Indeed, Tuesday had the worst breadth for an up day of any day since 1990! What that means is that the strength in the mega caps outweighed weakness across the rest of the S&amp;P.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"464\" src=\"https://www.topgunfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1790.jpg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>This weak market breadth places extra weight on the earnings reports of the Magnificent 7. In focus today is META which is currently down almost 9% in the premarket after guiding to a huge increase in expenses in 2026.</p><p>2025 expenses are forecast to come in between $116-$118 billion, representing a 22%-24% increase from 2024. And here’s what META said about 2026:</p><blockquote><p>We anticipate total expenses will grow at a <strong><em>significantly faster percentage rate</em></strong> in 2026 than 2025, with growth driven primarily by infrastructure costs, including incremental cloud expenses and depreciation. Employee compensation costs will be the second largest contributor to growth, as we recognize a full year of compensation for employees hired throughout 2025, particularly AI talent, and add technical talent in priority areas</p></blockquote><p><br/>Let’s do some hypothetical calculations. If 2025 total expenses come in at $117 billion that would represent a 23% increase over total expenses of $95 billion in 2024. And 2026 total expenses will grow at a “significantly faster percentage rate” than the 23% in 2025. Let’s say that means 33% which would work out to $155 billion. Obviously that kind of increase in expenses is going to crush META’s margins and profitability. I’m all for investing for the long term but clearly these numbers are making Wall Street nervous.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.topgunfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sc-2025-10-30T050908.866-1024x609.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Last, I’ve been waiting to comment on the mini crash in gold and the gold miners. Personally, I used it as a buying opportunity for a couple of reasons. One, the <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GDX\">GDX</a> seems to be finding support at its 50 DMA which makes this look like a standard correction in an ongoing bull market.</p><p>Two, fundamentally the miners are essentially printing money with gold around $4000/oz. In its 3Q25 earnings report last week, Newmont (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/NEM\">NEM</a>) reported an almost $2000 per ounce margin between its average realized gold price ($3539) and its All In Sustaining Cost/Oz. ($1566). As a result, Adjusted EBITDA increased 68% from 3Q24 to $3.3 billion. If they can maintain this, they’re looking at about $14 billion in Adjusted EBITDA on an annual basis with an $87 billion market cap or a 6x multiple.</p><p>The same thing applies to Agnico Eagle (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AEM\">AEM</a>) which reported 3Q25 earnings Wednesday afternoon. AEM’s average realized gold price was $3476 and its All In Sustaining Cost/Oz. $1373. That resulted in a 67% increase in Adjusted EBITDA to $2.1 billion. Once again, with a market cap of $79 billion, the valuation here remains very attractive.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/why-hold-onto-cat-despite-it-being-technically-overextended-and-fundamentally-overvalued?post=531493\">Why Hold Onto CAT Despite It Being Technically Overextended And Fundamentally Overvalued</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/bulls-back-in-charge-unh-continue-to-ride-with-uncle-warren-pypl-breakout-or-fakeout?post=531143\">Bulls Back In Charge, UNH: Continue To Ride With Uncle Warren, PYPL: Breakout Or Fakeout?</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/bonds/the-state-of-the-market-the-debate-over-interest-rates-gold-crash?post=529964\">The State Of The Market; The Debate Over Interest Rates; Gold Crash </a><br/></div>",

Namely, through unprecedented public-private partnerships (PPPs). Subsequent capital flows into energy and data centers have only strengthened that thesis.<br/><br/>For investors, this consolidation of influence and infrastructure flows directly through Nvidia, serving as the de facto arms dealer of the AI era, underpinning every AI model and data center needed to drive this transformation.<br/><br/>Now that Nvidia became the world’s first $5 trillion company on Wednesday, let’s examine if there is room for even more growth, or if this is an imminent prelude to bubble-popping.</p><h3><br/><strong>The Real Logic Behind AI Investing</strong></h3><p>Beyond AI’s commercial applications for content generation and productivity boosts, AI represents the holy grail of governance. Human-centric governance tends to be inconsistent, reactive, noisy, and to have a high overhead. In contrast, AI-centric governance has the potential to integrate vast data streams from economics, social behavior, and infrastructure in real time.</p><p>This comes hand in hand with policy simulation outcomes and continuous improvement enabled by machine learning. Most importantly, AI gives tiny groups multiplicative power, allowing them to exert their will on a scale otherwise impossible. This process is already underway, with <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/palantir-pltr-the-emerging-digital-nervous-system-of-u-s-government/\">tight coordination among OpenAI, Palantir, and Larry Ellison’s Oracle.</a></p><p>Such is the public-private level coordination revolving AI that Harvard economist Jason Furman <a href=\"https://x.com/jasonfurman/status/1971995367202775284\" target=\"_blank\">calculated </a>that cutting the AI-related investments would’ve resulted in an annualized GDP growth of only 0.1% for the first half of 2025.</p><p>According to the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI), corporate AI investments reached $252.3 billion in 2024, more than 8x the $31.2 billion in 2022, when the AI hype began. Yet, September’s Gartner research points to $1.5 trillion in worldwide AI spending in 2025, putting the last year to shame.</p><h3><br/><strong>Is Circular Financing a Concern?</strong></h3><p>Although the “AI is not a bubble” thesis has played out as expected so far, there is still a concern of overplaying the narrative itself. In other words, mistaking coordinated industrial policy for organic market demand, where rising valuations justify escalating capital commitments in a self-reinforcing loop.</p><p>This concern became more pressing when Nvidia pledged up to $100 billion in OpenAI’s data centers on September 22nd. Nvidia’s rival, AMD, soon joined the OpenAI partnership with a $34 billion pledge on October 6th, contributing its MI300X and MI350X chip series.</p><p>Yet, this represents only a tiny portion of overall circular financing between Nvidia, Oracle, Microsoft, OpenAI, Coreweave, and data center leasing.</p><p>Wall Street analysts are already likening this circular capital flow to the dot-com bubble building up in the late 1990s, which burst in March 2020. In the most recent appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box on Tuesday, the co-founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, noted that:</p><blockquote><p>“Absolutely, there are a ton of these investments that will be dead ends.”</p></blockquote><p><br/>However, just as investing in the internet turned out to be justified, the same is the case for AI commitments, according to Gates:</p><blockquote><p>“But you have a frenzy. And some of these companies will be glad they spent all this money. Some of them, you know, they’ll commit to data centers whose electricity is too expensive.”</p></blockquote><p><br/>Nonetheless, despite the circular financing—an artifact of coordination to bring AI to fruition—Nvidia still has room for improvement.</p><h3><br/><strong>The Nvidia GPU and Energy Bottlenecks</strong></h3><p>On Tuesday, Amazon (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AMZN\">AMZN</a>) announced it would cut around 14,000 middle managers, representing 4% of its workforce, potentially expanding to 30,000. Long-term, through 2033, Amazon plans to automate 500,000 jobs. As we explored recently, this boosts the company’s bottom line despite the <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/why-the-aws-outage-was-good-for-amazons-stock-price/\">recent AWS-related outage</a>.</p><p>At a glance, Amazon’s layoffs fit into the AI narrative, but investors should not mistake them as mono-causal. Throughout 2024, Amazon reported a severe AI GPU shortage in its retail division, to the point that the company launched ‘Project Greenland’ to optimize the allocation of compute resources.</p><p>In Q2 2025, Amazon committed $31.4 billion to AI capital expenditures (capex). For shareholders, this is a bitter, margin-preserving pill to swallow, which has to be offset by cost-cutting—layoffs. In other words, this is likely the primary driver for Amazon’s layoffs, not the AI replacement of human work per se.</p><p>And the willingness to do layoffs points to an ongoing Nvidia GPU shortage across the Big Tech cluster. After all, if Amazon has this problem, the entire Big Tech cluster likely does as well. In turn, Nvidia is expected to continue seeing GPU sales surge.</p><p>Contributing to the $5 trillion market cap milestone, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hinted as much on Tuesday at the GTC conference, when he said he expects half a trillion dollars worth of AI GPU sales. This estimate combines the existing cutting-edge Blackwell chips and the 2026 launch of Rubin chips.</p><p>Previously at July’s CDNLive conference, Jensen also noted that “power generation is going to be a big deal” as existing “power grids aren’t going to be enough to sustain the growth of this industry.”</p><p>This fits into our bullish thesis on <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/nuclear-meets-ai-which-companies-will-reflect-gains-first/\">nuclear power stocks</a>, but it also points to an energy bottleneck. The implication for Nvidia shareholders is that the company’s next challenge is not outcompeting AMD or Intel on performance per watt, but ensuring its customers can obtain those watts in the first place.</p><p>At the same time, as every incremental data center expansion runs up against the physical limits of grid capacity, Nvidia’s bottom line is supported by future scarcity.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/roblox-stock-drops-as-q4-and-full-year-loss-forecasts-disappoint-investors?post=531972\">Roblox Stock Drops As Q4 And Full-Year Loss Forecasts Disappoint Investors</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/eli-lilly-delivers-strong-q3-performance-raises-earnings-outlook?post=531895\">Eli Lilly Delivers Strong Q3 Performance, Raises Earnings Outlook</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/merck--co-beats-expectations-in-q3-2025-lifts-full-year-forecast?post=531815\">Merck &amp; Co.

Specifically, the one print that appeared to weigh the heaviest on the tech-centric Nasdaq was <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/META\">META</a>), which beat consensus revenue targets but fell short on earnings per share. The culprit? A one-time, tax-related charge, along with increased capital expenditures for this year and next due to artificial-intelligence-related investments.</p><p>META fell sharply during yesterday’s after-hours session, and the decline extended to the current session.</p><p>Obviously, AVGO stock represents an entirely different entity than META. However, the two share the same AI-related catalyst, which, in the case of Broadcom, has led to a robust return of over 61% year-to-date, inclusive of today’s volatility. Over the past 52 weeks, AVGO has gained nearly 112%, a beneficiary of the surge in AI-related spending.</p><p>During the midweek session, the security appeared to enjoy residual tailwinds from a partnership involving the U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne National Laboratory, <strong>Nvidia</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/NVDA\">NVDA</a>), and <strong>Oracle</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/ORCL\">ORCL</a>). Under the terms of the <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-new-partnership-nvidia-and-oracle-build-largest-doe-ai\">landmark deal</a>, the partnership will deliver the DOE’s largest AI supercomputer and accelerate scientific discovery.</p><p>While Broadcom wasn’t mentioned in the press release, such large-scale catalysts may reasonably extend to other major AI players, thereby lifting AVGO stock. However, the disappointing response to Meta’s financial disclosure indicates that investors are leery about excessive exposure to AI.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"307\" src=\"https://talkmarkets.com/contributor/krishna-ahirao-iyer/user_content/ckimages/orig_avgo.webp\" width=\"750\"/></p><p><br/>In the quantitative arena, the baseline performance of AVGO stock since January 2019 indicates a strong upward bias. Notably, AVGO’s 10-week projected returns features a bullishly skewed distributional curve, with median price outcomes ranging from $370 to a little over $430. Price clustering is expected to be predominant at around $408.</p><p>Currently, though, AVGO stock is structured in a 6-4-U formation: six up weeks, four down weeks, with an overall upward slope. Under this condition, the range of outcomes is about the same as the baseline state. However, price clustering would be expected to occur at around $393.</p><p>That’s still bullish but there’s a 3.68% negative delta in expected price density dynamics relative to baseline. Keep that in mind if you’re considering an acquisition of the red ink.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/why-investors-are-turning-bearish-on-meta?post=531943\">Why Investors Are Turning Bearish On META</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/what-can-investors-expect-from-archer-aviation-earnings-next-week?post=531528\">What Can Investors Expect From Archer Aviation Earnings Next Week? </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/how-nvidias-5-trillion-windfall-could-make-2-quantum-computing-stocks-go-even-more-parabolic?post=531508\">How Nvidia’s $5 Trillion Windfall Could Make 2 Quantum Computing Stocks Go Even More Parabolic</a><br/></div>",

Florence, where the ECB met today for its only annual meeting outside of Frankfurt, is apparently also this 'good place', the central bank's well-known pseudonym for comfortably keeping interest rates on hold. ECB President Christine Lagarde even called it a ‘magnificent’ place – Florence, that is, not rates.</p><p>The comments at the press conference confirmed once again that the ECB has no intention to leave its ‘good place’ any time soon.</p><h3><br/><strong>Highlights from the press conference</strong></h3><p>We had feared a rather uneventful press conference. What should we say? We hate to be right… Anyhow, here are a few interesting remarks made by Lagarde:</p><p>On the <strong>ECB’s risk assessment</strong>, the introductory statement had the most remarkable change compared with September. Last month, the ECB had still talked about risks to the growth outlook that had become “more balanced”; today, it refrained from qualifying any balance of risk. Instead, the central bank had a somewhat more extensive list of upside and downside risks to the growth outlook. Lagarde even said that some of the downside risks had abated. When asked whether this was a sign of an upcoming shift in the balance of risk, the ECB's President pointed out that it had already narrowed the risks at the September meeting. Funnily enough, back at the September meeting, there had been no mention of a narrowing of risks.</p><p><strong>Supply chain disruptions.</strong> Lagarde referred to a discussion on potential supply chain bottlenecks that could still arise as a result of the latest tensions between China and the EU on microchips and rare earths in general.</p><p><strong>Risks to inflation</strong>. As in the past, the ECB didn’t provide an assessment of the balance of risks to inflation. However, during the press conference, Lagarde mentioned different positions, views and analyses regarding inflation within the Governing Council. These differing views do exist, despite a unanimous decision to keep rates on hold today. A particular concern remains service inflation, which the ECB has often labelled as being too high.</p><h3><br/><strong>Comfortably staying in its 'good place'</strong></h3><p>Looking ahead, today’s meeting has done nothing to change the view that the bar for yet another rate cut from the ECB is high. In fact, the Bank currently feels very comfortable in its ‘good place’. With the ECB’s own growth forecasts indicating that the eurozone economy will grow by slightly more than 1% each year and inflation will settle down to 2% over the next few years, there is indeed very little reason to change its monetary policy stance.</p><p>At the same time, there are still valid dovish arguments that could force the central bank to cut again at the December meeting. Just think of the delayed adverse impact of US tariffs, the stronger euro exchange rate, French politics or a delay in Germany’s fiscal stimulus. If any of these downside risks materialise, we can expect the ECB to engage in one or two more rate cuts.</p><p>On this point, it remains important to note that the current ECB inflation forecast for 2027 includes a 0.2ppt impact from the introduction of the ETS2 system. Needless to say, any delay in the implementation could have implications for the ECB as it would increase the risk of inflation undershooting. Even if Lagarde tried to downplay this issue during the press conference.</p><p>In any case, even if the ECB seems to rest more comfortably on its laurels than before, the December staff projections will be crucial and could still invade its good place. If the 2028 inflation forecasts come in sub-1.7%, the likelihood of yet another rate cut would increase.</p><p>More generally speaking, Lagarde didn’t give away any hints at what’s next for the ECB. Maybe the strongest message came from the colours of the President's scarf, which – at least to us – resembled the French flag. For the rest, today’s meeting was another illustration that the ECB has no intention whatsoever of leaving its ‘good place’ any time soon.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/german-october-inflation-marks-start-of-more-disinflation-to-come?post=531970\">German October Inflation Marks Start Of More Disinflation To Come </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/eurozone-gdp-growth-slightly-better-than-expected?post=531891\">Eurozone GDP Growth Slightly Better Than Expected </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/the-commodities-feed-bullish-eia-release-pushes-oil-higher?post=531681\">The Commodities Feed: Bullish EIA Release Pushes Oil Higher </a><br/></div>",

He called the move a necessary step to maintain global parity.</p><p>Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Wednesday night: “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country. This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office.”</p><p>“Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years,” Trump said. “Because of other countries’ testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.” According to Fox News.</p><p> Talk of an oil glut is weighing om the market after Shell’s CEO said he saw an oversupply coming after reporting blow out earnings. Also people are still unsure if President Trump’s tough sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil will actually put a real dent in Russia’s oil exports. The market seems way more worried about a possible slowdown in global demand and the idea that we might be heading for an oil glut. But honestly, we’re just not seeing that reflected in the U.S. oil inventory reports.</p><p>For example, the latest numbers from the EIA show that U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (not counting the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) dropped by 6.9 million barrels from the previous week. Right now, we’re sitting at 416 million barrels, which is about 6% lower than the five-year average for this time of year. Gasoline inventories also fell—down 5.9 million barrels—and are 3% below the five-year average. Both finished gasoline and the stuff used to blend it saw declines. Distillate fuel inventories  that would most acutely be impacted of reduced Russian petroleum exports went down by 3.4 million barrels and are 8% under the five-year average.</p><p>On the flip side, propane and propylene inventories actually rose by 2.5 million barrels and are 14% above the usual levels for this time of year. Altogether, total commercial petroleum inventories dropped by a hefty 15.9 million barrels last week. Sure, sounds like an glut to me.</p><p>Demand also is at the highest level is years as the EIA’s Weekly Petroleum Status Report showed that total product demand based on product supplied was approximately 20.3 million barrels per day (b/d) down marginally from late-summer highs but up year-over-year by about 1.5% due to higher distillate demand (e.g., diesel and heating oil). Gasoline demand fell to around 8.8 million b/d as driving season winds down, while distillate demand rose to 4.1 million b/d, reflecting early winter preparations.</p><p>The oil market is awaiting updates on the US-China trade deal, which appears to be progressing. President Trump has eased some sanctions on Russia while his administration negotiates agreements with South Korea.</p><p>This morning’s big story centers on the Trump administration’s ongoing push for “energy dominance,” which basically means ramping up U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), crude oil, and other fuels to major Asian allies. This strategy goes hand-in-hand with broader trade talks, like President Trump’s recent summit with China’s Xi Jinping and the steady connections with South Korea. For instance, Wright pointed out that the U.S. is in a strong position to boost natural gas and oil exports to South Korea, and he’s planning a trip to Asia soon to hammer out the final details. This follows the August 2025 summit between Trump and South Korea’s President Lee Jae-myung, where both sides agreed to a massive $100 billion energy deal over four years.</p><p>Looking at the specifics, South Korea’s Korea Gas Corp. (Kogas) has already locked in long-term contracts for 3.3 million tons of U.S. LNG every year starting in 2028, mainly from places like Cheniere Energy’s Texas facilities.</p><p>Wright says this is a smart move for South Korea, helping them cut back on reliance on Middle Eastern suppliers, especially with all the uncertainty in the Persian Gulf. On the crude oil front, South Korea remains the top Asian buyer of U.S. crude, importing an impressive 84 million barrels in the first half of 2025 alone, worth about $6.4 billion.</p><p>The agreement also includes LPG, coal, and naphtha, and it’s expected that crude and LPG will make up around two-thirds of that $100 billion goal. Wright notes that U.S. light sweet grades like WTI Midland are especially appealing due to competitive pricing, such as the $2.10 per barrel spread compared to the UAE’s Murban benchmark as of late August.</p><p>On a bigger scale, there are ongoing discussions for a joint U.S.-South Korea venture on the Alaska LNG project, similar to what the U.S. is working on with Japan. Wright estimates that U.S. LNG exports could double in the next five years—reaching about 20 billion cubic feet per day—and possibly double again if Asian demand keeps climbing, fueled by the growth in AI data centers and manufacturing.</p><p>There’s also a new U.S.-South Korea trade agreement that includes those annual LNG purchases and $3 billion in investments over five years. Wright says this not only boosts South Korea’s energy security, since it imports all of its refinery feedstock, but also benefits American producers in Texas, Louisiana, and Alaska.</p><p>Switching gears to China, Wright mentioned that the U.S. is ready to step in if China starts buying less energy from Russia—a possibility given today’s announcement of a potential major U.S.-China energy deal focused on Alaskan oil and gas.</p><p>After Thursday’s Trump-Xi meeting, both countries agreed to explore a significant deal for Alaskan resources, and Wright, along with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, plans to meet with Chinese officials soon to hash out the details. Trump himself posted about this on Truth Social, rating the meeting a “12 out of 10” and highlighting lowered tariffs as part of the package.</p><p>China has been a major buyer of discounted Russian oil and gas since the Ukraine invasion, but U.S. sanctions—like those targeting Russian oil shipping and financial networks—are starting to squeeze those volumes. Wright had previously said in September that Russian gas sales to China wouldn’t hurt U.S. exporters, but now his comments suggest that if sanctions or politics push China to buy less from Russia, the U.S. could easily fill the gap. You can also get my daily trade levels by reaching out to me directly.</p><p>Speaking of filling the gap that’s exactly what natural gas futures did this morning and we could be very close to a seasonal bottom and natural gas what we would recommend is start looking and putting on those winter strategies right now as we believe that a colder than normal center which is being predicted by the fox weather channel could lead to a surprising rallying as we have said before the market has become complacent because we haven’t had a below average winter since 2018 if we indeed flipped the script this winter we could see natural gas make significant advances especially with the increasing US export picture as well as increasing domestic demand.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/trying-to-get-that-feeling-again-the-energy-report?post=530032\">Trying To Get That Feeling Again - The Energy Report </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/hey-dude-wheres-my-surplus-the-energy-report?post=529808\">Hey Dude Where’s, My Surplus?

Expanding corn-based ethanol production &amp; consumption provides a pillar of support, while the sheer size of production in 2025 keeps in place monthly exports of 6.5 MMT’s. Brazil’s corn ship lineup as of late October feature cumulative vessels worth 5.30 MMT’s, vs. 4.5 a year ago, and seasonal decline in weekly loadings has been less intense than last year. There’s enough for supply to meet ethanol and export demand. Note that Brazil’s daily cash corn price seasonal strength has been largely absent since August, and with interior prices in Mato Frosso still quoted below $3.80/Bu, vs. $3.95 a year ago in late Oct, ARC doubts any kind of rationing rally unfolds in Brazil through the balance of 2025. It’s the lack of movement in global cash corn markets that’s kept CBOT rallies challenged.</p><p><br/><strong>Corn Comments &amp; Analysis</strong></p><p>Corn &amp; Ag Markets Await Details of Trump-Xi Visit; Rally Encourages Producer Selling Globally:</p><p>CBOT corn ended mixed, with calendar spreads narrowing. Price discovery over the next 24 hours will be centered on whatever details become available from Presidents Trump &amp; Xi talks overnight. Although, news of success that China would resume buying US ag products and loaded 3 US soybean cargoes just before the talks, the grain complex reaction to the successful news have been rather muted. The market must want more encouraging details as many traders priced in a positive outcome. Headline volatility persists through the balance of the week, and many analysts maintain that the fundamental spark to propel March CBOT above $4.50-$4.52 is absent today. The Midwest cash ethanol market has done little in October, and ethanol inventories will be building seasonally from now till April. A peak in ethanol grind occurs in November. Otherwise, weakness in South American &amp; Ukrainian FOB premiums indicates producers worldwide are rewarding the rally. The Argentine peso’s inability to sustain rallies keeps farmers there profitable. Most important overnight is the US and China’s ability to lower tariffs on one another. We must reiterate that China is unlikely to import sizable tonnages of corn/feed with their own large domestic supplies. Trade news rallies should be rewarded with the US lacking a demand driver thereafter. Corn should be nearing a seasonal peak without adverse South American weather. Dec corn has resistance above $4.36.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/keep-the-trade-deal-momentum-going-the-corn--ethanol-report?post=531431\">Keep The Trade Deal Momentum Going - The Corn &amp; Ethanol Report</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/corn-fundamentals-remain-a-major-obstacle-for-bulls-the-corn--ethanol-report?post=531123\">Corn Fundamentals Remain A Major Obstacle For Bulls.

Founded in 1995, it’s now a mature e-commerce platform focusing on categories like collectibles, refurbished goods, and AI tools for users.</p><p>Recently, eBay’s stock sold off despite beating Q3 earnings estimates, revenue hit about $2.82 B (vs. $2.73 B expected) and EPS was $1.36 (vs. $1.33 expected). The drop came after management issued weaker forward guidance, projecting slower GMV growth (4–6% for Q4) and ongoing margin pressures. Investors reacted negatively to signs of deceleration despite solid current results.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"ebayD\" height=\"613\" src=\"https://talkmarkets.com/contributor/gregor-horvat/user_content/ckimages/orig_ebayd.webp\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>From an Elliott Wave perspective, eBay appears to be in a strong and extended fifth wave advancing from the April lows, with the impulsive structure still looking incomplete. The recent sell-off following earnings may represent a deeper, higher-degree <strong>ABC correction</strong> within <strong>wave IV</strong>, particularly considering the presence of a newly opened and unfilled price gap.</p><p>The <strong>ideal support zone</strong> lies between <strong>83–77</strong>, where the correction could potentially find a floor before resuming higher. We continue to anticipate a final push to new highs in <strong>wave V</strong>, likely extending <strong>beyond the 100 area</strong>. However, it’s important to note that once a five-wave sequence completes, markets often enter a slower, corrective phase, suggesting we may be approaching the <strong>late stages of the broader bullish cycle (red wave three)</strong> heading into year-end.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"basicbullishimpulse\" height=\"461\" src=\"https://talkmarkets.com/contributor/gregor-horvat/user_content/ckimages/orig_ethbtcbasic_638974370953023378.webp\" width=\"401\"/></p><p>The Elliott Wave Principle is a form of technical analysis that identifies patterns in market movements. A bullish impulsive wave is one of the most important and common wave structures in an uptrend. It describes how prices typically move in the direction of the main trend. A bullish impulsive wave consists of five waves labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Basic Impulsive Bullish Pattern shows that eBay can be finishing wave 4 correction before a bullish continuation for wave 5.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/asml-is-unfolding-a-five-wave-impulse-into-all-time-highs?post=531110\">ASML Is Unfolding A Five-Wave Impulse Into All-Time Highs</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/zcash-remains-under-strong-bullish-pressure?post=530666\">Zcash Remains Under Strong Bullish Pressure </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/netflix-wave-4-consolidation-before-the-next-breakout?post=530176\">Netflix Wave 4: Consolidation Before The Next Breakout</a></p></div>",

At the time of writing, GBP/USD trades at 1.3160 after hitting a daily high of 1.3218.</p><h3><br/><strong>Pound pressured ahead of next week’s BoE decision and UK fiscal plans</strong><br/> </h3><p>On Wednesday, the Fed cut rates to 3.75%-4% amid the lack of economic data due to the US government shutdown, entering its thirtieth day. The decision was not unanimous, with Fed Governor Stephen Miran opting for a 50-bps cut, while the Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted to hold rates unchanged.</p><p>Also, the US central bank announced the end of Quantitative Easing (QE) on December 1. In the press conference, Powell said that the balance of risks are tilted to the upside on inflation and to the downside on the jobs market and added that there were constructive discussions at the meeting, regarding the December’s decision.</p><p>Powell made clear that a cut in December, is far from a sure thing, as he said, “a further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion — far from it.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pound Sterling remains pressured as investors’ attention shifts to next week’s Banf of England (BoE) monetary policy decision, and the UK budget. The Financial Times revealed that UK Chancellor Reeves is looking at an early scraping of windfall tax on the UK oil and gas sector. The Telegraph said that Reeves is considering a 2 percent rise in income tax.</p><p>The light US schedule will feature Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan late today and on Friday. Atlanta’s Fed Raphael Bostic and Cleveland’s Beth Hammack will cross the wires on Friday at a research conference.</p><h3><br/><strong>GBP/USD Price Forecast: Technical outlook</strong><br/> </h3><p>The technical picture shows the GBP/USD is bearishly biased after clearing the 200-day SMA at 1.3242, which opened the door to drop below 1.3200. A daily close below the 200-day SMA would cement the trend shift, exposing key support levels like the 1.3000 figure, followed by the April 8 low of 1.2708.</p><p>Conversely, if buyers reclaim 1.3200, the GBP/USD could consolidate within the 1.32/1.33 range in the near term.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"GBP/USD daily chart\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feditorial.fxsstatic.com%2Fmiscelaneous%2Fimage-1761837100760-1761837100760.png&amp;w=1536&amp;q=95\" width=\"750\"/></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/audusd-slips-as-feds-hawkish-cut-dashes-december-dovish-hopes?post=531549\">AUD/USD Slips As Fed’s “Hawkish Cut” Dashes December Dovish Hopes </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/eurusd-slides-as-fed-delivers-rate-cut-signals-end-of-qt?post=531527\">EUR/USD Slides As Fed Delivers Rate Cut, Signals End Of QT</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/gold-steadies-ahead-of-fed-decision-as-traders-position-for-dovish-outcome?post=531515\">Gold Steadies Ahead Of Fed Decision As Traders Position For Dovish Outcome </a><br/></div>",

Founded in 2009 and based in Chicago, the firm focuses on generating income and capital appreciation by investing in one-stop and other senior secured loans to U.S. middle-market companies with annual EBITDA under $100 million.</p><p>Managed by GC Advisors LLC, Golub emphasizes strong credit quality, scalable business models, and consistent cash flows. With a diversified portfolio across multiple industries, the company has built a reputation as one of the largest and most reliable middle-market lenders in the U.S., generating over $600 million in annual net investment income, maintaining a steady record of dividend payments, and adhering to disciplined risk management.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"527\" src=\"https://www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-27-at-6.35.25-PM-1024x771.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: <a href=\"https://golubcapitalbdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Golub-Capital-BDC-Inc.-Investor-Presentation-August-2025.pdf\">Investor Relations</a><br/> </p><p>Golub Capital BDC, Inc. reported its fiscal third-quarter 2025 results, ending June 30, with net investment income of $0.38 per share, up from $0.37 in the prior quarter, and adjusted NII steady at $0.39 per share. Revenue rose 27.5% year-over-year to $218.3 million, slightly exceeding expectations. Net earnings were $0.34 per share, while net asset value (NAV) per share declined slightly to $15.00 from $15.04. The company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, payable on September 29, 2025.</p><p>As of June 30, 2025, Golub’s investment portfolio totaled $8.96 billion across 401 portfolio companies, up from $8.62 billion and 393 companies in the prior quarter. The portfolio was primarily composed of one-stop loans (86.9%), with smaller allocations to equity (7%) and senior secured loans (5.4%). The company made $556.8 million in new investment commitments and repurchased 2.4 million shares of its stock for $34.3 million at an average price of $13.99 per share.</p><p>Golub maintained a strong financial position with $9.24 billion in total assets and $5.15 billion in debt, resulting in a 1.26x debt-to-equity ratio. Liquidity remained healthy, supported by $99.8 million in cash and $547 million in credit facility availability. The company also improved borrowing flexibility by amending its JPMorgan and GC Advisors credit agreements. Despite minor unrealized losses from certain portfolio holdings, Golub demonstrated solid income generation, disciplined capital management, and consistent shareholder value through dividends and buybacks.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"527\" src=\"https://www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-27-at-6.36.43-PM-1024x771.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: <a href=\"https://golubcapitalbdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Golub-Capital-BDC-Inc.-Investor-Presentation-August-2025.pdf\">Investor Relations</a><br/> </p><h3><strong>Growth Prospects</strong></h3><p>Golub Capital BDC, Inc. has maintained stable net investment income over the years, currently paying an annualized base dividend of $1.56 per share. Its equity investments have occasionally generated additional gains used for special dividends, though these are irregular—$0.04 in FY2023 and $0.35 in FY2024, with none in FY2021 or FY2022.</p><p>The company’s growth prospects are influenced by interest rates and portfolio performance. Investment income yield, which fell to 7.3% in mid-2022, has risen to 12.0% with higher rates, though the net investment spread has narrowed to 5.9% from 7.0% last year due to rising debt costs. Despite this, Golub’s diversified, senior-secured loan portfolio supports stable income and potential capital appreciation.</p><p>Golub’s strategy of combining reliable loan income with opportunistic equity gains, along with disciplined balance sheet management and consistent dividend payments, positions the company to continue generating shareholder value. While future EPS and special dividends are uncertain due to market volatility, the company’s track record suggests it can sustain stable income and selectively reward shareholders.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"527\" src=\"https://www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-27-at-6.37.17-PM-1024x771.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: <a href=\"https://golubcapitalbdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Golub-Capital-BDC-Inc.-Investor-Presentation-August-2025.pdf\">Investor Relations</a><br/> </p><h3><strong>Competitive Advantages &amp; Recession Performance</strong></h3><p>Golub Capital BDC, Inc. has strong competitive advantages in middle-market lending, including a focus on one-stop and senior secured loans, rigorous underwriting, and relationships with private equity sponsors that provide access to high-quality opportunities. Its diversified portfolio and disciplined credit monitoring help manage risk across industries.</p><p>The company has proven resilient in economic downturns, maintaining net investment income and dividend payments even during market stress. By combining conservative lending, active portfolio management, and strategic sponsor partnerships, Golub sustains a stable, recession-resistant business model.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Dividend Analysis</strong></h3><p>Golub Capital BDC’s annual dividend is $1.65 per share. At its recent share price, the stock has a high yield of 11.6%.</p><p>Given the company’s 2025 earnings outlook, NII is expected to be $1.60 per share. As a result, the company is expected to pay out over 100% of its NII to shareholders in dividends.</p><p>The dividend appears to be on track to be cut this year or next.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p>Golub Capital BDC, Inc. is a well-diversified investment company that offers a net investment spread of approximately 5%. We project annualized returns of around 8.5%, primarily driven by its dividend, though actual returns could be higher if its private equity investments perform well.</p><p>Insider ownership exceeds 10% of the $3.94 billion company, indicating strong alignment with shareholder interests. At current prices, the shares merit a hold rating.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/10-of-the-right-retirement-stocks-for-income-investors?post=531175\">10 Of The Right Retirement Stocks For Income Investors</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/real-estate--reits/3-top-retirement-stocks-for-income?post=531102\">3 Top Retirement Stocks For Income </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/real-estate--reits/high-dividend-50-agnc-investment-corporation?post=530470\">High Dividend 50: AGNC Investment Corporation</a></p></div>",

While the gaming platform delivered mixed results with strong bookings performance and impressive user engagement metrics, shares tumbled over 10% as investors focused on the company’s forecast of wider-than-expected losses for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025.</p><p>The stock initially surged more than 8% in <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/investing/how-to-trade-after-hours/\">pre-market trading</a> before reversing course and falling approximately 6-12% as concerns about profitability overshadowed the company’s robust growth in user activity and bookings.</p><h3><br/><strong>Strong User Growth and Bookings Overshadowed by Higher Expenses</strong><br/> </h3><p>Roblox delivered a mixed third-quarter performance that showcased impressive operational growth while raising concerns about profitability. The company reported a net loss of $255.6 million, or $0.37 per share, which was narrower than the consensus estimate of $0.49 per share.</p><p>However, revenue of $1.36 billion, despite climbing 48% year-over-year, fell short of analyst expectations of $1.69 billion. Total expenses surged nearly 38% to $1.66 billion during the quarter, highlighting the significant investments required to fuel the platform’s expansion.</p><p>The standout metric from the quarter was bookings, which jumped 70% year-over-year to $1.92 billion, significantly surpassing the consensus estimate of $1.70 billion. Average daily active users (DAUs) reached 151.5 million, marking a 70% increase and crossing the 150 million milestone for the first time in company history. Hours Engaged grew an impressive 91% year-over-year to 39.6 billion hours, demonstrating the platform’s ability to keep users highly engaged with popular new releases like “Grow A Garden” and “Steal a Brainrot.”</p><p>Despite the strong operational performance, Roblox’s forward guidance dampened investor enthusiasm. For the full year 2025, the company forecasts net losses between $1.10 billion and $1.13 billion, exceeding the Bloomberg consensus estimate of $1.09 billion. The fourth-quarter loss projection of $1.35 billion to $1.40 billion also surpassed analyst estimates of $1.34 billion.</p><p>However, the company raised its full-year bookings guidance to $6.566 billion to $6.616 billion, well above the consensus of $6.16 billion, and projected Q4 bookings of $2 billion to $2.05 billion versus estimates of $1.83 billion.</p><h3><br/><strong>Stock Plunges Over 10% Despite Strong Year-to-Date Performance</strong><br/> </h3><p>RBLX stock tumbled 10.46% on Thursday, October 30, 2025, closing at $119.75, down $13.99 from the previous close of $133.74. The stock experienced dramatic intraday volatility, initially jumping more than 8% in pre-market trading before reversing sharply and falling as much as 12% as investors digested the wider-than-expected loss forecasts. Trading volume reached 6.9 million shares, approaching the average daily volume of 7.9 million, as the market reacted to the mixed earnings report and disappointing profitability outlook.</p><p>Despite Thursday’s sharp decline, Roblox stock has delivered exceptional returns over longer timeframes, significantly outperforming broader market indices. Year-to-date, RBLX has surged 101.64% compared to the <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/investing/spx-vs-spy/\">S&amp;P 500’s</a> gain of 16.81%. Over the past year, the stock has soared 170.45% versus the S&amp;P 500’s 18.18% return. The stock reached its 52-week high of $150.59 before Thursday’s selloff, and remains well above its 52-week low of $47.95, reflecting strong investor confidence in the platform’s long-term growth potential despite ongoing profitability challenges.</p><p>Analysts remain moderately optimistic about Roblox’s prospects, with the stock carrying a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 16 Buy ratings, six Hold ratings, and one Sell rating. The average price target of $149.42 implies approximately 24.8% upside from the current trading level of $119.75, with individual targets ranging from a low of $65 to a high of $180. The company’s market capitalization stands at $81.9 billion, with an enterprise value of $91.71 billion.</p><p>Roblox maintains a strong balance sheet with $2.63 billion in total cash, though its debt-to-equity ratio of 528.68% reflects significant leverage as the company continues investing heavily in platform development and user acquisition.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/eli-lilly-delivers-strong-q3-performance-raises-earnings-outlook?post=531895\">Eli Lilly Delivers Strong Q3 Performance, Raises Earnings Outlook</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/merck--co-beats-expectations-in-q3-2025-lifts-full-year-forecast?post=531815\">Merck &amp; Co.

After several months of increasing headline inflation, the just-released inflation data points to a trend reversal. Headline inflation, according to the national measure, decreased to 2.3% year-on-year in October, from 2.4% YoY in September. The European measure also came down to 2.3% YoY. Core inflation remained unchanged at 2.8% YoY, while services inflation even increased somewhat to 3.5% YoY, from 3.4% YoY.</p><h3><br/><strong>Moving towards 2%</strong><br/> </h3><p>The available regional state data shows that the drop in German inflation was mainly driven by favourable base effects. On the month, almost all categories saw prices slightly increase.</p><p>Looking ahead, the stronger euro and still favourable energy base effects should push German inflation back towards – and below – 2% over the coming months. At the same time, the worsening labour market and AI will further moderate wage growth. Finally, US tariffs could also bring disinflationary pressures to Europe due to overcapacity and weaker sales in the US. While these elements clearly bring disinflationary forces to Germany over the coming months, the longer-term picture brings more upward pressure on inflation. Restructuring of supply chains, labour costs in an era of ageing and the green transition remain three important structural drivers of price pressures. And not to forget the inflationary impact from Germany’s fiscal stimulus.</p><p>In short, today’s inflation reading marks another turning point and the start of at least a short-lived period of rather disinflationary pressures before inflationary forces take over again.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/eurozone-gdp-growth-slightly-better-than-expected?post=531891\">Eurozone GDP Growth Slightly Better Than Expected </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/the-commodities-feed-bullish-eia-release-pushes-oil-higher?post=531681\">The Commodities Feed: Bullish EIA Release Pushes Oil Higher </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/rates-spark-fed-and-ecb-in-a-good-place?post=531554\">Rates Spark: Fed And ECB In A Good Place </a><br/></div>",

As investors, our goal is to buy stocks when they are undervalued and sell when they are overvalued. But how do we know what “value” truly means? Let’s dig into the heart of <strong>company stock valuation</strong> and why it matters so much for your long-term financial success.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Understanding Stock Valuation: More Than Just a Number</strong></h3><p>At its core, <strong>stock valuation</strong> is the analytical process of determining the fair value of a company’s shares. This isn’t just about looking at the current market price; it’s about understanding what the business is worth based on its fundamentals, earnings power, growth prospects, assets, and risks.</p><p>There are several approaches to <strong>share valuation</strong>. Some investors prefer the simplicity of the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, while others dig deeper with discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis or Benjamin Graham’s intrinsic value formula, still a reliable and timeless method for assessing value despite its imperfections. The key is to use these valuation tools to separate the signal from the noise in the ever-volatile world of <strong>stock market valuation</strong>.</p><p>The FAST Graphs fundamentals analyzer software tool clearly expresses the relationship between stock prices and fundamental values over the long run. It incorporates all these methodologies to illustrate intrinsic value while providing real-world evidence of the reliability of those valuation models.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Why Valuation in Stocks Matters</strong></h3><p>Imagine walking into a store and seeing two identical products, one priced at $10, the other at $20. Which would you buy? The answer seems obvious, but in the stock market, prices are constantly changing, and the “product” (the company) is evolving as well. <strong>Valuation in stocks</strong> helps you determine whether you’re getting a bargain or overpaying for enthusiasm.</p><p>When you buy a stock without considering its valuation, you’re essentially speculating. But when you anchor your decisions in sound valuation principles, you become a true investor, someone who understands the difference between <em>price</em> and <em>value</em>.<br/> </p><h3><strong>The Market’s Mood Swings: Stock Market Valuation in Action</strong></h3><p>The stock market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in the long term. Prices can swing wildly based on news, sentiment, or macroeconomic factors. However, over time, the market rewards companies that grow earnings and generate value for shareholders. That’s why focusing on <strong>stock market valuation</strong>, not just short-term price movements, is essential for building lasting wealth.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Company Stock Valuation: A Closer Look</strong></h3><p>Let’s break down the main approaches to <strong>company stock valuation</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Relative Valuation</strong> – Compares a company’s valuation ratios (P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA) to peers or market averages.</li><li><strong>Absolute Valuation</strong> – Calculates the present value of expected future cash flows (DCF analysis).</li><li><strong>Asset-Based Valuation</strong> – Assesses a company’s assets minus its liabilities to estimate equity value.</li></ol><p>Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, but together they paint a more complete picture of a company’s true worth.<br/> </p><h3><strong><u>How Market Sentiment Impacts Stock Valuations</u></strong><br/> </h3><h3><strong>The Power of Sentiment in Stock Valuation</strong></h3><p>Market sentiment, the collective attitude of investors, plays a powerful role in shaping <strong>stock valuations</strong> in the short run. While valuation methods focus on fundamentals such as earnings, cash flow, and growth, sentiment can temporarily drive prices above or below fair value. However, in the long run, fundamentals always prevail. Recognizing when the market misjudges a stock’s value is the key to minimizing risk and achieving superior long-term returns.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Sentiment Drives Prices Beyond Fundamentals</strong></h3><p>When investor sentiment turns optimistic, stocks often trade at higher valuation multiples. This is especially true during bull markets, when enthusiasm and confidence push prices beyond what fundamentals might justify. Conversely, in periods of fear or pessimism, such as market corrections or recessions, valuations can fall sharply, even for fundamentally sound companies.</p><p>For instance, during phases of high investor optimism, <strong>stock market valuations</strong> often reflect excitement more than reality. When sentiment shifts, valuations can quickly contract, revealing how emotional markets can be.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Sentiment and Volatility: The Emotional Rollercoaster</strong></h3><p>Market sentiment is highly sensitive and can change overnight. After a stretch of optimism, when valuation multiples expand, the market becomes vulnerable to corrections if sentiment cools. Even small changes, triggered by earnings reports, economic data, or global events, can lead to major swings in <strong>stock market valuation</strong>.</p><p>Interestingly, negative sentiment tends to have a more pronounced and lasting impact on stock prices than positive sentiment. Fear drives prices down faster and further than optimism drives them up.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Behavioral Finance: Why Sentiment Matters</strong></h3><p>Behavioral finance has shown that investor psychology and emotions significantly influence short-term price movements. Retail investors, in particular, can amplify sentiment-driven buying and selling, creating price deviations from intrinsic value. This is why periods of euphoria can lead to bubbles, while fear can present undervalued opportunities for disciplined investors.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Real-World Examples of Sentiment and Valuation</strong></h3><p>Recent examples abound. Companies like Apple and Nvidia have seen their <strong>stock valuations</strong> surge amid investor optimism surrounding innovation and technology trends, sometimes reaching levels that reflect excitement as much as fundamentals.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://fastgraphs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aapl-1024x536.jpg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><br/><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://fastgraphs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nvda-1024x534.jpg\" width=\"700\"/></p><h3><br/><strong>Conclusion: The Power of Valuation Discipline</strong></h3><p>In the end, <strong>stock valuation</strong> is both an art and a science. It requires a thoughtful blend of quantitative analysis and qualitative insight. By mastering the principles of <strong>company stock valuation</strong> and maintaining a disciplined approach to <strong>share valuation</strong>, investors can navigate the market’s emotional tides with confidence.</p><p>Remember, while market sentiment comes and goes, <em>value endures.</em> As “Mr. Valuation,” I remind investors: focus on what a business is truly worth, not merely what it’s trading for today. That’s the surest path to consistent, long-term investment success.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/how-the-stock-market-works-a-guide-for-long-term-investors?post=530190\">How The Stock Market Works: A Guide For Long-Term Investors </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/discounted-dividend-method-ddm-formula-variations-examples-and-how-to-use-it?post=528485\">Discounted Dividend Method (DDM): Formula, Variations, Examples, And How To Use It </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/factset-evaluating-the-recent-decline-time-to-buy-or-stay-away?post=527447\">FactSet: Evaluating The Recent Decline-Time To Buy Or Stay Away?</a></p></div>",

The move matters now because IBM is sitting close to resistance, analysts remain broadly constructive, and an earnings print has already changed near-term sentiment. Short-term, momentum and news-driven flows are driving price action; long-term, growth and profitability metrics are weighing on valuation comparisons. Globally, the beat reinforces enterprise demand narratives in the US and Europe, while partnerships with AI vendors extend reach into Asia and emerging markets. Compared with recent quarters, IBM’s results show steady revenue execution and stronger market sentiment, lifting technical momentum ahead of the next reporting cycle.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3><p>This note provides a multi-dimensional review of <strong>International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)</strong> based on the latest market, technical and fundamental data. The objective is to explain what is moving the stock now, how recent earnings altered the backdrop, and how IMS metrics, analyst targets and sector comparators knit together into a coherent view for informed investors. The analysis is informational only and avoids forward-looking recommendations.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Key Takeaway: Trade Engine Score</strong></h3><p>IBM’s Trade Engine Score stands at <strong>69.70</strong>. This composite tally blends technicals, fundamentals, sentiment and analyst inputs. A score near 70 indicates a favorable short- to medium-term posture: momentum and sentiment are contributing positively while fundamentals are mixed. In practice, the score suggests greater odds of continued price support from buyers and news flows, but it does not imply guaranteed outperformance. Investors should regard this as a measure of current market reception rather than a standalone valuation signal.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Price Performance, Earnings Watch &amp; Recent Drivers</strong></h3><p>The stock closed at <strong>$308.21</strong>, up <strong>$21.72</strong> month-to-date and <strong>$88.27</strong> year-to-date. IBM is trading within about 3.5% of its 52-week high of <strong>$319.35</strong>, which places it in a near-high trading range where momentum traders and earnings-sensitive funds are most active. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at <strong>74.83</strong> flags short-term overbought conditions; expect volatility around resistance.</p><p>IBM reported earnings on <strong>2025-10-22</strong>. Reported revenue of $16,331,000,000 slightly exceeded the estimate of $16,248,802,078, a modest upside that likely fueled part of the recent price push. The proximity of the print to estimates suggests execution rather than a material reacceleration in top-line growth, but it did lift sentiment indicators and the Trade Engine Score.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Sector Comparison, Fundamentals &amp; Technicals</strong></h3><p>Against the Information Technology sector backdrop, IBM’s profile shows contrasts. The sector PE (TTM) sits near <strong>23.16</strong>, and QoQ revenue growth averages about <strong>4.39%</strong>. IBM’s own comparative strengths include high profitability metrics — profitability score at <strong>84.11%</strong> and an earnings quality letter grade of <strong>A-</strong> with an earnings quality score of <strong>67.88</strong>. Growth is marked as a strength by the internal growth score of <strong>72.46%</strong>, while capital allocation is modest at <strong>24.20%</strong>.</p><p>Leverage is notable: a leverage score of <strong>90.75%</strong> signals higher-than-average balance-sheet gearing relative to peers. Net margin is shown as <strong>0.00%</strong> in the dataset; given IBM’s established profitability, that zero may reflect a data artefact or a specific metric definition and should be treated cautiously. Overall, the fundamental score of <strong>58.60</strong> is moderate — healthy profitability and growth offset by capital allocation and leverage concerns.</p><p>Technically, a <strong>50-day EMA of $267.97</strong> and a <strong>50-day SMA of $255.49</strong> place the current price well above short-term trend averages, confirming upward momentum. The technical score of <strong>60.91</strong> is consistent with a trend-confirmation phase rather than an exhausted run.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Analyst Sentiment &amp; News Synthesis</strong></h3><p>Analyst sentiment tilts constructive. The analyst score is <strong>85.71</strong> derived from 23 tracked analysts, with a mean target of <strong>$286.20</strong> and a median of <strong>$300.90</strong>. The current price of $308.21 sits above the mean and slightly above the median, indicating the market has priced in somewhat more optimism than the consensus target. Coverage counts in the dataset show a wide spread of ratings — many buy/hold/sell entries — reflecting a mixed but tilted buying bias in broader aggregates.</p><p>Recent news is limited but meaningful: a renewal and expansion of a partnership between IBM and Straker Limited (<strong>ASX:STG</strong>) highlights continued traction for IBM’s AI and language services ecosystem. That kind of commercial expansion supports the narrative of enterprise customers leaning on IBM’s AI-enabled offerings, which aligns with the revenue beat and elevated news sentiment score of <strong>77.00</strong>. The news probably reinforced short-term flows and helped the Trade Engine Score remain elevated.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>IBM’s current profile is one of momentum meeting measured fundamentals. The Trade Engine Score of <strong>69.70</strong> captures this mix: positive technicals and strong sentiment sit alongside moderate fundamental scores and elevated leverage. Recent earnings produced a slight revenue beat that likely accelerated buying into resistance near the 52-week high. Analyst targets cluster below the current price, indicating the market has already priced some optimism beyond consensus.</p><p>For readers, the key takeaway is that IBM is in a phase where news, momentum and earnings cadence are the primary drivers of near-term performance, while valuation and leverage remain the longer-term anchors. Monitor price behavior around the $319 area and any follow-up commentary on margins, capital allocation and large-scale partnerships that could materially shift the fundamental case.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/meta-platforms-heads-into-earnings-with-ai-driven-ad-growth-and-tightened-power-competition?post=531397\">Meta Platforms Heads Into Earnings With AI-Driven Ad Growth And Tightened Power Competition</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/palantir-technologies-nears-record-high-after-lumen-ai-deal-and-defense-demonstrations?post=531081\">Palantir Technologies Nears Record High After Lumen AI Deal And Defense Demonstrations </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/micron-technology-near-52-week-high-as-ai-demand-drives-momentum?post=530726\">Micron Technology Near 52-Week High As AI Demand Drives Momentum</a></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p>As expected, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its target rate cut by ¼ point to a 4.0%-to-4.25% range. The drop marks the second rate cut this year, following the drop in the policy rate in September. A third cut by 2025’s close, however, is less likely, according to Fed Chairman Powell.</p><p>“There were strongly differing views about how to proceed [at the next policy meeting] in December,” Powell <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/fed-rate-decision-october-2025.html\">said</a> during a news conference following the Fed’s rate-cut announcement. “A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it.”</p><p>The bond market quickly took the hint and sold off, driving yields higher. The policy-sensitive 2-year rate, for example, shot up on Wednesday to 3.60%, a three-week high.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.capitalspectator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/two.yr_.30oct2025.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"309\" src=\"https://www.capitalspectator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/two.yr_.30oct2025.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p><br/><a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\">Fed funds futures</a> are still pricing in moderately high odds that favor another rate cut at the Dec. 10 meeting, but the implied probability is 72%, which leaves room for debate about how the end of the year unfolds.</p><p>Part of the reasoning for possibly pausing on rate cuts is the delay in new economic reports due to the government shutdown. “What do you do if you’re driving the fog? You slow down,” Powell <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/10/30/fed-cut-rates-officials-disagree-on-whats-next/86964505007/\">said</a>, referring to the postponed numbers, such as the monthly payrolls report for September which remains in hiatus.</p><p>The lack of new economic numbers is “very concerning,” former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Erica Groshen <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/10/29/powell-cuts-interest-rates-employment-inflation-trump-incompetent/\">told</a> <em>Fortune, </em>noting that the Fed is “flying blind.” She explained: “If policymakers build systems around data that can vanish overnight, that’s a real vulnerability for economic governance.”</p><p>The special release of consumer inflation data for September showed headline CPI rising 3.0% year-over-year, the highest since January. But Powell expressed a degree of optimism that to the extent that pricing pressure is rising due to tariffs, it will be a one-time effect that won’t push up inflation much longer beyond what’s already been seen.</p><p>“Inflation away from tariffs is actually not so far from our 2% goal,” Powell <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0p7g7560o\">said</a>. He advised that central bankers are looking for signs that tariffs only lead to one-time price increases for certain consumer products.</p><p>Despite the uncertainty linked to delayed data, weakness in hiring will likely keep the Fed on a rate-cutting path, predicts Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial. “The downside risks within the job market will likely ensure the Fed will continue to cut rates in December and throughout the next year,” he reasoned in a press release sent to CapitalSpectator.com.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.capitalspectator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fed.30oct2025.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"374\" src=\"https://www.capitalspectator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fed.30oct2025.png\" width=\"500\"/></a></p><p><br/>The critical variable in the days and weeks ahead is how the Treasury market reacts.

The company also raised its full-year guidance, reflecting robust business performance and strategic initiatives.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Q3 Revenue and EPS Exceed Estimates on Obesity Drug Momentum</strong></h3><p>Eli Lilly’s third-quarter 2025 financial results revealed a remarkable 54% increase in revenue, reaching $17.60 billion, compared to $11.44 billion in Q3 2024. This growth was primarily driven by a 62% volume increase, fueled by strong demand for key products such as Mounjaro and Zepbound. The company’s reported <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/investing/how-to-value-a-stock/\">earnings per share (EPS)</a> surged to $6.21, a significant rise from $1.07 in the same period last year. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS reached $7.02, up from $1.18 in Q3 2024. These results exceeded the market expectations of an EPS of $6.02 and revenue of $16.01 billion.</p><p>Despite the strong performance, the company faced a 10% decrease in realized prices, which was partially offset by a favorable product mix. Gross margin increased by 57% to $14.59 billion, with gross margin as a percent of revenue improving to 82.9%. Research and development expenses rose by 27% to $3.47 billion, reflecting continued investments in the company’s early and late-stage portfolio. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses also saw a 31% increase, driven by promotional efforts for ongoing and future launches.</p><p>In terms of net income, Eli Lilly reported $5.58 billion on a reported basis and $6.31 billion on a non-GAAP basis, compared to $970.3 million and $1.06 billion, respectively, in Q3 2024. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.8% on a reported basis and 17.7% on a non-GAAP basis, both impacted by non-deductible acquired IPR&amp;D charges. The company’s strong financial performance in Q3 2025 was further highlighted by positive developments in its R&amp;D pipeline, including successful Phase 3 trials and regulatory approvals.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Eli Lilly Raises 2025 Guidance on Continued Product Strength</strong></h3><p>Looking ahead, Eli Lilly has raised its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to be in the range of $63.0 billion to $63.5 billion, up from its previous estimate of $60.0 billion to $62.0 billion. This optimistic outlook is attributed to the strong performance across its portfolio and favorable foreign exchange rates. The company also increased its reported EPS guidance to be between $21.80 and $22.50, with non-GAAP EPS expected to range from $23.00 to $23.70.</p><p>The company’s performance margin is now anticipated to be between 43.5% and 44.5% on a reported basis and 45.0% to 46.0% on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting the increased revenue guidance. Other income (expense) on a reported basis is expected to be an expense in the range of $700 million to $600 million, due to a decrease in net losses on investments in equity securities. The estimated effective tax rate for 2025 remains unchanged at approximately 19% on a reported basis and 17% on a non-GAAP basis.</p><p>In addition to financial guidance, Eli Lilly highlighted its strategic initiatives, including the expansion of manufacturing facilities in Virginia, Texas, and Puerto Rico. The company is also focusing on advancing its R&amp;D pipeline, with plans to submit orforglipron for global regulatory approval for obesity treatment by the end of the year. Regulatory progress included the U.S. FDA approval of Inluriyo for certain breast cancer patients and the European Commission’s marketing authorization for Kisunla in Alzheimer’s treatment. These strategic moves and regulatory advancements position Eli Lilly for continued growth and innovation in the pharmaceutical industry.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/merck--co-beats-expectations-in-q3-2025-lifts-full-year-forecast?post=531815\">Merck &amp; Co.

The two leaders agreed to a one-year trade truce that includes reducing US tariffs on Chinese goods from about 57% to 47% and Chinese commitments to resume US soybean purchases. Trump claimed China has agreed to “continue the flow of rare earth, critical minerals, magnets, etc., openly and freely.\"</li><li value=\"2\">The US central bank lowered the federal funds rate by 25 bps to a target range of 3.75%-4.00%. The decision was not unanimous, with Fed Governor Stephen Miran voting for a deeper 50 bps cut and Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid preferring to keep rates unchanged.</li><li value=\"3\">In its Monetary Policy Statement, the Fed stated that economic activity continues to expand at a moderate pace, though job gains have slowed and inflation remains somewhat elevated. Policymakers acknowledged that uncertainty surrounding the outlook is still high and that downside risks to employment have increased in recent months. The Committee also announced plans to end Quantitative Tightening (QT) by halting the reduction of its securities holdings on December 1, signaling a pause in balance sheet runoff.</li><li value=\"4\">In the press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that there is tension between tackling inflation and supporting employment, noting that both cannot be addressed with a single policy tool. He added that the policy rate is now within the range of many estimates of neutral and that if labor market data show signs of stabilizing or strengthening, it would influence future policy decisions. Powell also said there is a “growing chorus” within the Committee suggesting it may be better to wait before making another move.</li><li value=\"5\">According to the World Gold Council’s (WGC) Q3 2025 Gold Demand Trends report, published on October 30, total gold demand rose 3% YoY to 1,313 tonnes, hitting a record quarterly high. Investment demand jumped 47% to 537 tonnes, driven by strong ETF inflows of 222 tonnes and continued bar and coin purchases of 316 tonnes. Central bank buying remained solid at 220 tonnes, up 28% from the previous quarter, while jewellery consumption declined 19% amid record-high prices.<br/>\t </li></ul><h3><strong>Technical analysis: XAU/USD consolidates below $4,000 with modest bullish momentum</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"336\" src=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feditorial.fxsstatic.com%2Fmiscelaneous%2Fchart-screenshot%2520-%25202025-10-30T173014-1761825626689-1761825626690.746.png&amp;w=1536&amp;q=95\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>XAU/USD remains vulnerable below the $4,000 mark, attempting to stabilize after recent volatility, though lacking follow-through buying.

China agreed to suspend those for a year and dropped its levy on US made/operated ships port calls. Beijing will also buy US soy, and some reports say energy as well. Apparently, Nvidia's Blackwell chip was not a subject of talks. Even with America's technological prowess, the education and material infrastructure to build rare earth processing capability and magnet will take more than a year. The deal will likely be widely criticized by the hawks that seem to dominate the US foreign policy establishment. Meanwhile, the hawkish cut by the Federal Reserve yesterday has seen the market narrow the odds of a December cut (to ~73% now from a little more than 90% yesterday) has helped lift greenback and it is largely consolidating today. The chief exception is the Japanese yen, which has been sold to a new eight-month low following the Bank of Japan's decision to stand pat and leave its economic forecasts from July largely intact. The dollar reached nearly JPY154.</p><p>The jump in US yields following the FOMC decision helped boost benchmark 10-year rates today. Benchmark yields are up 2-4 bp in Europe. The 10-year Treasury yield is slightly softer at 4.06%. Equities are mostly lower today. In the Asia Pacific region, among the large bourses, only Japan and South Korea, which secured a trade deal with the US, which include nuclear-fueled submarines, rose. Europe's Stoxx 600 is lower for the third session, matching its longest slump in a couple of months. US index futures are softer. Gold is firm, but mostly within yesterday's range. It is probing $4000 in the European morning. December WTI is also trading quietly in a narrow range around $60. </p><p><strong>USD: </strong>As widely expected, (96% of 81 economists in Bloomberg's survey and 98% discounted in the futures market), the Federal Reserve delivered the second quarter-point rate cut of the year. It also signaled it would stop the unwinding of its balance sheet (QT) at the end of November. The maturing mortgage-backed securities will be replaced with T-bills. There were two dissents. The one in favor of a 50 bp cut was widely expected but Miran. The other was from regional Fed President Schmid who favored steady policy. We suspect his dissent was due to the elevated inflation rather than the lack of data. Federal Reserve Chair Powell sounded less dovish and underscored that a December cut was not a foregone conclusion, as the derivatives market had shown. The Dollar Index recovered during Powell's press conference and reached 99.35, a new two-week high. It is trading quietly today between about 98.90 and 99.20. Nearby resistance near this month's highs in the 99.45-55 area. Above there, scope near-term scope may extend to around 100.00-25. Q3 GDP was due today, but the government shutdown continues to disrupt, and starting on November 1, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will stop being sent to some 40 mln Americans, though in the last government shutdown in President Trump's first time, the aid was still provided. Around 40% of the recipients are children, 18% elderly, and another 11% are disabled. Of the remainder, estimates suggest 70% are what is dubbed the \"working poor\" in that they do not earn a \"livable wage\". The Atlanta Fed GDP tracker saw growth in Q3 accelerating to 3.9%. The median forecast in Bloomberg's survey was for 2.7% and 3.0% (two different surveys were reported). </p><p><strong>EURO:</strong> The euro had been confined to an uninspiring range of about $1.1615-$1.1670 this week until the Fed's press conference when it was sold to about $1.1575. It has held above $1.1595 today, but the next technical target is around $1.1540. The outcome of the ECB meeting will be known shortly, but there is little doubt that it will leave policy unchanged. Still, the exchange rate may be sensitive to comments by ECB President Lagarde. Earlier today, it was reported that the eurozone economy grew by 0.2% in Q3 and after 0.1% in Q2. The September unemployment rate was steady at 6.3%. The German and Italian economies stagnated, while the French economy unexpectedly grew by 0.5% (0.3% in Q2). Ahead of tomorrow's preliminary aggregate October CPI, German states reported, and it looks consistent with a 0.2%-0.3% month-over-month increase for a country as a whole, which would see the year-over-year rate slip to 2.2%-2.3% from 2.4%. Spain's CPI was firmer than expected, rising 0.5% for a 3.2% year-over-year pace (EU harmonized) </p><p><strong>CNY:</strong> The dollar appears to have found support in the past couple of sessions a little in front of CNH7.09. The low for the year was recorded near CNH7.0850 on September 17, the last time the Fed cut rates. The dollar briefly traded above CNH7.10 shortly during the Fed's press conference. Its recovery was extended to a three-day high today, slightly above CNH7.11. Nearby resistance may be in the CNH7.1250-CNH7.1300 area. After setting the dollar fix at new lows for the year in each of the past three sessions, the PBOC set the reference rate a little higher today (CNY7.0864 vs CNY7.0843 yesterday). Presidents Trump and Xi met earlier today. Another uneasy trade truce has been negotiated. The two actions that China claims spurred the broadening rare earth export licensing requirements, namely the sanctioned companies to subsidiaries of other sanctioned companies and going ahead with the port levy, have been rescinded. Both sides have suspended the port levies for a year. China's rare earths action will also be suspended for a year. China agreed to resume its soy purchases and may also buy more US energy. Tomorrow, China reports October PMI and it is expected to be little changed. </p><p><strong>JPY: </strong>At the start of the week, the greenback retested the eight-month high set earlier this month near JPY153.25. The seven-day rally was capped with the help of mild verbal intervention. With the rise in US rates after the FOMC rate cut, the dollar traded back above JPY153. It has jumped to almost JPY154 today after the Bank of Japan left its target rate unchanged at 0.50%, with two dissents as before in favor an immediate hike. In Bloomberg's survey 59 of the 63 economists (~94%) surveyed expected this outcome and the swaps market had about an 87% chance of steady policy discounted. While leaving most of its economic projections unchanged from the July iteration, the growth forecast was raised to 0.7% from 0.6%. Governor Ueda continues to indicate that if the economy proceeds as officials expects, there is scope for higher rates. The BOJ also provided updates to its economic forecasts. Still, the state of the Japanese economy will be clearer tomorrow, after it reports September unemployment, industrial production, and retail sales. Recall that August was an especially poor month for the Japanese economy and it appears to have found better traction in September. Tokyo will report October CPI. The headline rate may have softened slightly but the measures may have ticked up. </p><p><strong>GBP: </strong>Sterling has traded poorly. Since September 17, when the Fed cut rates last, it has fallen by almost 4.3%. It has lost a little more than half of it in the past nine sessions. Yesterday, it was sold to about $1.3140, which provided support in both May and August. It corresponds to the (38.2%) retracement of this year's rally that peaked July slightly below $1.3800. It is consolidating in a narrow range today between in bout a 15-tick range on either side of $1.3200. Follow-through selling could target the $1.2950-$1.3000 area. Despite light economic calendar this week, the swaps market marginally increased the odds of a Bank of England rate cut next week to about 27% now from a little less than 24% at the end of last week. Selling pressure on sterling may have been exacerbated by month-end as portfolio managers prepare for next month's government budget. </p><p><strong>CAD: </strong> The Canadian dollar extended its recover even after the Bank of Canada cut rates. The US dollar was sold slightly below CAD1.3890 to reach its lowest level since September 25. Recall that before the weekend, it tested the CAD1.4040 area. The loss of CAD1.3900 means that the greenback has given up about half of its gains since the Federal Reserve cut last month. The greenback rebound sharply after the FOMC decision and returned to session highs near CAD1.3955, leaving a bullish hammer candlestick in its wake. There has been no follow-through US dollar buying today. Instead, the greenback is consolidating in a tight range between CAD1.3925-CAD1.3950. The Bank of Canada delivered a quarter-point cut yesterday and the overnight lending rate now stands at 2.25%. The market suspects this takes the central bank out of the picture for a while. The swaps market has about a 60% chance of another cut in Q2 26. Tomorrow, Canada reports August GDP. It is expected to be flat after 0.2% growth was recorded in July. </p><p><strong>AUD: </strong> The Australian dollar snapped a four-day advance yesterday, primarily due to the reaction during Fed Chair Powell's press conference. With yesterday's advance is met the (61.8%) retracement objective of the losses from the year's high set on September 17 (slightly above $0.6705). The recent gains have been sufficiently strong to lift the five-day moving average above the 20-day moving average for the first time since late September. Yesterday's high near $0.6620 approached the high for the month ~$0.6630 but sold off sharply to $0.6555 around Fed Powell's press conference. The Aussie is in about a third of a cent range below $0.6600 so far today. After yesterday's Q3 CPI, the futures market downgraded the chances that the Reserve Bank of Australia cuts rates next week. The pricing is consistent with slightly less than a 10% chance, down from about 55% at the end of last week. The overnight cash target rate is 3.60% and the swaps market is discounting a terminal rate near 3.35%. </p><p><strong>MXN: </strong>The dollar was confined to the range set at the end of last week: ~MXN18.3430-MXN18.4650 until the FOMC meeting, when it briefly rallied to MXN18.5025. It settled around MXN18.4850, which is the highest close in a couple of weeks. It is consolidating in a MCN18.45-MXN18.50 range today. Mexico reports Q3 GDP today. The median forecast in Bloomberg's survey anticipated a 0.4% quarterly contraction. Arguably more revealing is the year-over-year projection of a contraction of 0.3%. If accurate, it would be first negative year-over-year print since Q1 21. It may encourage more speculation of a cut in the 7.50% overnight target rate next week Meanwhile, the dollar bled lower against the Brazilian real for the third session yesterday. It fell slightly through BRL5.3350 yesterday, its lowest since October 9 before recovering on the back of the Fed to new session highs around BRL5.3670 before settling slightly BRL5.36. </p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/japanese-verbal-intervention-was-more-effective-than-bassets-and-the-dollar-is-bid-ahead-of-fomc-outcome?post=531392\">Japanese Verbal Intervention Was More Effective Than Basset's, And The Dollar Is Bid Ahead Of FOMC Outcome </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/japans-warning-and-successful-us-japan-talks-see-yen-snap-seven-day-slide?post=531077\">Japan's Warning And Successful US-Japan Talks See Yen Snap Seven-Day Slide</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/risk-on-as-us-china-take-step-away-from-brink?post=530694\">Risk-On As US-China Take Step Away From Brink</a><br/></div>",

While we do expect a gradual acceleration of growth over the coming year, we remain cautious about marking this as the start of a growth spurt, given domestic and global uncertainty.</p><p>GDP continues to show modest growth in the Eurozone, as GDP growth of 0.2% was slightly better than anticipated. The mood about the economy seems decently optimistic at the moment, despite ample downside risks clearly weighing on the outlook. Domestic policy risks relate to government budgets and reform agendas, while international risks centre on a global slowdown and trade policy.</p><p>By country, significant differences emerged in the third quarter. The French economy surprised to the upside, growing by 0.5% quarter-on-quarter despite political turmoil. Investments and exports jumped in France, in part because of a strong aerospace sector, which tends to see volatile production. The Netherlands also beat expectations with a strong 0.4% growth rate, while Germany and Italy both disappointed with 0% growth. Spanish growth continues to beat the Eurozone average, but did come down from 0.8 to 0.6%.</p><p>Surveys about the economy have become more upbeat despite global uncertainty. That certainly seems to have been the case in October, as today’s economic sentiment indicator jumped from 95.6 to 96.7, after the PMI also revealed optimism. We do, however, remain cautious about whether this is the start of a sustained growth acceleration.</p><p>With political uncertainty continuing in France, for example, the question remains whether the strong French GDP reading can be sustained. And Germany, of course, continues to struggle to make stimulus plans turn into GDP growth. With the largest Eurozone economy still sluggish, broad GDP acceleration is particularly challenging.</p><p>For those looking at this from a glass-half-full perspective, the Eurozone has remained far from recession despite all the global and domestic turmoil. But the half-empty take would be that evidence of a real sustained growth acceleration on the back of extra investment promises is not there yet.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/the-commodities-feed-bullish-eia-release-pushes-oil-higher?post=531681\">The Commodities Feed: Bullish EIA Release Pushes Oil Higher </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/rates-spark-fed-and-ecb-in-a-good-place?post=531554\">Rates Spark: Fed And ECB In A Good Place </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/bank-of-canada-cuts-rates-again-but-signals-the-end-is-approaching?post=531507\">Bank Of Canada Cuts Rates Again, But Signals The End Is Approaching </a><br/></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p>How is the U.S. new home market faring?</p><p>That's a more difficult question to answer than usual because the U.S. Census Bureau isn't publishing data on new residential sales with the federal government shutdown still dragging on. That matters because when we assess the relative health of the U.S. new home market, the primary data we employ is the Census Bureau's new residential sales data that tells us both the estimated number of new homes sold each month and the average price at which they sold. We multiply these figures together to produce an estimate of the total value of new homes sold within the U.S. each month. We then calculate the trailing twelve month average to smooth out seasonal variation in the data, shifting it \"backward\" in time so it becomes more of a contemporary indicator of the trends being experienced by the new home market.</p><p>But if that government-compiled data is not available, does that mean we're dead in the water for producing that kind of analysis?</p><p>Don't be silly. As with most data the government publishes that's useful, there are alternative sources available from private sector sources that provide a similar window for looking into the state of the new home market. We're going to use one of those alternative sources to do that today, which will give us a different but still useful picture of the.</p><p>We've tapped <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/research/data/\" target=\"_blank\">Zillow's monthly data</a> for new construction homes, which covers single family residences and condominiums, which is based on sales data for this class of real estate from major metropolitan areas in the U.S. to produce a national figure. That's a subset of the data that's compiled in the Census Bureau's new residential sales data, but should work to give us an idea of how the market is for the new construction homes in the markets that Zillow covers.</p><p>And also for which it has sales data. Because Zillow obtains its data from state and local sources that are slower to report their monthly new home sales figures, it lags a bit behind the national and regional estimates of new home sales data reported by the Census Bureau.

That's large enough for Zillow's data to provide a good indication of the overall state of the U.S. new home market.</p><p>The trend data, indicated by the time-shifted trailing twelve month average (orange) in the chart shows the new home market was largely flat from January 2024 through August 2024, but has been slowly falling off in the year since.</p><p>That mirrors similar trends for the number of new construction sales over the same period of time.</p><p>The trend for the mean sale price of new construction shows a different pattern. Here, average sale prices rose from May 2024 through December 2024, but have fallen off in the months since. First slowly from December 2024 through May 2025, then more steeply.</p><p>That pattern indicates 2025 has been a difficult market for the builders of single family homes and condominiums. Although they've been lowering prices since the end of 2024, it hasn't been enough to reverse the downtrend in the number of sales. A good portion of that problem has been tied up with elevated mortgage rates, which have made new homes less affordable than they would otherwise be had these interest rates been lower. The problem of unaffordability is harming the market for new homes. And by extension, Americans seeking to become new homeowners.</p><p>The analysis that falls out from using Zillow's data on new construction homes largely squares with the analysis we've been doing for years with the Census Bureau's new home sales figures. The government shutdown isn't an obstacle for reading the state of the U.S. new home market.</p><p><em>References</em></p><p><em>Zillow. New Construction Sales Count.

The pair is now trading near its lowest point since April 2025, with selling pressure intensifying after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points. While delivering the expected cut, Fed Chair Jerome Powell struck a hawkish note by stressing that further easing this year is not guaranteed, bolstering the US dollar.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The pound faces its own set of domestic headwinds. Mounting expectations of a Bank of England rate cut, combined with concerns over the upcoming November budget, are weighing on sentiment. During parliamentary hearings, Prime Minister Keir Starmer refused to rule out potential rises in income tax, national insurance, and VAT.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Further compounding the issue, press reports suggest the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) plans to lower its productivity growth forecast by approximately 0.3 percentage points. Such a revision could create a budget deficit of around £20 billion.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Softer-than-expected inflation data and a reported decline in food prices by the BRC have reinforced the market's view that the Bank of England is moving closer to easing monetary policy.<br/> </p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Technical Analysis: GBP/USD</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\">H4 Chart:<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"319\" src=\"https://talkmarkets.com/contributor/andrey-goilov/user_content/ckimages/orig_gbpusdh4_638974123894329815.webp\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/>On the H4 chart, GBP/USD is developing a bearish wave structure targeting 1.3111. We anticipate the pair reaching this level before forming a consolidation range around it. Critically, this move is considered the third and typically powerful wave within the broader downtrend, with the 1.3111 target representing only its initial phase. Following consolidation, we expect a downward breakout and a continuation of the sell-off to at least 1.2830. This bearish scenario is confirmed by the MACD indicator, whose signal line is below zero and pointing decisively downward, indicating sustained selling momentum.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">H1 Chart:<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"319\" src=\"https://talkmarkets.com/contributor/andrey-goilov/user_content/ckimages/orig_gbpusdh1_638974124119045090.webp\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/>On the H1 chart, the pair has completed a downward impulse to 1.3193 and formed a consolidation range, which has since expanded down to 1.3139. We now foresee a technical retest of 1.3217 from below, after which a further decline towards 1.3111 is expected. A decisive break below this support level would open the path for a move down to at least 1.3015. The Stochastic oscillator supports this outlook, with its signal line having turned down from below the 80 level and heading towards 20, reflecting building bearish momentum in the short term.<br/> </p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\">GBP/USD is stabilizing after a sharp drop, but the fundamental and technical backdrop remains bearish. Hawkish Fed rhetoric and a dovish shift in BoE expectations, alongside worrying UK fiscal signals, suggest any recovery may be short-lived. The path of least resistance appears lower, with key technical targets at 1.3111 and 1.3015.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/a-key-day-for-eurusd-as-the-fed-decision-looms?post=531324\">A Key Day For EUR/USD As The Fed Decision Looms </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/gold-rebounds-to-4000-usd-mark?post=530987\">Gold Rebounds To 4,000 USD Mark </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/usdjpy-tests-key-february-highs?post=530639\">USD/JPY Tests Key February Highs </a></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Stock, Trading, Monitor, Business, Finance, Exchange\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/11/27/21/42/stock-1863880_960_720.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/images/id-1863880/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em><br/> </p><p>While many other eurozone countries posted surprisingly strong growth numbers, the German economy remains the eurozone's growth laggard.</p><p>Stuck in stagnation. When German Chancellor Friedrich Merz took office in May, he promised that all Germans would feel change and improvement by the summer. This morning’s first estimate of German third-quarter GDP shows that this promise has not been fulfilled. In fact, the German economy just narrowly avoided a technical recession, as it stagnated in the third quarter, following a slightly upwardly revised contraction of -0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter (was -0.3% QoQ). On the year, the economy grew by 0.3%.</p><p>GDP details will only be released at the end of November, but available monthly data, as well as the statistical office’s press release, suggest that investments were a small growth driver, while exports and private consumption weighed on economic activity.<br/> </p><h3><strong>2025 is yet another year of stagnation</strong></h3><p>With today's GDP data and assuming no future revisions, the German economy is clearly headed towards another year of de facto stagnation. In fact, another quarter of stagnation would bring annual growth in 2025 to some 0.2%, keeping the size of the economy still below its late-2019 level.</p><p>After the excitement and enthusiasm sparked by Germany’s fiscal policy U-turn and its decision to invest significantly in infrastructure and defence this spring, the summer brought a rude awakening. The mood in Germany soured and optimism ground to a halt – and not just because of US tariffs or a stronger euro, both of which complicate matters for the export industry. In fact, German policymakers are apparently just now waking up to the painful reality that readers of our research have heard endlessly over the last five years. A reality in which Germany has lost international competitiveness as a result of long-term underinvestment, a portion of naivety and arrogance, and China's rise from export destination to system rival. Current fears of production stops in the German (automotive) industry as a result of Chinese export controls on microchips are one of too many reminders that German industry is no longer dictating the rules of the game, and instead, merely lies at the receiving end.</p><p>Another reason for the worsening mood in Germany is domestic politics. The hope that a new government and fiscal stimulus would finally lift the economy out of its prolonged stagnation seems to have faded. Why? The discussion around possible austerity measures undermines the psychological impact of the announced fiscal stimulus. The government’s decision to shift previously planned investments from the annual budget to special investment funds has also brought a whiff of creative accounting in German fiscal policy. These developments not only revive unpleasant memories of coalition infighting from the previous government but also risk dampening household and corporate spending and investment decisions.<br/> </p><h3><strong>All hopes are still on fiscal stimulus</strong></h3><p>Let’s be clear: the scale of Germany’s announced fiscal stimulus – €500bn for infrastructure and a ‘whatever it takes’ stance on defence – remains significant. This money will eventually reach the economy. However, recent fiscal manoeuvres have increased the risk that the stimulus will be less impactful and slower to materialise than initially hoped. Add to this the well-known supply-side constraints, from a shortage of skilled labour and high material costs to bureaucratic hurdles, and it seems likely that infrastructure investments will boost the economy more in 2027 than in 2026. Defence spending, on the other hand, could still deliver a positive growth surprise. Beyond the diluted impact of fiscal stimulus, the government is still struggling to agree on the far-reaching reforms needed to structurally enhance Germany’s competitiveness. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has promised a 'Fall of Reforms'. So far, the government has not only failed to deliver but also appears stuck in a macroeconomic model rooted in the 20th century, lacking a clear plan to propel the German economy into the 21st century.</p><p>That said, autumn isn’t over yet, and recent weeks have seen new initiatives aimed at reducing bureaucracy and boosting digitalisation. And yes, it takes time for investments and reforms to translate into growth.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Europe's growth laggard</strong></h3><p>All in all, while other eurozone countries showed surprisingly strong growth, the German economy continues to lag behind. The country remains stuck in stagnation and only banking on fiscal stimulus to come to the rescue gets increasingly risky. The longer this stagnation lasts, the easier it is to surprise to the upside. However, to return as a real powerhouse, Germany quickly needs a coherent, longer-term strategy and less wishful thinking with full pockets.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/german-ifo-index-surprises-in-october?post=530650\">German Ifo Index Surprises In October </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/three-reasons-to-skip-next-weeks-ecb-meeting?post=529726\">Three Reasons To Skip Next Week’s ECB Meeting </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/europe-is-praying-that-france-gets-a-grip?post=527616\">Europe Is Praying That France Gets A Grip </a><br/></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Person Holding Blue and Clear Ballpoint Pen\" height=\"331\" src=\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/590022/pexels-photo-590022.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/chart-close-up-data-desk-590022/\" target=\"_blank\">Pexels</a></em><br/> </p><p>On Wednesday, US stock indices showed mixed performance. The Dow Jones (US30) Index fell by 0.16%. The S&amp;P 500 (US500) declined by 0.01%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq (US100) closed higher by 0.55%. The Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis point (bps) cut to the federal funds rate, bringing it to 4.00% at its October 2025 meeting, a move that fully aligned with market expectations. This was the second consecutive cut after the September decision. The regulator noted increasing risks in the labor market in recent months, while inflation has accelerated since the start of the year and remains relatively elevated. During the press conference, Chairman Jerome Powell stressed that a rate cut in December is not guaranteed, although investors still price in a high probability of another 25 bps move, consistent with the Fed’s September forecasts. Additionally, the central bank announced that the reduction of its balance sheet (Quantitative Tightening) will conclude on December 1st.</p><p>The Bank of Canada (BoC) cut its rate to 2.25% and signaled a potential pause in the easing cycle. The regulator indicated that the easing cycle is likely nearing its end, provided the baseline economic forecast remains unchanged amidst ongoing uncertainty. The Governing Council noted that trade conflict has caused structural damage to the economy, reducing its potential, which aligns with the 1.6% year-over-year GDP decline in the second quarter.</p><p>G7 nations plan to establish a critical minerals alliance to counter China’s dominance in global supply chains. The alliance aims to reduce China’s market influence, including its practice of dumping to push out Western projects and the imposition of export controls. Canada, in particular, expects economic benefits, leveraging its domestic resource base and ready-to-go infrastructure projects.</p><p>European stock markets traded with mixed dynamics yesterday. Germany’s DAX (DE40) fell by 0.64%, France’s CAC 40 (FR40) closed down 0.19%, Spain’s IBEX35 (ES35) gained 0.39%, and the UK’s FTSE 100 (UK100) closed 0.61% higher. Contradictory corporate results amplified uncertainty regarding the region’s economic outlook. The banking sector was the leader of the gains: Santander added 4% after publishing a record nine-month profit, and Deutsche Bank rose by 5% on strong investment division results. Mercedes-Benz climbed 4.3% as growth in premium segment sales ensured margin expansion and compensated for a decline in China revenue.</p><p>Today, the ECB will hold its monetary policy meeting. There is an almost 99% probability that the interest rate will remain unchanged at 2.15%. This stands in contrast to the situation at the US Federal Reserve (Fed).</p><p>WTI crude oil prices rose on Wednesday to around $60.6 per barrel due to a reduction in inventories. According to the EIA, US crude oil stocks fell by 6.9 million barrels, a more significant drop than expected. Gasoline and distillate inventories also decreased, while stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub increased. Indian refineries temporarily halted new purchases pending official instructions, though the state-owned IOC confirmed it would continue imports under contractual obligations. However, some analysts doubt that the sanctions will lead to a significant supply reduction, given reports that OPEC+ may consider another production increase at its next meeting to stabilize the market.</p><p>Asian markets also traded with mixed results yesterday. Japan’s Nikkei 225 (JP225) surged 2.17%, China’s FTSE China A50 (CHA50) gained 0.10%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng (HK50) fell by 0.33%, and Australia’s ASX 200 (AU200) posted a negative result of 0.96%.</p><p>The Bank of Japan (BoJ) kept its key short-term rate at 0.5%, holding borrowing costs at their highest level since 2008 and extending the pause after the January hike. The regulator reiterated its readiness to tighten policy further if the economy evolves within its outlook. In its quarterly projections, the BoJ maintained its core inflation estimate for the 2025 fiscal year at 2.7%, expecting it to slow to 1.8% in 2026. The GDP growth forecast for 2025 was improved from 0.6% to 0.7%, facilitated by a new trade agreement with the US and the policies of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s cabinet.</p><ul><li>S&amp;P 500 (US500) <strong>6,890.59</strong> −0.30 (−0.01%)</li><li>Dow Jones (US30) <strong>47,632.00</strong> −74.37 (−0.16%)</li><li>DAX (DE40) <strong>24,124.21</strong> −154.42 (−0.64%)</li><li>FTSE 100 (UK100) <strong>9,756.14</strong> +59.40 (+0.61%)</li><li>USD Index <strong>99.13</strong> +0.47% (+0.47%)<br/>\t </li></ul><h3><strong>News feed for: 2025.10.30</strong></h3><ul><li>Japan BoJ Interest Rate Decision at 05:00 (GMT+2);</li><li>Japan BoJ Monetary Policy Statement at 05:00 (GMT+2);</li><li>Japan BOJ Outlook Report at 05:00 (GMT+2);</li><li>Switzerland KOF Leading Indicators (m/m) at 10:00 (GMT+2);</li><li>German Unemployment Rate (m/m) at 10:55 (GMT+2);</li><li>German GDP (m/m) at 11:00 (GMT+2);</li><li>Eurozone GDP (m/m) at 12:00 (GMT+2);</li><li>Eurozone Unemployment Rate (m/m) at 12:00 (GMT+2);</li><li>German Inflation Rate (m/m) at 15:00 (GMT+2);</li><li>Eurozone ECB Interest Rate Decision at 15:15 (GMT+2);</li><li>Eurozone ECB Monetary Policy Statement at 15:15 (GMT+2);</li><li>Eurozone ECB Press Conference at 15:45 (GMT+2);</li><li>US Natural Gas Storage (w/w) at 16:30 (GMT+2).</li></ul><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/the-australian-dollar-strengthened-reaching-a-three-week-high?post=531317\">The Australian Dollar Strengthened, Reaching A Three-Week High </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/the-us-and-china-representatives-reached-a-preliminary-trade-agreement?post=530941\">The US And China Representatives Reached A Preliminary Trade Agreement </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/us-stock-indices-set-price-records-amid-soft-inflation-data?post=530637\">US Stock Indices Set Price Records Amid Soft Inflation Data </a></p></div>",

Asian markets are predominantly up on Thursday, influenced by the varied signals from Wall Street the previous night, as optimism grows regarding a trade agreement between the U.S. and China. Traders are also responding to the recent quarter-point interest rate reduction by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The Bank of Japan kept interest rates unchanged but reaffirmed its commitment to raising borrowing costs if the economy aligns with its forecasts, directing investor attention toward the possibility of a rate increase as early as December.</p><p>President Trump and President Xi engaged in a nearly two-hour meeting on Thursday, local time, during the APEC summit in South Korea. While aboard Air Force One, Trump praised the meeting as \"amazing\" and \"outstanding\". He announced that the fentanyl tariff on Chinese imports will be reduced to 10% immediately, while many other tariffs will stay in place. Trump also mentioned that China will start purchasing soybeans again without delay and confirmed that China will refrain from implementing rare earth controls. While Trump called it \"amazing\", markets remain cautious, awaiting China's perspective. Global stocks surged, with Chinese equities nearing decade highs. </p><p>The progressive Democrats 66 party appeared set to secure victory in the Dutch parliamentary elections after voters rejected Geert Wilders’ far-right Freedom Party and expressed support for more traditional political factions. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung completed a trade agreement on Wednesday, concluding months of negotiations over the implementation of a framework deal established in July. Nvidia reached a remarkable market capitalisation of $5 trillion on Wednesday, as Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang’s series of acquisitions propels the boom in artificial intelligence to unprecedented levels.</p><p>The Fed cut rates by 25bps to a 3.75-4.0% target range, but Powell downplayed expectations for another cut in December, stating it’s “not a foregone conclusion.” He emphasized the need to wait, citing unclear data and FOMC divisions. Schmid dissented against the cut, while Miran supported a larger 50bps cut. The dot plot shows 9 of 19 members support no further cuts or only one more this year. Market expectations for a December cut dropped from ~90% to ~70%, with 2-year yields rising ~10bps to 3.6%. Equities initially reacted negatively but later recovered. QT will end on December 1, with maturing MBS holdings reinvested into T-bills and redeeming Treasuries reinvested into Treasuries.</p><p>The upcoming ECB meeting is expected to be uneventful, with consensus predicting the Depo rate to remain at 2% and minimal chances of a cut. Lagarde is unlikely to signal policy changes during her press conference. Inflation forecasts hover around 2%, placing the Governing Council in a stable position on price stability. Risks persist, with German fiscal stimulus offering optimism but weaker trade dynamics and potential impacts from Trump tariffs posing challenges. While Q3 GDP data is released today, external demand concerns are unlikely to influence policy decisions yet.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Overnight Headlines</strong></h3><ul><li>EZ GDP Set To Tick Higher; Growth Could Come From German Spending</li><li>Lacking Impetus, ECB Likely To Hold Rates Again</li><li>BoJ Holds Rates In First Meeting After Japan PM Takaichi’s Ascent</li><li>Powell’s December Warning Exposes Hardening Divisions At Fed</li><li>HKMA Cuts Base Rate By 25bps To 4.25%</li><li>Trump Says Xi Meeting Yielded Fentanyl Tariff Cut To 10%</li><li>Trump Orders Nuclear Weapons Trials After Russia Tests</li><li>EU States Plan To Help Move Tanks Across Continent In Case Of War</li><li>Dutch Far Right Loses Ground In Elections As Centrists Gain</li><li>Google Revenue Soars To Record As AI Boom Lifts Cloud Business</li><li>Microsoft’s Cloud Services Power Earnings Beyond Expectations</li><li>Meta Projects Higher Expenses, Takes One-Time Tax Charge</li><li>Starbucks Café Sales Stabilise After Prolonged Slide</li><li>eBay Reports Q3 Sales, Merchandise Volume Rise</li><li>Chipotle Cuts Outlook Again In 2025 On Weak Traffic</li><li>ServiceNow Sees Strong AI-Driven Growth, Highlights Spending Cuts<br/>\t </li></ul><h3><strong>FX Options Expiries For 10am New York Cut </strong></h3><p>(1BLN+ represents larger expiries, more magnetic when trading within daily ATR)</p><ul><li>EUR/USD: 1.1725 (EU1.2b), 1.1650 (EU948.5m), 1.2000 (EU933.8m)</li><li>USD/JPY: 135.00 ($1.68b), 125.00 ($1.68b), 150.00 ($908m)</li><li>USD/CAD: 1.4015 ($1.66b), 1.3675 ($1.1b), 1.3965 ($1.01b)</li><li>USD/BRL: 5.3500 ($380m), 5.5125 ($320.3m)</li><li>AUD/USD: 0.6515 (AUD864.9m), 0.6550 (AUD501.1m), 0.5700 (AUD481.4m)</li><li>GBP/USD: 1.3000 (GBP367.7m)</li><li>USD/CNY: 7.1250 ($449.1m), 7.1150 ($350m), 7.1200 ($300m)</li><li>EUR/GBP: 0.8750 (EU429.1m)<br/>\t </li></ul><h3><strong>CFTC Positions as of the Week Ending 9/10/25 </strong></h3><ul><li><p>October 1, 2025: During the shutdown of the federal government, Commitments of Traders Reports will not be published<br/>\t </p></li></ul><h3><strong>Technical &amp;

As of October 2025, copper prices have surged to approximately $11,000 per metric ton, nearing their all-time high of $11,104.50 set in May 2024.<br/> </p><h3><strong>What Affects Copper Price</strong></h3><p>Major copper-producing countries - Chile and Peru- have faced environmental regulations, labor shortages, and declining ore grades, leading to limited supply availability. Additionally, incidents like the Grasberg mine disruptions in Indonesia have further strained global copper supply.</p><p>The global push towards infrastructure development and renewable energy transition has significantly increased copper demand. Copper is essential in electrical wiring, power grids, and renewable energy technologies like solar panels and wind turbines. In 2024, global refined copper demand reached nearly 27 million tonnes, a 3.2% rise compared to 2023.</p><p>Geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China created issues in the copper market. Trade restrictions and political instability are increasing costs and causing delays in mining operations, especially in the copper sector.</p><p>Speculative trading has also influenced copper prices. Analysts have debated whether the current price surge is driven by genuine supply shortages or speculative activities. While some forecasts predict prices reaching $11,000–$14,000 per tonne in 2026–2027, others caution that these projections may be influenced by market speculation.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Bottom Line Is</strong></h3><p>Looking ahead, the copper market faces a potential supply shortfall. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts a 30% supply deficit by 2035, driven by increased demand from electrification and renewable energy sectors. This anticipated deficit underscores the importance of strategic investments in mining operations and exploration to meet future demand.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/soybeans-price-analysis-trends-and-drivers?post=530278\">Soybeans Price Analysis - Trends And Drivers</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/warren-buffett-adds-521-million-to-chevron?post=529984\">Warren Buffett Adds $521 Million To Chevron </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/coffee-price-analysis-arabica-2025?post=529522\">Coffee Price Analysis: Arabica, 2025 </a></p></div>",

(NYSE: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/MRK\">MRK</a>) has <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251030997062/en/Merck-Co.-Inc.-Rahway-N.J.-USA-Announces-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> its financial results for the third quarter of 2025, showcasing a strong performance that exceeded expectations. The company also provided updated guidance for the full year, reflecting its strategic advancements and market positioning.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Strong Oncology Growth and $2.58 EPS Power Merck’s Q3 Results</strong></h3><p>In the third quarter of 2025, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. reported total worldwide sales of $17.3 billion, marking a 4% increase from the same period in 2024. This growth was primarily driven by strong demand for KEYTRUDA, which saw a 10% increase in sales to $8.1 billion. The pharmaceutical segment’s performance was bolstered by oncology, cardiovascular, and diabetes products, despite some declines in vaccines and virology. Notably, WINREVAIR sales surged by 141% to $360 million.</p><p>The company’s GAAP <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/investing/how-to-value-a-stock/\">earnings per share (EPS)</a> was $2.32, while non-GAAP EPS was $2.58, both surpassing the expected EPS of $2.35. This performance was supported by a net income increase of 83% to $5.8 billion, compared to $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in EPS was partly attributed to lower restructuring costs and favorable product mix. Merck’s sales also exceeded the anticipated revenue of $17.06 billion, reaching $17.3 billion.</p><p>Merck’s robust performance in Q3 2025 was highlighted by significant product approvals and strategic acquisitions. The FDA’s approval of KEYTRUDA QLEX for subcutaneous use across all solid tumor indications marked a major milestone. Additionally, the acquisition of Verona Pharma strengthened Merck’s pipeline, particularly in the cardiovascular and respiratory domains. These strategic moves underscore Merck’s commitment to delivering value through innovative medicines and vaccines.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Merck Reaffirms Long-Term Growth Plans with Higher 2025 Guidance</strong></h3><p>Looking ahead, Merck has updated its full-year 2025 financial outlook, projecting worldwide sales between $64.5 billion and $65.0 billion. This revised guidance reflects a slight increase from the previous range of $64.3 billion to $65.3 billion. The company has also raised its expected non-GAAP EPS range to $8.93 to $8.98, up from the prior range of $8.87 to $8.97.</p><p>The updated guidance accounts for several factors, including a favorable amendment to the collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca related to Koselugo and operational improvements. However, it also considers the potential negative impact of the Verona Pharma acquisition and foreign exchange fluctuations. Merck anticipates a non-GAAP effective tax rate between 14.0% and 15.0%, reflecting a more favorable tax environment than previously expected.</p><p>Merck’s strategic focus on expanding its manufacturing and R&amp;D capabilities is evident in its ongoing investments.

He said, “On a scale of 1 to 10, the meeting with Xi was a 12”.

The Cable fell sharply on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve (Fed) decision to reduce interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.75%-4.00%.</li><li value=\"2\">This was the second straight interest rate cut by the Fed this year. The central bank was expected to announce a dovish interest rate decision, as recent US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release has signaled that the impact of tariffs on inflation is not persistent. Additionally, deteriorating labor market conditions and the ongoing federal shutdown remained key reasons behind the Fed’s rate cut announcement.</li><li value=\"3\">Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also stated that the cut was “risk management” as the job creation has remained “very low”.</li><li value=\"4\">Technically, lower interest rates by the Fed bode poorly for the US Dollar; however, the Greenback strengthened after Chair Powell argued against further monetary easing in the December policy meeting. “Another cut in December is far from assured, as inflation remains somewhat elevated relative to the goal,” he said.</li><li value=\"5\">Powell's comments signaling no support for an interest rate cut in December led investors to revise their dovish expectations. According to the CME FedWatch tool, traders see a 70% chance that the Fed will hold interest rates steady in the range of 3.75%-4.00% in December, significantly increased from 9.1% seen on Tuesday.</li><li value=\"6\">In the United Kingdom (UK), the major trigger for the British currency will be expectations regarding the upcoming Bank of England’s (BoE) monetary policy scheduled next week. Analysts at Goldman Sachs wait for the BoE to cut interest rates by 25 bps to 3.75% on November 6. The investment banking firm turns dovish for November’s monetary policy due to the softening labor market.</li><li value=\"7\">Contrary to Goldman Sachs, a recent Reuters poll showed that economists expect there will be no further interest rate cuts by the BoE this year, and the central bank will restart the monetary-easing campaign in the first quarter of 2026.<br/>\t </li></ul><h3><strong>Technical Analysis: Pound Sterling struggles to return above 1.3200</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"265\" src=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feditorial.fxsstatic.com%2Fmiscelaneous%2Fchart-screenshot%2520(93)-1761810090392-1761810090396.png&amp;w=1536&amp;q=95\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>The Pound Sterling ticks down to near 1.3185 against the US Dollar on Thursday.
