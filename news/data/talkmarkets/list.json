            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p>Dow Theory is a market tool developed by Charles Dow in the very early 1900s. Dow also created the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The basic gist of Dow theory is that market trends are confirmed when gains or record highs are established in the broader market indexes, and then confirmed by similar trends and/or record highs in the Dow Jones Transportation Index.</p><p>Over 100 years ago, when he proposed the Dow Theory, the US was much more of a manufacturing nation; thus, the health of the shipping and trucking industries was a paramount gauge of the economy. Today, services account for over two-thirds of the economy; thus, shipping is not as important. That said, trucking, an essential component of the transportation industry, helps us appreciate the flow of goods within the US, whether domestically made or imported. Therefore, it can still serve as a good economic gauge.</p><p>With that, we present two graphs and a comment that elicits Dow Theory and asks whether we should be concerned or if Dow Theory is an artifact of the past.</p><ul><li>The first is a comment from the most recent <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.dallasfed.org_research_surveys_tssos_2025_2510-23tab-2Dcomments&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=PJgpDD_X4kvibnixE-spwza342hldu9uV5MjnfW1V1k&amp;m=dphsE1jyn7dYUw4G3kEUB6T3l223iTF5ziJDzjFZwa7m3aIlNR9XIvAgG8w9KVSf&amp;s=m9aBhZtdGHB9KCjvEQ3M7KJ-m5fvSu7a2T80E0PNbg0&amp;e=\" target=\"_blank\">Dallas Fed Services Survey</a>.

The index is a daily measure of the freight volume contracted by shippers for transport. Per its creator, FreightWaves, its data provides a real-time pulse of truckload demand in the freight market. As the graph shows, demand for trucking this year (blue) is much weaker than the prior two years.</li><li>Lastly, the graph on the right shows that the Dow Transportation Index is significantly lagging the broader market. Per Charles Dow, this divergence does not confirm the S&amp;P 500’s record highs.<br/>\t </li></ul><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"387\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dowtheroy-1-1024x566.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><h3><br/><strong>What To Watch Today</strong></h3><p><strong>Earnings</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-175.png\"><img alt=\"Earnings Calendar\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-175-1024x289.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p><br/><strong>Economy</strong><br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-176.png\"><img alt=\"Economic Calendar\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-176-1024x389.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><h3><br/><strong>Market Trading Update</strong></h3><p><strong><em><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/liquidity-concerns-put-an-end-to-qt?post=531785\" target=\"_blank\">Yesterday</a></em></strong>, we discussed the ongoing breadth problem in the market. Yet, despite that concern, the market continues to find buyers on every dip. For now, corporate profits and earnings remain very supportive of bulls as we head into year-end. As noted by FactSet, corporate profitability is indeed very profitable.</p><blockquote><p><em>“The blended net profit margin for the S&amp;P 500 for Q3 2025 is 12.8%, which is equal to the previous quarter’s net profit margin, but above the year-ago net profit margin and above the 5-year average. <strong>In fact, this quarter marks the 6<sup>th</sup> consecutive quarter that the S&amp;P 500 is reporting a net profit margin above the 5-year average (12.1%).</strong></em></p><p><em>At the sector level, four sectors are reporting a year-over-year increase in their net profit margins in Q3 2025 compared to Q3 2024, led by the Financials (19.9% vs. 18.0%) and Utilities (16.7% vs. 14.8%) sectors. On the other hand, six sectors are reporting a year-over-year decrease in their net profit margins in Q3 2025 compared to Q3 2024, led by the Communication Services (13.8 vs. 14.8%), Real Estate (34.3% vs. 35.2%), and Health Care (7.3% vs. 8.2%) sectors.</em></p><p><em>Seven sectors are reporting net profit margins in Q3 2025 that are above their 5-year averages, led by the Utilities (16.7% vs. 13.6%) sector. On the other hand, four sectors are reporting net profit margins in Q3 2025 that are below their 5-year averages, led by the Health Care (7.3% vs. 9.3%) and Energy (8.0% vs. 9.8%) sectors. Five sectors are reporting a quarter-over-quarter increase in their net profit margins in Q3 2025 compared to Q2 2025, led by the Utilities (16.7% vs. 12.8%) sector. On the other hand, six sectors are reporting a quarter-over-quarter decrease in their net profit margins in Q3 2025 compared to Q2 2025, led by the Communication Services (13.8% vs. 15.3%) sector.</em></p><p><em>It is interesting to note that analysts believe net profit margins for the S&amp;P 500 will be higher in 2026. As of today, the estimated net profit margins for Q4 2025 through Q2 2026 are 12.8%, 13.4% and 13.7%, respectively.”</em></p></blockquote><p> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://insight.factset.com/hs-fs/hubfs/1)Insight/2025/10.2025/10.27.2025_Earnings%20Insight/01-sp500-net-profit-margin-q420-q325.png?width=672&amp;height=384&amp;name=01-sp500-net-profit-margin-q420-q325.png\"><img alt=\"01-sp500-net-profit-margin-q420-q325\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://insight.factset.com/hs-fs/hubfs/1)Insight/2025/10.2025/10.27.2025_Earnings%20Insight/01-sp500-net-profit-margin-q420-q325.png?width=672&amp;height=384&amp;name=01-sp500-net-profit-margin-q420-q325.png\" width=\"600\"/></a></p><p><br/>It is also notable that coming into the Q3 earnings season, Wall Street estimates were on the conservative side, given the unknowns about the impact of tariffs on US companies. It is now apparent that those concerns were overblown as the “<em>beat rate”</em> for earnings is approaching the highest level since the end of the Pandemic-driven economic shutdown.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G4gHJQaXEAAkuPn?format=jpg&amp;name=small\"><img alt=\"Line chart titled Proportion of S&amp;P 500 beating earnings estimate (%) displays data from Q1 2006 to Q1 2025 with blue line for actual percentages fluctuating between 63 and 83 percent, green horizontal line at 73 percent labeled Average (2006-19:74%), gray shaded area labeled Recession, and orange line for recent trends, sourced from S&amp;P Global and Deutsche Bank Association.\" height=\"442\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G4gHJQaXEAAkuPn?format=jpg&amp;name=small\" width=\"600\"/></a></p><p><br/>With both earnings and profitability coming in above expectations, the bulls continue to find the support needed to justify the current valuation overpayment. How long that will last is unknown, but for now, the risk of the “<em>pain trade higher”</em> into year-end seems plausible.</p><p>Trade accordingly.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Meta Disappoints Despite Good News</strong></h3><p>Meta shares fell by nearly ten percent on what appears to be good news. Revenues beat estimates by 3% and prior guidance from Meta by almost 5%. EPS missed estimates significantly, but it was due to a one-time accounting issue related to a temporary difference between taxable income and income reported on financial statements. There’s no impact on future cash flows. Excluding the accounting earnings impact, earnings beat estimates. Most importantly, to the market, CapEx spending plans were increased for the remainder of 2025 and 2026.</p><p>Meta is going all out with its spending to transition from a social media platform to an AI computational platform wrapped into social media. As we share in the quote below from its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta is intent on being an AI leader.</p><blockquote><p><em>I think it’s pretty early, but I think we’re seeing the returns in the core business that’s giving us a lot of confidence that we should be investing a lot more. And we want to make sure that we’re not underinvesting.</em></p></blockquote><p>What we find interesting is that increased CapEx spending plans by other large companies have been met with applause. Is this a buying opportunity for Meta, or is the market starting to worry about overinvestment in AI? To help answer that question, consider that Microsoft is also trading lower after its earnings report, which also discussed increased CapEx spending plans.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/meta.png\"><img alt=\"meta\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/meta-1024x444.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><h3><br/><strong>Two S&amp;P 500s: One Big Divergence</strong></h3><p>The S&amp;P 500 index is weighted by market cap. Today, that means the top stocks carry much more weight than the remaining stocks. For instance, the Magnificent Seven account for a third of the daily price changes. While the weighted index is most followed, there is also an equal-weighted index. Comparing the market-cap-weighted and equal-weighted indexes can help us measure market breadth. What we have recently seen is a gross divergence between the two indexes.</p><p>The table below, courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.simplevisor.com/factor-analysis\" target=\"_blank\">SimpleVisor</a>, shows relative returns as compared to the S&amp;P 500. The two highest excess returns over the last five days are those that are even more heavily weighted in the Magnificent Seven stocks (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/IVW\">IVW</a> and <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/MGK\">MGK</a>) than the market-cap-weighted S&amp;P 500. Towards the bottom, note that the equal-weighted S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/RSP\">RSP</a>) has significantly underperformed. The second table, also from SimpleVisor, quantifies the extent of the performance divergence. Per the graphic, over the last 252 trading days (one year), the correlation of excess returns between RSP and mega-cap stocks (MGK) is in the lowest .81 percentile. Another table in SimpleVisor (not shown) indicates that the relationship is nearly two standard deviations from the norm. The Tweet of the Day below provides further context on the gross outperformance of market-cap-weighted indexes versus their equally weighted counterparts.</p><p>The takeaway: the market is prime for a rotation from the most prominent companies to the many others being left out. The question is when?<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"returns by market weight S&amp;P 500\" height=\"323\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rsp-spy-1024x473.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/correlation.png\"><img alt=\"correlation mgk and rsp S&amp;P 500\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/correlation.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><h3><br/><strong>Tweet of the Day</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/equal-vs-cap-weighted.png\"><img alt=\"equal vs market weighted S&amp;P 500\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/equal-vs-cap-weighted.png\" width=\"500\"/></a></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/liquidity-concerns-put-an-end-to-qt?post=531785\">Liquidity Concerns Put An End To QT</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/rebasing-the-dollar-another-look-at-the-debasing-narrative?post=531399\">Rebasing The Dollar: Another Look At The Debasing Narrative</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/gold-or-bitcoin-which-is-the-right-dollar-hedge?post=531005\">Gold Or Bitcoin: Which Is The ‘Right’ Dollar Hedge?</a><br/></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"10 and one 10 us dollar bill\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580519541857-b9b8e6da1471?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/G5lbnuiS9mg\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></em><br/> </p><p>The dollar enjoyed a second round of support yesterday as Powell's relatively hawkish press conference continued to resonate with data-starved markets. But the conditions for another big leg higher in USD aren't there, in our view. Meanwhile, Japan has intervened verbally to curb JPY volatility, and GBP is looking closely at Reeves' political position. <br/> </p><h3><strong>USD: Further gains harder to justify</strong></h3><p>The dollar found more support yesterday on the tail effect of Fed Chair Powell’s hawkish press conference and, more marginally, the US-China trade deal (on the latter, we recommend our commodities team’s <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/articles/how-rare-earths-became-the-next-trade-war-weapon/\">rare earths </a>note). Throughout September and October, we have discussed how short-dollar trades clearly hit a roadblock and needed to be fuelled by more compelling negative USD news. The government shutdown has prevented jobs data from offering that catalyst, and Powell’s caution on a December cut has to be taken more at face value now.</p><p>But our short-term call on the dollar remains more one of ‘lack of direction’ rather than the initiation of a more sustainable rebound. And the reason is precisely the lack of data releases, which incidentally prevents markets from making any conviction call on slower Fed easing. In our view, DXY lacks the thrust to break above 100.0. Today, the PCE report should be delayed.</p><p>In Japan, USD/JPY is now obviously causing concerns for authorities. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said overnight that the yen’s “very one-sided and rapid currency” moves are being watched with a “high sense of urgency”. This confirms it’s officially the rate of change rather than the level that matters, although previous instances of BoJ FX intervention tell us that psychological levels play a role too. This time, there is a larger question mark on whether the US will condone FX intervention.</p><p>Markets may be willing to test whether 155.0 is a line in the sand – inaction around that level could prompt more speculative long USD/JPY bets. However, <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/snaps/japan-industrial-output-rebounded-and-inflation-a/\">hot Tokyo CPI and industrial production</a> overnight raise the chance of a December hike, which is our base case, but only 45% priced in by markets.<br/> </p><h3><strong>EUR: Bar for more ECB easing is high</strong></h3><p>It’s abundantly clear that the ECB wants to keep things boring at this stage. Here are our ECB watcher Carsten Brzeski’s takes on yesterday’s <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/snaps/ecb-keeps-interest-rates-on-hold/\">statement</a> and <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/articles/ecb-presser-in-florence-oct25/\">press conference</a>. The only real highlight was the shift from a ‘balance of risk’ wording to a broader set of upside and downside risks to growth. Lagarde acknowledged some downside risks had eased, but didn’t give much weight to the shift in wording. Admittedly, eurozone growth was <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/snaps/eurozone-gdp-growth-slightly-better-than-expected-in-3q/\">better than expected in 3Q</a> (0.2% QoQ), largely due to surprisingly strong French numbers (0.5% QoQ).</p><p>The coming weeks will see Governing Council members offering their nuances to the policy-inflation-growth assessments. But don’t expect much. The ECB is clearly in a ‘good place’ at 2% and the bar for more easing remains high.</p><p>Anyway, EUR/USD remains entirely a function of dollar moves, and post-FOMC price action is leading to speculation of a potential break below 1.150. We don’t see the conditions for another big leg lower in the pair, though. Jobs data need to confirm Powell’s more cautious stance, and we doubt the bar is much higher for a Fed dovish repricing should US jobs deterioration continue. The contribution of the euro is small, but a slight improvement in the growth story and a firm ECB cannot harm. Our call remains bullish on EUR/USD into year-end.<br/> </p><h3><strong>GBP: A surprise Reeves resignation would be bad for markets</strong></h3><p>We published a <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/articles/uk-budget-four-scenarios-for-markets-as-gilt-yields-tumble/\">market guide to the UK Autumn Budget</a> yesterday, looking at four different scenarios and their impact on gilts and the pound. In our baseline scenario, Chancellor Rachel Reeves delivers a combination of tax hikes whilst avoiding the more inflationary measures. That has gradually been priced in by markets via some dovish BoE repricing, lower gilt yields and a weaker pound. Our post-budget EUR/GBP target is 0.880 on the back of that.</p><p>One source of risk for gilts and GBP, even before any clearer details on the Budget emerge, is from opposition calls on Reeves to resign following her admission of failing to obtain a required license to rent her home. The story slightly deflated yesterday as PM Starmer fully backed Reeves and a real estate agency took the blame for the error.</p><p>In July, when Reeves appeared close to leaving her post, gilt yields spiked. Markets are wary that a change in Chancellor could herald more relaxed fiscal rules and additional borrowing, at a time when gilt issuance remains elevated. A surprise resignation, which looks unlikely, would, in our view, cause elevated volatility in gilts and the pound.<br/> </p><h3><strong>CEE: Spike in rates should offset the effect of a stronger US dollar</strong></h3><p>Following yesterday’s regional GDP data, today brings the release of Poland’s October inflation figures, as always, the first inflation print from the CEE region. Our economists expect a slight increase from 2.9% to 3.0% YoY, in line with market expectations, while core inflation should remain unchanged at 3.2% YoY. Today's figure could decide whether the National Bank of Poland cuts rates again next week. We believe that it will take a break, but a surprise to the downside could push the decision back towards a rate cut.</p><p>Yesterday's GDP data in the Czech Republic and Hungary confirmed our bias and more divergence in economic performance in the region. While the Czech GDP surprised up, with a growth of 2.7% YoY, the Hungarian economy surprised down by 0.6% YoY, both roughly in line with our expectations. Although the market impact was almost invisible given the strong global story, in the longer term, this is clearly a story worth following.</p><p>Next week, we will see the meeting of the Czech National Bank, which will also publish a new forecast. Although headline inflation may give the impression that the central bank may be relaxed and may return to rate cuts one day, the economic data shows that the CNB needs to be cautious as we look ahead. The economy is growing at its fastest pace since the Covid rebound, and at the same time, wages are showing upside, which will keep core inflation higher. On the other hand, the Hungarian economy has confirmed its weak performance, and we believe that the market will push more dovish bets even though the NBH remains hawkish. This should gradually start to undermine the HUF in the medium term.</p><p>For now, the strong rate reaction in the CEE region to Wednesday's hawkish Fed should offset the impact of a stronger US dollar, and we expect EUR/HUF and EUR/CZK to stabilise at current levels, while PLN will follow inflation figures.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/strong-japanese-industrial-output-and-accelerating-inflation-raise-chances-of-december-rate-hike?post=532152\">Strong Japanese Industrial Output And Accelerating Inflation Raise Chances Of December Rate Hike </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/the-commodities-feed-opec-set-for-another-supply-increase?post=532122\">The Commodities Feed: OPEC+ Set For Another Supply Increase </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/rates-spark-eur-curve-wants-to-steepen-but-faces-resistance?post=532047\">Rates Spark: EUR Curve Wants To Steepen, But Faces Resistance </a><br/></div>",

Ripple token dropped to $2.46, down sharply from the year-to-date high. So, what next for the token as a death cross nears?<br/> </p><h3><strong>XRP Price Technical Analysis as a Death Cross nears</strong></h3><p>The daily timeframe chart shows that the Ripple price has remained under pressure in the past few months. It has plunged by over 30% from the year-to-date high, leading to a multi-billion-dollar wipeout. </p><p>Technicals suggest that the XRP price has more downside in the coming weeks. For one, it is about to form a death cross as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) near their crossover. Such a crossover would lead to more downside.</p><p>Its top oscillators, like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic Oscillator, have continued falling. The token has moved to the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. It also moved below the Supertrend indicator. </p><p>Therefore, the token will likely continue falling in the coming days as buyers remain in the sidelines. Such a crash may have it plunge to the psychological point at $2. </p><p>A drop below the support at $2 will point to more downside, potentially to the year-to-date low of $1.3826, its lowest level this month. </p><p>On the other hand, a move above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average at $2.6650 will invalidate the bearish XRP price forecast. <br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"XRP price\" height=\"399\" src=\"https://invezz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/XRP-Price-3-1024x584.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>XRP price chart | Source: TradingView</em><br/> </p><h3><strong>Why the Ripple Price is Falling</strong></h3><p>The XRP price has crashed as sentiment in the crypto industry worsened and a sense of fear among investors prevailed despite some notable macro news.</p><p>For example, the <a href=\"https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/29/fed-delivers-quarter-points-rate-cut-amid-data-uncertainty/\">Federal Reserve slashed interest rates</a><strong> </strong>by 0.25% on Wednesday. They brought the official cash rate to between 3.75% and 4%, citing the weak labor market. </p><p>The other notable macro news was the deal inked between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. The two leaders reached a deal that de-escalated the trade war. Indeed, <a href=\"https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/29/china-resumes-us-soybean-imports-as-trade-deal-nears-final-stage/\">China has already started buying soybeans</a> from the United States.</p><p>The XRP price also plunged after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave its go-ahead for the launch of top altcoin ETFs like Hedera (HBAR), Solana (SOL), and Litecoin (LTC).</p><p>This approval is bullish for the XRP price as it means that the SEC will greenlight the multiple ETFs in the coming weeks. These ETFs will likely have substantial inflows as evidenced by the recent XRPR ETF, which has gained over $115 million in assets in a month. The XXRP ETF has over $340 million in assets.</p><p>Still, despite all this, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has remained in the fear zone of 31. If the ongoing trend continues, the index will likely move to the extreme fear zone today. </p><p>The ongoing Ripple crash is happening because of the overall performance of the crypto industry. A closer look shows that Bitcoin and most altcoins have all plunged in the past few days.</p><p>XRP price has also dropped as the XRP Ledger network is struggling as the <a href=\"https://defillama.com/chain/xrpl\" target=\"_blank\">total value locked</a> (TVL) standing at just $86 million. Its burn rate has continued falling in the past few months.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/apples-china-sales-slump-36-despite-overall-quarterly-beat?post=532049\">Apple’s China Sales Slump 3.6% Despite Overall Quarterly Beat </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/us-digest-trump-refugee-cap-sparks-debate-openai-unveils-aardvark?post=532026\">U.S. Digest: Trump Refugee Cap Sparks Debate, OpenAI Unveils Aardvark</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/is-gm-stock-a-buy-at-its-ath-after-pivoting-away-from-evs?post=532009\">Is GM Stock A Buy At Its ATH After Pivoting Away From EVs? </a><br/></div>",

The yield of the benchmark 10-year note has rallied more than 30 basis points since Wednesday to hit three-week highs at 4.10%</li><li value=\"5\">The CME Group's FedWatch Tool shows that expectations for a further rate cut in December have dropped to a 64.8% chance from 91% ahead of Wednesday's monetary policy decision.<br/>\t </li></ul><h3><strong>Technical Analysis: EUR/USD hovers above a key support at 1.1540</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"EUR/USD Chart\" height=\"439\" src=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feditorial.fxsstatic.com%2Fmiscelaneous%2Fimage-1761897228609-1761897228610.png&amp;w=1536&amp;q=95\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>The <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/brokers/best-brokers-to-trade-eur-usd\">EUR/USD</a> has broken the monthly triangle pattern and the feeble recovery attempt seen after the ECB's monetary policy decision has been capped below a previous support area at 1.1580, confirming the pair's bearish bias. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) is low but still above oversold levels, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence reflects a strong negative momentum.</p><p>Bears are now focusing on the key support area around 1.1545 (October 9 and 14 lows). Below here, the 1.1500 round level is a plausible target ahead of the measured target of the triangle pattern at the 1.1450 area.</p><p>To the upside, the mentioned 1.1580 area – which held losses in October 22, 23, and 28 – is acting now as resistance. Further up, the reverse trendline, now around 1.1615, and Thursday's high near 1.1635 are likely to challenge bulls ahead of the October 28 and 29 highs in the area of 1.1670.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/gold-edges-higher-on-safe-haven-flows-remains-below-4050-amid-feds-hawkish-tilt?post=532053\">Gold Edges Higher On Safe-Haven Flows; Remains Below $4,050 Amid Fed's Hawkish Tilt </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/comcast-stock-tests-critical-support-two-level-trade-setup-emerges?post=532031\">Comcast Stock Tests Critical Support: Two-Level Trade Setup Emerges </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/wti-steadies-near-60-as-markets-digest-us-china-truce-rosneft-sanctions?post=531999\">WTI Steadies Near $60 As Markets Digest U.S.-China Truce, Rosneft Sanctions </a><br/></div>",

The December contract, of course, will offer pretty significant demand and perhaps even pricing pressures to the upside due to the fact that colder temperatures will drive up overall demand in places like Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Columbus.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Natural Gas Forecast 31/10: Winter Demand Heats Up (graph)\" height=\"392\" src=\"https://www.dailyforex.com/files/natgas-oct3125-chris.webp\" title=\"Natural Gas Forecast 31/10: Winter Demand Heats Up (graph)\" width=\"700\"/></p><h3><br/><strong>Cyclical Momentum</strong></h3><p>In this environment, every year I see an opportunity to start buying natural gas and simply hang on to it as we roll through the next couple of contracts. That being said, the massive gap that kicked off the rollover into December was about 45 cents, so a little bit of a pullback does make a certain amount of sense. We saw this during the previous month of November, as far as the futures contract is concerned, where we pulled back and then bounced.</p><p>I do think there is a certain amount of lackluster performance that will get bought into based on the idea of value. The $4 level is above, and it will offer a certain amount of psychological resistance as well as possibly option barriers. But I think it's only a matter of time before we break out to the upside. Natural gas, of course, does tend to have that cyclical trade, so for the next three months, I won’t short the market regardless. I don’t care what the setup is; I just do not short the market this time of year.</p><p>Now, once we roll into spring, I short it and I don’t buy it. It’s a pretty straightforward way to trade natural gas, and although the reality is it can do pretty much anything, overall, it’s a very cyclical market, and if you abide by those guardrails, it tends to help. We are entering that high season, so I fully anticipate that any pullback gets bought into with the idea of offering value.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/cadchf-forex-signal-launches-higher-into-resistance?post=531786\">CAD/CHF Forex Signal: Launches Higher Into Resistance</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/usdjpy-forecast-drops-against-yen?post=531318\">USD/JPY Forecast: Drops Against Yen</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/gbpusd-forecast-slips-below-200-day-ema-as-fed-takes-the-spotlight?post=531421\">GBP/USD Forecast: Slips Below 200-Day EMA As Fed Takes The Spotlight </a><br/></div>",

After testing 1.1600, price action is now turning its attention to October’s low at 1.1550. A subsequent break below this region would indicate that bears are in full force after the pair continues to move lower. The recent bullish divergence in the RSI is the key indicator of whether buying will pick up again, and 1.1660 would be the first hurdle to overcome.<br/> </p><h3><strong>XAUUSD hitting psychological barrier</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://cdn.orbex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/31092942/XAUUSD-chart-31.10.2025.png\"><img alt=\"• Gold chart shows price testing psychological resistance with support levels guiding the bullish push. \" height=\"403\" src=\"https://cdn.orbex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/31092942/XAUUSD-chart-31.10.2025.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p><br/>Gold received a slight boost in fortunes as prices tested the psychological resistance at 4000. The recent low at 3920, at the base of the latest bounce, is an important level to sustain the bullish thrust, as its break would have forced buyers to abandon ship.

A bounce off 24400 on the daily chart has put the bulls on the defensive, as 24100 has become a fresh resistance level. A further pullback could see a few more points shed off the index as the RSI remains in the neutral area. 24400 is the next target higher to see if there’s any chance of a turnaround, or if prices will become vulnerable to a deeper correction below 24000 in the medium-term.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/the-fed-raises-doubts-of-further-rate-cuts?post=531904\">The Fed Raises Doubts of Further Rate Cuts</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/technical-analysis-usdjpy-thursday-oct-30?post=531794\">Technical Analysis: USD/JPY - Thursday, Oct. 30</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/intraday-analysis-thursday-oct-30?post=531679\">Intraday Analysis - Thursday, Oct. 30</a><br/></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Mockup, Typewriter, Word, Money, Wall Street, Etf\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/06/11/19/51/mockup-5288033_960_720.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><small><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/images/id-5288033/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em></small><br/> </p><p>The highly anticipated Trump-Xi meeting in South Korea bore major fruit for the U.S. clean energy sector, with President Donald Trump claiming that both nations have signed a one-year agreement that will ensure uninterrupted rare earth and critical mineral supplies from China. The pact should come as a lifeline for American clean energy manufacturers reeling from months of raw material shortages and price spikes.</p><p>This deal, a major sign of de-escalation in the long-running trade war between the globe’s two largest economies, boosts the outlook for clean energy Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). By assuring supply-chain stability, this agreement should remove a major operational headache and reduce input price volatility for component manufacturers, thereby improving profit visibility across the renewables sector.</p><h3><br/><strong>America’s Reliance on Chinese Minerals</strong><br/> </h3><p>The global clean energy industry is acutely dependent on rare earth elements (REEs), a group of 17 minerals essential for high-performance magnets used in wind turbines, electric motors, and solar tracking systems. Across the globe, China enjoys a near monopoly on extracting REEs as well as on refining them, with the nation accounting for around 60% of global mining output and representing about 91% of global production, as of 2024 (as <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/commentaries/with-new-export-controls-on-critical-minerals-supply-concentration-risks-become-reality\">per a recent report released by the International Energy Agency</a>).</p><p>Therefore, like many other nations, the United States also relies heavily on China for its import of REEs. Evidently, China accounted for 70% of U.S. rare earth imports between 2020 and 2023 (as per <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/34301/us-rare-earth-imports/?srsltid=AfmBOoqFrD3YXTG5YPmR9LYF7wdV-5AtJA_rBM7dSO0QzQa4wc9axIbD\">Statista</a>).</p><p>This heavy dependence has recently caused distress for the U.S. clean energy industry, after China announced at the beginning of this month that it is increasing export controls on five rare-earth metals, in addition to the seven for which such controls were implemented in April this year.</p><p>Notably, amid the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, Beijing’s geopolitical leverage as a rare earth elements (REE) supplier has created significant uncertainty, contributing to the U.S. clean energy sector lagging behind its global peers.</p><p>On top of that, unfavorable government policies like accelerated phase-out of federal tax incentives for new projects and regulatory hurdles have already created an uncertain environment for the long-term growth prospects of the U.S. clean energy companies.</p><h3><br/><strong>What’s the Current Scenario?</strong><br/> </h3><p>U.S. President Trump enthusiastically mentioned his latest meeting with his Chinese counterpart as “amazing” and claimed the issue of rare earth mineral import from China to be “settled”. However, it is important to note that while China has agreed to delay the implementation of its latest round of rare earth export controls as part of the recent deal, its earlier restrictions on these critical minerals appear to remain in place.</p><p>To this end, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced that the nation would pause for one year export controls introduced on Oct. 9 (as <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/china-agrees-to-oneyear-rare-earth-export-deal-issue-settled-says-trump-4317851\">cited in a report of Investing.com</a>).</p><p>However, neither Chinese nor U.S. officials have mentioned the export restrictions introduced in April on seven rare earths. So, the general market consensus is that the earlier restrictions will remain in place.</p><p>Therefore, while the long-term prospects of the U.S. clean energy industry remain somewhat clouded by uncertainty surrounding earlier restrictions and the potential for new developments that could again complicate U.S.-China trade relations, the one-year rare earth agreement should restore confidence in the industry’s near-term growth opportunities.</p><h3><br/><strong>Clean Energy ETFs to Gain</strong><br/> </h3><p>Following the new trade agreement, clean energy ETFs may see renewed inflows as investors bet on a more resilient U.S. supply chain and improved sector profit margins.

The Bank of Japan may consider an earlier rate increase.</em></p><h3><br/><strong>Tokyo CPI inflation beat expectations in October</strong><br/> </h3><p>Tokyo CPI inflation increased 2.8% year-on-year in October (vs 2.5% in September, 2.4% market consensus). October is typically the month when companies adjust prices. A 0.6% month-on-month, seasonally adjusted, increase suggests businesses are raising final prices in response to input price hikes. Prices increased for both goods (0.9%) and services (0.4%), with notable gains in labour-intensive sectors like transport, communication, and entertainment.</p><p>The Bank of Japan views this as evidence that sustainable wage growth is driving prices higher. Meanwhile, food prices rose, but at a slower pace. Utilities prices jumped as government subsidies ended. We expect core CPI to remain around 2.5% by the end of this year, backed by solid wage growth.</p><p>The Takaichi government plans to fight inflation by reducing the gasoline tax and offering temporary discounts on winter power and gas bills. This may lower headline inflation early next year.</p><h3><br/><strong>Tokyo CPI rose stronger than expected in October</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://think.ing.com/uploads/charts/_w800/Japan_Tokyo_CPI_2025_October.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: CEIC</p><h3><br/><strong>Industrial output rebounded stronger than expected 2.2% MoM sa in September, for the first time in three months</strong><br/> </h3><p>Industrial production decreased by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter, primarily due to reductions in output related to US tariffs. Transportation equipment and iron/steel output declined in September, likely due to the lingering effects of US tariffs. Still, the recent easing of tariff tensions in several countries should support Japan's production rebound in the coming months. Semiconductor equipment sales rose for a second consecutive month, suggesting that strong global chip demand continued. Meanwhile, retail sales rebounded 0.3% MoM in September, but missed the market consensus of 0.8%.</p><p>Both IP and retail sales fell in Q3, indicating a GDP contraction for 3Q25.

In an even more aggressive move toward monetary easing, the FOMC also announced balance sheet reduction will end in December.</p><p>However, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell tried to keep the party from heating up too much by downplaying the possibility of another cut in December.</p><p>The FOMC voted 10-2 to cut rates. The federal funds rate now sits in a range between 3.75 and 4 percent.</p><p>As he did at the September meeting, Trump appointee Governor Stephen Miran cast a dissenting vote, indicating he wanted a half-percent cut. On the other side of the coin, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted NO, signaling that he opposed any cut at this time.  </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251029a.htm\" target=\"_blank\">official FOMC statement acknowledged</a>, “<em>Inflation has moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated</em>,” yet eased monetary policy anyway. The committee stated that “<em>downside risks to employment rose in recent months</em>.”</p><h3><br/><strong>Balance Sheet Reduction to End</strong><br/> </h3><p>Powell hinted that the central bank could end balance sheet reduction earlier in the month. The FOMC followed through, announcing an end to quantitative tightening as of December 1.</p><p>In practice, this means the central bank will stop reducing its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, maintaining the size of its balance sheet at the current level.</p><p>Balance sheet reduction, or quantitative tightening (QT), pulls liquidity out of the financial system by reducing bank reserves and shifting government debt financing to the private sector. This tightens funding conditions and market debt. It is effectively deflationary. Ending the balance sheet runoff will increase liquidity. It is also inflationary.</p><p>More significantly, an end to balance sheet reduction will take some pressure off the Treasury market, as the central bank would have to purchase new bonds as the old ones mature. In effect, this would create additional artificial demand in the Treasury market. This could help drive bond yields lower, allowing the federal government to borrow at lower rates, lowering its financing costs.</p><p>The Fed announced a balance sheet reduction plan in March 2022, when it could no longer convince everybody that price inflation was “transitory.” The plan wasn’t exactly ambitious, given the amount of inflation it created during the pandemic. If the Fed followed the blueprint (and it didn’t), it would take <strong>7.8 years</strong> for the Fed to shrink its balance sheet back to pre-pandemic levels. This doesn't even account for the trillions added in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>And of course, the central bank didn’t stick with the plan. The Fed slowed the pace of balance sheet reduction in May 2024, and now it’s over.</p><p>From its peak, the Fed ran around $2.4 trillion off the balance sheet. That sounds impressive, but it only represents about half of the increase during the pandemic alone.</p><h3><br/><strong>Chairman Powell’s Open Mouth Operations</strong><br/> </h3><p>Powell and Company filled up the punchbowl and cranked up the easy money party, but the Fed chair then tried to talk the giddy partygoers down by tempering expectations for a December rate cut.</p><p>That’s because the Fed just aggressively eased monetary policy despite <a href=\"https://www.moneymetals.com/news/2025/10/25/september-cpi-better-than-expected-doesnt-mean-good-004439\">persistent inflation</a>. In a sane world, the central bank would be holding rates higher to strangle inflation once and for all. It might even be hiking rates.</p><p>But we don’t live in a sane world.</p><p>We live in a world with a debt black hole and a bubble economy created by decades of easy money that can’t function in a modestly higher interest rate environment.</p><p>Powell knows this, so he has to at least talk like a central banker worried about inflation even as he’s cranking up the inflation machine.</p><p>Going into the October meeting, most analysts expected the Fed to cut both this month and then again in December. But Powell said we shouldn’t just assume there will be further easing in the final meeting of 2025.</p><blockquote><p>“In the committee’s discussions at this meeting, there were strongly differing views about how to proceed in December. A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it.”</p></blockquote><p>Powell also indicated that there is “<em>a growing chorus</em>” among the committee members to “<em>at least wait a cycle</em>” before cutting again.</p><p>Powell’s jawboning worked. Traders lowered the odds for a December cut from 90 percent to 67 percent after Powell’s post-meeting presser, and the stock market sank in disappointment.</p><p>But this is nothing but talk. Fed officials can say all kinds of things. It’s important to pay attention to what it does. What it did was cut rates and ease monetary policy in an inflationary environment. And the FOMC has no clue what it will do in December because it is effectively flying blind with the government shutdown limiting the release of data. When asked about December, Powell conceded, “<em>We just don’t know what we’re going to get. If there is a very high level of uncertainty, then that could be an argument in favor of caution about moving</em>.”</p><p>Powell also claimed, “<em>Inflation, away from tariffs, is actually not so far from our 2 percent goal.</em>”</p><p>But no matter how Powell tries to parse and spin the CPI data, inflation is already increasing, and this additional cut, coupled with an end to quantitative tightening, will accelerate that trend.</p><p>As of the end of June, the money supply had expanded by more than $600 billion since its low point in mid-2023.</p><p>As of September, <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL\" target=\"_blank\">the M2 money supply</a> stood at $22.2 trillion and is above the peak reached during the pandemic.</p><p>I can’t overstate this fact: <a href=\"https://www.moneymetals.com/news/2025/06/30/money-supply-expansion-this-is-inflation-004158\">this IS inflation</a>.</p><p>Rising consumer prices are just one symptom of monetary inflation. We also see it showing up in asset prices such as real estate and stocks. This is precisely why the stock market sold off when Powell started in on his hawkish messaging.</p><p>The reality is the Fed is in <a href=\"https://www.moneymetals.com/news/2025/01/12/trump-vs-powell-and-a-catch-22-003748\">a Catch-22</a>. It simultaneously needs to hold rates higher to deal with inflation and cut rates to try to keep the economy from being completely sucked into the debt black hole. Make no mistake, no matter what you hear coming out of the mouths of Fed officials, they’ve picked inflation.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/silver-gold-and-debt?post=531161\">Silver, Gold, And Debt </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/why-exactly-is-the-federal-reserve-cutting-rates?post=531104\">Why Exactly Is The Federal Reserve Cutting Rates? </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/indian-gold-demand-robust-in-september-despite-high-prices?post=530816\">Indian Gold Demand Robust In September Despite High Prices </a><br/></div>",

Clearly, the price action suggests that the market is not convinced that we will lose a significant amount of Russian oil supply. Yesterday’s meeting between President Trump and President Xi only served to strengthen this conviction, with Russian oil flows to China apparently not part of broader talks between the two leaders. This is important for the market given that China imports around 2m b/d of Russian oil. It’s the only buyer that could meaningfully increase its purchases if India reduced its imports of Russian crude.</p><p>On Sunday, OPEC+ is set to meet. It appears likely that the group will agree to another 137k b/d supply increase for December. The uncertainty surrounding sanctions on Russia also supports this increase. However, the move will only reinforce the bearish outlook for the market, adding to the substantial surplus expected through 2026. Obviously, this is assuming no supply shocks from Russia.</p><p>Middle distillate cracks remain well supported, with lingering uncertainty over the impact of sanctions on Russian diesel exports. The ICE gasoil crack is holding around $30/bbl, after a strong rally since mid-October. However, the latest data from Insights Global shows that gasoil inventories in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) region increased by 109kt WoW to 2.27mt, which saw its gap to the 5-year average widen. In Singapore, meanwhile, after a significant increase in middle distillate stocks the previous week, stocks declined by 6.25m barrels over the last week.</p><p>US natural gas Dec’25 futures rallied 3.7% yesterday, and the strength has continued in early morning trading today. The move higher comes despite US natural gas inventories rising by 74 bcf over the last week, in line with expectations, and above the 5-year average increase of 67 bcf. Instead, the market appears to be focused on forecasts for cooler weather, which should prove supportive of demand.</p><h3><br/><strong>Agriculture – China to buy 25mt of US soybeans annually</strong><br/> </h3><p>CBOT soybean futures extended their upward rally, with prices surging more than 1.9% at one stage yesterday. This was after President Donald Trump announced that China would immediately purchase large volumes of US soybeans. Later, the US administration said that China agreed to buy 12mt of soybeans between now and January, with a further commitment to purchase at least 25mt annually over the next three years. The announced purchases are largely in line with China's imports of US soybeans prior to the trade war. For reference, China imported around 22mt of US soybeans in 2024.</p><p>The latest fortnightly report from the Brazilian Sugarcane and Bioenergy Industry Association (UNICA) shows that sugarcane crushing in Central-South Brazil stood at 34mt over the first half of October, an increase of 0.3% year-on-year. Sugar output over this period rose 1.25% YoY to 2.48mt. Meanwhile, the sugar mix in CS Brazil over the fortnight was 48.2%, up from 47.3% a year ago. This is despite prices suggesting that mills should favour a stronger ethanol mix. The cumulative cane crush so far this season still lags last year, down 2.8% to stand at 525mt, while cumulative sugar production totals 36mt, up 0.9% YoY.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/rates-spark-eur-curve-wants-to-steepen-but-faces-resistance?post=532047\">Rates Spark: EUR Curve Wants To Steepen, But Faces Resistance </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/florence-press-conference-confirms-ecb-remains-comfortable-in-its-good-place?post=531988\">Florence Press Conference Confirms ECB Remains Comfortable In Its ‘Good Place’ </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/german-october-inflation-marks-start-of-more-disinflation-to-come?post=531970\">German October Inflation Marks Start Of More Disinflation To Come </a><br/></div>",

The pair moves little following the release of China’s NBS Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data. It is important to note that any shift in China’s economic conditions could also affect the Australian dollar (AUD), given the close trade ties between China and Australia.</p><p>China’s NBS Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index dropped sharply to 49.0 in October, following 49.8 recorded in September. The reading came in above the expected 49.6 figure in the reported month. Meanwhile, the NBS Non-Manufacturing PMI unexpectedly rose slightly to 50.1 against the previous and the market consensus of 50.0 readings.</p><p>The AUD/USD pair faced challenges as the Australian Dollar (AUD) struggled amid market sentiment that remained subdued following the meeting between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, which offered few positive surprises. President Trump announced that tariffs on China would be reduced to 47% from the current 57% and confirmed that the rare earth dispute had been resolved, removing restrictions on China’s rare earth exports. However, Trump acknowledged that not all matters were addressed during the talks.</p><p>The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.75%–4% in a 10–2 vote. The decision was not unanimous, as Fed Governor Stephen Miran supported a larger 50-basis-point cut, while Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted to keep rates unchanged.</p><p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the available data indicate little change in the outlook for employment and inflation since the September meeting. Powell added that another rate cut in December is far from certain, emphasizing that the path forward remains uncertain, which provided support for the US Dollar (USD).</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/eurjpy-price-forecast-trades-near-record-highs-above-17800-as-bullish-bias-persists?post=531758\">EUR/JPY Price Forecast: Trades Near Record Highs Above 178.00 As Bullish Bias Persists </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/australian-dollar-holds-gains-as-trump-announces-to-cut-tariffs-on-china?post=531664\">Australian Dollar Holds Gains As Trump Announces To Cut Tariffs On China </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/usdcad-price-forecast-holds-losses-below-13950-lower-rectangle-boundary?post=531305\">USD/CAD Price Forecast: Holds Losses Below 1.3950, Lower Rectangle Boundary </a><br/></div>",

The commodity, however, lacks follow-through buying and remains below the $4,050 level amid mixed fundamental cues.</p><p>The growing market concerns that a prolonged US government shutdown would impact the economic performance keep a lid on the post-FOMC US Dollar (USD) rise to the highest level since early August and weigh on investors' sentiment. This, in turn, is seen as a key factor acting as a tailwind for the safe-haven Gold. However, the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) hawkish tilt holds back the XAU/USD bulls from placing aggressive bets.</p><p>The US central bank lowered its benchmark overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3.75%-4% and said it would stop reducing the size of its balance sheet as soon as December, marking the end of its quantitative tightening program. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that a further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. This, in turn, favors the USD bulls and caps the non-yielding yellow metal.</p><p>Apart from this, the latest optimism led by a de-escalation of trade tensions between the US and China – the world's two largest economies – contributes to keeping a lid on the Gold price. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through buying before confirming that the recent sharp corrective decline from the all-time peak, touched earlier this month, has run its course and positioning for any meaningful near-term appreciating move.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/comcast-stock-tests-critical-support-two-level-trade-setup-emerges?post=532031\">Comcast Stock Tests Critical Support: Two-Level Trade Setup Emerges </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/wti-steadies-near-60-as-markets-digest-us-china-truce-rosneft-sanctions?post=531999\">WTI Steadies Near $60 As Markets Digest U.S.-China Truce, Rosneft Sanctions </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/gold-steadies-as-fed-caution-tempers-rate-cut-hopes-trump-xi-truce-lifts-sentiment?post=531896\">Gold Steadies As Fed Caution Tempers Rate-Cut Hopes, Trump-Xi Truce Lifts Sentiment </a><br/></div>",

This milestone highlights an incomplete short-term Elliott Wave structure. A clear five-wave impulse cycle continues to advance from the October 11, 2025 low. Wave 1 completed at 608.31. It gave way to wave 2, which dipped to 590.08. The 30-minute chart clearly shows this correction. From there, the ETF surged higher into wave 3.</p><p>Within wave 3, wave ((i)) peaked at 612.80. A brief wave ((ii)) followed and ended at 599.74. Price then accelerated upward in wave ((iii)), reaching 638.18. Wave ((iv)) corrected modestly to 625.61. One final push remains in wave ((v)). It should finish wave 3. After that, wave 4 will pull back. The ETF then resumes its climb in wave 5. This leg completes the full cycle from October 11.</p><p>The key pivot at 590.08 stays intact. Any dip should hold support in a 3-, 7-, or 11-swing area. Upside momentum resumes above this level. The upside target derives from the 123.6%–161.8% inverse Fibonacci extension of wave ((iv)). This projects a zone of 640.80–645.50. Once wave 5 tops, a more significant correction follows. For now, price action favors higher levels, so the path of least resistance stays upward as long as 590.08 holds.</p><h3><br/><strong>QQQ Latest 30-Minutes Elliott Wave Chart From 10.29.2025</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://elliottwave-forecast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/QQQ-1H20251030185830.jpg\"><img alt=\"QQQ Elliott Wave Chart\" height=\"979\" src=\"https://elliottwave-forecast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/QQQ-1H20251030185830.jpg\" title=\"QQQ Short Term Elliott Wave View: Bullish Formation Not Yet Complete\" width=\"750\"/></a></p><h3><br/><strong>QQQ Elliott Wave Video:</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\">Video Length: 00:04:28</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hSrlOgeAsTw?si=qhxfeOPXSS87xaOz\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/apple-progressing-in-wave-5-to-new-all-time-high-as-nested-pattern?post=531552\">Apple Progressing In Wave ((5)) To New All-Time High As Nested Pattern</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/aizs-17-year-bullish-cycle-attract-buyers-from-blue-box?post=530839\">AIZ’s 17-Year Bullish Cycle Attract Buyers From Blue Box</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/marriott-international-elliott-wave-analysis-strong-bullish-outlook-ahead?post=529450\">Marriott International Elliott Wave Analysis: Strong Bullish Outlook Ahead</a><br/></div>",

This followed the Federal Reserve's quarter-point interest rate cut. However, the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 indices declined after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stated that there is still a heated discussion about whether to follow up today's rate cut with another. Powell added, \"A further rate cut at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion, quite the opposite. Monetary policy is not on a preset course.\"</p><h3><br/><strong>Future of US Interest Rates</strong><br/> </h3><p>In this regard, the Federal Reserve's decision on US interest rates has sparked opposition from both sides, with one side calling for further rate cuts and the other advocating for keeping rates higher. President Trump, who has repeatedly called for faster U.S. interest rate cuts, again criticized Powell ahead of Wednesday's decision, saying the administration would be \"very happy\" to see his term end.</p><p>Trump spoke from South Korea, where both sides said they were close to finalizing a trade deal—marking progress after months of thorny talks over a $350 billion investment pledged by Seoul to the US. In this context, the US President is scheduled to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea tomorrow, and investors hope this meeting will pave the way for NVIDIA to regain access to the Chinese market.</p><p>Meanwhile, across stock trading company platforms, NVIDIA's stock jumped, making it the first company to reach a market capitalization of $5 trillion. Booming sales of the company's flagship AI chip were crucial to this surge.</p><p>Overall, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments about the December rate-setting meeting—which will be held in six weeks—went far beyond the usual disavowal that Fed decisions are not on a preset course. Instead, his comments revealed a broader discomfort among at least some of his colleagues with the unrealistic investor expectation that a December rate cut is guaranteed. Powell said: \"It may be time for some Committee members to step back a little and see if there are actually downside risks to the labor market.\" Powell added that this week's meeting revealed a \"growing chorus\" of policymakers who are asking: \"Maybe we need to wait a while.\"<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" id=\"tradingview_5ff9c\" lang=\"en\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://s.tradingview.com/dailyforexcom/widgetembed/?hideideas=1&amp;overrides=%7B%7D&amp;enabled_features=%5B%5D&amp;disabled_features=%5B%5D&amp;locale=en#%7B%22symbol%22%3A%22FX_IDC%3AEURUSD%22%2C%22frameElementId%22%3A%22tradingview_5ff9c%22%2C%22interval%22%3A%2215%22%2C%22allow_symbol_change%22%3A%221%22%2C%22save_image%22%3A%221%22%2C%22studies%22%3A%22%5B%5D%22%2C%22theme%22%3A%22Light%22%2C%22style%22%3A%221%22%2C%22timezone%22%3A%22Etc%2FUTC%22%2C%22studies_overrides%22%3A%22%7B%7D%22%2C%22utm_source%22%3A%22www.dailyforex.com%22%2C%22utm_medium%22%3A%22widget_new%22%2C%22utm_campaign%22%3A%22chart%22%2C%22utm_term%22%3A%22FX_IDC%3AEURUSD%22%2C%22page-uri%22%3A%22www.dailyforex.com%2Fforex-technical-analysis%2F2025%2F10%2Feurusd-analysis-30-october-2025%2F236318%22%7D\" title=\"advanced chart TradingView widget\" width=\"750\"></iframe></p><p><br/>In the past, Powell has tried to deflect questions about upcoming policy decisions by refocusing attention on the policy actions at that particular meeting.</p><h3><br/><strong>Technical Analysis for the EUR/USD Pair</strong><br/> </h3><p>Based on the daily chart trading, the EUR/USD bears have gained momentum to push the currency prices lower. This is confirmed by the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) being stable around a reading of 47, below the neutral line, and having more time to head toward stronger downward levels before reaching oversold territory. In the same performance, the MACD indicator is steadily leaning downwards. The bears' focus is directed towards the support levels of 1.1590 and 1.1480 first.</p><p>The current downward bias for EUR/USD is anticipating important events, led by the announcement of the European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy decisions at 16:15 Cairo time, followed by statements from ECB Governor Lagarde half an hour after the bank's decision is announced. Before that, the German economic growth reading will be announced at 12:00 PM Cairo time, and the Eurozone economic growth reading will be announced at 1:00 PM Cairo time. On the US side, no important data releases are expected today.</p><p>Conversely, as we mentioned before, the success of the EUR/USD bull scenario remains contingent on a return to the 1.1800 resistance level. Otherwise, the downward trend will continue until further notice.</p><h3><br/><strong>Trading Advice:</strong><br/> </h3><p>We still advise selling the EUR/USD pair on any strong upward retracement, but never take unnecessary risks.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/eurusd-analysis-price-seeking-positive-momentum?post=530732\">EUR/USD Analysis: Price Seeking Positive Momentum</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/eurusd-analysis-selling-pressure-may-persist-pending-us-inflation-figures?post=530013\">EUR/USD Analysis: Selling Pressure May Persist Pending US Inflation Figures</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/eurusd-analysis-price-correction-in-an-important-zone?post=529591\">EUR/USD Analysis: Price Correction In An Important Zone</a><br/></div>",

The complexity of estimating Dutch pension reform flows doesn't help the case for a steeper 10s30s. In the US, Treasuries are trading heavily in post-FOMC, and look like they can attempt to continue to do so.</em></p><h3><br/><strong>Higher 10Y euro swap rates through steeper curves</strong><br/> </h3><p>With hard data confirming eurozone growth is on a recovery trajectory, we think 10-year euro swap rates should start considering a push higher. Additionally, inflation came in hotter, bringing the 10-year inflation swap a tick closer to the 2% target again. We acknowledge that the upside potential for euro rates remains limited this year, and we target a 10-year rate of some 10 basis points above the current 2.65%. With growth on track to improve further in 2026, that’s when we aim for the 10Y to look at 3% as the new equilibrium.</p><p>For the front end, the wiggle room is much more limited as the ECB’s mantra of being “in a good place” is set on repeat. That means that the 2Y swap rate is firmly anchored between 2.1% and 2.2%. The rise in longer-dated yields must therefore come from steeper curves. That steepening faces resistance from the US, however, where 10Y UST yields dove from 4.5% to 4.0% over the past months. As 10-year US rates stabilise, or even rise as we predict, the 2s10s of the euro curve should feel more comfortable steepening.</p><h3><br/><strong>Dutch pension reforms too complex to push for steeper 10s30s by itself</strong><br/> </h3><p>Besides US spillovers, we have flattening pressures from the very long-end to deal with, whereby the 10s30s steepener seems to have come to a halt. The 10s30s dynamics this year have been almost entirely dictated by the US, but Dutch pension reforms may also play a role. Whilst we still anticipate significant unwinds of 30Y becomes and bonds starting in January, we feel the trade may have become too crowded over the summer.</p><p>Estimating the timing and size of the flows stemming from the pension reforms is extremely complex, if not impossible, given the available data. Each fund of the 30 scheduled to transition on 1 January 2026 has a unique maturity profile and hedging strategy. Additionally, we remain concerned that IT problems could result in last-minute delays. And now that the US macro landscape is less supportive of 10s30s steepeners, we understand that the trade has become less attractive from a risk-reward perspective.</p><h3><br/><strong>US Treasuries continue to trade heavily post-FOMC</strong><br/> </h3><p>As the dust settles following Wednesday's Federal Open Market Committee outcome, the new levels for the 2-year and 10-year combo are 3.6% and 4.1%, respectively (both up 10 basis points). The net feeling centres on a Fed Chair that has no problem leaving the funds rate unchanged at the December meeting, if that is deemed the thing to do. It comes with residual comfort in the economy. The fact that a 4.3% unemployment rate was specifically referenced as \"low\" amplifies this point. Instead, there is a degree of discomfort with inflation running at 3%, and likely heading higher.</p><p>At the same time, there has not been a material change in the ultimate landing level for the funds rate. It's now slightly above 3%, but still within the 3% range. And the 5yr rate continues to trade below the straight line that can be drawn between the 2yr and 10yr rates in a steady fashion. This signals an unwavering expectation that the Fed is, in fact, far from done — it's just a matter of timing. The question now is how robust (or not) the economy manages to be in the next month or so<strong>. </strong>Yields may continue to push higher—particularly for longer maturities—despite the current pause. However, the lack of hard data remains a challenge due to the ongoing government shutdown. It is an opportunity for the 10yr yield to have a go at testing higher. It might not go too far, but there is a data vacuum that can be filled in, at least until we gain more clarity.</p><h3><br/><strong>Friday's events and market views</strong><br/> </h3><p>We start with eurozone inflation numbers. The headline French CPI number is expected to come in at just 0.9% year-on-year, a tick below the 1.1% from September. Italian inflation is also expected to nudge lower, from 1.8% YoY to 1.6%. This would then help the eurozone aggregate core CPI down from 2.4% YoY to 2.3%. Due to the US government shutdown, we only expect the Market News International (MNI) Chicago PMI to stand out as notable data.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/florence-press-conference-confirms-ecb-remains-comfortable-in-its-good-place?post=531988\">Florence Press Conference Confirms ECB Remains Comfortable In Its ‘Good Place’ </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/german-october-inflation-marks-start-of-more-disinflation-to-come?post=531970\">German October Inflation Marks Start Of More Disinflation To Come </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/eurozone-gdp-growth-slightly-better-than-expected?post=531891\">Eurozone GDP Growth Slightly Better Than Expected </a><br/></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Gold, Ingots, Treasure, Bullion, Gold Bars, Wealth\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/11/01/22/33/gold-513062_960_720.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><small><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/photos/gold-ingots-treasure-bullion-513062/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em></small><br/> </p><p>After the close of trading last Thursday, Newmont Mining (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/NEM\">NEM</a>), the first senior gold producer to report quarterly financial results, released its results for Q3-2025. As expected, given the high average gold price and gold/oil ratio during the quarter, the results were extremely good and included record-high quarterly cash-flow. The company earned US$1.71/share during the quarter, which is US$6.84/share annualised. This means that despite this year’s large gain in its share price, NEM is being valued by the stock market at only about 12-times trailing earnings. We expect that it will be a similar story for most senior and mid-tier gold producers.</p><p>Further to comments in our lithium discussion earlier in today’s report, the fact that earnings are high and P/E ratios are low in the gold mining sector does not preclude the possibility that a long-term price top is forming. On the contrary, in the commodity realm, financial results and valuations tend to be most inviting near the ends of bull markets. However, the signs that normally are seen near the end of a gold-mining bull market are not currently evident. Before we get to that, the long-term underperformance of gold mining stocks relative to gold bullion is worth a brief revisit.</p><p>The main reason that gold mining stocks, as a group, underperform gold bullion over the long-term is that just as monetary inflation and the associated interest-rate manipulation promote malinvestment in the broad economy, they do the same in the gold mining sector. The difference is that booms in the gold mining sector generally coincide with busts in the broad economy, and vice versa.</p><p>As an aside, don’t be misled by the performances of equity indices such as the SPX into thinking that the US economy is in the boom phase of the economic cycle. Due to the domination of passive investing, the performance of the stock market now has very little to do with the performance of the broad economy. In the US economy over the past few years there have been booms in a small number of sectors, chief among them being AI and the related infrastructure, but the economy as a whole has been in the bust phase. Busts usually, but not always, culminate in a recession, with a surge in monetary inflation associated with the official response to the recession sowing the seeds of the next boom.</p><p>In the gold mining sector, the malinvestment that eventually stems from a boom involves ill-conceived acquisitions and project developments, the costs of which get written-off years later during the bust phase. The result is wealth destruction over the long-term.</p><p>A point we want to make today is that at this stage of the gold sector’s boom there are no signs of widespread malinvestment. On the contrary, NEM and other large-scale gold producers still appear to be more focussed on cost reduction and cash-flow maximisation than on growth, especially ‘growth at any price’. This suggests to us that the end of the boom phase is not imminent.</p><p>The end of the boom is not imminent, but the intermediate-term upward trend that began late last year is almost certainly over.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/commodities-and-the-ai-bubble?post=529542\">Commodities And The AI Bubble </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-recession-not-yet-but-possibly-soon?post=526949\">US Recession: Not Yet, But Possibly Soon </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/the-us-dollars-long-term-cycle?post=522214\">The US Dollar’s Long-Term Cycle </a><br/></div>",

People are losing jobs.</p><p>And it’s not just in the USA, but it’s happening almost everywhere. For the first time in decades, the lines that usually move together have split apart. Sales and profits are booming. But the job market? It’s softening.</p><p>Over the past three years, global corporations have hit record highs in revenue and stock prices, even while cutting staff. Big firms are selling more, earning more, and hiring less. The same story plays out in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.</p><p>The reason isn’t a mystery. Technology now lets companies do more with fewer people. Automation, AI, smarter logistics, better software, it’s all reducing the need for human labor. And for the first time, it’s not just factories feeling it. White-collar work is on the line too.</p><p>Four in ten CEOs say they’ll replace workers with AI within the next two years. Seven in ten believe AI will reshape their business entirely. That’s why re-skilling programs are popping up everywhere, with people trying to learn how to work with AI before it replaces them.</p><p>But here’s the twist. Most companies using AI aren’t seeing a profit from it yet. One MIT study found that 95% of them still haven’t earned back what they invested. Small businesses that rushed to replace people with AI now say they regret it. Only the biggest firms, the ones with pricing power, data, and capital, are really benefitting.</p><p>Look at global stock markets. The big caps, Apple (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/aapl\">AAPL</a>), Microsoft (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/msft\">MSFT</a>), Nvidia (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/nvda\">NVDA</a>), Samsung, are flying. Smaller companies? Stuck. That’s not productivity. That’s concentration.</p><p>So yes, something big is shifting. But maybe not the way everyone thinks. This “AI boom” isn’t yet about efficiency. It’s about belief, belief that machines will save costs and boost profits, even if the numbers don’t show it yet.</p><p>AI isn’t replacing people yet. It’s replacing belief in people. And that might be the real risk.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/if-taiwan-falls-so-does-ai?post=531260\">If Taiwan Falls, So Does AI</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/from-free-to-play-to-pay-to-regulate-europes-next-tech-mistake?post=527807\">From Free-To-Play To Pay-To-Regulate: Europe’s Next Tech Mistake </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/from-80-games-to-5b-hits-inside-gamings-turbulent-transformation-in-may-2025?post=495756\">From $80 Games to $5B Hits: Inside Gaming’s Turbulent Transformation in May 2025</a></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Entrepreneur, Idea, Competence, Vision, Target\" height=\"354\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/04/20/08/21/entrepreneur-1340649_960_720.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/photos/entrepreneur-idea-competence-vision-1340649/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em></p><p><br/>The latest CPI report coupled with the stagnant jobs market essentially gave the FOMC license to continue its rate cutting cycle this week, and fed funds futures now give highest odds for three more 25-bp cuts over the next 12 months. Historically, rate cuts give an outsized boost to growth over value stocks. But this time might be a bit different given the lengthy stretch of outperformance of growth over value and large over small caps, driven by the Big Tech juggernauts, as investors have anticipated a more accommodative Fed for a long time. After several sporadic attempts, could the market finally be ready for sustained market rotation? Let’s explore.</p><p>Interest rate cuts provide a favorable backdrop for stocks in general, by stimulating business and consumer borrowing and encouraging investment in risk assets. While growth stocks are more advantaged by interest rate cuts through valuation (i.e., a falling discount rate on long-duration cash flows), value stocks are more advantaged through fundamentals (i.e., lower borrowing costs and rising consumer demand) because they are often capital intensive and/or cyclical.</p><p>To be sure, even with “higher for longer” interest rates, investors have been quite willing to pay up for all that Big Tech has to offer as they ride strong secular growth trends (i.e., little cyclicality) in disruptive innovation that create rising sales growth, margins, operating leverage, cash flow, ROIC, insider buying—at levels no other sector can match. With little to no concern about the level of interest rates, these cash-flush juggernauts have wasted no time in their race for supremacy in new technologies like AI, quantum computing, robotics, automation, cloud computing, cybersecurity, 3D printing, fintech, precision medicine, genomics, space exploration, and blockchain.</p><p>This has driven the major cap-weighted indexes to lofty heights, with 10 companies in the $1 trillion market cap club. And this week, Microsoft (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/MSFT\">MSFT</a>) and Apple (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AAPL\">AAPL</a>) joined NVIDIA (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/NVDA\">NVDA</a>) in the exclusive $4 trillion market cap club, while NVIDIA just surged past the $5 trillion mark!</p><p>From the April 7th lows, retail investors flipped from tariff panic to FOMO/YOLO/momentum, and the rest of the investor world jumped onboard. Besides Big Tech, speculative “meme” stocks also have been hot, and AQR’s Quality-minus-Junk factor (aka “quality margin”) has been shrinking. Moreover, small caps have been participating, as evidenced by the Russell 2000 Small-cap Index (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/IWM\">IWM</a>) and the Russell Microcap Index (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/IWC\">IWC</a>) both setting new all-time highs in October (for the first time since 2021), which is a historically bullish signal. Similarly, value stocks also have perked up, with the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Pure Value ETF (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/RPV\">RPV</a>) and S&amp;P 500 Value (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/SPYV\">SPYV</a>) also reaching new highs.</p><p>However, while retail investors have continued to invest aggressively, institutional investors and hedge funds (the so-called “smart money”) have grown more defensive. So, maintaining a disciplined approach—such as focusing on fundamental analysis, long-term trends, and clear investment goals—can protect against emotional kneejerk reactions during murky or turbulent periods.</p><p>Stock valuations are dependent upon expectations for economic growth, corporate earnings, and interest rates, tempered by the volatility/uncertainty of each—which manifests in the equity risk premium (ERP, i.e., earnings yield minus the risk-free rate) and the market P/E multiple. Some commentators suggest that every 25-bp reduction in interest rates allows for another 1-point increase in the P/E multiple of the S&amp;P 500. But regardless, the expected rate cuts over the next several months might already be baked into the current market multiple for the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 such that further gains for the broad indexes might be tied solely to earnings growth—driven by both revenue growth and margin expansion (from productivity and efficiency gains and cost cutting)—rather than multiple expansion.</p><p>As such, although near-term market action might remain risk-on into year end, led by growth stocks, the case for value stocks today might be framed as countercyclical, mean reversion, portfolio diversification, and market broadening/rotation into the neglected large, mid, and small caps, many of which display a solid earnings history and growth trajectory as well as low volatility and less downside risk. Value investors can avoid paying the Tech-growth premium. And given their more modest valuations, they also might have greater room for multiple expansion.</p><p>So, perhaps the time is ripe to add value stocks as a portfolio diversifier, such as the <strong>Sabrient Forward Looking Value Portfolio (FLV 13)</strong>, which is offered annually as a unit investment trust by First Trust Portfolios—<em>and remains in primary market only until November 14th</em>.</p><p>In addition, small caps tend to benefit most from lower rates and deregulation, and high-dividend payers become more appealing as bond alternatives as interest rates fall, so Sabrient’s quarterly <strong>Small Cap Growth </strong>and <strong>Dividend</strong> portfolios also might be timely as beneficiaries of a broadening market—in addition to our all-seasons <strong>Baker’s Dozen</strong> growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) portfolio, which always includes a diverse group of 13 high-potential stocks, including a number of under-the-radar names identified by our models.</p><p>Let me discuss three key drivers that might make the heretofore sporadic attempts at market rotation into value and smaller caps more sustainable:</p><p><br/><strong>1. Mean reversion on relative valuation:</strong></p><p>While major indexes like the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/SPY\">SPY</a>) and Nasdaq 100 (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/QQQ\">QQQ</a>) have soared on the backs of those mega-cap, Big-Tech, secular-growth juggernauts, the broader market is trading at far more reasonable valuations. Witness this YTD chart of the cap-weight SPY versus S&amp;P 500 Growth (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/SPYG\">SPYG</a>), Russell 2000 Small Cap (IWM), S&amp;P 500 Pure Value (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/RPV\">RPV</a>), and equal-weight S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/RSP\">RSP</a>). Despite some short spurts of convergence attempts (as circled), most recently the divergence has reached its widest of the year.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.sabrientsystems.com/sites/default/files/Value-Growth-and-Small-Large_perform-comparison-chart.jpg\"/></p><p><br/>In addition to the performance divergence, relative valuations (large vs. small, growth vs. value, and the Tech sector vs. all others) have become quite stretched, and there have been intermittent signs of a nascent broadening market and rotation from the mega-cap dominators into other large, mid, and small caps, value stocks, and lagging sectors. The table below compares forward P/E, expected next-12-months (NTM) earnings growth rate, and forward PEG (P/E divided by earnings growth rate) for various market-segment proxy ETFs, listed in descending order of P/E:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Valuation comparisons\" src=\"https://www.sabrientsystems.com/sites/default/files/Value-Growth-and-Small-Large_valuation-comparison-table.jpg\"/></p><p>According to DataTrek Research, <em>“S&amp;P 500 valuations have reached levels that cannot be justified solely by reasonable expected earnings growth in 2026/2027.Structural profitability must improve as well.Current Street estimates imply a 13.7% net profit margin in 2026, substantially better than Q2 2021’s peak of 13.0%.”</em></p><p>The “Buffett Indicator,” which measures the ratio of Total Market Capitalization to GDP, is rated “significantly overvalued” at an all-time high of 225%, having risen 60 pps since the April lows. The S&amp;P 500 trailing 12-month P/E is around 26x, and the Shiller cyclically adjusted P/E ratio (CAPE), based on trailing 10-year earnings, is now at 40x and officially back to dot-com era levels (which peaked at 44x). However, P/E and CAPE (cyclically adjusted P/E) can be misleading due to the differences in business models, capital intensity, growth rates, and sector concentrations within the S&amp;P 500 throughout the past decades. But price-to-sales (P/S) is less so—and the S&amp;P 500 is selling at nearly 3.5x P/S, which is double the median of the past 25 years of 1.7x.</p><p>Of course, other factors are at play for any valuation metric in determining a “fair” value, such as the level of interest rates that inform the appropriate discount rate on future sales, earnings, and cash flow—and interest rates are falling. And then of course, today’s Tech companies are more fundamentally sound, profitable, cash-flush, and sporting higher return ratios than during the dot-com era. And the index overall reflects more secular growth and less cyclicality—especially when compared to the industrial conglomerates and oil companies that previously held the largest market caps as recently as 2013, when Exxon Mobil was still competing with Apple for the top spot. As DataTrek Research has opined, the continued appeal of US large caps <em>“is grounded in the idea that current earnings power, interest rates, and long-term earnings growth are all highly predictable and will remain so for the foreseeable future.”</em></p><p>Nevertheless, the relative valuation divergences cannot be ignored. Many smaller value names have been neglected during this AI-driven growth boom, with the spread between top-decile growth and bottom-decile value stocks near an historic high, which historically has led to a mean-reversion <em>market rotation</em> and broadening into those lagging segments to narrow the valuation spread (with the broad market indexes continuing to climb higher), rather than a stock market crash from a <em>capital rotation</em> into bonds and cash.</p><p>Lastly, value has historically outperformed after previous periods of high concentration in a handful of stocks, as relative valuations normalize. For example, the Nifty Fifty in the early 1970s, the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, and the FAANG-driven rallies of 2018–2021 all saw a subsequent multi-year outperformance of value over growth.</p><p><br/><strong>2. Diversification of portfolios that have become heavily tilted to growth:</strong></p><p>Value stocks in this market provide a number of diversification benefits. Sectors like Consumer Staples, Energy, Financials, and Healthcare provide more defensive positioning for investors wary of market volatility and the lofty valuations of growth stocks. Value stocks are less exposed to earnings disappointments, particularly given the lofty expectations for earnings and margin growth already priced into most of the leading growth stocks—especially those with the AI tailwind, as the massive capital investments have a lot of future profits yet to prove out.</p><p>One goal of the Fed’s rate cuts is to stimulate borrowing, spending, and investment, leading to broader economic activity, which would tend to help cyclical and value sectors—such as Industrials, Materials, and Financials—which typically benefit when the economy picks up.</p><p>If we have a climate of moderate real GDP growth (say, 2-3%) and broader earnings improvement (beyond the mega-caps), value stocks and smaller caps should benefit from widening participation. Also, value companies typically generate strong current cash flow and pay dividends, making them more resilient if the Fed decides to hold rates steady and liquidity growth is constrained. They offer lower duration risk, less downside/drawdown if the market experiences multiple compression, and thus valuable diversification benefits.</p><p><br/><strong>3. Sticky inflation can benefit real assets and cyclical/value sectors:</strong></p><p>I believe inflation will moderate further due to the many global disinflationary secular trends like aging demographics, ongoing globalization (despite some strategic onshoring and supply chain diversification), deregulation, technological disruption, automation, and rising productivity. However, maintaining somewhat elevated inflation (closer to 3% than 2%) may well be a tactic to help reduce our massive federal debt—as part of a 3-prong approach along with strong economic growth and reduced (or at least stable) federal spending.</p><p>Elevated inflation and interest rates along with strong real GDP growth would likely conspire to boost real asset prices, which would benefit cyclical and value sectors, particularly Energy, Real Estate, and Materials. Energy and commodity producers also benefit from geopolitical tension, supply constraints, and decarbonization bottlenecks. In the Financials sector, banks and insurance companies can see margin expansion when yield curves steepen. And Industrials and Utilities benefit from infrastructure upgrades, factory onshoring, capex cycles, and construction of AI datacenters and new power plants (as power generation demand rises).</p><p>So, value investing aligns with reflation of <em>real</em> assets (as opposed to <em>financial</em> assets), which might persist throughout this decade. In any case, diversification across sectors, industries, market caps, and value versus growth can help manage risk while still capturing growth opportunities.</p><p><br/><strong>Summary:</strong></p><p>Today, we have a growing economy with modest inflation, robust corporate earnings and rising forward guidance, falling interest rates and substantial liquidity from an increasingly accommodative Federal Reserve, tight credit spreads, and low volatility in both stocks and bonds/interest rates—resulting in an ultra-low ERP and a historically high market P/E multiple. The case for value stocks rests on the historic valuation divergences (for growth vs. value, large vs. small caps, and Tech vs. all other sectors), as well as macro shifts, historical mean reversion, and diversification for heavily growth-tilted portfolios. While the headline valuation multiples of the broad cap-weight indexes look stretched—some might say “priced for perfection”—value is one of the segments in which forward returns still look attractive.</p><p>A disciplined value investing strategy might emphasize:</p><ul><li>Equal-weight or fundamental index funds rather than cap-weight benchmarks</li><li>Sector-specific tilts toward Energy, Financials, Industrials, Consumer Staples, and selected Materials</li><li>Quality/value screens to identify strong balance sheets, free cash flow, and dividends</li><li>Small- and mid-cap allocations, where the valuation divergence is widest </li></ul><p>Indeed, rather than the pricey cap-weighted indexes dominated by Big Tech, investors may be better served in today’s market by active stock selection that seeks under-the-radar and undervalued gems primed for explosive growth. This is what Sabrient aims to do in our various Growth, Value, Dividend, and Small Cap portfolios, all of which provide exposure to growth, value, quality, and size factors and to both secular and cyclical growth.</p><p>In selecting our <strong>Baker’s Dozen, Forward Looking Value, Dividend, and Small Cap Growth</strong> portfolios, Sabrient’s multifactor models and selection process prioritize fundamental quality, which is a timeless characteristic to which even the most speculative market always (eventually) reverts. In addition, our cash-flow and balance-sheet oriented Earnings Quality Rank (EQR) is a key factor used in all our internal models and is also licensed to the <strong>First Trust Long-Short ETF (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/FTLS\">FTLS</a>)</strong> as a quality prescreen.</p><p>As always, I welcome your thoughts on this article.

For example, the S&amp;P 500’s current yield is only ~1.2%.</p><p>High-yield stocks can be particularly beneficial in supplementing income after retirement. A $120,000 investment in stocks with an average dividend yield of 5% creates an average of <strong>$500 a month in dividends</strong>.</p><p>Next on our list of <a href=\"https://www.suredividend.com/high-dividend-stocks/\">high-dividend stocks</a> to review is PermRock Royalty Trust (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/PRT\">PRT</a>).</p><h3><br/><strong>Business Overview</strong></h3><p>PermRock Royalty Trust (PRT) is a trust established in November 2017 by Boaz Energy, a company specializing in the acquisition, development, and operation of oil and natural gas assets in the Permian Basin. The trust generates all its cash flow from the net profits of oil and gas sales from its properties and distributes dividends monthly. PRT trades with a market capitalization of $49 million and went public in May 2018.</p><p>The trust’s properties consist of long-life reserves in mature, conventional oil fields, featuring shallow, predictable decline rates. Production can be enhanced through water-flooding techniques, and new reserves may be identified in the future. The Permian Basin, spanning West Texas and southeastern New Mexico, is the most prolific oil-producing region in the U.S., historically yielding over 30 billion barrels of oil and more than 75 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"355\" src=\"https://www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PRT-Overview-e1621974526727.jpg\" width=\"600\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.permrock.com/\">Investor Relations</a></p><p><br/>On March 31, 2025, Boaz Energy sold the oil and gas properties underlying the trust to T2S Permian Acquisition II LLC. For the second quarter ending June 30, 2025, PRT reported net profits of $1.55 million, slightly below $1.66 million in the prior year period. The average realized oil price fell 16% year-over-year, while natural gas rose 8.7%. Distributable income totaled $1.20 million, down 11% from $1.35 million in the prior year, equating to $0.10 per unit versus $0.11 previously. Cash reserves remained at $1 million, unchanged from June 30, 2024, and year-to-date distributions totaled $0.3105 per unit.</p><h3><br/><strong>Growth Prospects</strong></h3><p>PermRock Royalty Trust has faced declining production volumes since 2019, despite higher average realized oil and gas prices in 2021 and 2022. Production declined again in 2023 and 2024, reflecting the mature nature of the trust’s assets. The new owner, T2S, plans to drill one injector and one producer well in Crane County, Texas, in 2025, which could help stabilize output.</p><p>Management believes production can also be modestly increased through expanded water-flooding operations and additional well drilling, though overall growth remains limited by the properties’ maturity.</p><p>Future earnings and distributable income are highly sensitive to oil and natural gas prices, making precise forecasts challenging. Commodity price swings have historically driven volatility, such as the 2020 oil collapse and the 2022 surge amid global supply disruptions.</p><p>Assuming stable market conditions, we estimate distributable income per unit could grow roughly 6% annually through 2030, primarily driven by higher oil prices rather than significant production gains. This underscores the trust’s ability to leverage commodity cycles rather than pursue operational expansion.</p><h3><br/><strong>Competitive Advantages &amp; Recession Performance</strong></h3><p>PermRock Royalty Trust benefits from its ownership of long-life reserves in the Permian Basin, one of the most prolific oil-producing regions in the U.S. Its assets have shallow, predictable decline rates, and production can be enhanced through water-flooding and selective drilling.</p><p>As a royalty trust, PermRock has minimal operating expenses and does not incur exploration or development costs, allowing it to pass most of its profits directly to shareholders as monthly dividends. This structure provides a streamlined, cash-focused way to gain exposure to oil and gas production.</p><p>However, the trust is highly sensitive to commodity price fluctuations, making it vulnerable during economic downturns. For example, the dividend was suspended for five months in 2020 amid the COVID-19-driven oil glut. Conversely, during periods of rising oil prices, PermRock can deliver outsized returns and high dividend yields, often outperforming integrated energy companies. Its performance is therefore closely tied to macroeconomic and geopolitical factors that affect the oil and gas markets.</p><h3><br/><strong>Dividend Analysis</strong></h3><p>PermRock Royalty Trust pays a variable monthly dividend based on its underlying net profits. The trust is expected to distribute $0.38 per share for 2025, yielding 9.7%. While this yield is attractive, dividends can fluctuate significantly with oil prices. During the oil market collapse of 2019–2020, PermRock suspended its dividend for five consecutive months.</p><p>The trust is highly sensitive to oil prices, offering greater upside than integrated oil companies when prices rise, as seen in the post-pandemic recovery that allowed dividend growth to resume. This makes PermRock suitable for investors confident in higher future oil prices who want exposure to the Permian Basin.</p><p>However, this leverage also carries risk: in a downturn, losses are amplified. Although PermRock’s assets are located in the prolific Permian Basin, an oil royalty trust may not be the most efficient way to benefit from production growth. Investors may achieve better risk-adjusted exposure through traditional oil and gas producers or midstream companies. The 2020 dividend suspension underscores the volatility inherent in oil and gas royalty trusts.</p><h3><br/><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p>PermRock Royalty Trust has faced several challenges in recent years, including weak oil prices and the demand collapse caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The trust operates in the U.S.’s most prolific oil-producing region and offers an exceptionally high dividend yield, supported by modest growth prospects.</p><p>While we do not anticipate a near-term downturn in the energy sector, the trust’s heavy reliance on oil prices and non-diversified business model makes it risky for concentrated investment. As a pure upstream player, it is inherently exposed to commodity price volatility, and its relatively short track record limits confidence in long-term dividend stability and consistency.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/high-dividend-50-golub-capital-bdc-inc?post=531808\">High Dividend 50: Golub Capital BDC, Inc.</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/10-of-the-right-retirement-stocks-for-income-investors?post=531175\">10 Of The Right Retirement Stocks For Income Investors</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/real-estate--reits/3-top-retirement-stocks-for-income?post=531102\">3 Top Retirement Stocks For Income </a><br/></div>",

I wrote a piece a few months ago about <a href=\"https://kyla.substack.com/p/gen-z-and-the-end-of-predictable\">“Gen Z and the End of Predictable Progress”</a> but it really should have been titled <em>“Why The Economic Ladder Has Completely Changed For Everyone Due to Policy Choices”.</em></p><p>One driver of our changing economy <em>is</em> demographics. We talk about it in generational terms because that makes it easier, but it’s impacting <em>everyone</em>. The population is aging, and policy increasingly favors some of the elderly (don’t forget 43% of boomers have no retirement savings) over the young.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.livenowfox.com/news/lawmakers-several-states-pursuing-property-tax-reform-measures\">Across the country</a>, states are slashing property taxes, which is the source of 70% of local revenue. Florida, which already has no income tax, wants to get rid of property taxes entirely. Illinois wants to exempt homeowners who’ve lived in their houses 30+ years. It’s unclear where replacement revenue to keep these economies going for our future would come from - or whether voters even care.</p><p>A lot of young people are very worried. The WSJ put it neatly: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/old-young-economic-divide-7a5203f0?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqffYfJvERtEjeGGxQOLzszd3d5kJPtPapG_JsrYhfNQcJV_X0nNFa_c8u67mo4%3D&amp;gaa_ts=690152aa&amp;gaa_sig=GyFyTbVcxAaxyeFzC4YuKCvjPqx8SL_XmolidSG-rsPTsq8_bvvQhvZsShdlXMkD0uELuL7v90nwpPGIRrBkrg%3D%3D\">The Economy That’s Great for Parents, Lousy for Their Grown-Up Kids</a>, highlighting how a generation that came of age during zero rates and rising asset prices is now facing a ladder that’s missing several rungs. Young people - and their parents - don’t believe that upward mobility will be there for them.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TALW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6fa4584-8cac-424d-8132-a082a3e0e55a_1088x668.png\" title=\"\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>According to the <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market#--:explore:unemployment\">New York Fed’s Labor Market for Recent College Graduates</a> tracker, unemployment for new college graduates up 30% since the pandemic versus 18% for all <a href=\"https://www.siliconcontinent.com/p/the-ai-becker-problem\">workers</a> - the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/us-economy-analysis-wealthy-low-income-8ba80ccc?mod=article_inline\">highest level in a decade</a>, outside of the pandemic unemployment spike.</p><p>And that’s part of the reason that people are turning to the stock market - <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/stock-market-working-class-investors-1f915b4b\">over half of Americans</a> who make below $80k a year have taxable investment accounts, with half of those investors entering the market within the last five years. People are trying to create their own financial foundation. Markets feel more stable than institutions.</p><p>And that ties into the financialization of everything. In <em>industrial</em> capitalism, firms existed to produce and expand. Carnegie and Ford (for all their flaws) understood the ecosystem: workers were also consumers, so paying them well was good business.</p><p>But now… we don’t seem to think of it that way.

Automation erases the “training ground” work that once created experts. When machines do the junior tasks, no one learns the senior ones. Apprenticeship collapses.

They cite “unemployment, increased student loan repayment, and slower real wage growth” as the primary headwinds. The whole call was essentially like “yeah, it’s not our burritos, it’s the economy”. Kraft Heinz <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/khc\">KHC</a> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-29/kraft-heinz-sees-weaker-us-sales-ahead-of-planned-split\">stated</a> in their earnings call that “we now have one of the worst consumer sentiments we have seen in decades” (which might reflect GLP1s more than anything).</p><p>But it isn’t the burritos. We do have a K-shaped economy<a href=\"https://kyla.substack.com/p/how-bible-sales-and-chipotle-explain#footnote-7-177527193\" target=\"_self\">7</a> - the top keeps rising as the bottom falls. That means that the really wealthy (<a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/story/2025/09/17/top-10-of-earners-make-up-half-of-us-retail-spending\">the top 10% driving 50% of spending</a>, for example) are doing quite well. Their <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/credit-card-consumers-charts-a4ce81e5?mod=e2tw\">credit-card</a> spending and travel budgets have surged alongside stock and home-equity gains (they are celebrating the new 100% tax write-off by <a href=\"https://x.com/FirstSquawk/status/1982980942928195665\">buying private jets</a>).</p><p>For everyone else, the economy has become something to believe in rather than participate in, a system that promises meaning through motion. That’s the real mood of the economy right now - <em>everything</em> is a trade. Money, work, meaning, even faith.</p><p>Bible sales are up roughly 40% since the pandemic, but c<a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/642548/church-attendance-declined-religious-groups.aspx\">hurch attendance is down to 30% from 42% two decades ago</a> and 38% ten years ago. It’s aesthetic in a way - aesthetic spirituality, aesthetic politics, Baudrillard and Debord would have a blast.</p><p>When belief itself becomes transactional, risk stops feeling like a financial concept and starts feeling like a moral one. People don’t just gamble with money anymore; they gamble with time, attention, identity - anything that might yield security or a sense of control. The markets are only the macro version of that instinct.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"328\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9rRW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F045d38ca-c9cf-4b39-99b4-7c96aee2a119_1611x881.jpeg\" width=\"600\"/></p><p><br/>That’s why the economy feels both booming and brittle at once: we have extraordinary wealth concentration coupled with mass participation in markets. Wealthy households and large firms transfer risk through diversification, hedging, political insulation (like <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/10/26/37-white-house-ballroom-donors-funding-300-million-build-tech-ceos-trump/\">donating to a ballroom</a> maybe). Everyone else absorbs risk through gig work, debt, market exposure, and health costs. It is the logical outcome of labor precarity + 401(k)ification + income volatility. Risk always rolls downhill, but lately it looks like belief too.</p><p>The fixes for some of this aren’t complicated (it’s ideas that many have been talking about for a long time). Create portable benefit pools that follow workers between gigs. Build a public infrastructure corps that provides an employment floor. We have examples as to what works, like Singapore’s sovereign wealth model, Germany’s apprenticeship programs, and Denmark’s flexicurity system.</p><p>The goal is probably to not ban the casino but rather to build something slower beside it. Every speculative boom eventually exhausts its own attention span. Markets will always trade. The invisible hand will keep dealing.

Wynne and Lillian Derr, both work in the Fed’s Research Department. And although the report explicitly notes: “The views expressed are those of the authors and should not be attributed to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas or the Federal Reserve System,” the chart they provide is telling.</p><p>I’ll let the authors set it up for you:</p><p><em>Artificial intelligence (AI), like many technologies before it, offers the potential to improve people’s living standards. Such advances can be approximated by changes in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita over time—the rate of change in the amount of output per person.</em></p><p><em>Chart 1 shows GDP per capita from 1870 to 2024 along with scenarios, some of them extreme, depicting what could happen to living standards between now and 2050.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Turn Your Images On\" src=\"https://banyanhill.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Daily_Disruptor/images/2025/10/103025_DD_SS1.png\"/></p><p>In layman’s terms, this chart shows what the authors call a “singularity-level” productivity path. It’s an exponential curve where output per worker accelerates far beyond the historic norm.</p><p>And it’s proof that even the most cautious economists are beginning to imagine a future where growth accelerates beyond anything we’ve ever seen before.</p><h2><br/>FROM 1.9% TO INFINITY</h2><p>Since 1950, U.S. labor productivity has grown at roughly 1.9% per year.</p><p>At that pace, living standards double about every 36 years.</p><p>The Fed’s “normal AI” scenario assumes a modest improvement similar to the bump we saw after personal computers took off in the 1990s.</p><p>But its extreme scenario tells another story.</p><p>In that model, AI triggers what the authors call a “technological singularity.”</p><p><em>Technological singularity refers to a scenario in which AI eventually surpasses human intelligence, leading to rapid and unpredictable changes to the economy and society. Under a benign version of this scenario, machines get smarter at a rapidly increasing rate, eventually gaining the ability to produce everything, leading to a world in which the fundamental economic problem, scarcity, is solved. Under this scenario, the future could look something like the (hypothetical) red line in Chart 1.</em></p><p>As you can see on the chart, in this scenario growth isn’t gradual. It’s exponential.</p><p>This is the first time I’ve seen a Federal Reserve publication openly modeling a world that looks anything like the Coasean Singularity we talked about yesterday…</p><p>The idea that transaction costs, the invisible frictions that make companies necessary, could eventually fall toward zero.</p><p>And it shows you how mainstream the idea of a technological singularity has become.</p><p>But what’s with that line falling off the graph when the singularity happens?</p><p><em>Under a less benign version of this scenario, machine intelligence overtakes human intelligence at some finite point in the near future, the machines become malevolent, and this eventually leads to human extinction. This is a recurring theme in science fiction, but scientists working in the field take it seriously enough to call for guidelines for AI development. Under this scenario, the future could look something like the (hypothetical) purple line in Chart 1.</em></p><p>In other words, that’s the <em>Terminator</em> scenario.</p><p>And even though that scenario is highly unlikely to happen, the Fed isn’t dismissing the possibility that AI could reshape the economy in ways we can’t yet measure.</p><h2><br/>HERE’S MY TAKE</h2><p>The Dallas Fed is simply acknowledging what we’ve been talking about for over a year.</p><p>AI is no longer a sideshow in the economy. It’s the main event.</p><p>The authors note that neither of these singularity paths is likely to happen in the next 25 years:</p><blockquote><p><em>Today there is little empirical evidence that would prompt us to put much weight on either of these extreme scenarios (although economists have explored the implications of each). A more reasonable scenario might be one in which AI boosts annual productivity growth by 0.3 percentage points for the next decade. This is at the low end of a range of estimates produced by economists at Goldman Sachs. Under this scenario, we are looking at a difference in GDP per capita in 2050 of only a few thousand dollars, which is not trivial but not earth shattering either. This scenario is illustrated with the green line in Chart 1.</em></p></blockquote><p>Instead, they predict a small but not insignificant annual productivity growth of 0.3 percentage points over the next decade.</p><p>But that might be too small of a prediction.</p><p>Compounding machine productivity demands new infrastructure. Not just data centers and payment rails, but the energy and network infrastructure that will power this new world.</p><p>And as each new AI model outpaces the one before it, the timeline between innovation and impact collapses.</p><p>My big takeaway?
