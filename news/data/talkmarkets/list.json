On the right, WSJ dutifully tells us that Nvidia (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/NVDA\">NVDA</a>) recently surged past a $5 trillion market capitalization, the first public company to do so. Other AI-related stocks like Broadcom (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AVGO\">AVGO</a>), Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AMD\">AMD</a>), and Micron Technology (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/MU\">MU</a>) have also powered higher in recent months.</p><p>And on the exact same day, the paper ran a story about a new wave of white-collar layoffs. Could one story have something to do with the other?</p><p>The WSJ‘s coverage about the troubles in the job market isn’t wrong. The labor market is looming over everything like a giant specter waiting to eat who it may. The hiring rate, or number of new jobs added as a percentage of total employment, is at the lowest level it has been in 15 years.</p><p>To put it into further perspective, the rate of monthly job creation last summer averaged 89,000. This past summer, it fell to just 29,000. We haven’t seen numbers this bad since 2010 after the Great Recession hit. And it’s hard not to get at least a little scared when you see such a decline.</p><p>The Federal Reserve, for its part, felt that conditions in the labor market were bad enough to warrant another quarter-point cut, which Jay Powell announced this week. Economists and average Joes alike have been wondering for years now when the next recession will hit. But these numbers make me think we’re already in one, just in a jobs-specific way.</p><h3><br/><strong>The U.S. Jobs Situation Isn’t Pretty... (But)</strong></h3><p>Outside of certain markets like my hometown areas of Greenville and Spartanburg, South Carolina – the subject of a future article – the U.S. is experiencing only modest hiring and a growing number of job cuts.</p><p>Take Amazon (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AMZN\">AMZN</a>), which announced plans this week to lay off 30,000 corporate employees in the days and months ahead. The tech giant says it wants to slim down and conserve cash. But really, it could be because AI is able to fill more roles than ever before. Regardless of the reason, this culling will amount to around 10% of Amazon’s workforce – its largest reduction since 2022, when it eliminated around 27,000 positions.</p><p>Last month, Starbucks (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/SBUX\">SBUX</a>) announced its own corporate cuts: 900 across the U.S. and Canada. Plus, it will be closing about 1% of its stores.</p><p>We also have to remember how many businesses avoided hiring over the summer months as they awaited clarity on Trump’s trade policy. They do seem to be growing more confident now, with private payroll processor ADP reporting Tuesday that employment increased a weekly average of 14,250 in the four-week stretch ending Oct. 11. So that’s a clear positive.</p><p>However, it’s still in the face of:</p><ol><li>The federal government shedding over 200,000 jobs this year due to efficiency efforts.</li><li>The ongoing government shutdown, which has left around 1.4 million federal employees on unpaid leave or working without pay. And who knows how much longer that’s going to last.</li></ol><p>That’s why the Fed’s decision to lower interest rates by another quarter point is so welcome. It’s now down to between 3.75% and 4%, which should help lower financing costs on business loans, credit-card debt, car loans, and home equity lines of credit. And that should spur greater economic spending, which will create more jobs.</p><p>It will take time to do so. We might not see truly brighter days until this year is over. But it will happen nonetheless. In the meantime, while we wait for a healthier America to manifest itself, there are many real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that should benefit much more quickly.</p><h3><br/><strong>These REITs Love Rate Cuts</strong></h3><p>While the SPDR S&amp;P 500 Fund (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/SPY\">SPY</a>) soared around 17.5% year-to-date, hitting new highs in the process, shares of REITs have lagged, up a mere 0.7%.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://files.widemoatresearch.com/WM/main/2025/10/30121857/Screenshot-2025-10-30-at-12.05.37%E2%80%AFPM.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://files.widemoatresearch.com/WM/main/2025/10/30121857/Screenshot-2025-10-30-at-12.05.37%E2%80%AFPM.png\" width=\"540\"/></a></p><p><em>Source: Yahoo Finance</em></p><p><br/>Yet as REITs report their third-quarter results, the consensus so far is that demand outstrips supply (in most property sectors), giving them plenty of opportunity to grow. That’s why, even in the middle of this dreary season of lackluster investor reception, I’m very much bullish.</p><p>For example, REITs such as Agree Realty (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/ADC\">ADC</a>), Digital Realty (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/DLR\">DLR</a>), and Prologis (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/PLD\">PLD</a>) all increased their future outlook in recent weeks.</p><p>Net-lease operator Agree, for its part, raised its adjusted funds from operations per share projections to between $4.31 and $4.33. That would be 4.4% year-over-year growth. And it also boosted acquisition volume expectations to between $1.5 billion and $1.65 billion.</p><p>Data-center giant Digital Realty, meanwhile – which had previously expected 7.1% full-year funds from operations (“FFO”) growth – says it should hit 9.4%. For the quarter, it recorded impressive 8% leasing spreads, up from an already noteworthy 7.3% in the second quarter.</p><p>Then there’s warehouse provider Prologis, which raised its core FFO guidance to between $5.78 and $5.81, a 4.4% growth rate from 2024. Also, quarterly occupancy rose to 95.3%, a 20 basis-point increase.</p><p>Now, one REIT that reported negative expectations so far is life-science landlord Alexandria Real Estate (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/ARE\">ARE</a>). It not only missed earnings by $0.09, but it revised its 2026 guidance from between $9.16 and $9.36 to between $8.98 and $9.04. The company bases these projections on a 100 basis-point reduction in generally accepted accounting principles same-store net operating income, amounting to a 3.7% contraction.</p><p>I plan to put together a deep-dive research report on Alexandria, which I’ll publish next week. And I’ll be discussing the larger life-science sector with fellow Wide Moat Research analyst Nick Ward next week at The Wide Moat Show on YouTube.</p><p>It’s not all scary out there, but I want you to be as well-informed as possible. So make sure not to miss these upcoming analyses.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://files.widemoatresearch.com/WM/main/2025/10/30121927/Screenshot-2025-10-30-at-12.05.50%E2%80%AFPM.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://files.widemoatresearch.com/WM/main/2025/10/30121927/Screenshot-2025-10-30-at-12.05.50%E2%80%AFPM.png\" width=\"540\"/></a></p><p><em>Source: iREIT® + HOYA</em></p><h3><br/><strong>REIT Tricks and Treats</strong></h3><p>Overall, the REIT earnings season appears to be in good shape. And I suspect, now that interest rates have dropped again, we’ll see even more guidance increases as the quarterly reports continue.</p><p>With a possible recession looming, we’re less excited with the softer lodging sector, which generally underperforms in downturns. And weaker retail landlords with properties in less affluent markets will likely take a hit as well.</p><p>Also, I’m watching the apartment sector closely, where several REITs have already lowered expectations due to weakening rents. I still expect these apartment landlords to improve based on the demand outlook in 2026 and improved cost of capital. However, I’m very well aware there are outliers here we want to stay away from.</p><p>Overall, I would focus on REITs that generate superior growth, and sectors like data centers and industrial warehouses that benefit from the AI boom. I also like the more dominant net-lease REITs like Realty Income (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/O\">O</a>), Agree Realty, and VICI Properties (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/VICI\">VICI</a>).</p><p>REIT investing shouldn’t be that scary, even when interest rates are high and especially if you pay close attention to fundamentals. That’s a topic <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSKnr8kJ0LZPP_U61vueodQ\">we've recently discussed</a>.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Ipad, Online, Tablet, Internet, Screen, Digital\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/08/01/17/56/ipad-407799_960_720.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/photos/ipad-online-tablet-internet-screen-407799/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em></p><h3><br/><strong>Market Brief</strong> – <strong>Fed Cuts &amp; Mega Earnings</strong></h3><p>This week, the Federal Reserve acted as expected, cutting its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday to a target range of 3.75% to 4.00%. Alongside the cut, the Fed announced a halt to its balance sheet runoff, effectively ending quantitative tightening (QT). Both moves were significant shifts away from policy restraint toward support, the subject of this week’s newsletter.</p><p>While the rate cut was widely expected, off-the-run labor data have shown signs of softening, particularly in the small business side of the economy. Typically, such slides often act as a pre-recessionary indicator, suggesting the Fed’s actions are likely pre-emptive in nature.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"ADP Jobs Data\" height=\"293\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-7.png\" width=\"670\"/></p><p><br/>While Inflation data remains above the Fed’s target, recent softness gives the Fed room to pivot. For the market, the end of QT came as liquidity conditions in the Treasury and repo markets began to tighten, with funding stress building. The Fed appears to have acted preemptively, choosing to preserve market function and prevent another 2019-style disruption.</p><p>Markets responded negatively to the news, with equities selling off and bond yields rising. However, this was mainly the result of a<em> “buy the rumor, sell the news” </em>outcome as both stocks and bonds had rallied strongly heading into the meeting. Part of the selloff was also due to the removal of the certainty of a December rate cut.</p><p>Lastly, Mega-cap earnings added to the week’s focus. Five of the largest market-cap companies reported Q3 results:</p><ul><li><em><strong>Apple (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AAPL\">AAPL</a>)</strong> posted strong results, with revenue up 10% year-over-year and earnings per share rising to $1.57. Services revenue hit a new record.</em></li><li><em><strong>Amazon (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AMZN\">AMZN</a>)</strong> beat expectations on AWS growth and issued solid Q4 guidance, projecting $206 billion to $ 213 billion in revenue.</em></li><li><em><strong>Meta (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/META\">META</a>)</strong> delivered 26% year-over-year revenue growth, but profit fell due to a $1.6 billion one-time tax charge and higher costs. The stock declined post-report.</em></li><li><em><strong>Microsoft (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/MSFT\">MSFT</a>)</strong> showed strong demand in its cloud segment, but growth was steady rather than accelerating.</em></li><li><em><strong>Alphabet (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GOOG\">GOOG</a>)</strong> beat on topline revenue but missed slightly on cloud margins, which pressured the stock.</em></li></ul><p><br/>Earnings season overall remains positive. According to FactSet, nearly 85% of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten EPS estimates, as shown. The blended year-over-year earnings growth rate for Q3 sits at 10.7%, with revenue growth at 7.9%. While growth is down from peak levels, it remains healthy by historical standards. That backdrop remains supportive of equities heading into year-end, particularly as corporate share buybacks of $6-7 billion daily will resume in November.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Percentage of the market beating earnings estimates.\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-8.png\"/></p><p>The combination of a Fed pivot and decent earnings remains supportive of asset prices currently. Still, the durability of the rally will depend on how the economy and inflation trend into year-end.</p><h3><br/><strong>Technical Backdrop</strong> – <strong>Breadth Tumbles</strong></h3><p>The S&amp;P 500 closed the week at 6,840 after making an all-time high on Tuesday. The breakout above the previous highs, following a successful test of the 50-day moving average (DMA), confirmed the continuation of the bullish trend. That move also reaffirmed support at key levels, particularly the running bullish trend line and the 20-DMA. The index remains above both the 50- and 200-day moving averages, both of which are trending higher, also supporting the bullish backdrop. Momentum has shifted positively, with the MACD triggering a fresh buy signal; however, there are concerns worth noting.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Market Trading Update\" height=\"529\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-13-1024x774.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Breakouts to new highs typically draw in momentum buyers, yet this time has been different. Relative strength remains in a negative divergence to the S&amp;P 500, and overall market breadth remains concerning. As shown, over the last week, the percentage of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index trading above their respective 50-, 75-, and 150-day moving averages has fallen sharply. Only 62.6% of S&amp;P 500 components are trading above their 200-day moving average. That is a sharp decline from earlier this year and signals that fewer names are driving the rally. As price moves higher, participation narrows—a sign of fragility. The advance-decline line has also failed to confirm the new highs, flashing a classic divergence. Volume has been lighter on up days, adding to concerns about conviction.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Stocks trading above moving averages.\" height=\"354\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G4loAs4WMAAs5cX?format=jpg&amp;name=medium\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Technically, this backdrop is bullish, but not strong. Breadth weakness, momentum divergence, and low-volume rallies suggest that the foundation beneath the breakout is thin. Price is moving higher, but without broad participation, the move becomes more vulnerable to sharp reversals.</p><p><strong>Support and Resistance Levels:</strong></p><ul><li><em><strong>Resistance</strong>: ~6,850–6,900 (top of rising trend channel)</em></li><li><em><strong>First Support</strong>: ~6,740 (20-day moving average)</em></li><li><em><strong>Second Support</strong>: ~6,650 (50-day moving average)</em></li><li><em><strong>Crucial Support</strong>: ~6,100–6,200 (structural breakout level and 200-day moving averag</em>e)</li></ul><p>In this environment, investors should manage equity exposure with discipline. Participate in the trend, but stay alert. Without a broader base of participation, this rally could struggle to sustain momentum. If earnings and economic data don’t confirm price action, the risk of reversal will grow. Trim extended positions, tighten stops, and stay tactical.</p><h3><br/><strong>Key Catalysts Next Week</strong></h3><p>The week ahead will be a critical test for the recent rally in equities. With the Federal Reserve having shifted policy and major macroeconomic data releases disrupted by the ongoing federal shutdown, market focus now turns to corporate earnings and the few economic indicators still scheduled for release.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Kay catalysts \" height=\"463\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-9-1024x677.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>With the mega-cap tech earnings cycle behind us and economic data flow restricted, the spotlight shifts to the next tier of corporate results and private-sector indicators. Earnings from Uber and Disney will provide critical insights into consumer behavior, while Qualcomm and Palantir offer valuable information on business investment and government technology demand.</p><p>Furthermore, the ISM Manufacturing and Services reports will be closely watched, as they are among the few reliable macroeconomic signals this week. These surveys can influence sentiment on inflation trends, demand strength, and pricing pressure, all key inputs for market expectations around the Fed’s next moves.</p><p>With valuations stretched and participation narrow, the bar for positive surprises is high. Strong reports could reinforce bullish momentum, but any signs of weakness or cautionary forward guidance could quickly undermine confidence.</p><p>Trade accordingly.</p><h3><br/><strong>Need Help With Your Investing Strategy?</strong></h3><p>Are you looking for comprehensive financial, insurance, and estate planning services? Need a risk-managed portfolio management strategy to grow and protect your savings? Whatever your needs are, we are here to help.</p><h3><br/><strong>Fed QT Ends</strong></h3><p>On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve delivered a 25 basis-point rate cut and ended quantitative tightening. The funds rate now sits between 3.75% and 4.00%. The balance sheet runoff, which had drained over $1.2 trillion in liquidity since June 2022, has officially stopped. That marked a clear pivot from policy restraint to policy accommodation.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Bank reserves, market and Fed balance sheet\" height=\"449\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-168.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>The move was unsurprising, as the markets had anticipated it since the beginning of the<em> “tapering”</em> in 2022. With each FOMC meeting, the markets rallied in hopes that the Federal Reserve would cut rates further and eventually, while not yet, return to <em>“QE.”</em> The initial reduction in the Fed’s <em>“QT”</em> early was the first step, and now the end of QT entirely puts the Fed much closer to the market’s aspirations.</p><p>However, investors should ask an obvious question. With the market pushing all-time highs, valuations stretched, credit spreads tight, and jobless claims remaining very low, why provide accommodation now?</p><p>The answer lies beneath the surface.</p><p>Fed officials had grown increasingly concerned about reserve scarcity. The rapid pace of QT and a heavy Treasury issuance calendar increased the risk of a collateral shortage. Repo rates spiked in mid-October. SOFR crept above the fed funds target. Market-based stress measures suggested a potential breakdown in overnight funding conditions. The plumbing was cracking, even as asset prices looked strong. This was the same environment we had seen in the summer of 2019, although not yet to the same level of concern.</p><p>The combination of reserves and reverse repos is now at its lowest level since 2020, resulting in a creeping increase in the SOFR rate. This aligns with the Fed’s long-standing plan to end the balance sheet drawdown once the level of reserves hits current levels. <strong>The Fed also wants to shift to a Treasury-only balance sheet</strong>. This is a crucial point, as it means that while the Fed will no longer reduce its Treasury holdings, it will continue to allow mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to roll off. For the Treasury market, the Fed will buy the same amount of new Treasuries as the ones that mature.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Bank reserves and reverse repo data from the Fed.\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/reserves%20plus%20reverses_0.jpg?itok=FW3OPTij\"/></p><p><br/>The decision to end QT was a response to that liquidity pressure. The Fed has a long memory. In 2019, it waited too long to react to reserve scarcity, which triggered chaos in the repo market and forced an emergency balance sheet expansion. This time, Powell and his colleagues are choosing to act before a funding market eruption.</p><p>The rate cut was equally preemptive. Real rates are elevated, and inflation-adjusted yields on the 10-year Treasury approached 2% last month, the highest since 2007. At the same time, economic momentum slowed as consumer confidence slipped. These indicators told the Fed that underlying demand was cooling; therefore, the cut was likely to ease financial conditions without waiting for more visible cracks.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Real interest rates and GDP\" height=\"418\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-169-1024x612.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Powell has previously framed these actions as<em> “risk management.” </em>He has also noted that monetary policy acts with a lag and that the full effects of prior tightening are still filtering through. In other words, the Fed doesn’t want to tighten into a slowdown it cannot yet see. It’s also clear that the Fed is targeting broader liquidity health. Cutting rates and halting the Fed’s QT signals that monetary conditions are now meant to support—not restrain—the system.</p><p>That doesn’t mean the Fed is aiming for a new bull market. This is not QE or ZIRP. The Fed is still monitoring inflation, but its priority has shifted, and stability in financial markets now takes precedence over the residual fight against inflation. <strong>Liquidity fragility, rather than asset prices, compelled the Fed’s hand.</strong></p><p>The implications for investors are clear. The regime has shifted, and the Fed no longer wants to be a headwind, even though markets have largely ignored it. What is important is that it does change how capital is priced, how credit is extended, and how markets behave over the next several months. Liquidity is no longer contracting, and the Fed is no longer out of the market.</p><p>So, what does this all mean for the stock and bond markets?</p><h3><br/><strong>What the Fed’s Pivot Means for Stocks</strong></h3><p>The end of QT and a 25-basis-point rate cut altered the dynamics for the equity market. For the past 18 months, financial conditions had tightened steadily. Higher rates increased the cost of capital, while balance sheet runoff drained liquidity. That regime has ended, and as shown in the chart below, monetary policy is now the most dovish in years.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Monetary policy index and treasury bonds (TIPS)\" height=\"467\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-170.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Investors must understand that stocks now trade in an environment where Fed policy supports risk-taking. While the Fed’s move was not designed to ignite an asset boom, the side effects are unavoidable, <strong>particularly when liquidity matters more than fundamentals.</strong> And for now, liquidity is back.</p><p>Immediately after the announcement, stocks sold off, which is unsurprising given the recent run-up to all-time highs. It was a bit of <em>“buy the rumor, sell the news.”</em> Nonetheless, in previous days, growth stocks grossly outperformed, particularly in the “<em><strong>Magnificent 7,</strong></em>” which have driven the broader indices. As we discussed on Wednesday, the Megacap ETF (MGK) is grossly overbought on a relative and absolute basis. At the same time, more defensive market areas, such as low volatility (SPLV), are deeply oversold. <em>(Chart courtesy of <a href=\"https://simplevisor.com/home\"><strong>SimpleVisor.com)</strong></a></em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Screenshot of a financial dashboard titled Factors Absolute and Relative Scores Analysis for S and P displaying a table with sectors like Low Beta, MegaCap, Value, High Dividend Yield, Small Cap Growth, Small Cap Value, Equal Weight, Micro Cap Value, Micro Cap Growth each with upward and downward arrows, numerical scores such as 0.18 for Low Beta and 0.57 for MegaCap, and a color-coded heatmap matrix on the right with highlighted cells in red and green indicating overbought and oversold conditions.\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G4bpzjxXUAAJ8kC?format=jpg&amp;name=small\"/></p><p><br/>That bifurcation in the market reflects a clear shift in investor psychology, where looser financial conditions and more policy support support higher valuations. That is a risk if economic data deteriorates or earnings growth slows. Nonetheless, while already elevated, valuation multiples are likely to expand under these conditions. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&amp;P 500 already sits above 23 and only slightly below the 2021 “stimulus-fueled” peak. With a lower discount rate and an end to the liquidity drain, the question is whether multiples can continue to climb, especially for high-duration assets such as technology and biotech. That doesn’t mean earnings justify the move, but liquidity flows tend to override earnings concerns, at least in the near term.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Valuations based on forward earnings\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-171-1024x624.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Corporate buybacks may also accelerate. With lower yields and a more stable funding backdrop, companies will have more flexibility to return capital. As noted in <em><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/rally-into-year-end-3-reasons-to-buy-dips\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>“3-Reasons To Buy Dips,”</strong></a></em> corporate share buybacks add a significant buyer to the market of roughly $6-7 trillion per day through year-end.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Corporate share buybacks vs the market.\" height=\"370\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-172-1024x541.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Given this backdrop, we will likely continue to see a divergence between the Mega-cap index (driven by passive investing flooding money into the largest companies) and the Equal-weight index, given the market’s dearth of breadth.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Market cap vs Equal weight index.\" height=\"325\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-173-1024x476.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p>However, investors should not confuse an easier policy with economic acceleration. The Fed eased because growth was weakening, not strengthening. That distinction matters, given that earnings come from economic activity. Given current market valuations, if earnings expectations decline, the risk of the market <em>“re-pricing” </em>valuations becomes significant.</p><p>While the Fed’s move provides bulls with ammunition, structural imbalances persist, inherently creating market fragility. Liquidity is necessary, but not sufficient, and it sets the stage for performance; however, earnings and guidance will still drive outcomes. If inflation flares again or labor markets weaken too quickly, risk sentiment could reverse fast.</p><p>Just because the Fed removed the “brakes,” the risk to investors has not vanished. <strong>Yes, stocks will likely benefit into year-end, but the road ahead still requires careful navigation</strong>. This is not an all-clear; it is more akin to a reprieve. Markets are forward-looking, and while policy is now a tailwind, it’s still unclear how strong that wind will blow.</p><h3><br/><strong>The Bond Market Reprices: Fed Back in Play</strong></h3><p>However, one area that could also benefit from the end of the Fed’s QT is the Treasury market. After more than a year of balance sheet runoff, the central bank is no longer a net seller, which alone changes the supply-demand equation. The Treasury must still issue record volumes of debt, but one of the largest marginal sellers has now stepped aside. That shift eases pressure on the long end of the curve.</p><p>The bond market has already been pushing rates lower and bond prices higher over recent weeks, heading into this announcement. As shown, the 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/TLT\">TLT</a>) has broken above both the 50– and 200-day moving averages (DMAs) and triggered a <em>“golden cr</em>oss,” establishing a bullish trend over the last few months. This is a significantly bullish development after the last few years of downward pressure due to rising inflation and restrictive Fed policies.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"TLT bond market price\" height=\"290\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-16-1024x424.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>With that, the bond market is now pricing in a different regime where policy is no longer restrictive. Real yields are falling, and inflation breakevens remain anchored. That combination improves the total return profile for Treasuries, especially those with intermediate and long durations.</p><p>This policy shift also reduces volatility in the rates market. QT was unpredictable, and the monthly roll-off capped reserve balances, increasing stress in repo markets. With the Fed out of the way, supply dynamics become more stable, helping institutional allocators such as pensions, insurers, sovereign funds, etc. to re-engage with longer-dated paper. That too has already been happening as foreign buyers of US Treasuries have surged to a record in recent months.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Foreign owners of US Treasury bonds\" height=\"247\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fredgraph-1024x361.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p>For investors, this creates a new opportunity in fixed income. Bond prices have policy support for the first time in nearly two years. Income is meaningful, and capital appreciation is back in the conversation. If growth slows or inflation continues to decline, longer-duration Treasuries may outperform.</p><p>While the backdrop has improved, it’s not risk-free. However, it is possible to view Treasuries as viable ballast again. With policy support returning and yields still elevated by historical standards, the bond market has shifted from headwind to tailwind. That matters for portfolios built on balance and risk management.</p><h3><br/><strong>Tactical Investing Strategies for an Accommodative Fed</strong></h3><p>The Fed’s policy shift—cutting rates and ending QT—marked a clear transition from tightening to easing. Liquidity is stabilizing, rates are falling, and the Fed has removed itself as a seller of Treasuries. These moves are supportive of both equity and bond prices. <strong>But supportive does not mean guaranteed.</strong> <strong>Policy is a tailwind, not a parachute</strong>. Investors must adjust their positioning to reflect the changing environment while maintaining discipline.</p><p>Here are portfolio tactics to consider:</p><ul><li><em><strong>Increase exposure to intermediate-duration bonds.</strong> With the Fed backstopping liquidity and cutting rates, 5- to 10-year Treasuries offer attractive risk-adjusted returns.</em></li><li><em><strong>Tilt equity exposure toward rate-sensitive sectors.</strong> Technology, communication services, and discretionary names outperform when financial conditions ease.</em></li><li><em><strong>Reduce cash holdings modestly.</strong> Holding excess cash made sense when rates were rising. With the Fed now easing, idle capital risks underperform.</em></li><li><em><strong>Rebalance fixed income allocation.</strong> Add quality credit exposure where spreads remain attractive. Consider investing in investment-grade corporates over high-yield bonds for better risk control.</em></li><li><em><strong>Monitor cyclical sectors carefully.</strong> Industrials and financials may lag if growth weakens further, despite easier policy.</em></li><li><em><strong>Maintain exposure to defensives.</strong> Consumer staples and utilities continue to play a role if inflation flares or growth deteriorates unexpectedly.</em></li><li><em><strong>Use options or hedges selectively.</strong> Despite the supportive policy backdrop, event risk remains. Protecting downside is prudent.</em></li><li><em><strong>Watch liquidity metrics.</strong> Reserve balances, repo spreads, and Treasury auction coverage ratios will indicate how smoothly the policy shift is being absorbed.</em></li></ul><p>The Fed’s move removed a significant overhang. But outcomes are never guaranteed. Easing policy can delay market stress, not eliminate it. You should position for a more constructive market, but manage risk as if uncertainty remains high—because it does. Use this environment to reset exposures and reallocate with intention.</p><p>Trade accordingly.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Portfolio Allocation\" height=\"168\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-151-1024x246.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/gold-myths-luring-investors-into-risk?post=532303\">Gold Myths Luring Investors Into Risk</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/dow-theory-a-concerning-divergence-or-artifact?post=532179\">Dow Theory: A Concerning Divergence Or Artifact?</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/liquidity-concerns-put-an-end-to-qt?post=531785\">Liquidity Concerns Put An End To QT</a></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Businessman, Internet, Continents\" height=\"249\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/08/26/10/47/businessman-2682712__340.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/images/id-2682712/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em></p><p><br/>A snooze fest the October FOMC meeting was not. “…Far from it.” An inebriated Wall Street didn’t see that coming. After trading near a one-year low of 3.97% in early Wednesday trading, 10-year Treasury yields jumped to a Thursday high of 4.11% - before ending the week at 4.08%. Two-year yields traded from 3.48% up to 3.63% - closing the week at 3.57%. The rates market went from almost a 100% probability for a December rate cut to 68%.<br/><br/>Chair Powell: <em>“…strongly differing views in today’s meeting, as I pointed out in my remarks. And that’s what leads me to say that we haven’t made a decision about December. I always say that. It’s a fact that we don’t make decisions in advance. But I’m saying something in addition here, is that it’s not to be seen as a foregone conclusion, in fact, far from it.”</em><br/><br/>“<em>And so there’s a growing chorus now of feeling like maybe this is where we should at least wait a cycle…” “There were strongly differing views today.” “The strongly differing views were really about the future…” “…Strongly differing views in today’s meeting, as I pointed out in my remarks.” “…Everybody on the Committee is deeply committed to doing the right thing to achieve our goals, maximum employment and stable prices. You have differences on how to do that…” “When participants go out and talk, they’re very disparate views.” “…Different risk aversions to the two different variables, which is common through all Federal Reserves… people just have different risk tolerances... So that leads you to people with disparate views.”</em><br/><br/>According to JPMorgan’s Bob Michele, “Powell is losing his grip on the Fed.” I would come at his from a different angle: the Federal Reserve’s flawed analytical framework has closed in on Powell, the Committee, and the entire organization. Lacking a cohesive framework, the Fed is now deeply divided, just like about everything else. The chasm will be filled by partisan “politics.”<br/><br/><em>“Perspectives of people on the Committee that we’ve now moved 150 bps and that we’re down into – you’re into that range between 3 and 4, where many estimates of the neutral rate live, in the 3 to 4% area, you’re there now - you’re above the median number for the Committee. But I think there are people on the Committee who have higher estimates of the neutral rate, and you can argue these positions since they can’t be directly observed, the neutral rate.”</em><br/><br/>Guesswork as to the level of some unobservable hypothetical “neutral rate” is no way to run a central bank. Traditionally, central bankers focused on bank lending and Credit conditions as primary mechanisms for policy rates to influence growth and inflation dynamics. Today, financial markets dominate, highly speculative markets at that. A “risk on” backdrop of risk-taking, speculative leverage and liquidity abundance requires significantly higher policy rates to restrain Credit growth and broad inflationary pressures (including asset inflation). That same policy rate would turn restrictive in a “risk off” environment of risk aversion, deleveraging and waning liquidity excess.<br/><br/>It's imperative that the Federal Reserve incorporate thoughtful analysis of the market backdrop and financial conditions more specifically. Ignore at our peril. The Fed erred 13 months ago when it began loosening monetary policy despite dangerously loose conditions and speculative markets. Nvidia’s stock inflated almost 80%. For Oracle, it was 65%. The Semiconductor Index has returned 50% since the Fed’s first cut, boosting three-year gains to over 200%. A few weeks ago, investment-grade corporate spreads to Treasuries traded at 72 bps, the narrowest level since the (pre-LTCM crisis) summer of 1998. Corporate debt issuance has boomed, Wall Street just reported record quarterly earnings, and, led by the AI mania/arms race, stocks have surged further into record territory. Somehow, “financial conditions” didn’t get a mention in Powell’s prepared remarks or during his press conference. It’s as if this critical issue off limits.<br/><br/>The Associated Press’ Chris Rugaber: <em>“So there’s a big investment boom in AI infrastructure right now, as you know, and wondering if the existence of such a boom would indicate that rates are not that restrictive after all. And could further rate cuts at this point perhaps fuel an excess level of investment there, or market bubbles. How is the Fed thinking about that?”</em><br/><br/>Powell: <em>“You’re right. There’s a lot of data centers being built, and other investments being made around the country and around the world. And big U.S. companies are just investing a lot of resources in thinking about how AI… run through data centers, is going to affect their businesses. So, it’s a big deal. I don’t think that the spending that happens to build data centers all over the country is especially interest sensitive. It’s based on longer run assessments that this is an area where there’s going to be a lot of investment and that’s going to drive higher productivity and that sort of thing. I don’t know how those investments will work out. But I don’t think they’re particularly interest sensitive compared to some of the other sectors.”</em><br/><br/>Considering historic dynamics - company market capitalizations, the incredible ramp up of spending, and all the hype - Powell surely knew AI questions were coming. Hard to believe he prepared to respond so ineffectively. Apparently, it’s not rate-related – not an issue of or for the Federal Reserve. But the AI mania and arms race have and continue to feed off late-cycle loose financial conditions and liquidity abundance. This backdrop has everything to do with monetary policy.<br/><br/>Bloomberg’s Michael McKee:<em> “Do you have any concerns that equity markets are, or are close to being overvalued at this point?”</em><br/><br/>Powell: “<em>We don’t look at any one asset price and say hey, that’s wrong. It’s not our job to do that. We look at the overall financial system, and we ask whether it’s stable and whether it could withstand shocks, right? So, banks are well capitalized… households are in good shape financially. Relatively manageable levels of debt… And you don’t see too much leverage in the banking system or the financial system… It’s not appropriate -- we don’t set asset prices, markets do that.”</em><br/><br/>Mike McKee follow-up: <em>“Well, you must be well-aware by lowering interest rates, you’re contributing to additional asset price increases. And I wonder how you balance the idea that lowering rates would help the labor market with the reality that it seems more likely to be stimulating increased investment in AI, which is the rationale for thousands of job cuts that have been announced in the last few weeks.”</em><br/><br/>Powell: <em>“Yeah, I don’t think interest rates are an important part of the AI -- the data center story. People think there are great economics in building these data centers, and they’re making a lot of money building them and I think they have very high present value and all this sort of thing, it’s not really about 25 bps here or there. We use our tools to support the labor market and to create price stability. That’s what we do.”</em><br/><br/>Politico’s Victoria Guida: <em>“On AI, I’m just wondering, it seems like a lot of the economic growth that we’ve been seeing is fed by investments in AI. So, how worried are you about what the sudden contraction in tech investment would mean for the overall economy, is there enough strength in other sectors? And specifically, are there any lessons that you take from the 1990s in how you might approach what's happening right now?”</em><br/><br/>Powell: <em>“Yeah, this is different in the sense that these companies, the companies that are so highly valued actually have earnings and stuff like that. So, you go back to the ‘90s and the dot-com, these were ideas rather than companies. So, there’s a clear bubble there, whereas - I won’t go into particular names - but they actually have earnings and it looks like they have business models and profits and that kind of thing. So, it’s really a different thing. You know, the investment we’re getting in equipment and all those things that go into creating data centers and feeding the AI, it’s clearly one of the big sources of growth in the economy.”</em><br/><br/>Yahoo Finance’s Jennifer Schonberger: <em>“Both regional and large banks have taken losses on loans given delinquencies on sub-prime auto loans. JPMorgan's CEO, Jamie Dimon, warned when you see one cockroach, there may be more likely. I’m curious how the Fed is looking at these loan losses and if it poses risks to the financial system or the outlook for the economy. Is it a warning sign?”</em><br/><br/>Powell: <em>“So, obviously we watch these things very carefully, credit conditions very carefully. You’re right, you’ve seen rising defaults in subprime credit for some time now, and now you’ve seen a number of subprime credit -- automobile credit institutions having significant losses, and some of those losses are now showing up on the books of banks. We’re looking at it carefully. We’re paying close attention. I don’t see, at this point, a broader credit issue. It doesn’t seem to be something that has very broad application across financial institutions. But we’re going to be monitoring this quite carefully and making sure that that is the case.”</em><br/><br/>Jennifer Schonberger follow up: <em>“How much of consumer spending continuing hinges on the stock market remaining strong? In some odd way, does the market help keep the economy buoyant?”</em><br/><br/>Powell: <em>“So there is some relationship there. But remember, the more wealth someone has, the lower an additional dollar of wealth matters. So, your marginal propensity to consume declines quite dramatically as you reach levels of stock market wealth. So, the stock market, it would affect spending if the stock market went down. But it wouldn’t drop sharply unless there were quite a sharp drop in the stock market.”</em><br/><br/>This is such an unprecedented environment, with various momentous developments. Whether responding to questions regarding AI investment, Bubble possibilities, inflated equities markets, or recent Credit issues – Powell’s answers leave me uncomfortable. Is he purposely downplaying their significance – loath to make waves – or is he and the committee not on top of such consequential and far-reaching developments?<br/><br/>Why not offer cautious comments on conspicuous signs of excess throughout tech and AI? Why dismiss obvious signs of a dangerous arms race and Bubble? How could Powell not allude to the First Brands collapse and potential ramifications across “Wall Street finance?” How can he stay mum after Bank of England’s Andrew Bailey’s astute “alarm bells” were ringing comments from a week ago? With recent concerns voiced by Bailey, the IMF, BIS, rating agencies and others, Powell should have been asked about potential Fed concerns with bank exposure to “non-depository financial institutions.”<br/><br/><em>October 30 – Reuters (Andrea Shalal and David Lawder): “U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent… applauded the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point, but said comments casting doubt on another rate cut this year showed the institution needed a major revamp… The goal, he said, was to find a new leader for the U.S. central bank who would overhaul the entire institution. ‘The decision by the Federal Reserve yesterday - the decision to cut rates by 25 bps, I applaud, but the language that went with it, tells me that this Fed is stuck in the past. Their inflation estimates have been terrible so far this year… Their models are broken.’ Bessent said he could not understand why the Fed was signaling that it didn’t want to cut rates at its December meeting, saying their estimates of gross domestic product and inflation had been ‘consistently wrong.’ ‘We’re going to find a leader who is going to revamp the entire institution in terms of process and inner workings,’ he said.”</em><br/><br/>This is most inopportune timing for the Fed Chair and FOMC to be running scared. Finance has evolved momentously over recent decades. The Fed has failed to construct coherent analytical and policymaking frameworks. This will cost them Federal Reserve independence. It already is.<br/><br/><em>October 25 – Financial Times (James Politi): “From the sofa in his office overlooking the White House, Scott Bessent, Donald Trump’s Treasury secretary, summed up how he approaches the job. ‘We want the most America-first policies that are possible, without incurring market wrath,’ said the… hedge fund manager… who now runs the cabinet agency responsible for the world’s… most important debt market… ‘Unlike most of my predecessors, I have a very healthy scepticism of elite institutions and elite opinion, whereas I think they didn’t,’ Bessent said. ‘But I have a healthy regard for the market’… He also distanced himself from other populist governments around the world with unorthodox policies. ‘What gets the people in trouble is they come in, they have these ideas, but they don’t respect the market… you’ve got to respect the market.’”</em><br/><br/><em>October 27 – Wall Street Journal (Nick Timiraos): “President Trump said… he might announce before year-end his pick to succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires next May, and is on track to choose from five finalists. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent plans to conduct a second round of interviews with the current slate next month… The five include two sitting Fed governors who were initially nominated to the central bank’s board by Trump: Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman… Two candidates are widely seen as front-runners: Kevin Hassett… and Kevin Warsh… Rick Rieder, a senior executive at BlackRock who oversees the firm’s massive bond business, rounds out the five.”</em><br/><br/>My hunch is Bessent would prefer BlackRock’s Rick Rieder to replace Powell (ASAP). What a super-cycle climax dynamic: Hedge fund and asset management communities unite to demolish and reconstruct the Federal Reserve system (to their and Trump’s liking). A White House keenly aware that cracks in financing Washington’s massive debt load would torpedo their agenda – and a hot shot Wall Street bond manager willing to work together creatively to postpone The Day of Reckoning.<br/><br/>I think the Trump folks pretty much despise central bankers – how they’re educated; how they think and operate. Bessent: “We’re going to find a leader who is going to revamp the entire institution…” To get things going, placate uneasy markets with a seemingly conventional search process. But they will want someone from the outside, so Waller and Bowman are out. Warsh might be too much of an independent thinker. Hassett would suffice, but he lacks market gravitas. Rick – “whoever ends up being the Fed chair, there’s so many innovative things… how to use the balance sheet, how to use liquidity, where the yield curve is” – Rieder; the administration’s archetypal made-for-television masculinity - the skillful salesman and market operator. It may only be a case of (global) markets buying into a Rieder chairmanship.<br/><br/>This could move fast, with Bessent expecting to present “a ‘good slate’ to Trump after the Thanksgiving holiday.” Powell’s term as Chair ends on May 15th. Time might be of the essence. I expect markets to turn more circumspect of the Trump/Bessent Fed scheme when things start to unravel.<br/><br/>KKR dropped another 2.4% this week – and is down 22% from September highs and traded intraday Friday at lows since June. Blackstone sank 5.1% this week and Blue Owl 5.5%. Credit issues fester.<br/><br/><em>October 31 – Bloomberg (Jeannine Amodeo): “The US leveraged-loan market ended Octoberwith another tepid week for launches, putting monthly volumes on track to be the third-slowest of the year following a record 3Q.”</em><br/><br/><em>October 31 – Bloomberg (Gowri Gurumurthy): “US junk bonds tumbled, posting their steepest one-day loss in three weeks, as the risk premium climbed to 278 bps after Chair Powell cautioned that a December rate cut is not a foregone conclusion. Yields rose 11 bps to 6.76%, the biggest one-day jump in three weeks… CCC yields, the riskiest tier of the high yield market, climbed 14 bps to 9.84%. Spreads rose 14 bps to 607 — the biggest one-day widening in three weeks.”</em><br/><br/><em>October 27 – Financial Times (Lee Harris and Euan Healy): “Credit ratings on private loans held by US insurers may have been systematically inflated, the Bank for International Settlements has warned in a new paper on the growing risk of ‘fire sales’ during periods of financial turmoil. Ratings on private credit investments have come under scrutiny following a rise in insolvencies and recent high-profile bankruptcies at car parts maker First Brands and auto lender Tricolor. The rapid collapse of the two businesses has rattled credit markets, with some investors highlighting concerns over their complex funding structures. Smaller rating agencies have captured market share in the fast-growing world of private credit by providing so-called private letter ratings, which are typically only visible to an issuer and select investors. US life insurers have been among the biggest buyers of such debt.”</em><br/><br/>I am reminded of the focus on inflated ratings and ratings companies after the 2007 subprime blowup. More from Lee Harris’s and Euan Healy’s insightful FT article:<br/><br/><em>“The number of insurance securities rated by Moody’s, S&amp;P and Fitch… has been largely flat in recent years, while the quantity rated by smaller providers has grown rapidly. Smaller groups may face commercial pressure to assign more favourable scores, according to the BIS, which said the strategy could ‘lead to inflated assessments of creditworthiness’ and ‘obscure the true risk of complex assets’. Insurers with links to private equity groups have been heavy users of private letter ratings. About a quarter of those insurers’ investments relied on such ratings as of 2024…”</em><br/><br/><em>“‘If market users are part of the mechanism for keeping rating agencies honest, it’s not working,’ Ann Rutledge, a former senior Moody’s analyst and now chief executive of rating agency CreditSpectrum, told the Financial Times… Private equity’s growing stake in insurance through direct acquisitions of insurers or management of their assets, may have raised ‘systemic vulnerabilities’ in the sector, the BIS said. Insurers affiliated with alternative investment managers invest about 24% of their portfolios to private credit, as well as riskier and more complex assets, compared with 6% at non-affiliated insurers, Fitch said…”</em><br/><br/>Along with BOE Governor Andrew Bailey's warning, last week I highlighted a comment from BOE deputy governor Sarah Breeden: <em>“We can see the vulnerabilities here, the opacity, the leverage, the weak underwriting standards, the interconnections. We can see parallels with the global financial crisis. What we don’t know is how macro-significant those issues are.”</em><br/><br/>Unfolding Credit issues could not be more “macro-significant.” This most-protracted Credit cycle went to historic extremes. Epic “terminal phase excess” has unleashed a perilous AI arms race blowoff.<br/><br/><em>October 30 – Wall Street Journal (Meghan Bobrowsky): “Silicon Valley’s biggest companies are already planning to pour $400 billion into artificial intelligence efforts this year. They all say it’s nowhere near enough. Meta Platforms says it is still running up against capacity constraints as it tries to train new AI models and power its existing products at the same time. Microsoft says it is seeing so much customer demand for its data-center-driven services that it plans to double its data-center footprint in the next two years. And Amazon.com says it is racing to bring more cloud capacity online as soon as it can. ‘We’ve been short [on computing power] now for many quarters. I thought we were going to catch up. We are not. Demand is increasing,’ said Amy Hood, Microsoft’s chief financial officer. ‘When you see these kinds of demand signals and we know we’re behind, we do need to spend.’”</em><br/><br/><em>October 31 – Bloomberg (Carmen Arroyo): “Just this month, Meta Platforms Inc. has secured about $60 billion in capital to build data centers, part of its spending to get ahead in the artificial intelligence race. Half of that won’t show up on the social media giant’s balance sheet as debt. Meta is among firms popularizing a way for debt to sit completely off balance sheet, allowing enormous sums to be raised while limiting impact on its financial health. Morgan Stanley structured a $30 billion deal — the largest private capital transaction on record — where the debt would sit in a special purpose vehicle tied to Blue Owl Capital Inc. That made it easier for Meta to raise another $30 billion this week the usual way, in the corporate bond market. Off-balance-sheet debt, through an SPV or a joint venture tied to assets like chips or real estate, is becoming the go-to for AI data center deals, bankers say. Morgan Stanley estimates that tech firms and others will need as much as $800 billion from private credit in deals tied to specific assets, including in SPV format, by 2028.”</em><br/><br/><em>October 29 – Bloomberg (Caleb Mutua): “Credit traders are buying protection against Oracle Corp. defaulting on its debt, a trend that Morgan Stanley sees continuing in the near term as the tech giant pours billions into artificial intelligence. The cost to insure against default on the company's debt over the next five years is hovering near its highest since Oct. 2023… The company’s 4.9% bonds maturing in February 2033 widened 26 bps to 83 bps… Morgan Stanley expects Oracle’s net adjusted debt to more than double to roughly $290 billion by fiscal year 2028 from around $100 billion and is recommending that investors buy the company’s five-year CDS and its five-year bonds.”</em><br/><br/>Tech Credit default swap (CDS) prices have begun moving. Concerns are mounting. Curiously, Oracle CDS jumped another 10 bps this week to 86 bps – having now doubled since mid-September. Oracle just tapped the debt markets for $38 billion, followed by Meta’s $30 billion. As spending skyrockets, big tech’s big cash positions will no longer suffice. The great AI buildout will increasingly be at the whim of the debt markets. Off balance sheet debt and structured finance to fund the AI buildout? Really? Considering mounting Credit issues, the AI Bubble is vulnerable.<br/><br/><em>October 29 – Telegraph (Hans van Leeuwen): “The $3tn shadow banking industry has developed ‘bubble-like characteristics’ that could risk triggering a wider global financial shock, the credit ratings agency Fitch has warned. Fitch said that if a crisis took hold in the private credit market, then it could ripple out to fund managers, banks and insurers who bankroll the market. The warning, issued this week, adds to a drumbeat of concern after the $12bn collapse of US auto parts giant First Brands was followed by two regional US banks sounding the alarm over bad loans. This has prompted fears that the incidents could be symptomatic of more serious problems in the market. </em></p><p><br/>For the Week:<br/><br/>The S&amp;P500 added 0.7% (up 16.3% y-t-d), and the Dow increased 0.8% (up 11.8%).

Key gauges of secured borrowing have risen in the US and UK, reaching levels not seen in years. While the drivers in each case may differ, the signs of tighter liquidity are flashing across markets. The ripples suggest a normalization after years of central bank bond purchases flooded funding markets with excess cash. But investors are also wary of risks, such as a repeat of the spike in US short-term interest rates that rocked markets in September 2019 — prompting the Federal Reserve to pump half a trillion dollars into the financial system.”<br/><br/>October 29 – Bloomberg (Swati Pandey): “Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers said global investors are on edge and capital flows are ‘jumpy’ as uncertainty builds over whether the world economy can withstand mounting headwinds or will slip into a correction.

He pointed to a massive surge in gold prices this year to underline the point. ‘What came through clearly in almost every conversation was that risks to the global economic outlook are accumulating – from every angle, all at once,’ Chalmers said… ‘Geopolitical tensions.

Payment-in-kind debt, the argument went, would give struggling borrowers breathing room to deal with soaring interest rates — by letting them push back payments until the debt itself had to be repaid. But the pile of this expensive debt keeps on swelling, and is now raising concern in some circles that private credit funds are using PIK to mask a deterioration in loan quality.”<br/><br/>October 30 – Bloomberg (Francesca Veronesi and Kat Hidalgo): “Private credit firms are in the business of lending, not owning. But as more borrowers start to struggle with their liabilities, lenders are swapping their debt positions for equity stakes to try and stem losses. There’s been a string of debt-for-equity swaps in recent weeks, including for British auction house Bonhams, telecommunications supplier Netceed, Italian sportswear maker Dainese and French radiology-center specialist Oradianse. While these swaps can produce upside, the original investment was designed to be a loan that provided stable income over time, rather than an equity play. The latter requires a different set of skills and offers more unpredictable returns.”<br/><br/>October 30 – Bloomberg (Dorothea Quallis, Kyle Ashworth and Todd Cooper): “The boom in CLO exchange-traded funds cooled in October as a flagship fund saw its biggest outflow since April. The Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF, which invests in the highest-rated collateralized loan obligations, saw a monthly outflow of $537 million as the bankruptcy of First Brands cast a spotlight on credit risks.”<br/><br/>October 29 – Bloomberg (Eliza Ronalds-Hannon, Scott Carpenter, and Natalie Wong): “A distressed-debt fund is seizing control of one of the largest malls in America after a series of moves that wiped out some creditors and even left holders of bonds once rated AAA nursing steep losses. The trade was set in motion after Black Diamond Capital Management bought more than 70% of the top-ranking slice in a commercial mortgage-backed security tied to the struggling Palisades Center shopping mall in West Nyack, New York. The firm then used its position to acquire the sole mortgage backing the CMBS at a discount, triggering the bond’s liquidation…”<br/><br/>October 30 – Bloomberg (Todd Gillespie): “The mounting level of US debt risks a ‘reckoning’ for the economy if the pace of growth doesn’t improve, according to the chief executive of Goldman Sachs... ‘If we continue on the current course and we don’t take the growth level up, there will be a reckoning,’ David Solomon said… ‘The path out is a growth path.’”<br/><br/>First Brands Ramifications Watch:<br/><br/>October 31 – Bloomberg (Jonathan Randles): “A group of First Brands lenders have accused the auto parts supplier of ‘widespread fraud’ and are seeking to end part of the auto parts supplier’s bankruptcy. Lenders to certain First Brands-related special purpose vehicles said in a… court filing that besides existing allegations that the company double-pledged assets, new information has come to light indicating the business ‘made misrepresentations in numerous financial statements, credit agreements, and borrowing base certificates.’”<br/><br/>October 28 – Bloomberg (Amedeo Goria): “Goldman Sachs… Chief Executive Officer David Solomon downplayed concerns that have surfaced following the collapse of US firms First Brands Group and Tricolor Holdings, and said he doesn’t see any systemic risk looming in the credit market. ‘I don’t see anything in the context of a handful of bad credit situations that’s leading me to say we have a systemic issue around the corner,’ Solomon said… He reiterated his comments that the recent losses at regional banks tied to alleged fraud were ‘idiosyncratic events’…”<br/><br/>Global Credit and Financial Bubble Watch:<br/><br/>October 26 – Bloomberg (Heesu Lee, Shery Ahn, and Soo-hyang Choi): “South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned that the country’s property market is a bubble on the point of bursting, as he backed the Bank of Korea’s decision to hold rates last week. Amid concerns that cheaper borrowing may further fuel the rally in property prices, Lee said it was imperative to avoid triggering the kind of economic malaise that afflicted Japan for decades. ‘The truth is, the Republic of Korea is sitting on a very dangerous potential crisis, a ticking bomb — that is excessive real estate investment,’ Lee told Bloomberg... ‘If we were to lower interest rates, this could stimulate real estate prices, which is already an issue for us. The BOK made the right decision by keeping rates unchanged instead of cutting them.’”<br/><br/>October 28 – Financial Times (Sarah White): “BNP Paribas… said it suffered a €190mn hit from a fraud case involving an unidentified client, as increased provisions against soured loans overshadowed its third-quarter results… BNP only referred to a ‘specific credit event’ in its earnings statement but later confirmed some details of what it said was a ‘fraud case’ affecting its global markets unit in a call with analysts.”<br/><br/>October 30 – Bloomberg (Brian W Smith and Caleb Mutua): “BlackRock Inc. and other creditors are grappling with the fallout from loans made to two telecom firms that the companies are now accusing of fraud.

His brainstorm: Rather than hunt for gold, they’ll get rich selling picks and shovels. Welcome to ‘Blackstone Town,’ as a crew member later calls it – the set of an old-timey TV western that’s been repurposed for, of all things, an advertisement for the world’s largest private equity firm. Long the preserve of institutions and the wealthy, Blackstone Inc., Apollo Global Management Inc., Carlyle Group Inc. and other industry giants today are rushing to sell their rarefied brand of investing to everyday Americans.”<br/><br/>Trump Administration Watch:<br/><br/>October 26 – Wall Street Journal (Editorial Board): “The MAGA crowd likes to dismiss Ronald Reagan as irrelevant today, but apparently he still matters to President Trump. How else to explain Mr. Trump’s tantrum against Canada after the province of Ontario invoked the Gipper on trade in a television ad? The Ontario government had the temerity to buy ad time to run clips of Reagan’s 1987 remarks warning about the dangers of protectionism. Mr. Trump pitched a social-media fit in response…, claiming Ontario ‘fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs’… Ontario then said it would pull the ad, but when it still ran during sporting events on the weekend, Mr. Trump escalated with an additional 10% tariff on Canadian goods on top of the taxes he has already imposed.”<br/><br/>October 26 – Wall Street Journal (Alexander Ward, Gabriele Steinhauser and Meridith McGraw): “World leaders have developed something of a blueprint for President Trump when he comes to visit: produce a lavish welcoming ceremony and launch a charm offensive in hopes of securing relief from U.S. tariffs and demands to spend more on defense. Recent overseas trips have involved escorting Air Force One with jet fighters during its final approach and lining red carpets with uniformed soldiers and traditional dancers. Upon Trump’s arrival, foreign hosts often exalt him for his role in reaching a significant trade or peace deal. There have been repeated pledges to nominate the president for the Nobel Peace Prize.”<br/><br/>October 28 – Reuters (Trevor Hunnicutt and Susan Heavey): “U.S. President Donald Trump… said there was a long list of people who could take over the Federal Reserve, slamming current chairman Jerome Powell as the central bank prepared to meet this week. ‘We have an incompetent head of the Fed... we got a bad Fed guy, but he’ll be out of there in a few months, and we’ll get somebody new,’ Trump told business leaders at a dinner in Tokyo... Powell’s term ends in May.”<br/><br/>October 26 – Bloomberg (Emily Birnbaum and Bill Allison): “President Donald Trump is constructing a $300 million White House ballroom with the force of a political campaign, tapping his former campaign finance director to raise money for the high-profile but controversial project… The ballroom donors so far include some of the largest tech companies in the world — Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, and Meta Platforms Inc. — as well as major crypto firms like Coinbase Inc., Ripple Labs Inc. and Tether Holdings Ltd… Other contributors include longtime Trump donors like billionaires Steve Schwarzman and Miriam Adelson.”<br/><br/>October 31 – Miami Herald (Antonio María Delgado): “The Trump Administration has made the decision to attack military installations inside Venezuela and the strikes could come at any moment, sources with knowledge… told the Miami Herald, as the U.S. prepares to initiate the next stage of its campaign against the Soles drug cartel. The planned attacks… will seek to destroy military installations used by the drug-trafficking organization the U.S. says is headed by Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro and run by top members of his regime… While sources declined to say whether Maduro himself is a target, one of them said his time is running out. ‘Maduro is about to find himself trapped and might soon discover that he cannot flee the country even if he decided to… What’s worse for him, there is now more than one general willing to capture and hand him over, fully aware that one thing is to talk about death, and another to see it coming.’”<br/><br/>October 30 – Wall Street Journal (Michael R. Gordon and Robbie Gramer): “A day after President Trump vowed to resume testing of nuclear weapons, the White House wasn’t answering questions about the details, leaving members of Congress, experts and even the administration’s nominee to command U.S. nuclear forces uncertain what he meant. ‘I don’t have insights into the president’s intent,’ Vice Adm. Richard Correll said at his Senate confirmation hearing…, after he was asked whether Trump wanted to step up missile flight tests or resume underground nuclear detonations for the first time in more than three decades. Trump announced… on social media that he had ‘instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons,’ minutes before he met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping…”<br/><br/>October 28 – Bloomberg (Will Wade and Rachel Morison): “Keen to bolster a domestic nuclear industry that’s built just three reactors this century, the Trump administration is opting to use a government-investment strategy it’s applied to the mining, steel and semiconductor industries. Under a pact announced Tuesday, the administration is committing more than $80 billion to buy reactors from Westinghouse Electric Co. It follows moves to take equity positions in chip giant Intel Corp. and United States Steel Corp. The goal: help ease financing concerns that have deterred project development — even as enthusiasm for new reactors mounts.”<br/><br/>October 30 – Financial Times (Claire Jones): “The Federal Reserve’s top banking supervisor plans to shrink the… board’s regulatory staff by 30%, amid a push by the Trump administration to deregulate the financial sector.

Rare earth materials will flow more smoothly, but China has put in place an export permitting regime that it can tighten or loosen as needed. Port fees will go away, but only for one year. And Beijing is again buying U.S. soybeans after it had abruptly cut off American farmers. After months of posturing, arguing and threatening, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have essentially turned back the clock. While the meeting between the two leaders was hailed by Trump as a ‘roaring success,’ the agreement that came out of it may only serve to undo some of the damages Trump inflicted with his trade war... ‘It is hard to see what major gains the U.S. has made in the bilateral relationship relative to where things stood before Trump took office,’ said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University.”<br/><br/>October 30 – Wall Street Journal (Editorial Board): “President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping struck their third trade truce in a year…, and the best we can say is that the deal averted more economic damage. Mr. Trump called the deal a ‘12 out of 10,’ but markets were nearer to the truth when they yawned. The deal mostly restores the status quo that prevailed in May.”<br/><br/>October 30 – Bloomberg (Justin Sink and Colum Murphy): “US President Donald Trump emerged from his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping beaming, labeling the conversation ‘truly great.’ But the one-year truce struck… in South Korea is likely to only stabilize relations between the world’s two largest economies rather than resolve fundamental differences, with both sides buying time to further reduce dependence on each other in strategic areas. And it made clear just how much stronger China has become since Trump’s first term in office’… ‘China gave some ground, but the clear dynamic is how Chinese threats have gotten the US to back off a series of proposed restrictions,’ said Scott Kennedy, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies... ‘Xi has created more safe space for China’s economic system and its efforts to achieve greater global leadership.’”<br/><br/>October 30 – Bloomberg (Jenny Leonard, Shawn Donnan, and Joe Deaux): “Donald Trump sounded triumphant afterwards. But in his first meeting with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping since returning to office in January, the US president had to give at least as much as he got. Trump declared the two leaders had ‘settled’ their differences on one of the thorniest issues, and a major source of Beijing’s leverage: access to China’s rare earths. ‘There’s no roadblock at all on rare earth,’ he said… ‘That will hopefully disappear from our vocabulary for a little while.’ What Trump chalked up as a win… was China’s agreement to wait one year before implementing a sweeping regime of export controls for critical minerals that are crucial in all kinds of industries.”<br/><br/>October 31 – Bloomberg: “After Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met in South Korea on Oct. 30, China released a statement on the outcomes of the landmark summit while US officials made public remarks. In places, those comments didn’t quite match, while for other areas — such as the deal to keep Chinese social media app TikTok alive in the US — many details await clarification. China’s statements were broader than the specifics offered by Trump administration chiefs. Some of the language on what rare earth licensing measures China is suspending already suggest the two sides could have different understandings of what was agreed.”<br/><br/>October 30 – Financial Times (Joe Leahy and Demetri Sevastopulo): “China’s President Xi Jinping sought to cement a personal connection with his mercurial American counterpart when he met Donald Trump to hammer out a trade war ceasefire this week. Xi found common ground with Trump’s ‘Maga’ agenda, which parallels the Communist party’s own ambitions of restoring China’s past glory, known as the ‘great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation’. ‘I always believe that China’s development should go hand in hand with your vision to make America great again,’ the Chinese president told Trump… But behind the niceties, the change in the balance of power between the two men was unmistakable. Unlike nearly 10 years ago, when Trump’s first trade offensive caught Beijing by surprise, this time a better prepared and economically more powerful China has been able to fight its once far mightier opponent to a standstill.”<br/><br/>October 30 – Bloomberg (Catherine Lucey and Skylar Woodhouse): “The US will proceed with an investigation that opens the door to new tariffs on goods from China, despite the two nations’ fresh truce, President Donald Trump’s top trade negotiator said. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer last Friday opened a probe into China’s compliance with a limited trade agreement reached during Trump’s first term. That move was seen as potential leverage for the US president in his meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. While the leaders agreed to suspend plans for higher tariffs and stricter export controls during their summit, the investigation is still moving forward, Greer said…”<br/><br/>October 30 – Bloomberg (Mackenzie Hawkins): “US President Donald Trump said he didn’t discuss approving sales of Nvidia Corp.’s Blackwell chips to China with his counterpart Xi Jinping, dampening speculation that Washington will allow exports of the powerful AI accelerators to the world’s largest semiconductor market.”<br/><br/>October 27 – Bloomberg: “Chinese and US trade negotiators have lined up an array of diplomatic wins for Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to unveil at a summit this week. Those easy hits are pleasing investors, but leave deeper core conflicts unresolved… ‘Picking the low-hanging fruit makes the path ahead inherently tougher because it leaves the hard, high-stakes conflicts for last,’ said Sun Chenghao, a fellow at Tsinghua University in Beijing. ‘The ‘grand deal’ requires tackling profound disagreements on state subsidies, tech competition and national security — areas where both sides’ fundamental models clash.’”<br/><br/>Trade War Watch:<br/><br/>October 28 – Wall Street Journal (Ontario Premier Doug Ford): “Your editorial ‘Reagan vs. Trump on Tariffs’ (Oct. 27) begins by pointing out that Ronald Reagan and his legacy still matter to Donald Trump. There’s nothing wrong with that. The 40th president still matters to me too. I’m not American, but like millions of Canadians I admire Reagan and his commitment to free trade, free markets and closer ties between our two countries. His friendship with another great leader, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, set the stage for decades of cooperation and shared prosperity on both sides of the border. The numbers don’t lie: Last year cross-border trade between the U.S. and Canada hit nearly $1 trillion. Every day, millions of Americans wake up, go to work and earn a paycheck making something for or providing a service to a company based in Canada. Together we have built the most secure, prosperous and mutually beneficial partnership between any two countries in the history of the world. I believe that is Reagan’s legacy—built on free trade. It’s now at risk.”<br/><br/>October 27 – Bloomberg (Josh Wingrove and Brian Platt): “US President Donald Trump said he doesn’t anticipate meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney ‘for a while,’ despite Carney’s insistence that the two sides were close to a trade deal on lowering metals tariffs.

To beef up the surrounding grids, Google, Microsoft and others have been striking partnerships with utilities to bring in the needed power. A fascinating data point: Many economists credit A.I. spending with bolstering the overall economy. ‘In the first half of this year, A.I.-related capital expenditures contributed 1.1 percent to G.D.P. growth, outpacing the U.S. consumer as an engine of expansion,’ Stephanie Aliaga, a strategist at J.P.

I couldn’t help but think of this when I flew into San Francisco a couple of weeks ago. Artificial intelligence, rather than consumer web pages, drives the exuberance today. But the vibe is the same as it was 30 years ago — there is one story, and everyone is buying it. Every single billboard I passed from the airport to the city had something to do with AI. Giant white blocks of brand-new housing and office space lined the highway.”<br/><br/>October 31 – Financial Times (Robin Wigglesworth): “Whenever a bubble bursts, there are some stories from their peaks that morph into endlessly-recounted legends that symbolise how mad people had become.

He logged into his Charles Schwab brokerage account, built a trade he’d discovered on Reddit — and unlocked about $650,000 to help finance a Bay Area home. The trade, dubbed a ‘box spread,’ carried a kind of mystique. By combining two opposing options positions — one bullish, one bearish — Yang built a strategy that mimics a fixed-rate loan: upfront cash now, repayment at a set date, and a locked-in cost in between. Yang used it to borrow at just 1.6% for five years — well below the rate on his traditional mortgage — creating a down payment without having to sell assets he wanted to keep in the market… Now, that same strategy powers SyntheticFi, a San Francisco-based fintech Yang co-founded to help others do the same. Box spread loans, also called synthetic borrowing, aren’t accessible to every buyer. They require sizable portfolios to back them. But for those with the assets, they offer speed, flexibility, and often a lower cost than traditional bank credit — plus potential tax advantages. Once a tool for hedge funds and family offices, box-spread loans now sit alongside direct indexing, custom portfolios, and options overlays — all pitched as tax-efficient ways to gain financial control.”<br/><br/>Inflation Watch:<br/><br/>October 29 – The Hill (Nathaniel Weixel): “The rates, pricing and other data for 2026 Affordable Care Act (ACA) insurance plans were publicly posted on the federal Healthcare.gov marketplace on Wednesday… The health research nonprofit KFF said the average increase in premiums for ACA plans will be 26% next year, based on data for ‘benchmark’ silver plans, which are the midtier plans in each region that most people purchase and are used to set the subsidy amounts.”<br/><br/>October 31 – CNBC (Greg Iacurci): “Open enrollment for health insurance bought on the Affordable Care Act marketplace starts Nov. 1 in most states — but millions of people may get a financial surprise when they try to sign up.

Consumers are ‘going to get huge sticker shock, because prices are going up,’ said Carolyn McClanahan, a physician and certified financial planner based in Jacksonville... That sticker shock could have significant ramifications for consumers’ finances and the choices they make about health coverage, experts say, contributing to a higher population of uninsured and underinsured consumers and soaring premiums in years to come.”<br/><br/>October 28 – Reuters (Vallari Srivastava): “U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs are set to raise operating costs, disrupt supply chains and weaken investment momentum for the oil and gas industry in 2026, a report published by Deloitte showed… The energy industry relies heavily on global supply chains and internationally sourced materials such as drilling rigs, valves, compressors and specialized steel are central to their operations.

China will ‘form an economic development model driven more by domestic demand and powered by consumption,’ it said.”<br/><br/>October 31 – Bloomberg: “China’s new-home sales extended a slump in October, despite recent easing measures introduced by major cities to revive the struggling property market. The value of new-home sales from the 100 largest property companies stood at 253 billion yuan ($35.6bn)… That represents a 41.9% drop from a year earlier…”<br/><br/>October 29 – Bloomberg: “China’s multi-year property crisis is set to drag on in 2026 and further weigh on banks’ asset quality, even after the government stepped up its stimulus push to boost demand, according to Fitch Ratings. The country’s new home sales by area may decline 15%-20% from their current level before the sector stabilizes, Lulu Shi, a director at Fitch… ‘China’s trickling stimulus measures didn’t pull the residential sector from a further slowdown,’ Shi said. ‘A meaningful property recovery will only come after the job market stabilizes and household income rebounds, which would require a basket of policies and a long period of time.’”<br/><br/>October 31 – CNBC (Anniek Bao): “China’s manufacturing activity in October contracted more than expected, shrinking to the lowest level in six months… The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index came in at 49.0…, missing economists’ expectations for 49.6... The latest reading reversed the recovery in recent months…”<br/><br/>October 30 – Bloomberg: “China Vanke Co. reported a deeper third-quarter loss, highlighting mounting challenges as the prolonged property market downturn continues to weigh on its sales. The… company posted a loss of 16.1 billion yuan ($2.3bn) in the three months ended Sept. 30, roughly doubling its loss in same period a year earlier.”<br/><br/>Central Bank Watch:<br/><br/>October 29 – Reuters (Promit Mukherjee and David Ljunggren): “The Bank of Canada signaled… an end to its cutting cycle after trimming its key overnight interest rate to 2.25%, but Governor Tiff Macklem said he would be ready to respond if Canada’s economic outlook changed materially. The 25-bps cut, the second in a row, brings the rate down to the lowest since July 2022. Macklem said the easing was designed to help the economy deal with the disruption from U.S. tariffs while keeping inflation close to the bank’s 2% target.”<br/><br/>Europe Watch:<br/><br/>October 27 – Wall Street Journal (Ed Frankl): “German business confidence rose a little in October…, driven by companies’ expectations that the economy will gain momentum next year. The Ifo Institute said… its business-climate index, based on around 9,000 monthly responses from businesses, rose to 88.4 in October from 87.7 in September.”<br/><br/>Japan Watch:<br/><br/>October 30 – Reuters (Leika Kihara): “The Bank of Japan’s cautious governor has dropped unusually hawkish hints of an interest rate hike in December or January next year, with the timing likely swayed not just by wage momentum but by moves in the yen. The central bank kept interest rates steady at 0.5%... as expected, but Governor Kazuo Ueda said the likelihood of its baseline scenario materialising has heightened - language he had used in the past to signal a rate hike was imminent.”<br/><br/>October 28 – Bloomberg (Toru Fujioka): “US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called on Japan’s new government to give the nation’s central bank the space to combat inflation — marking a stark contrast with his message at home for the Federal Reserve. ‘The Government’s willingness to allow the Bank of Japan policy space will be key to anchoring inflation expectations and avoiding excess exchange rate volatility,’ Bessent said…”<br/><br/>Emerging Market Watch:<br/><br/>October 31 – Bloomberg (Giovanna Bellotti Azevedo, Rachel Gamarski and Vinícius Andrade): “Brazil’s credit flareups are driving up borrowing costs and spooking investors, forcing companies in Latin America’s largest economy to scrap or scale down their plans to tap the debt market. Companies’ issuance of hard-currency bonds fell by more than half in October compared to the same period last year…”<br/><br/>Social, Political, Environmental, Cybersecurity Instability Watch:<br/><br/>October 27 – Axios (Tina Reed): “Migratory birds are driving up avian flu cases across the country, reviving concerns about U.S. readiness to respond to outbreaks, especially during the government shutdown. The most immediate concern is how the spread of the disease in commercial poultry flocks could drive up food prices. But the virus is continuing to evolve and spill over to other species, fueling fears of human-to-human transmissions and a possible pandemic. ‘It’s happening pretty fast and doesn’t seem to be slowing down and I’m really very unclear about what the U.S.’s approach is going to be,’ said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan.”<br/><br/>October 28 – Axios (Andrew Solender): “The national fight over redistricting is ramping up in this week, with several states taking new steps to redraw their congressional maps ahead of the 2026 elections. These changes could have reverberations for years as Democrats and Republicans scramble to nullify each other’s gains. Some states, for instance, are taking steps to bypass their independent redistricting commissions in order to embark on mid-decade redistricting. What could lie ahead is a never-ending, zero-sum arms race to squeeze every last drop of partisan advantage out of every congressional map.”<br/><br/>Geopolitical Watch:<br/><br/>October 28 – Financial Times (Demetri Sevastopulo, Leo Lewis and David Keohane): “Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has pledged to reinforce Japan’s defence capabilities as she and President Donald Trump vowed to bring the US-Japan security alliance into a ‘new golden age’… Takaichi warned that the two allies faced an ‘unprecedented severe security environment’. Stressing that ‘peace cannot be preserved by words alone,’ Takaichi, a security hawk who took office last week, said Japan was ‘ready to contribute even more proactively to peace and stability in the region’. Trump… said the ‘cherished alliance between the US and Japan is one of the most remarkable relationships in the world’.”</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/weekly-commentary-foreshocks?post=530460\">Weekly Commentary: Foreshocks</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/economics--politics/weekly-commentary-infestation?post=529250\">Weekly Commentary: Infestation</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/economics--politics/weekly-commentary-two-questions?post=527752\">Weekly Commentary: Two Questions</a></p></div>",

Despite record highs in many equity markets, beneath the surface, the global order is being re-engineered—one export restriction, cyberattack, and parliamentary deadlock at a time.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/><strong>US-China Tensions Move Away from the Immediate Brink</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Let’s start with the main event: the U.S.–China tech war. Washington thought it had cornered the semiconductor chessboard. By the end of September, the U.S. had expanded its extraterritorial export controls, tightening the screws on Chinese firms and their subsidiaries abroad. The sanctioned entity list grew longer, and the US appears to have encouraged the Netherlands to takeover the domestic operations of the Chinese-owned chip company, Nexperia, or the company would have been added to the list of sanctioned entities. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">But Beijing didn’t blink. Instead, it countered with its own extraterritorial licensing regime for critical minerals and technologies. It broadened and tightened its export licensing requirements for critical minerals and threatened to deny approval for any military application. The new rules meant that even foreign firms using Chinese-origin materials could face restrictions. It’s a mirror image of Washington’s playbook, and it’s aimed squarely at the semiconductor and AI sectors that have powered U.S. stocks and growth this year. Those two sectors alone account for roughly 40% of U.S. GDP expansion in the first half of 2025. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">A de-escalation was agreed in late October that provides for the shipment of rare earth magnets to US industry and a resumption of Chinese purchases of US agriculture goods, and possibly, energy. The port levies have been suspended, that the subsidiaries of sanctioned Chinese companies, will themselves no longer be sanction. The truce will ostensibly last a year; however, many are skeptical that it will be that durable. The US China hawks feel betrayed, and China's supply chain leverage extends beyond critical earths and magnets. Beijing has imposed export licensing requirements for EV batteries, and it dominates many precursors for pharmaceuticals. Chipmakers, like Nvidia and AMD continue to rely on inputs from China. </p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/><strong>Europe Faces Economic and Political Challenges</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Europe is no safe harbor. Germany, the continent’s industrial engine, is sputtering. Industrial output has collapsed to 20-year lows, dragged down by weak global demand, high energy costs, and a painful transition away from combustion engines. The export model that sustained Germany for decades is cracking, and there’s no obvious replacement.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">France isn’t faring much better politically. President Macron is struggling after last year's snap parliamentary elections failed to give his reforms a mandate. He miscalculated. The electorate balked. After going through three prime ministers, Macron has allowed a dilution of his controversial agenda. The retirement age will not be raised until after the 2027 president election, and the extent of budget cuts were reduced (next year's deficit may be 5.4% of GDP rather than 4.8%, and large businesses will face a higher tax while small businesses may see a cut. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, Russia continues its hybrid war against Europe. Fighter jets and drones have violated NATO airspace in the Baltics and Eastern Europe, while cyberattacks on infrastructure—from power grids to rail networks—have intensified. It’s a low-grade conflict designed to destabilize without triggering Article 5, and it’s working. European defense budgets are rising, but coordination remains patchy.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">A new flash point between the US and Europe may emerge in November. The EU is considering ESG legislation that would apply to US businesses. The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive requires viable climate transition plans and exposes legal liability for environment and human right violations in the value chains. US business groups have reportedly sought help from the US government to deter Europe. Many European businesses have also sought some dilution of the effort. The European Parliament is set to vote on the directive on November 13, and if it passes, it goes to the member states for approval. </p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/><strong>Takaichi's Victory Shakes Japanese Politics</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Across the globe, Japan has made history. The Liberal Democratic Party selected Takaichi Sanae as its new leader, making her the country’s first female prime minister. Takaichi has embraced the LDP’s traditional policy mix: easy money and fiscal stimulus. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">However, by not endorsing stronger reforms in the campaign finance, Takaichi lost the support of the LDP's junior partner for 26 years, the Komeito Party. However, she struck an accord with Japan's Innovation Party, and this solidifies her government. The new government, coupled with uninspiring data kept the Bank of Japan on the sidelines. Markets have responded predictably. The yen weakened sharply in October (almost 4%), and Japanese stocks have risen dramatically (the Nikkei's 16.6% rally was the largest monthly advance since October 1990). </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The broader global picture is one of divergence. The U.S. economy is outperforming, but the government shutdown acts as a drag. Europe is practically stagnating, and the German and locomotive continues to sputter. Japan is reflating, but at the cost of currency stability. China is slowing but flexing its geopolitical muscles. India and Southeast Asia are bright spots, benefiting from supply chain diversification and domestic demand.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/><strong>December Fed Cut Odds May Be Too High</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Central banks are threading the needle. Even with the government closed, the Federal Reserve resumed its easing cycle as the deterioration of the labor market offset the price pressures, which many officials want to look through as induced by the tariffs. There is more room for the market to reconsider the odds of a December cut. Despite Fed Chair Powell's best efforts, as the month closed, the derivatives market is still discounting about a 2/3 chance of a cut. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">We lean the other way. Without more evidence of either weakening of the labor market or easing of price pressures, The ECB may have completed its easing cycle, though risks mount for a cut next year. The market has pushed out a hike by the Bank of Japan into next year. China is cautiously loosening policy, trying to support growth without fueling asset bubbles.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/><strong>Precarious Time</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Trade policy has become a weapon. Export controls, investment screening, and industrial policy are now standard tools. The era of US-led globalization may be over, but through the strategic decoupling and focus on national security, new trade patterns are emerging that bypass the United States. The US accounts for about 15% of the world's goods trade. The other 85% seems more promising. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Canada now imports more cars from Mexico than the US, for example. Peru is seeking customers for its blueberries in Asia, Europe, and Africa. China is replacing US soybeans with product from South America. It is replacing US beef with Australian beef. New trade groups are forming. The World Trade Organization revised its estimate for merchandise trade growth to 2.4% from 0.9%. Last month, the IMF revised its forecast for world growth to 3.2% from its July projection of 3.0%. Its forecast for next year's growth was unchanged at 3.1%. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The risks are asymmetrical and biased lower. A misstep in the Taiwan Strait, a cyberattack on critical infrastructure, a prolonged shutdown of the US federal government could trigger outsized market reactions. A failure by Washington and Beijing to head off further escalation of their trade conflict could increasingly catch others in the crosshairs. Investors may be optimistic, but the tail risks are fattening.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">As we head into home stretch for 2025, the global economy is not in crisis—but it is in a precarious position. The tectonic plates are shifting, and the old maps no longer apply. The challenge for investors, policymakers, and businesses is to navigate a world where the rules are being rewritten in real time.  </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-j7PcChJGvif6Ajw0A3ozQjQ49Io4VBXfmGPA97DwWfUoV4dAJ3v-jtjvIDgW3EkbXw_-GlHxQxlDeuuSKql9lo8woZSa1DY6iUetjb0XZB9Gvcgx_toas2GtrWjSFy5N9VtduIKXCyDfKOWHp3KtFpcsdICrvUKiuqphVU-X59DLMXOdTItTZs7eLdxq/s952/bwci%20Nov%202025.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/><strong>Bannockburn World Currency Index </strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Bannockburn's World Currency Index, a GDP-weighted basket of the currencies of the dozen largest economies, fell for the second consecutive month. This reflected the decline of nearly all the components. The Russian ruble was the chief exception. It appreciated by about 2.4%. The Chinese yuan and Indian rupee eked out negligible gains. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Japanese yen was by far the weakest component. It fell by a little more than 4%. Sterling has the dubious honor of being the second weakest. It fell by about 2.4%. Among the high-income countries, the Canadian dollar fared best, losing about 0.65%. The Canadian dollar often outperforms in a firm US dollar environment. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">We had suggested last month the BWCI decline did not look complete. After the roughly 0.65% fall in October, the pullback still does not appear over. It appears to have scope for another 0.50% decline. This is consistent with additional dollar gains. We suspect there is more scope for the market to downgrade the chances of a Federal Reserve rate cut in December. The capital flight/dollar debasement meme in the financial press chiefly a first half story. Bannockburn's World Currency Index peaked on July 1. To be sure, we retain a medium and longer-term bearish dollar outlook, but we see near-term scope to extend the upside correction. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>U.S. Dollar:</strong>Although the US government was shut for the month of October, the dollar and stocks rallied. It was only the second month this year that the Dollar Index rose. The Atlanta Fed's GDP tracker estimates Q3 GDP of almost 4%, while the median forecast in Bloomberg's survey is for 2.7%. Spending related to AI is thought to account for more than half of US growth this year. The Federal Reserve cut rates in late October, but Chair Powell made an effort to dissuade the market from being confident of another rate cut in December. The market downgraded the odds from a little more than 90% to a still high 70%. There is room for further adjustment as Federal Reserve officials emerge from the self-imposed blackout period before the FOMC meeting. We lean against a December rate cut. The lack of US data, which may persist even after the government re-opens. The fact that headline inflation has risen for five consecutive months may steady the Fed's hand in the absence of further deterioration of the labor market, which Powell explicitly said he does not anticipate. Of course, as the longer the government shutdown lasts, the more disruptive it becomes. About 1.4 million federal employees missed a full paycheck in October. Roughly half are furloughed, while the other half are working without pay. A rule of thumb is that every week shaves GDP by 0.1%. Meanwhile, the tariffs the US imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) have been challenged, and the Supreme Court will hear the oral arguments on November 5. Reports suggest a secondary market has emerged for the possible tariff refunds if the Supreme Court rules that the tariffs exceeded presidential authority. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Euro:</strong> After rallying in the first half of the year, the euro entered a broad sideways phase. The range is about $1.15-$1.18. A downside breakout in late July proved false, as was the upside break higher to a new multi-year highs near $1.1920. The US two-year premium over Germany from over 200 bp in late May to about 150 bp, in mid-September and rose to a little above 160 bp. The current policy rates are about 225 bp wide. The swaps market implies a 100 bp differential in a year. Europe is being squeezed by the combination of China's export controls of critical minerals and EV battery technology threaten European industry, which has already had to deal with the import shock from China, the tariff shock from the US, and the hybrid warfare by Russia. The Dutch government take-over of the Nexperia (the previous Netherland's based chip business purchased by a Chinese company) to avoid US sanctions appears to have created unintended consequences and the ire of Beijing. It is in an awkward position now that the US has agreed not to sanction the subsidiaries of Chinese companies on the entity list. The German economy struggles to sustain forward momentum, and neither Beijing nor Washington seem to take it seriously. France is in an uneasy political stalemate, which has further eroded its debt quality. . The swaps market reflects the view that the ECB is done easing. The indicative pricing is for less than 50% of another cut next year. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">(As of October 31, indicative closing prices, previous in parentheses) </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Spot: </strong>$1.1535 ($1.1705) <strong>Median Bloomberg One-month forecast:</strong> $1.1675 ($1.1770) <strong>One-month forward:</strong> $1.1555 ($1.1725) <strong>One-month implied vol: </strong>5.3% (6.3%)</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Japanese Yen:</strong>The policy mix anticipated by the new Japanese government weighed on the yen in October. The yen's roughly 4.0% decline is led the G10 currencies lower. Japan industry is vulnerable to the new export controls introduced by China. The surge in oil prices following the US (and EU) sanction Russia's two large oil companies lifted oil prices sharply and that also works against the yen. with a new support package being put together to help absorb some of the price pressures and promote key sectors, like AI, chips, and processing critical minerals. After a dismal August, the economy recovered in September, but it seems fragile, especially given Beijing's threat, even though the Nikkei and Topix are at record highs. The long end of the bond market rallied, and the 30-year was hovering near 3% in late October, the lowest since early July. The OECD's model of purchasing power estimate that the yen is a little more than 60% undervalued and has not been less undervalued that 50% in the past two years, and yet Japan continues to run a trade deficit. Domestic political considerations and geopolitical forces overwhelmed the usual driver of the exchange rate, US rates. The dollar has recouped nearly 3/4 of the losses inflicted in the first four months of the year. While a move toward JPY155 cannot be ruled out, the dollar's recovery of nearly 10% since April's low appears stretched, especially given the gravitational pull of interest rates. The US 10-year yield premium over Japan fell to about 230 bp, the least in three years, before firming into the end of the month. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Spot:</strong> JPY154.00 (JPY149.50) <strong>Median Bloomberg One-month forecast:</strong> JPY150.30 (JPY147.60) <strong>One-month forward:</strong> JPY153.55 (JPY149.00). <strong>One-month implied vol:</strong> 7.8% (8.4%)</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>British Pound:</strong> In October, sterling extended the downtrend begun with the downside reversal 2 1/2-month high ($1.3725) after the Federal Reserve's rate hike on September 17. It was sold to its lowest level since April at the end of October, slightly below $1.31. There has been renewed speculation of a Bank of England rate cut this year. The odds implied by the swaps market increased from almost 25% at the end of September to a little less 70% at the end of October. The market is pricing in about a 30%chance of hike at the November 6 meeting. That seems exaggerated. Instead, we suspect the Fall Budget on November 26 may be more impactful. After a six-week campaign, the Labour Party chose Powell as deputy leader. She is seen as part of the more left criticism. This was seen too in a byelection in the Welsh parliament in a district that ousted for the first time in more than a century. On the other hand, the Starmer government faces the challenge of Farage's Reform Party. Chancellor Reeve's budget must reflect these forces. There are also the fiscal reality and Labour's campaign promises. The GBP10 bln buffer projected is too small and she has is talking about increasing it, which means tax increase and/or spending cuts. No one is likely to be happy with the results. Marginal tax rates on the highest incomes may be raised; thresholds could be adjusted so one pays higher taxes (bracket creep). taxing private school fees are reportedly under discussion. Sterling rose by around 14% from the January low through July 1 (to almost $1.38). With the late October losses, it has fallen slightly more than 5%. The $1.2950-$1.3000 area offers the next target. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Spot: </strong>$1.3150 ($1.3400) <strong>Median Bloomberg One-month forecast:</strong> $1.3335 ($1.3505) <strong>One-month forward:</strong> $1.3155 ($1.3405) <strong>One-month implied vol:</strong> 7.0% (6.3%)</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Canadian Dollar:</strong> The Canadian dollar was the performers in the G10 in October. It fell by about 0.65% against the US dollar. The Bank of Canada began easing last year as the economy weakened, but the disruption from the US was still meaningful. A new flash point emerged as the province of Ontario ran an advertisement during the baseball World Series that showed former President Reagan's critical of tariffs. President Trump was irate and suspended all trade talks with Canada and slapped an additional 10% tariff on Canada (though as of the end of the month, it does not appear to have been implemented). Prime Minister Carney is seeking new trade ties and aims to double Canada's exports to non-US parties in the next decade. A new flash point may emerge if Canada strikes a trade deal, even if limited, with China. The US imports around 80% of the potash it consumes and Canada accounts for a little more than 90%. Canada has not sought to weaponize potash. The US dollar may re-challenge the six-month high set in October near CAD1.4080. A move above there targets the CAD1.4160 area. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Spot:</strong> CAD1.4010 (CAD 1.3940) <strong>Median Bloomberg One-month forecast:</strong> CAD1.3900 (CAD1.3825) <strong>One-month forward:</strong> CAD1.3990 (CAD1.3920) <strong>One-month implied vol:</strong> 3.9% (4.3%)</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Australian Dollar:</strong> The Australian dollar's downside correction that began with new highs of the year a little below $0.6710 when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates on September 17 and continued through the first half of October. Intraday spikes to $0.6440 were snapped up and the Australian dollar did not settle below $0.6485 after the low was recorded. Still support around $0.6530 looks vulnerable.An adjustment of expectations of the trajectory of monetary policy may have also been completed around the middle of October. The implied policy rate at the end of 2026 fell from 3.35% to a little below 3.10%, where is also where it bottomed in mid-September.The futures market sees practically now chance of a rate cut in November and December. The critical minerals pact with the US and President Trump's affirmation of the submarine deal under AUKUS further strengthens the bilateral relationship. Although Australia's stock market is at record highs, its less than 9% gain year-to-date underperforms most of bourses among high-income countries. We continue to see potential into the $0.7000-$0.7200 area by the end of next year.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Spot:</strong> $0.6545 ($0.6545) <strong>Median Bloomberg One-month forecast:</strong> $0.6625 ($0.6600) <strong>One-month forward:</strong> $0.6550 ($0.6555) <strong>One-month implied vol:</strong> 7.4% (8.1%). </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Mexican Peso:</strong>The dollar spent most of October trading quietly in the trough after declining in the first three quarters. The greenback recorded the low for the year in September near MXN18.20. The low for October was set the first day of the month around MXN18.24. There were three sessions in which the dollar traded above MXN18.60 and all three took place when US equities fell. Although price pressures are elevated, and the core rate is above the upper end of the target range (3% +/- 1 percentage point), the concerns about growth are more salient for the central bank. In Q3, the economy contracted on a year-over-year basis for the first time since Q1 21. Banxico is likely to cut its overnight target rate by 25 bp in early November to 7.25%. The swaps market anticipates another cut in H1 26 and sees the terminal rate near 7%. The external account looks healthier with a trade deficit of almost $3 bln recorded in the first nine months of the year compared with a nearly $19.5 bln shortfall in the first three quarters of last year. President Sheinbaum continues to receive high marks for navigating around and with the mercurial US president. Her public support remains high. Colombia and Brazil have more strained relationships with the US administration. The high yields offered relative to Mexico have lent their respective currencies more support in the past month. Since the Federal Reserve's rate cut in mid-September, Mexico's carry for dollar based investors has not been sufficient to compensate for the spot movement. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Spot:</strong> MXN18.55 (MXN18.3670) <strong>Median Bloomberg One-month forecast:</strong> MXN18.6025 (MXN18.6550) <strong>One-month forward:</strong> MXN18.6075 (MXN18.4280) <strong>One-month implied vol:</strong> 7.3% (8.4%)</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Chinese Yuan: </strong>The Chinese yuan was practically flat against the US dollar in October. This leaves the onshore yuan about 2.5% lower year-over-year, and the offshore yuan down about 3.0%. Still, there were two notable developments. First, the PBOC has steadily lowered the dollar's reference rate in the daily setting. It has been taken to its lowest level since last October, and the campaign does not appear over. Through the setting of the \"fix\" that officials exert broad control of the exchange rate. It does not permit trades that imply the dollar move more than 2% from the reference rate. Second, because the yuan shadows the dollar so tightly and the dollar has fallen against most currencies, so has the yuan. However, that is really more of a story for the first half of the year. Since the end of June, the dollar, and therefore the yuan, has appreciated against most G10 currencies, including a little more than 7.0% against the Japanese yen, 4.9% against sterling, and 3.5% against the Canadian dollar. The euro is off around 2.8%. The South Korean won has fallen by nearly 6% and the Taiwanese dollar has lost about 4.4%. The broad strokes of what may shape China's next five-year plan, to be published next spring, emerged and it seems Beijing is committed to becoming less dependent on foreign inputs while still maintaining absolute advantage in several key sectors or \"commanding heights\". Despite claims that China is export-dependent, as a percentage of GDP, near 20%, they are quite modest for other major countries, with US as the notable exception (~11%). The dollar spent October between about CNH7.0850 and CNH7.15. It finished near CNH7.1200. There may be scope to probe the upper end of the range, but we do not expect to see much beyond it. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Spot:</strong> CNY7.1200 (CNY7.1345) <strong>Median Bloomberg One-month forecast:</strong> CNY7.1095 (CNY7.1225) <strong>One-month forward:</strong> CNY7.0870 (CNY7.1055) <strong>One-month implied vol:</strong> 2.5% (2.6%)</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/us-china-agree-to-unwind-recent-actions?post=531894\">US-China Agree To Unwind Recent Actions</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/japanese-verbal-intervention-was-more-effective-than-bassets-and-the-dollar-is-bid-ahead-of-fomc-outcome?post=531392\">Japanese Verbal Intervention Was More Effective Than Basset's, And The Dollar Is Bid Ahead Of FOMC Outcome </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/japans-warning-and-successful-us-japan-talks-see-yen-snap-seven-day-slide?post=531077\">Japan's Warning And Successful US-Japan Talks See Yen Snap Seven-Day Slide</a></p></div>",

This week’s spotlight is <strong>Global Ship Lease, Inc. (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GSL\">GSL</a>)</strong> — a containership charter owner with long-term, fixed-rate contracts providing stable and visible cash flows in the volatile global shipping sector.</p><h3><br/><strong>Business Overview</strong></h3><p>Headquartered in London, GSL owns and charters a diversified fleet of mid-sized and smaller containerships on long-term time charters to leading liner companies. These charters typically provide multi-year revenue visibility and protection from short-term spot-rate volatility. The company benefits from fleet expansion and accretive vessel acquisitions during market downturns, positioning itself to compound value as freight rates and charter durations normalize.</p><p><br/><strong>What is IV/P (Intrinsic Value to Price)?</strong></p><p>IV/P tells you whether a stock offers more intrinsic value than the price you are paying for it. The calculation blends earnings power, reinvestment efficiency, and capital return policy to estimate intrinsic value — a conservative measure of what the business is worth.</p><p>The interpretation is straightforward:</p><ul><li>IV/P above 1 suggests undervaluation.</li><li>IV/P below 1 suggests overvaluation.</li><li>The further above 1, the more value you may be getting per dollar invested.</li></ul><p>GSL’s IV/P is <strong>1.70</strong>, meaning its intrinsic value is estimated to be roughly 70% higher than its current market price — a strong signal of potential undervaluation.</p><p><br/><strong>Supporting Metrics</strong></p><p><strong>Market Cap:</strong> ~$1.017 B<br/><strong>Enterprise Value (EV):</strong> ~$1.288 B<br/><strong>Free Cash Flow (TTM):</strong> ~$142 M<br/><strong>Free Cash Flow Yield:</strong> ~11%<br/><strong>Acquirer’s Multiple:</strong> 3.3</p><p>Global Ship Lease (GSL) trades at a market cap of about $1.0 billion and an enterprise value of $1.3 billion, generating roughly $142 million in free cash flow—equating to an ~11% FCF yield and an Acquirer’s Multiple of 3.3, highlighting strong cash generation relative to valuation.</p><p><br/><strong>Revenue &amp; Profitability</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Revenue (TTM):</strong> $730 M</li><li><strong>Operating Income (TTM):</strong> $381 M</li><li><strong>Operating Margin:</strong> ~52%</li><li><strong>Net Income (TTM):</strong> $383 M</li><li><strong>Net Margin:</strong> ~52%</li><li><strong>Diluted EPS (TTM):</strong> $10.70</li></ul><p>Profitability has remained robust, supported by long-term charters that lock in high-margin contracts. Even as freight markets cooled from 2022 peaks, GSL sustained strong operating margins and earnings stability — a rarity in the cyclical shipping space.</p><p><br/><strong>Balance Sheet Strength</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cash &amp; Equivalents:</strong> ~$167M</li><li><strong>Total Debt:</strong> ~$684M</li><li><strong>Net Debt:</strong> ~$533M</li><li><strong>Shareholder Equity:</strong> ~$1.46B</li></ul><p>GSL maintains a solid balance sheet with strong equity backing and ample liquidity relative to its vessel commitments. While leverage remains moderate due to fleet financing, the company’s substantial asset base and steady contracted cash flows provide flexibility for future fleet expansion and shareholder returns.</p><p><br/><strong>Capital Returns</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Dividend Yield (TTM):</strong> ~6–7%</li><li><strong>Total Dividends Paid (TTM):</strong> ~$76 M</li><li><strong>Capital Expenditure (TTM):</strong> ~$304 M</li></ul><p>GSL continues to return capital to shareholders through a growing dividend while reinvesting in its fleet. The company’s disciplined capital allocation — balancing fleet renewal with dividends — supports both sustainability and long-term compounding.</p><h3><br/><strong>Why Might GSL Be Undervalued?</strong></h3><p>Shipping stocks often trade at deep discounts due to cyclicality and investor hesitation following previous booms and busts. Yet GSL’s long-term charter coverage, strong free cash flow, and solid balance sheet differentiate it from typical shipping plays. Its Acquirer’s Multiple of 3.3 and IV/P of 1.70 suggest the market is mispricing a company that generates stable, contracted cash flows and yields double-digit free-cash-flow returns.</p><h3><br/><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>With an IV/P of 1.70, an Acquirer’s Multiple of 3.3, and a free cash flow yield of roughly 11%, <strong>Global Ship Lease (GSL)</strong> represents a compelling deep-value opportunity in the transportation sector. For patient investors, the combination of strong earnings visibility, high cash generation, and shareholder-friendly capital returns offers a rare setup: a cyclical business behaving like a compounding cash machine.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/meta-platforms-inc-our-calculation-of-intrinsic-value?post=532292\">Meta Platforms, Inc.: Our Calculation Of Intrinsic Value</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/why-small-caps-are-poised-for-a-multi-year-comeback?post=531162\">Why Small Caps Are Poised For A Multi-Year Comeback</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/tesla-inc-q3-2025-revenue-up-12-free-cash-flow-hits-new-record?post=530929\">Tesla, Inc.

Following the talks, both sides announced a modest set of agreements aimed at improving trade relations.</p><p>The U.S. agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese imports by 10%, while China committed to purchasing more U.S. agricultural goods—particularly soybeans—and delaying certain export controls on rare earth minerals. Both nations also postponed new port fees and trade restrictions on each other. While these measures fell short of a comprehensive trade deal, they represent a constructive step toward de-escalation in U.S.-China relations.</p><p>Equity markets responded to the news with restraint, with U.S. stocks even pulling back during the day on Thursday, as some investors may have been hoping for a broader deal. Still, the developments signal a cooling of tensions that could pave the way for more substantive negotiations between the two countries in the months ahead.</p><p>Next week, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear a case regarding the legality of certain reciprocal tariffs. Even if the Court were to strike down portions of them, there are still other ways for the U.S. to impose tariffs on key trading partners. From a macro perspective, we think the current tariff environment will only have a modest hit to U.S. growth. Our central scenario is still for the U.S. economy to achieve a soft landing.</p><h2><br/>Fed, BoC lower rates while BoJ stands pat</h2><p>Central bank announcements also made headlines this week, with both the Bank of Canada (BoC) and the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) lowering interest rates by 0.25%, while the Bank of Japan (BoJ) opted to stay on hold.</p><p>The BoC’s decision brought its policy rate down to 2.25%, which is the lower end of its estimated neutral rate—the rate that neither speeds up nor slows down the economy. With rates at this level, there will likely be a higher threshold for additional cuts, though the central bank still reiterated its data-dependent stance. If the Canadian economy weakens further—<a href=\"https://russellinvestments.com/content/ri/us/en/insights/russell-research/2025/09/economy-gdp-spike-mwir.html\">a plausible scenario</a> given its relative vulnerability compared to the U.S.—further easing in December or early 2026 can’t be ruled out.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Fed’s rate cut was also widely anticipated. Chair Jerome Powell noted that while the recent U.S. government shutdown has disrupted access to some official data, the central bank can use private-sector indicators to gauge the state of the economy. These numbers suggest the labor market has softened but is still resilient, which should allow the Fed to gradually lower rates.</p><p>By contrast, the BoJ left borrowing rates unchanged. However, officials signaled rate hikes may be on the horizon as Japan attempts to normalize its monetary policy. </p><h2><br/>U.S. earnings remain a bright spot</h2><p>Earnings reports this week underscored the <a href=\"https://russellinvestments.com/content/ri/us/en/insights/russell-research/2025/10/macro-vitals-data-dead-zone-mwir.html\">continued strength of corporate America</a>. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking above 12% year-over-year, while revenue growth stands near 8%—one of the strongest revenue growth readings in recent years.</p><p>This robust earnings performance supports the view that corporate profitability remains healthy, helping keep layoffs low and bolstering the case for a <a href=\"https://russellinvestments.com/content/ri/us/en/insights/russell-research/2025/10/why-gold-prices-falling-mwir.html\">soft landing</a>. </p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/us-economy-flexes-muscle-with-gdp-spike?post=525168\">U.S. Economy Flexes Muscle With GDP Spike</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/summer-sizzle-stocks-stay-hot-earnings-heat-up?post=515726\">Summer Sizzle: Stocks Stay Hot, Earnings Heat Up</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/us-economy-slows-is-a-soft-landing-still-likely?post=514380\">U.S. Economy Slows - Is A Soft Landing Still Likely?</a></p></div>",

Nexperia holds about 40% of the market for these essential chips, and roughly 60% of its $2 billion annual revenue comes from automakers.</p><p>China’s decision to grant selective exemptions appears directly linked to the Trump-Xi summit held Thursday in Busan.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/white-house-to-announce-auto-chip-shipments-to-resume-from-china-88ef4db0\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street Journal </a>reported that the resumption of Nexperia shipments was part of the broader trade deal agreed by the two leaders, which also included suspending Trump’s threatened 100% tariff on Chinese goods, halving the fentanyl-linked tariff from 20% to 10%, and pausing China’s export controls on rare earth minerals for one year.</p><h2><br/>Could Nvidia be next after the Trump-Xi meeting?</h2><p>The semiconductor discussions between Trump and Xi have raised hopes and questions about whether Nvidia could regain access to China’s massive market.</p><p>Trump confirmed aboard Air Force One that he and Xi “did discuss chips” and that China would be “talking with Nvidia and others” about purchasing American-made semiconductors.</p><p>However, the president quickly clarified that the talks did not cover Nvidia’s most advanced Blackwell chip, a state-of-the-art AI processor he had previously described as “super-duper” and “probably 10 years ahead of any other chip”.</p><p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed optimism about the potential for re-entering China while acknowledging the final decision rests with Trump.</p><blockquote><p>We always hope to go back to China, and I believe Nvidia’s being there is good for both the United States and China.</p></blockquote><p><br/>The stakes couldn’t be higher for Nvidia.</p><p>After Beijing urged tech giants like ByteDance and Alibaba to stop buying its H20 chip, a China-compliant version of its flagship AI hardware, Nvidia’s business in the country has basically vanished.</p><p>CEO Jensen Huang said in October that the company’s share of China’s AI accelerator market plunged from about 95% to zero, wiping out billions in revenue.</p><p>That’s a huge blow, considering China once made up 20–25% of Nvidia’s $41 billion data center business.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/amazon-shares-surge-12-lifting-markets-as-aws-revival-sparks-stock-surge?post=532462\">Amazon Shares Surge 12%, Lifting Markets As AWS Revival Sparks Stock Surge </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/twilio-stock-soars-20-on-record-q3-results-and-strong-ai-driven-outlook?post=532435\">Twilio Stock Soars 20% On Record Q3 Results And Strong AI-Driven Outlook </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/colgate-palmolive-posts-higher-q3-sales-as-pricing-gains-offset-volume-decline?post=532302\">Colgate-Palmolive Posts Higher Q3 Sales As Pricing Gains Offset Volume Decline </a></p></div>",

Over the past 10 years, <strong>Netflix stock has had an average annualized return of 26% per year</strong>.</p><p>This year, Netflix stock is right at that number, <strong>up 26% year-to-date, trading at around $1,122 per share</strong>. But soon, investors will be able to <strong>buy Netflix stock at a much lower entry price</strong>.</p><p>On Thursday, the <strong>company announced a 10-for-1 stock split</strong>, meaning that each share of Netflix will be split into 10.</p><h2><br/>Why is Netflix doing a stock split?</h2><p>Companies typically do stock splits when their share price gets too lofty. Last year, the big one was <strong>Nvidia</strong> (Nasdaq: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/NVDA\">NVDA</a>), which did a 10-for-1 stock split in June that brought the share price down from around $1,200 to around $120 per share.</p><p>While it doesn’t change the actual value of the stock, it allows investors to <strong>own more shares of a stock than they did before</strong>. <strong>Broadcom</strong> (Nasdaq: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AVGO\">AVGO</a>) also did a 10-for-1 split last year, while <strong>Chipotle</strong> (Nasdaq: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/CMG\">CMG</a>) did a 50-for-1 split. Other recent big name stock splits include a 3-for-1 split by <strong>Walmart</strong> (NYSE: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/WMT\">WMT</a>) in 2024 and 20-for-1 splits by both <strong>Alphabet</strong> (Nasdaq: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GOOG\">GOOG</a>) and <strong>Amazon</strong> (Nasdaq: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AMZN\">AMZN</a>) in 2022.</p><p>With <strong>Netflix, the 10-for-1 split should bring the stock price down to $110 to $120 per share</strong>, depending on its share price when the split takes effect on November 17.</p><p>Each Netflix shareholder as of the closing bell on <strong>November 10 will receive, after the close of trading on November 14, nine additional shares for every share held</strong>. Trading is expected to begin on a split-adjusted basis on November 17.</p><p>Netflix officials said the purpose of the stock split is to <strong>“reset the market price of the company’s common stock </strong>to a range that will be more accessible to employees who participate in the company’s stock option program.”</p><p>While it’s not always the case, a stock split like this can boost the stock price, as more investors buy in, wanting to get the additional shares at a lower price. That seemed to be happening on Friday, as <strong>Netflix shares were up about 3% on the day</strong>.</p><p>Looking ahead, there are some new prime candidates for stock splits, namely <strong>Booking</strong> (Nasdaq: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/BKNG\">BKNG</a>) trading at over $5,000 per share, <strong>AutoZone </strong>(NYSE: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AZO\">AZO</a>) at over $3,600 per share, and <strong>BlackRock</strong> (NYSE: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/BLK\">BLK</a>) at around $1,100 per share, to name a few.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/company-news/nexus-international-plans-ipo-in-2027-with-revenue-on-track-for-1b-by-year-end?post=532379\">Nexus International Plans IPO In 2027 With Revenue On Track For $1B By Year-End</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/microsoft-stock-sinks-on-ai-spending?post=532007\">Microsoft Stock Sinks On AI Spending? </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/one-of-the-best-ai-stocks-just-got-better-after-blowout-earnings?post=531538\">One Of The Best AI Stocks Just Got Better After Blowout Earnings</a></p></div>",

I read pieces in the business press and random articles that more knowledgeable friends pass along. But I can’t say I have any knowledge of the nuts and bolts of the technology. </p><p>However, I can understand costs and the story there does not look very good for the United States AI industry. It looks like the latest offerings from China offer comparable speed in computing at a small fraction of the cost. According to this <a href=\"https://winbuzzer.com/2025/10/28/chinas-new-minimax-m2-model-challenges-gpt-5-and-claude-4-5-with-ultra-efficiency-top-performance-low-cost-xcxwbn/\">piece</a> on the new MiniMax M2 Model, it can deliver performance that is comparable to the cutting edge U.S. models, at just 8 percent of the cost. This system is also open source. That makes it cheaper to adopt and alter than proprietary models. </p><p>The need to develop efficient techniques was forced on China’s AI companies by the decision to deny them the most advanced computer chips produced by Nvidia and other chip makers. It now looks as though this prohibition may not have been a smart path from a competitive standpoint, even if it meant that the United States might have better AI in some abstract sense. Given the enormous need for electricity and water by data centers, it is a great thing that China seems to have designed systems requiring far less computing power, and therefore less electricity and water.</p><p>It is also worth noting that, while access to low-cost electricity may be a real constraint on the progress of AI in the United States, that is not likely to be a problem in China. Electricity there is plentiful, and the average <a href=\"https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/China/electricity_prices/\">price</a> is less than <a href=\"https://www.energybot.com/electricity-rates/\">half</a> as much as it is here. </p><p>With tech stocks hitting ever higher levels (Nvidia <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/nvda\">NVDA</a> just crossed $5 trillion in market capitalization), it’s hard to believe there is not a serious bubble in the U.S. markets. Having lived through two major bubbles in my adult life, I am used to the optimists coming up with ever whackier stories. </p><p>For example, for Nvidia’s current stock price to make sense, the company would have to earn about 10 percent of all projected corporate profits five years out. That’s not impossible, but I wouldn’t bet on it. I heard similar projections about Cisco Systems and other tech companies in the 1990s bubble. </p><p>I also remember being assured in the 00s that house prices could never plummet because they are not traded like stocks on an exchange. (I believe Federal Reserve Board Chair Alan Greenspan once pushed that line.) They also said that we had never seen the sort of nationwide plunge in house prices I was predicting. I pointed out that we had never seen the sort of nationwide run-up in prices that the country saw from 1996 to 2005.</p><p>Anyhow, it sure looks like a bubble to me. It will be ironic if the success of China’s AI is what ends up being the proximate cause of its bursting.  </p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/economics--politics/the-economics-of-trade-and-trumps-little-water-pistol?post=530544\">The Economics Of Trade And Trump’s Little Water Pistol </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/no-economists-didnt-get-it-wrong-on-trumps-tariffs?post=530430\">No, Economists Didn’t Get It Wrong On Trump’s Tariffs</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-trump-boom-a-legend-in-his-own-mind?post=529325\">The Trump Boom: A Legend In His Own Mind </a></p></div>",

It allocates to equities, fixed income and alternatives based on a proprietary model. The fund holds some ETFs but a lot of individual issues.

I included <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AQRIX\">AQRIX</a> because it is risk-parityish and somewhere in the literature I saw a quick reference to risk-parity.</p><p>Here's how actual RAA has done since inception. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"322\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjETMyobur3P8PKUIK_i_GuKbfV8wOMYgFcDyFTloElOehw-tOg8BGp4Jedz6ioYjrTtVcdvfBAfxnREpbTDl5Go3AUEaDjqTBvxG5ewIysLEScdeuYyjdbG3EVQzaSjAEbpxNPx4KxIg7jN0ZuXOelUlRd35L-CracpE1EHh8k8ln5GTx95H0Prg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>I threw FAPYX in because it is also risk-parity but only been around a couple of years. Without knowing how RAA was positioned earlier, it's hard to know why it lagged the replication we built. Looking at the drawdown chart, really only FAPYX seems to differentiate in any noticeable way.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"144\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjyLFbUtlgm7h7WGvxs6lMByThTmP8A_l-Hcg3YWnBtXVSC5cbdOTh7PJB88Dx4qQGdEl8q7gkJJKGypGTVFfsknX3jKOrDpXbUAyCX7xtJsrSM5QCSEMqNYJ2qBqtIwXRTOhYpXxFwIGmBdxj2FXkeeDU2_vVbuVPPkWZCKUnjksoOeyvbrGO2GQ\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>If the idea is to differentiate, then it is not clear that RAA does that but in fairness it might be too soon to know. It has been a little more volatile than <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/VBAIX\">VBAIX</a> or either risk parity fund and had a slightly larger drawdown.

Unintended is the reiteration of how important it is to go down less during that part of the cycle. Portfolio 2 lagged by a lot in 2023 and has been nothing special in the other years except 2022 yet it came out ahead for four+ years. </p><p>There doesn't appear to be anything obviously wrong with RAA but at this point, as noted above, I'm not sure it will differentiate. As a believer in alts, it seems plausible that it could be a slightly better mousetrap than VBAIX.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/is-strategys-debt-junk?post=531169\">Is Strategy's Debt Junk?</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/options/am-i-diversified?post=530505\">Am I Diversified?</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/theyre-here-levered-derivative-income-funds?post=529524\">They're Here!

For example, the S&amp;P 500’s current yield is only ~1.2%.</p><p>High-yield stocks can be particularly helpful in shoring up income after retirement. A $120,000 investment in stocks with an average dividend yield of 5% creates an average of <strong>$500 a month in dividends</strong>.</p><p>Next on our list of <a href=\"https://www.suredividend.com/high-dividend-stocks/\">high-dividend stocks</a> to review is Delek Logistics Partners (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/DKL\">DKL</a>).</p><h3><br/><strong>Business Overview</strong></h3><p>Delek Logistics Partners, LP (NYSE: DKL) is a master limited partnership (MLP) based in Brentwood, Tennessee, formed in 2012 by Delek US Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DK). The company owns and operates an extensive network of midstream energy infrastructure, including roughly 850 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines and a 700-mile crude oil gathering system across the southeastern United States and West Texas. Its assets play a key role in supporting Delek US’s refining operations, particularly at refineries in Tyler, Texas, and El Dorado, Arkansas.</p><p>In addition to transporting and storing crude oil, Delek Logistics also markets, distributes, and stores refined petroleum products for Delek US and third-party customers. The partnership benefits from stable, fee-based revenue under long-term agreements, which helps reduce exposure to commodity price volatility. Through steady expansion projects and strategic acquisitions, Delek Logistics continues to strengthen its position in the midstream sector, providing essential infrastructure that connects crude oil production areas with key refining and distribution markets.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"381\" src=\"https://www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-28-at-6.10.21-PM-768x418.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: <a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/790371638/files/doc_presentations/2025/Apr/01/DKL-Investor-Update-Apr-2025.pdf\">Investor Relations</a></p><p><br/>Delek Logistics Partners reported strong Q2 2025 results, with earnings per share of $1.41—beating estimates by $0.22. Revenue was $246.35 million, down 6.9% year-over-year and below expectations. Net income reached $44.6 million, and Adjusted EBITDA rose 18% to $120.9 million. The company reaffirmed full-year Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $480–$520 million and announced its 50th consecutive quarterly distribution increase to $1.115 per unit. Delek also completed the Libby 2 gas processing plant in New Mexico and issued $700 million in new debt maturing in 2033, boosting total liquidity to over $1 billion.</p><p>The Gathering and Processing segment led growth, with Adjusted EBITDA climbing to $78 million from $54.7 million last year, driven by recent acquisitions. The Wholesale Marketing and Terminalling segment declined to $23.3 million due to a contract reassignment, while Storage and Transportation held steady at $16.9 million. Operating cash flow rose to $107.4 million, and distributable cash flow totaled $72.5 million. President Avigal Soreq highlighted plans to expand gas-treating capacity at the Libby Complex and to maintain strong balance-sheet discipline. With solid liquidity, consistent distribution growth, and improving cash generation, Delek Logistics remains well-positioned for steady midstream expansion.</p><h3><br/><strong>Growth Prospects</strong></h3><p>The company has a strong growth outlook, with analysts expecting distributable cash flow (DCF) per unit to rise at a 3.7% annual rate over the next five years. Growth will be driven by expanding sour natural gas treating and acid gas injection operations, integrating the Gravity Water Midstream acquisition, and pursuing additional strategic deals. These initiatives aim to increase efficiency, scale, and profitability across key U.S. basins while supporting steady cash flow generation.</p><p>The company also launched a $150 million unit repurchase program to enhance unitholder value and maintain financial discipline. While DKL’s payout ratio is currently high, management expects distribution growth to trail DCF growth to preserve flexibility for reinvestment. Backed by a fee-based business model and a strong track record of execution, Delek Logistics is positioned for stable and sustainable growth through 2030.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-28-at-6.11.10-PM-768x428.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: <a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/790371638/files/doc_presentations/2025/Apr/01/DKL-Investor-Update-Apr-2025.pdf\">Investor Relations</a></p><h3><br/><strong>Competitive Advantages &amp; Recession Performance</strong></h3><p>Delek Logistics Partners has key competitive advantages, including a large midstream network connecting major production areas to refineries and long-term, fee-based contracts that reduce exposure to commodity price swings. Recent expansions and acquisitions, such as Libby 2 and Gravity Water Midstream, further increase scale, efficiency, and service capabilities.</p><p>The company has proven resilient in economic downturns, with diversified operations generating stable cash flow even when commodity prices fall. Disciplined capital management and contracted revenue streams help maintain distributions and financial stability, making DKL well-positioned to perform across market cycles.</p><h3><br/><strong>Dividend Analysis</strong></h3><p>Delek Logistics Partners’ annual dividend is $4.46 per share. At its recent share price, the stock has a high yield of 9.8%.</p><p>Given the company’s 2025 earnings outlook, EPS is expected to be $5.95 per share. As a result, the company is expected to pay out75% of its EPS to shareholders in dividends.</p><h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p><br/>Delek Logistics Partners combines a high distribution yield, steady growth, and potential valuation expansion, with distributable cash flow per unit projected to grow 3.7% annually through 2030. Strategic acquisitions and infrastructure projects, including Gravity Water Midstream and sour gas treating, support its growth and distribution track record.</p><p>However, with an elevated payout ratio and a dividend risk score of F, distribution growth may be limited. While total returns could reach 15.3% annually, the company is rated a Hold due to this moderate dividend risk.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/high-dividend-50-hooker-furnishings-corp?post=532424\">High Dividend 50: Hooker Furnishings Corp.</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/high-dividend-50-permrock-royalty-trust?post=532038\">High Dividend 50: PermRock Royalty Trust</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/high-dividend-50-golub-capital-bdc-inc?post=531808\">High Dividend 50: Golub Capital BDC, Inc.</a><br/></div>",

The pattern recently broke out to the upside on the chart. This signals a potential trend reversal for the cryptocurrency.</p><p>XRP currently trades around $2.5127 after a slight retracement from recent highs. The asset tested resistance near the order block zone around $2.80. Price action shows consolidation at current levels following the breakout.</p><p>The chart shows a measured move projection with three take-profit targets. The first target sits at approximately $2.6668 for the asset. The second target aligns with the current price level at $2.5127.</p><p>The third target appears near $2.4281 on the technical chart. These targets derive from Fibonacci retracement levels of recent price swings. The projection uses the swing high and low for calculation.</p><p>Canary Capital’s XRP ETF could open doors for future altcoin-based products.

November 13 represents a milestone for XRP in traditional capital markets.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/bitcoin-ethereum-etfs-hit-hard-672m-vanishes-in-two-day-streak?post=532417\">Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs Hit Hard: $672M Vanishes In Two-Day Streak</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/exxon-mobil-corp-stock-q3-earnings-beat-estimates-as-production-hits-records-in-guyana-and-permian?post=532331\">Exxon Mobil Corp.

Higher? Lower? Inflation points win prizes... like higher borrowing costs. And don't forget the Sudden Death round - available to anyone willing to push their luck and gamble.</p><p>Speaking of luck, it’s pretty remarkable that <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/snaps/eurozone-inflation-drops-back-to-21-while-services-inflation-ticks-up/\">eurozone inflation</a> has been within a whisker of the European Central Bank’s target for more than a year now, isn’t it? No wonder the ECB keeps telling us it's in its <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/articles/ecb-presser-in-florence-oct25/\">happy place</a>.</p><p>But luck tends to run out eventually, so in round one, we’re asking: will eurozone inflation be higher or lower in twelve months' time? The winner nabs themselves a signed Christine Lagarde scarf.</p><p>It’s a tricky one, though the downside pressures are clear. A stronger euro is one. Energy is another; our team expects Brent crude prices to head consistently below 60 USD/bbl in 2026. The oil market is in surplus, and our expert Warren Patterson isn’t convinced that US sanctions on Russia will change much.</p><p>Food inflation is also coming lower. Meat remains an issue, but pressure from fresh produce is rapidly abating. Unprocessed food inflation was 5.5% in August; it was just 3.2% in October. Global input price pressures are easing off, judging by UN data.</p><p>The problem is services, as <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/snaps/eurozone-inflation-drops-back-to-21-while-services-inflation-ticks-up/\">Bert Colijn discusses</a> in his write-up of October’s figures. This accounts for the bulk of eurozone inflation right now, and it actually picked up this month. Housing and recreation have been key areas of stickiness.</p><p>The good news is that selling price expectations among service-sector companies are falling. And the ECB suggests negotiated wage growth is plummeting. But for the time being, sticky services inflation is enough to keep eurozone inflation close to target, our team thinks. And <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/articles/ecb-presser-in-florence-oct25/\">enough to prevent the ECB from cutting rates further</a> for the time being, too.</p><p><strong>The Answer is: <em>Slightly lower</em></strong> – inflation averages 1.9% in Q4 next year.</p><h3><br/><strong>Chart of the week: Contributions to headline inflation (YoY%)</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"399\" src=\"https://think.ing.com/uploads/charts/_w1200/312025-chart-inflation.png\" width=\"750\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: Macrobond, ING</p><h3><br/><strong>Place your bets...</strong><br/> </h3><p>On to round two, and let’s ask the same question of the US. This one is easier; <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/articles/cooler-us-inflation-gives-the-green-light-to-rate-cuts/\">inflation’s at 3% now</a> and should be closer to 2% by late next year. The bigger question is how long it takes to get there.</p><p>So far, tariff revenue has undershot. The average tariff rate was roughly 10% through July and August, below the 18% you’d expect based on what has been announced and 2024 import data. That either hints at poor enforcement or that US companies are shifting towards lower-tariff countries. Either way, we expect tariff collection to increase and that will push up goods inflation into year-end.</p><p>Fed boss Jerome Powell presumably is thinking the same thing. It would explain his <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/articles/fed-cuts-rates-25bp-suggest-december-is-not-a-foregone-conclusion/\">pushback</a> against an automatic cut in December. Markets have pared back the implied probability of another cut this year to 60%.</p><p>The thing is, though, ‘core goods’ – the bit affected by tariffs - are only 20% of the inflation basket. And pressure elsewhere is downwards. Energy costs, slowing housing rental growth and a weaker jobs market all point to lower inflation next year. James Knightley’s inflation forecast falls back to 2.2% late next year.</p><p>That’s why inflation shouldn’t be a barrier to further rate cuts. All the while, what little data we have on the jobs market remains a point of concern. Watch out for next week’s ADP employment estimate, which has fallen in three of the past four months. We're not forecasting a fourth, though that would reinforce the rate cut story. So too, increasingly, does America's never-ending shutdown. Food stamp payments may not go through this weekend, something 13% of Americans receive. James K tells me that the $8.3bn/month it pays out amounts to 1 in 10 dollars spent in grocery stores.</p><p>All reasons to expect another cut in December, and two more next year.</p><p><strong>The answer is:</strong><em> <strong>Lower inflation through 2026</strong></em>.</p><h3><br/><strong>Bonus question</strong><br/> </h3><p>Time for a Brucie Bonus! What about the UK? Well, the answer really depends on who you ask.</p><p>The hawks at the Bank of England – which meets next week – argue that inflation at 3.8% risks morphing into a much more persistent episode of price pressure. Rising food prices risk sparking inflation expectations and leading to a second round of price and wage rises.</p><p>We’re more inclined to side with the doves, who say the weaker jobs market means wage growth is more likely to slow. That latest data hints at that, too. And it showed food inflation is actually slowing. For now, this is just one month’s data. And one month’s data won’t settle this debate just yet. That’s why we still think a pause is most likely next week.</p><p>But inflation should look better next year – and that’s overwhelmingly down to services. The Bank’s preferred measure of “core services” has already slipped below 4%. And together with slower wage growth, it should ease further in the new year – and particularly from April, where a lot of service-sector price hikes are concentrated.</p><p>That’s why I’m still calling for three cuts from the Bank of England. Whether the next one comes in December or February depends largely on the budget. I’m now leaning more towards the former, though that’s increasingly priced in now. Further downside to gilt yields looks limited, barring a more aggressive fiscal tightening. Check out our budget scenarios <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/articles/uk-budget-four-scenarios-for-markets-as-gilt-yields-tumble/\">here</a>.</p><p>Get this right, you could get your rent paid for a year! (Sorry, Rachel Reeves).</p><p><strong>We think the Answer is: <em>Lower </em></strong>– headline CPI should fall to 2.5% in the Spring.</p><p>That’s it for this week, but don’t forget to sign up for our webinars next week on <a href=\"https://webinars.think.ing.com/pharmas-global-reset-economic-and\">pharma</a> (4 Nov) and all things <a href=\"https://webinars.think.ing.com/the-budget-the-bank-and-britains\">UK budget and Bank of England</a> (5 Nov).</p><p>As Brucie would say, it would be nice to see you – to see you nice!</p><h3><br/><strong>THINK Ahead in developed markets</strong><br/> </h3><p><strong>United States </strong>(James Knightley)</p><ul><li>With the government shutdown showing little sign of ending due to ongoing political intransigence, the data calendar will remain light. Nonetheless, we will get some key business surveys and consumer confidence readings, which will likely continue to show the economy cooling somewhat. The ISM manufacturing and service sector indicators are currently running at levels historically consistent with annual GDP growth in the region of 1-2%. This is respectable, but down from the 2-3% rates we have seen in recent years.</li><li>Another survey gaining increasing relevance is the ADP employment change number. This has been a poor guide for non-farm payrolls growth in recent years, but given that the report isn’t being published due to the shutdown, ADP is now of major market relevance. It has been reported that private sector payrolls have contracted for three of the past four months. They are now going to be releasing weekly updates in addition to the monthly figure we get on Wednesday and we look for an increase of around 40,000 given the lumpy nature of job changes. This certainly doesn’t signal the start of a revival, especially in light of recent high-profile job loss announcements at the likes of Amazon and UPS.</li><li>Rounding out the numbers will be the University of Michigan sentiment index. It indicates consumer confidence is weak, likely due to worries about tariff-induced price hikes and a cooling jobs market. A strong equity market performance may be supportive, but worries about inflation and jobs remain elevated and suggest that middle and lower-income household spending growth will continue to underperform that of higher-income households.</li></ul><p><strong>United Kingdom </strong>(James Smith)</p><ul><li><strong>Bank of England </strong>(Thu): Better inflation and wage data has revived the possibility of a November rate cut, though we still think it's unlikely. The vote could be close; a 5-4 vote in favour of keeping rates on hold, with some dissenters potentially voting for big, 50bp cuts. We don't expect the Bank to offer up much of a signal on whether the next cut will come in December, largely because it will want to see the contents of the late-November Autumn Budget first. But increasingly, we think a December cut is likely, and two more cuts in 2026 would likely follow.</li></ul><h3><br/><strong>THINK Ahead in Central and Eastern Europe</strong><br/> </h3><p><strong>Hungary</strong> (Peter Virovacz)</p><ul><li>Industry/Retail (Thu): Following the weak flash estimate of Q3 GDP in Hungary, we expect another set of data confirming that consumption is the only driver of the Hungarian economy. Retail sales are showing small monthly growth and, with the help of the low base, the yearly figure will be impressive. Due to the impact of working days, the raw figures of industrial production will appear strong, but the 1.3% month-on-month increase is far from the revival we used to see after the summer shutdowns in manufacturing. Therefore, we would rather label this as another abysmal performance.</li></ul><p><strong>Czech Republic </strong>(Frantisek Taborsky)</p><ul><li>The CNB is expected to keep rates unchanged at 3.50% in its penultimate meeting of the year, with the spotlight on forward guidance and a new forecast. While headline inflation surprised to the downside, core inflation and wage growth remain elevated, reinforcing a hawkish bias. The August forecast is broadly on track, but wage dynamics and FX developments may prompt some upward revisions. Energy subsidies from the new government could ease headline inflation, but core pressures persist. Overall, the CNB is likely to maintain a restrictive stance and balanced guidance, keeping rate cuts or hikes off the table for now.</li></ul><p><strong>Turkey </strong>(Muhammet Mercan)</p><ul><li>We expect October inflation at 2.6% MoM, given continuing pricing pressures in food with adverse weather conditions, in addition to the ongoing stickiness in services, seasonality in clothing and hikes in cigarette prices, while risks are on the upside. Annual inflation, on the other hand, will slightly drop to 33% from 33.3% a month ago, thanks to a favourable base.</li></ul><h3><br/><strong>Key events in developed markets next week</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://think.ing.com/uploads/charts/_w800/3010DMCal.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: Refinitiv, ING</p><h3><br/><strong>Key events in EMEA next week</strong><br/> </h3><p> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://think.ing.com/uploads/charts/_w800/3010EMEA_Cal_1.png\"/></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/eurozone-inflation-drops-back-to-21-as-services-inflation-ticks-up?post=532414\">Eurozone Inflation Drops Back To 2.1% As Services Inflation Ticks Up </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/asia-week-ahead-rba-rate-decision-and-key-data-on-china-japan-korea-taiwan-and-philippines?post=532193\">Asia Week Ahead: RBA Rate Decision And Key Data On China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, And Philippines </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/fx-daily-dollar-squeezing-every-bit-of-powells-hawkishness?post=532173\">FX Daily: Dollar Squeezing Every Bit Of Powell’s Hawkishness </a><br/></div>",

quarters of deceleration that had raised questions about Amazon’s competitiveness in artificial intelligence and enterprise computing.</p><p>Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney described the resurgence as an “AWS unlock,” highlighting a 150% sequential jump in revenue from Amazon’s Trainium custom-chip business—an area that had previously been a source of investor skepticism.</p><p>“The AI narrative has flipped positive for AWS,” Mahaney wrote, noting that demand for AI infrastructure and training workloads has reignited growth.</p><p>Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt echoed the sentiment, observing a “positive narrative shift” as AWS growth improved from 17.5% in the June quarter to 20.2% in the September period.</p><p>Devitt projects that AWS growth could reach 22% in the December quarter, citing rising demand, expanding backlog, and higher capital expenditures.</p><p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy emphasized that demand for AI and core infrastructure remains strong, saying the company has doubled AWS capacity since 2022 and plans to double it again by 2027.</p><p>The company now expects capital expenditures to reach $125 billion this year, up from $100 billion, and anticipates further increases in 2026.</p><h3><br/><strong>Broader business strengthens amid advertising and retail momentum</strong><br/> </h3><p>While AWS remains Amazon’s profit engine, other segments also posted strong

But the subsequent launch of bilateral trade negotiations and the announcement of interim trade deals helped investors put the tariff issue behind them.</p><p>The prevailing consensus after the April tariff announcements is that, although many tariff-related matters remain outstanding, we now have a clearer understanding of the current situation.</p><p>A constructive view of the economy is that, while tariffs-induced uncertainty will likely affect near-term growth, the U.S. economy's fundamentals remain rock-solid. This view is also optimistic about the Trump administration's non-trade policy agenda, including taxes and regulatory reform. On top of all this is the ongoing AI-centric spending boom, largely independent of fiscal and monetary policy.</p><p>Market bears see this market optimism as without a fundamental basis. This line of thinking sees the tariff-induced uncertainty severe enough to push the economy close to a recessionary growth level.<br/><br/>Market bears doubt that the upcoming Fed easing will boost growth, expecting sluggish expansion even as inflation remains high. Worries about macroeconomic fiscal imbalances and stock market valuations also surface in the bearish view of the market.</p><p>The interplay of these competing views will determine how the market performs in the coming months and quarters. To that end, let's examine the landscape of bullish and bearish arguments to help you make up your own mind.</p><p>Let's talk about the <u><strong>Bull</strong></u> case first.</p><p><strong>The Economy's Strong Foundation:</strong> The U.S. economy has literally been the envy of the world over the last few years, and those fundamentals are still intact despite continuing worries about their durability. It is this inherent resilience that allowed the U.S. economy to continue growing in the face of extraordinary Fed tightening over the last couple of years and is expected to be at play in the current tariff-centric policy environment.</p><p>Growth is expected to decelerate amid uncertainty over the tariff issue. We see this in consensus GDP growth expectations for this year, which are notably below the +2.8% growth pace in 2024 and +2.9% in 2023. These expectations show that the economy entered the current period of policy uncertainty in excellent shape.</p><p>We will not see the Q3 GDP report until after the government shutdown is behind us (October 30th was the scheduled date), but the expectation is another +3%-plus growth reading. The ongoing shutdown will weigh on Q4 growth, but history suggests the negative impact mostly reverses in the following quarter.</p><p>A stable consumer and business spending backdrop, underpinned by a robust labor market, ensures that growth remains positive, albeit at a lower trajectory. Tied to all this is the secular boom in AI-centric spending, expected to remain in place for at least the next two years before decelerating.</p><p>This is beneficial to the central bank's fight against inflation, as moderating economic growth pushes inflation readings toward the Fed's 2% target. The Fed’s latest policy decision was no surprise to anyone in the market, and they remain on track to cut rates in the subsequent few meetings as well.</p><p>All in all, the strong pillars of the U.S. economic foundation run contrary to the signs of trouble typically seen ahead.</p><p><strong>The Fed's Easing Cycle:</strong> The government shutdown has come on top of the Trump administration's trade agenda, adding uncertainty to market inflation and Fed expectations. The absence of critical economic data due to the shutdown notwithstanding, the bulls see the inflation issue as heading toward a resolution satisfactory to the central bank, allowing the Fed to continue easing policy.</p><p>This view doesn't see tariffs as inherently inflationary, but acknowledges that emerging signs of labor-market softness are likely a result of tariff-induced moderation in economic growth.</p><p>The Fed’s decision to lower interest rates at the latest meeting was in line with market expectations, with a majority of market participants expecting the December meeting to bring in another rate cut announcement.</p><p>Market bulls expect the Fed to stay on an easing path, with the first two to three meetings of the New Year likely to produce consistent quarter-point rate cuts. This will allow the central bank to get ahead of any threats to the labor market, the other part of the Fed’s dual mandate.</p><p><strong>Valuation &amp; Earnings:</strong> Tied to the economic and interest rate outlook is the question of stock market valuation that still looks reasonable given the expected interest rate trajectory.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index is currently trading at 23.5X next year’s earnings estimates, up from 18.7X at the April 2025 bottom and 15.4X at the end of September 2022. This is close to the 10-year high multiple for the market, which is feeding the ‘AI bubble’ narrative in parts of the market. We should keep in mind that the index peaked at 26X at year-end 1999 in the Tech bubble.</p><p>The appropriateness or otherwise of valuation multiples has to be seen in the context of the interest rate outlook. Valuation multiples typically expand when the Fed eases policy, particularly when the catalyst for the easing is confidence about inflation rather than growth fears.</p><p>Earnings outlook is a key part of the valuation discussion. Contrary to the earlier doom-and-gloom fears, the ongoing 2025 Q3 earnings season is showing a steadily improving earnings outlook for the coming periods. You can clearly see this in earnings expectations for 2025 Q4 and beyond.</p><p>What we are seeing this earnings season is that while companies in several industries lack adequate visibility into their businesses, many others continue to drive sales and earnings growth even in this environment. We are seeing many of these leaders from a variety of sectors, including Finance and Technology, deliver strong quarterly results and describe trends in their businesses in reassuring terms despite tariff uncertainty.</p><p>Current consensus expectations for this year and next reflect broad-based, vigorous growth, not driven by one or two sectors. While estimates had come down sharply earlier this year, the trend has totally shifted now, with estimates broadly reflecting a stable-to-positive trend line.</p><p>In the absence of a nasty economic downturn, the earnings picture can actually serve as a tailwind for the stock market amid easing Fed policy.</p><p>Let's see what the <u><strong>Bears</strong></u> have to say in response.</p><p><strong>The Market's Fed Exuberance:</strong> The Fed did the expected at its latest policy meeting, despite being forced to ‘fly blind’ in the absence of economic data due to the government shutdown.</p><p>The expectation is for another rate cut in December, with many in the market hoping for continued rate cuts in the first few meetings in 2026, provided incoming economic data over the coming weeks remains supportive.</p><p>The view that tariffs cause only a one-time bump in inflation is plausible, but far from proven at this stage, particularly since the full tariff impact has yet to seep through to the economy.</p><p>An accelerated easing cycle along the lines outlined here to forestall softness in the labor market risks entrenching inflation expectations at a level that is materially above the Fed’s target. Inflation expectations become entrenched at elevated levels when households and businesses expect prices to remain high, potentially limiting the Fed’s ability to fight inflation.</p><p>Tied to the first risk is the prospect that the economy's true health may be far more fragile than recent GDP reading suggests. Low-income households have been struggling for a while, but anecdotal evidence from earnings calls suggests that even better-off consumers are getting more cautious in their spending plans. On top of this is the diminished outlook for business spending beyond the AI space, at least in the near term, due to policy uncertainty.</p><p>In the worst-case scenario, stalled progress on the inflation front may prevent the Fed from easing policy even as the economy continues to weaken, leading to the so-called 'stagflation' scenario. But even if that isn't the case and the Fed continues to ease in December and the subsequent meetings, the decelerating momentum in the economy may be hard to stop by then.</p><p><strong>The Valuation Reality Check:</strong> Given the bears' view that the prudent course for the Fed is to be in no hurry to start easing policy in the absence of any economic issues, they see no fundamental reason for valuation multiples to expand from current record levels.</p><p>Higher-for-longer interest rates should have a direct impact on the prices of all asset classes, stocks included. Everything else constant, investors will use a higher discount rate, a function of interest rates, to value the future cash flows of the companies they want to invest in.</p><p>This means lower stock prices in a higher-interest-rate environment.</p><p><strong>The Earnings Growth Question:</strong> Current consensus earnings estimates show +9.7% growth this year and +12.7% growth in 2026, following +10.7% in 2024.</p><p>Market bears see these earnings growth expectations as inconsistent with an economy facing a significant tariff increase. The full extent of the emerging tariff regime has yet to take effect, but the aggregate effective tariff rate is already more than five times higher than it was for the last many decades. It is hard to envision that this tariff jump will have no impact on inflation, economic growth, or corporate earnings.</p><p>Notwithstanding the tough going in the manufacturing sector and the growth implications of still-elevated treasury yields despite Fed easing, earnings expectations for this year and next will need to come down significantly to align with economic reality.</p><p><br/><strong>Where Do I Stand?</strong></p><p>While I acknowledge that the pace of Fed easing beyond the December meeting may be slower than many in the market expect, I am skeptical of the higher-for-longer Fed policy view and see this scenario as a low-probability event.</p><p>The current Fed Funds rate level is still almost twice what central bank officials and economists see as the 'neutral' policy rate. At the 'neutral' policy rate, Fed policy is neither 'stimulating' nor 'restricting' economic activity.</p><p>Even if further progress on the inflation front is much slower than the Fed and the market are currently projecting, the central bank has plenty of cushion in its policy arsenal to start easing without adversely affecting its inflation fight. This doesn't mean that the Fed should put rate cuts on autopilot, but it does suggest that they don't need to wait for an extended period to consolidate the inflation gains.</p><p>Regular readers of my earnings commentary know that the earnings picture remains resilient, with the latest development being upward revisions to estimates for the current and upcoming periods.</p><p>The overall policy thrust of the Trump administration is expected to be pro-growth and pro-market. Still, it is nevertheless reasonable to expect some period of market tentativeness as we sort through the bilateral trade negotiations. We remain confident that investors will soon come around to our view of inflation, earnings, and the much more positive times ahead. The market’s rebound from the April lows reflects this view of the economy and market.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-enormous-earnings-power-of-the-mag-7-group?post=532430\">The Enormous Earnings Power Of The Mag 7 Group </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/positive-picture-emerging-from-q3-earnings-season?post=531647\">Positive Picture Emerging From Q3 Earnings Season </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/previewing-mag-7-earnings-what-investors-should-know?post=530367\">Previewing Mag 7 Earnings: What Investors Should Know</a><br/></div>",

Revenues and earnings grew handsomely year over year. The company raised its 2025 capital spending to $91-93 billion to expand AI infrastructure. Google Cloud revenues surged 33.5% and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.25%. Google’s AI app Gemini now has more than 650 million monthly active users, up from the 450 million active users it had last quarter, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/alphabet-google-q3-earnings.html\" target=\"_blank\">as quoted on CNBC</a>. </p><p><strong>Tesla </strong>(<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/TSLA\">TSLA</a> - <a href=\"https://www.zacks.com/registration/premium/login/?ALERT=zrmodule&amp;mode=zramodule&amp;t=TSLA&amp;ADID=ZCOM_ARTICLEBODY_TCK_ETFNEWSANDCOMMENTARY_2782438_TSLA&amp;icid=BLOG-ETF_News_and_Commentary-2782438-free_report-commentary_body-text-TSLA\">Free Report</a>) reported results on Oct. 22, 2025, after market close.

Money managers rotated out during quarter-end window dressing. Retail traders avoided it because the chart looked like death.</p><p>I stepped in and bought 50 shares at $165.</p><p>Not because I love yoga pants. Not because I'm bullish on retail. Because the math stopped making sense at these levels.</p><p>The stock traded at 11x earnings with 16% net margins and 22% return on assets. At that valuation, this isn't a trade. It's theft.</p><p>Charts show you what happened. Numbers show you what something's worth. When those two disconnect completely, that's your opportunity.</p><p>Every major reversal starts with stocks trading at absurd disconnects from their actual value. </p><p>The math says buy, but everyone stays away because the chart looks broken. Then algorithms finally recognize the setup, and the stock doubles in months.</p><p>Spotting one of these disconnects is straightforward when you dig into the numbers.</p><p>Finding all of them before algorithms confirm the reversal is impossible manually.</p><p>Today I'm showing you the five-minute framework that found this opportunity.</p><p><br/><strong>The Breakdown Nobody Believes</strong></p><p>Pull up Lululemon's two-year chart. What do you see?</p><p>Straight down. Relentless selling. No support. No bounce. Just algorithmic destruction walking the stock lower in a perfect downward channel.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://theotrade.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-31-at-1.44.48-PM.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"489\" src=\"https://theotrade.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-31-at-1.44.48-PM.png\" width=\"750\"/></a></p><p><br/>Most traders stop looking right there. The chart says sell. Momentum says avoid. Everyone who bought higher is underwater. Stay away.</p><p>That's exactly when I start digging into numbers.</p><p>The chart doesn't show fundamentals improving while the stock collapsed. It doesn't show valuation compressing to levels that make no mathematical sense. It especially doesn't show the algorithmic channel that just broke.</p><p><br/><strong>The Numbers Wall Street Ignores</strong></p><p>I ran a five-minute fundamental analysis. Not complex. Not academic. Just the metrics that actually matter.</p><ul><li><strong>Return on assets:</strong> 22%. For a retail company, that's exceptional. Compare that to Nike at 15% or any department store at 8%. Lululemon generates $22 in profit for every $100 in assets.</li><li><strong>Net margins:</strong> 16%. Nike delivers 10%. Under Armour barely scrapes 4%. Lululemon earns 16 cents on every dollar of sales while competitors struggle to maintain single digits.</li><li><strong>PE ratio:</strong> 11 times earnings. Nike trades at 33 times. The five-year average for Lululemon itself was 35 times. This stock compressed from bubble valuation to deep value territory in 24 months.</li><li><strong>Debt-to-equity:</strong> 23%. They're barely leveraged. Current ratio of 3.0 means massive cash reserves. They could acquire a competitor tomorrow without blinking.</li></ul><p>I ran this same analysis against every retail peer I could find. Lululemon beats them all on margins. Beats them all on asset efficiency. Trades at a fraction of their multiples.</p><p>The disconnect became impossible to ignore. Strong fundamentals, absurd valuation, pure chart-based selling with zero analysis behind it.</p><p><br/><strong>The Technical Signal That Triggered My Buy</strong></p><p>The stock broke outside the two-year downward channel at $165.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://theotrade.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-31-at-1.44.51-PM.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://theotrade.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-31-at-1.44.51-PM.png\" width=\"750\"/></a></p><p><br/>This matters for one specific reason. Algorithms that systematically sold every bounce for 24 months just detected a pattern change. The machines aren't defending the downward slope anymore.</p><p>The weekly MACD sits deep underwater at negative 40. But watch that indicator. If it pivots upward toward the signal line, this becomes the comeback trade of the year. That's the momentum shift that separates temporary bounces from sustained reversals.</p><p>Money flow tells the rest of the story. Nobody owns this stock anymore. All the overhead supply got flushed out during the two-year collapse. Everyone who bought at $300, $400, $500 has already capitulated. There's nothing left blocking a move higher.</p><p><br/><strong>The Risk-Reward Math</strong></p><p>I bought 50 shares at $165. My risk? Maybe $20 downside to book value support. That's $1,000 total exposure.</p><p>My reward? If this stock gets above $200 and algorithms confirm the reversal, it's going to $450. That's not hopium. That's the math of what happens when deep value meets technical breakout.</p><p>Once algos recognize a reversal setup, the move accelerates systematically. Buying pressure replaces selling pressure. Short covering adds fuel. Institutions rotate into beaten-down names with improving fundamentals. Retail finally notices after the move is already 30% complete.</p><p>I've watched this pattern repeat. FedEx collapsed to absurd levels, then doubled. Meta got destroyed, then ran 200%. Target broke down hard, then rallied 40% in weeks. Good companies get beaten to irrational prices. Charts look terrible. Everyone stays away. Then algorithms flip, and the stock explodes.</p><p><br/><strong>My Exit Strategy</strong></p><p>I'll sell 25 shares if it hits $185. Lock in some profit. Hold the rest through December 11th earnings.</p><p>If the weekly MACD turns positive and the stock breaks $200, I'll hold for $250. If I'm wrong and it drops to $145, I'll add more. Because at that valuation, this becomes a floor trade where fundamentals simply won't let it go much lower.</p><p>Michael Burry bought a block for around $180 for the same reasons I did. The fundamental disconnect was too obvious. When someone who predicted the housing crisis steps into a hated retail stock, that confirms the value proposition exists. I'm not following him. We're both following the math.</p><p><br/><strong>The Framework That Finds These Setups</strong></p><p>Wall Street trades momentum. They buy what's going up and sell what's going down. That works until it doesn't.</p><p>The opportunity exists in the gap between chart-based selling and fundamental reality. When those two things disconnect completely, you get setups like Lululemon.</p><p>The algorithms will eventually figure this out. They always do. The question is whether you're positioned when they flip from systematic selling to systematic buying.</p><p>Run your own five-minute analysis on beaten-down stocks. Check the margins against competitors. Compare the valuation to historical norms and peer groups. Look for the technical confirmation when downward channels break. Then size appropriately with defined risk.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/most-market-sectors-are-getting-smoked?post=532408\">Most Market Sectors Are Getting Smoked</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/three-consumer-names-about-to-get-crushed?post=532021\">Three Consumer Names About To Get Crushed </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-fed-cut-rates-bonds-collapsed-instead?post=531537\">The Fed Cut Rates.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Free stock photo of appartment, at home, beautiful home\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/4009402/pexels-photo-4009402.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/couple-love-date-sitting-4009402/\" target=\"_blank\">Pexels</a></em></p><p><br/>Netflix (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/nflx\">NFLX</a>) is one of the most recognizable companies in the world. It has a massive audience, strong brand awareness, and a long history of reshaping how we watch TV. Recently, Netflix announced a 10:1 stock split. A split does not change the value of the company, but it lowers the price per share and often makes the stock feel more accessible to everyday investors.</p><p>Financial media loves these moments because they tend to create attention, curiosity, and sometimes fear of missing out.</p><p>But here is the part many people are overlooking. The split announcement came right after an earnings call that did not land smoothly. The quarter included a large one-time tax expense from Brazil that affected the reported results and caught investors off guard. The reaction in the market was lukewarm. So now we have two stories happening at once: an exciting stock split that gets headlines and an earnings situation that introduces uncertainty.</p><p>This is why we are taking a deeper look. Instead of reacting to hype or fear, we want to understand what is actually happening underneath. What is strong. What is changing. And what matters for long-term investors. This blog will help you see beyond the headlines.</p><p>The IDDA Analysis framework is used to analyze companies and determine which are right for you. There are five steps to the process:</p><ol><li><strong>Capital Analysis</strong><br/>\tYour personal risk tolerance.</li><li><strong>Intentional Analysis</strong><br/>\tYour unique financial goals and timelines based on your age, health, and lifestyle.</li><li><strong>Fundamental Analysis</strong><br/>\tThe viability of the asset based on company performance, financial health, and market position.</li><li><strong>Sentimental Analysis</strong><br/>\tThe current emotions of Wall Street and other market participants.</li><li><strong>Technical Analysis</strong><br/>\tHistorical price action to identify key psychological levels and market patterns.</li></ol><p>Let’s dive into the IDDA analysis to assess <strong>Netflix’s</strong> fundamental, sentimental, and technical outlook.</p><p>IDDA Point 1&amp;2: Capital &amp; Intentional</p><p>The capital and intentional analysis need to be conducted by you.</p><p>Select your assets in alignment with your financial goals. Listen to your intuition about each asset, but remember to invest based on your own values, not just because of recommendations from others.</p><p>IDDA Point 3: Fundamental</p><p><strong>Revenue Growth and Business Model Strength</strong></p><p>Netflix continues to generate strong and steady revenue from monthly subscriptions. Their business model is simple. People pay every month to watch shows and movies. This gives Netflix predictable cash flow and the ability to invest in more content. Even with competition in streaming, Netflix remains one of the biggest platforms in the world.</p><p><strong>10:1 Stock Split Announced</strong></p><p>Netflix announced a 10:1 stock split. A split does not change the true value of the company, but it lowers the price per share and can make the stock feel more affordable to new investors. This often increases market attention and trading activity. It does not improve business fundamentals directly but can support sentiment and liquidity.</p><p><strong>Growing Advertising Business</strong></p><p>Netflix has started offering a lower priced plan with ads. This is bringing in new users who want something cheaper, and it also gives Netflix a new way to earn money from advertisers. As more big brands move their marketing budgets into streaming, Netflix benefits. This can be an important long term growth engine.</p><p><strong>Live Sports and Events Strategy</strong></p><p>Netflix is adding live events like WWE and NFL holiday games. Live content helps keep people subscribed because it creates habits and routine viewing. This is different from binge watching, which can lead to quick cancellations. Live programming can help Netflix keep users longer and attract new ones.</p><p><strong>Global Reach and Local Content</strong></p><p>Netflix creates shows in many languages for many regions. This helps the company connect with global audiences and reduces the risk of relying only on the United States market. Popular shows from Korea, India, Spain, and the Middle East help Netflix grow worldwide.</p><p><strong>Earnings Call Impact and One Time Tax Expense</strong></p><p>Recent earnings were affected by a large tax bill in Brazil, which reduced reported profit and surprised investors. This does not mean the business is weak, but it did create mixed reactions in the market. Investors may wait to see the next quarter before making big moves.</p><p><strong>High Content Costs</strong></p><p>Creating and buying shows is very expensive. Netflix must continue to invest to stay competitive. If content spending rises faster than revenue, profit margins can get squeezed. This is something long term investors should monitor.</p><p><strong>Strong Competition in Streaming</strong></p><p>Netflix competes with Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, and others. Viewers have many options. If other platforms offer more attractive content or better pricing, Netflix can lose audience attention. Competition pressure is still real.</p><p><strong>Fundamental Risk Level: Medium</strong><br/><br/>The business is strong and global with steady revenue. However, competition remains high and content costs must be managed carefully over time.</p><p>IDDA Point 4: Sentimental</p><p>Overall sentiment is <strong>cautiously bullish</strong> for Netflix. Investors are interested because the company continues to grow revenue and expand into new areas like advertising and live events. However, the recent earnings softness and the timing of the stock split have created mixed emotions. Some investors are excited. Some are waiting for more clarity.</p><p><strong>Strengths</strong></p><p><strong>Positive reaction to the 10:1 stock split</strong></p><p>Stock splits do not change the value of the company, but they can increase investor interest because the price per share becomes more accessible. This often brings new retail investors and can create fresh momentum.</p><p><strong>Growing confidence in the advertising strategy</strong></p><p>Analysts and advertisers see strong potential in Netflix’s ad tier. As more brands look for alternatives to traditional TV, Netflix is positioned to benefit from shifting advertising budgets.</p><p><strong>Live events are gaining attention</strong></p><p>Deals with WWE and NFL holiday games have attracted interest because live content helps improve subscriber retention. Investors see this as a strategic play to strengthen engagement and reduce churn.</p><p><strong>Strong brand loyalty and cultural relevance</strong></p><p>Netflix remains a household name with global reach. Even with competition, the brand is still one of the strongest in entertainment. This supports long term confidence.</p><p><strong>Risks</strong></p><p><strong>Earnings reaction created hesitation</strong></p><p>The recent quarter included a surprise tax expense from Brazil, which made results look weaker. Some investors prefer to wait for the next earnings call to see if it was truly a one time issue.</p><p><strong>Competition remains intense in streaming</strong></p><p>Disney, Amazon, YouTube, and others are fighting for viewer attention. If these platforms produce stronger content or pricing models, Netflix could face subscriber pressure.</p><p><strong>Content costs are still high</strong></p><p>To stay competitive, Netflix must spend heavily on producing shows and acquiring rights. If spending grows faster than revenue, profit margins may come under pressure, which can worry investors.</p><p><strong>Market sensitivity to headlines</strong></p><p>Streaming stocks tend to move based on emotion, trending stories, and subscriber expectations. This can create short term volatility even when long term fundamentals remain stable.</p><p><strong>Sentimental Risk Level:</strong> <strong>Medium</strong></p><p>There is optimism around the split and new business opportunities, but investors are watching competition and profitability carefully.</p><p><strong>Weekly Chart</strong></p><p><strong>Long-Term Uptrend</strong></p><p>On the weekly chart, Netflix has been in a clear upward trend since mid 2022. Even when the price has taken pauses or pullbacks, the broader direction remains upward. This shows that buyers have controlled the market over the longer term.</p><p><strong>Recent Pullback Inside the Uptrend</strong></p><p>There has been a downward move recently after reaching a local high. This type of pullback is common during long uptrends as the market rebalances and traders take profit. The key question is whether price holds above important support zones.</p><p><strong>Price Above the Ichimoku Cloud</strong></p><p>The price remains above the Ichimoku Cloud on the weekly timeframe. This is a standard signal that the long-term trend is still bullish. When price stays above the cloud, it suggests that buyers remain in control overall.</p><p><strong>Cloud Thickness Suggests Stable Trend Structure</strong></p><p>The cloud below the price appears wide rather than thin. A wide cloud indicates stronger trend support and can help the price avoid sharp reversals.</p><p><strong>RSI Shows Normal Trend Behavior</strong></p><p>On the weekly chart, the RSI is not in an extreme overbought or oversold zone. This suggests the market is not stretched and has room to move in either direction depending on momentum and news.</p><p><strong>50% Fibonacci Retracement Levels Matter Now</strong></p><p>The most important factor in the short term will be whether price holds above the 50% of the Fibonacci retracement level which is currently sitting in right now. A bounce from this level at $1,089 could continue the long-term uptrend. A breakdown below this level would suggest a deeper correction.</p><p><strong>Technical Summary</strong><br/>The long-term technical outlook remains bullish based on price staying above the Ichimoku Cloud and maintaining its higher-trend structure since 2022. The recent pullback does not break the overall uptrend, but investors may want to watch how price behaves near the level $1,089 to understand whether momentum is shifting or continuing upward.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"598\" src=\"https://investdiva.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-25-1024x598.png\" width=\"1024\"/></p><p><strong>Buy Limit (BL) levels:</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"> $1,085.72 – High Fill Probability</p><p> $1,021.91.XX – Moderate Fill Probability</p><p> $937.79 – Low Fill Probability</p><p>Profit Taking Ideas:</p><p>1,339.00 – High Fill Probability</p><p>1,451.55 – Moderate Fill Probability</p><p>1,537.93 – Low Fill Probability</p><p>Here are the Invest Diva ‘Confidence Compass’ questions to ask yourself before buying at each level:</p><ol><li>If I buy at this price and the price drops by another 50%, how would I feel? Would I panic, or would I buy more to dollar-cost average at lower prices? (hint: this question also reveals your CONFIDENCE in the asset you’re planning to invest in).</li><li>If I don’t buy at this price and the stock suddenly turns around and starts going up again, will I beat myself up for not having bought at this level?</li></ol><p><em>Remember: Investing is personal, and what is right for me might not be right for you. Always do your own due diligence. You should ONLY invest based on your own risk tolerance and your timeframe for reaching your portfolio goals</em></p><p><strong>Technical Risk Level:</strong> <strong>Medium</strong></p><p>The long-term trend remains upward and the price is still positioned above the Ichimoku cloud, which supports a bullish structure. However, the recent pullback means short-term movement could continue to fluctuate before direction becomes clear. If price holds key support levels, the uptrend can continue. If support breaks, the correction may deepen.</p><p>Summary: Final Thoughts</p><p>Netflix remains a strong global brand with a subscription model that generates steady revenue and supports long term growth. The company is expanding its business with an ad-supported plan and live event programming, which can improve engagement and create new revenue streams over time. The recent 10:1 stock split brings more attention to the stock, but it does not change the actual value of the company. It simply makes the shares appear more accessible and may increase trading activity among retail investors.</p><p>At the same time, Netflix faces meaningful challenges. The recent earnings reaction reminded investors that unexpected costs or financial adjustments can influence short term sentiment. The streaming industry also remains crowded, which forces Netflix to continue spending on new content to stay competitive. High content investment helps keep subscribers, but it can pressure profit margins if not managed carefully.</p><p>From a technical perspective, the long term trend is still upward, with price positioned above the Ichimoku cloud on the weekly chart. The recent pullback suggests caution in the short term, and price behavior around support levels will help indicate what comes next.</p><p>Overall, Netflix appears fundamentally stable with room for strategic growth, but it operates in a competitive environment that requires ongoing reinvestment. Patience and clarity are useful here. This is not a company that needs to be rushed into. It is one to watch with a long term mindset.</p><p><strong>Overall Risk Level:</strong> <strong>Medium</strong></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/beyond-meat-stock-900-million-debt-deal-news-lifeline-or-last-gasp-before-collapse?post=530559\">Beyond Meat Stock $900 Million Debt Deal News: Lifeline Or Last Gasp Before Collapse? </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/ferrari-stock-plunged-hard-is-it-a-short-term-drop-or-a-long-term-decline?post=529332\">Ferrari Stock Plunged Hard.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Gold, Bars, Wealth, Finance, Gold Bars, Deposit\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2013/07/18/10/56/gold-163519_960_720.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/photos/gold-bars-wealth-finance-gold-bars-163519/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em></p><p><br/>Investors chasing gold’s upside momentum was a major driver of its recent surge. Their relentless capital inflows helped catapult gold up to extraordinarily-overbought levels, really ramping risks for a reversal. As that indeed sure looks underway now, investors’ chasing has also turned on a dime to fleeing. While their capital outflows haven’t grown large yet, that selling could easily snowball deepening gold’s drawdown.</p><p>Gold investment demand is challenging to measure. The best-available data is only published once per quarter in the World Gold Council’s fantastic Gold Demand Trends, well-written must-read reports for all gold and gold-stock investors. Overnight into Thursday, the new Q3’25 version was just released. Like usual, it analyzes gold’s global supply-and-demand dynamics that fueled its enormous 16.5% rally last quarter.</p><p>Gold’s investment demand proved its biggest category in Q3, just under 3/7ths of overall total demand. The WGC has long subdivided that into bar-and-coin demand and gold-ETF demand. Physically-backed gold exchange-traded funds buy, hold, and sell actual gold bullion. So tracking their holdings reveals investment-capital flows into and out of gold. Gold-ETF buying was gold’s fastest-growing demand category in Q3.</p><p>Bar-and-coin demand last quarter grew 16.8% YoY to 315.5 metric tons. But <em>gold-ETF bullion demand skyrocketed 134.2% YoY</em> to 221.7t! The WGC also tracks the world’s biggest physically-backed gold ETFs quarterly. The largest has always been the American <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GLD\">GLD</a> SPDR Gold Shares, which has maintained an unassailable first-mover advantage since effectively birthing gold ETFs in mid-November 2004.</p><p>The second-biggest has always been the American <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/IAU\">IAU</a> iShares Gold Trust launched not much later in mid-January 2005. IAU has one key advantage over GLD that has left it more favored among many fund investors. IAU charges annual management fees of 0.25% of net assets, well under GLD’s 0.40%. In the super-competitive fund space, every basis point of returns matters. GLD and IAU have always dominated.</p><p>Exiting Q3, these two behemoths alone <em>commanded 38.9% of all the gold</em> held by all the world’s gold ETFs! Two UK gold ETFs were third and fourth with 6.3% and 5.7%, and a German one was fifth running 4.6%. But sixth place is really interesting, another way-newer American one called <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GLDM\">GLDM</a> SPDR Gold MiniShares. Born far later in late June 2018, it was designed to make gold ownership more accessible.</p><p>Its big-brother GLD under the same management is based on each share being worth 1/10th of an ounce of gold after cumulative annual management fees. GLDM tracks a smaller 1/50th of an ounce, making for a proportionally-lower share price for investors. But GLDM’s knockout advantage is its annual management fees <em>are only 0.1% of net assets</em>, merely 1/4th of GLD’s!So GLDM has to be cannibalizing GLD demand.</p><p>In Q3 GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings surged 7.8% or 120.7t. GLD grew 6.3% or 60.3t, IAU 8.9% or 39.2t, and GLDM enjoyed the strongest growth at 14.3% or 21.2t. They were much better than all the rest of the world’s physically-backed gold ETFs combined, as their collective holdings only climbed 4.9% or 101.0t last quarter. GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings are a great proxy for <em>American stock investors’ gold capital flows</em>.</p><p>While gold clocked in with that fantastic Q3 up 16.5%, it wasn’t particularly overheated yet. Most of the frenzied buying arose in the first several weeks of October, which the WGC’s Q3 report doesn’t cover. In that short span, <em>gold blasted another 12.9% higher</em> stretching an extraordinarily-extreme 33.0% above its baseline 200-day moving average!I had warned about <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/goldprst.htm\"><u>gold’s mounting overboughtness</u></a> and downside risk.</p><p>That also ballooned gold’s mighty cyclical bull since early October 2023 into its largest on record going way back to January 1971!In a mid-October essay on <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/goldbgbl.htm\"><u>gold’s biggest bull ever</u></a> right before it peaked, I warned that “History argues a 20%ish drawdown is probable, which gold stocks will leverage 2x to 3x like usual.”The next-ten-biggest gold bulls averaged subsequent big-and-fast gold selloffs of <em>20.8% over just 2.1 months!</em></p><p>One of the main reasons gold’s massive breakout accelerated so dramatically in October’s first few weeks was American stock investors increasingly chasing gold’s powerful upside momentum. In that short span this month when gold blasted up another 12.9%, GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings surged fully 3.8% or 62.9t!Again that compares to 7.8% and 120.7t for all of Q3, which was fully 3.6x longer in terms of total trading days.</p><p>Because American stock investors’ capital flows have been <em>one of gold’s major price drivers</em> for well over a decade now, I’ve done a lot of past research work on them. In mid-February 2025 before investors started chasing with GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings at just 1,372.2t compared to 1,696.7t midweek, I wrote an essay <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/amrchgld.htm\"><u>Americans to Chase Gold</u></a>. In mid-July with holdings at 1,538.6t, I wrote another one <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/gldchsmt.htm\"><u>Gold Chasing Mounts</u></a>.</p><p>One key thing past gold-ETF-holdings research revealed was their <em>major reversals tended to lag gold’s own</em>. In past major gold toppings, GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings would usually continue building for several weeks or more after gold crested. That implied American stock investors weren’t convinced those gold runs were over, so their differential gold-ETF-share buying persisted until it was clearer gold was rolling over.</p><p>But rather provocatively this time around, these dominant gold ETFs’ holdings look to have <em>peaked right with gold</em>. This chart superimposes GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings over gold prices during these last few years or so. While this is all still young, it sure looks like American stock investors’ gold chasing has already reversed with gold!This is certainly bearish, as gold-ETF selling pressure could easily cascade.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://talkmarkets.com/contributor/mirjana-mishevska/user_content/ckimages/orig_zeal103125a.webp\" width=\"700\"/></p><p>Gold’s latest record high was $4,350 on October 20th, capping that amazing 12.9% month-to-date surge. GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings technically crested the next day, but with a mere 0.1% build. Their daily builds in the prior three trading days including gold’s apparent topping were far-larger running 0.9%, 0.6%, and 0.7%!So for all intents and purposes, these gold-ETF bullion holdings <em>peaked simultaneously with gold</em>.</p><p>Had the usual post-gold-topping lag happened where differential gold-ETF-share buying continued for a few weeks or longer, that would’ve moderated gold’s nascent selloff. I suspect that didn’t happen because gold’s initial daily drop proved so darned violent. On the 21st right off that latest high, gold plummeted 5.3% which <em>ranked in its top-0.3%-biggest down days</em> since January 1971!I analyzed that in <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/gdskslam.htm\"><u>last week’s essay</u></a>.</p><p>The faster any plunge, the more they shock traders and forcibly change their herd sentiment. As gold was soaring into its latest peak, gold bullishness was universal. Major financial-media outlets were falling all over themselves running endless stories about gold’s strong gains and why they were likely to continue. CNBC, Bloomberg, and the Wall Street Journal were starting to feel like they were all-gold-all-the-time.</p><p>Not only was the frequency of gold reporting increasing, but its <em>near-term bullishness</em>. In early October a parade of billionaire hedge-fund managers and widely-respected investors were interviewed predicting much-higher gold prices still within the coming half-year. All that hype was getting frenzied, threatening to morph into a secular-bull-slaying popular speculative mania. Gold greed and euphoria were rapidly mounting.</p><p>With a psychological backdrop like that, there was little contrarian commentary about the risks of gold’s extraordinarily-extreme overboughtness. Despite intensely studying gold, actively trading gold stocks, and writing about all of it continuously for over a quarter-century now, I got plenty of flak from daring to point out how stretched gold just looked historically. Caught up in the hype, few wanted to view gold soberly.</p><p>So gold’s 39th-largest down day in 54.8 years hit gold-bewitched investors like a sledgehammer to the skull!Gold suddenly being clubbed like a baby seal out of the blue on no news catalyst <em>had to be deeply unsettling</em> for investors recently buying in high to chase. That was certainly a brutal wake-up call that gold has always been volatile and risky, and can’t power higher linearly indefinitely. Periodic selloffs are inevitable.</p><p>For grizzled battle-scarred veterans, gold plunging out of some of its most-extreme overbought conditions ever was no surprise. I started warning about that increasing likelihood in mid-September when gold was <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/goldprst.htm\"><u>already pretty stretched</u></a>. We had stopped adding new gold-stock trades in our popular weekly newsletter in mid-August, then tightened up their trailing stop losses in late September. The writing was on the wall then.</p><p>In mid-October when the gold-to-the-moon hype was deafening and overboughtness soaring, we added put options in GLD and a major gold-stock ETF. The entire modern history of gold argued that it couldn’t sustain such incredibly-overbought levels for long. But the great majority of investors not considering any studied contrarian perspectives likely had no idea what was coming. They figured gold would keep surging.</p><p>While momentum-chasing buying is powerful while underway as gold demonstrated in October’s first few weeks, it is brittle. When that fast-rallying price action wobbles then reverses, hot-money demand quickly vanishes. That leaves sellers in control, and the faster they force prices lower the more pressure exerted on recent investors to flee. In turn the more they sell, the more prices drop fueling snowballing capital outflows.</p><p>As of Wednesday’s data cutoff for this essay, gold had already plunged 9.5% in just seven trading days!That already proved the biggest drawdown of gold’s mighty 139.1% cyclical bull over 24.5 months since early October 2023. And gold was challenging a 10%+ correction, which would technically kill this epic gold bull. After cresting a single day past gold, GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings have <em>fallen six trading days in a row</em>.</p><p>That’s the longest streak of daily draws since mid-November 2024, during this gold bull’s previous largest selloff of 8.0%. The total GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings drop recently is 1.7% or 29.8t. Gold’s other primary driver in recent decades has been American speculators’ leveraged gold-futures trading. Normally with no government shutdown, their collective positioning is published weekly in Commitments of Traders reports.</p><p>Those are current to Tuesday closes, so CoT weeks end every Tuesday. During this latest one wrapping up this Tuesday, GLD+IAU+GLDM suffered a big 1.5% or 26.6t holdings draw. Rather forebodingly, that proved <em>the biggest single-CoT-week draw</em> in gold’s entire record cyclical bull!This recent differential gold-ETF-share selling not only didn’t lag gold, but it has already been the most intense this bull has yet witnessed.</p><p>American stock investors’ potential gold exodus cascading is a serious downside risk for gold already in a big-and-fast drawdown. The mission of physically-backed gold ETFs is to track the gold price. But the supply and demand of their shares are independent from gold’s own. So when gold-ETF shares are dumped faster than gold itself, their share prices threaten to decouple from their metal to the downside.</p><p>The only way gold-ETF managers can avert such failures is to buy back enough of their shares to absorb any excess supply. They raise the funds to finance these purchases by <em>selling some of their gold bullion</em>. So draws in GLD, IAU, or GLDM holdings reveal American stock-market capital flowing out of gold. And as this chart shows, investors still have lots of room to sell after those holdings paced gold’s massive breakout.</p><p>From mid-April to late August, gold was mired in a high consolidation after its previous episode of extreme overboughtness. And mid-April’s was considerably less extreme than mid-October’s. Gold’s upper resistance this past summer ran near $3,425. Gold didn’t break out above that until August’s final trading day, which <em>kicked off recent months’ chasing</em>. The day before that breakout, GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings ran 1,576.8t.</p><p>They surged 9.5% or 149.6t into mid-October as gold-ETF shares were bought much faster than gold. In that scenario of excess gold-ETF-share demand, their prices risk decoupling from gold to the upside. So gold-ETF managers issue new shares to offset that excess demand. They then plow the proceeds from those share sales into buying more physical gold bullion. These numbers can be rounded to 1,575t and 150t.</p><p>As gold plunged 9.5% since mid-October, American stock investors sold enough gold-ETF shares to force a 29.8t holdings draw. That’s close to 30t, <em>or just 1/5th of</em> the frenzied GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings build in September and the majority of October!What happens to gold prices if investors force another 45t draw unwinding half their recent frenzied build?What if they roundtrip the whole thing to 150t with 120t more selling?</p><p>Any more significant differential gold-ETF-share dumping will almost certainly <em>exacerbate gold’s drawdown</em>. Again previous massive gold bulls averaged big-and-fast subsequent selloffs around 20% over a couple months or so. Another one this time around implies $3,480 gold before the dust settles, which is hardly apocalyptic. Gold only first bested that level just two months ago on September’s opening trading day.</p><p>But the pain of a 20% drawdown would still be serious, <em>especially in gold stocks</em>. Historically the leading <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/gmq225fn.htm\"><u>GDX gold-stock ETF</u></a> has tended to amplify material gold moves by 2x to 3x. So if American stock investors’ gold chasing is indeed reversing as apparent so far, both the metal and its miners’ stocks still have long ways to fall before this drawdown runs its course. Both extreme sentiment and technicals need to be rebalanced.</p><p>The bottom line is American stock investors’ gold chasing via gold ETFs is reversing. Since gold peaked, major-gold-ETF bullion holdings have relentlessly fallen. This is unusual, as they’ve normally lagged major gold reversals historically. Gold plummeting out of its latest record close contributed to the urgency to exit, seriously damaging bullish psychology. This young exodus from gold ETFs could easily snowball.</p><p>So far investors have merely unwound about 1/5th of the holdings build from their frenzied differential gold-ETF-share buying in September and the first few weeks of October. If they keep selling, that will force the gold ETFs to dump more physical bullion intensifying gold’s necessary drawdown. That in turn will ramp pressure on investors to flee gold ETFs, which could spawn a vicious cycle of selling pounding gold much lower.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/gold-stocks-slammed?post=530356\">Gold Stocks Slammed</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/golds-biggest-bull-ever?post=529164\">Gold’s Biggest Bull Ever </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/more-gold-miner-records?post=527671\">More Gold Miner Records</a></p></div>",

(<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/HOFT\">HOFT</a>).</p><h3><br/><strong>Business Overview</strong></h3><p>Hooker Furnishings is a designer, marketer, and importer of furniture—including casegoods, leather, and fabric-upholstered pieces—along with lighting, accessories, and home décor for residential, hospitality, and contract markets. The company also produces premium custom leather and fabric furniture domestically. As the largest supplier of case goods and upholstery in the U.S., Hooker reaches over 75% of retail furniture distribution. Founded in 1924 and headquartered in Martinsville, Virginia, the company currently has a market capitalization of $93 million.</p><p>On September 11, 2025, Hooker Furnishings reported Q2 fiscal 2026 results (fiscal year ends January 2026), showing a 14% decline in net sales compared to last year, driven by weak demand and pre-pandemic home sales levels. High interest rates and elevated home prices have pressured the home furnishings sector over the past two years. Despite cost-cutting measures, loss per share widened from $0.11 to $0.31, missing analysts’ estimates by $0.19. This marked the seventh consecutive quarter of earnings misses. Consequently, our EPS forecast for fiscal 2026 has been reduced from $0.50 to $0.25.</p><p>Management cited weak new home sales and persistent inflation as key challenges. The company has reported weak sales and earnings for nine straight quarters. Assuming no significant tariffs are imposed on key trading partners, Hooker Furnishings could improve performance next year. The stock has fallen 22% this year due to these weak results.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-27-at-8.44.27-PM-768x250.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: <a href=\"https://investors.hookerfurnishings.com/\">Investor Relations</a></p><h3><br/><strong>Growth Prospects</strong></h3><p>Hooker Furnishings has experienced a highly volatile business performance, failing to grow its earnings over the past decade. The company posted steady earnings growth until 2020 but was severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Following a partial recovery, it faced another setback from surging inflation, which prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to a 23-year high. Combined with elevated home prices, these factors have constrained demand for new homes, creating a significant headwind for Hooker’s business.</p><p>Looking ahead, the outlook for Hooker Furnishings appears more favorable. Inflation is expected to moderate, and the Fed is likely to lower interest rates in the coming years. If these trends materialize, demand for new homes should strengthen, supporting a recovery in both sales and earnings for the company.</p><p>Given the business’s historical volatility, a conservative approach to growth expectations is warranted. Nevertheless, with this year’s exceptionally low comparison base, we project an average annual EPS growth of 32% over the next five years.</p><h3><br/><strong>Competitive Advantages &amp; Recession Performance</strong></h3><p>Hooker Furnishings’ competitive advantage lies in its scale, brand recognition, and extensive distribution network. As the largest supplier of case goods and upholstery in the U.S., the company reaches over 75% of retail furniture channels. Its combination of imported and domestically manufactured furniture, including premium custom leather and fabric pieces, allows Hooker to serve a wide range of residential, hospitality, and contract markets.</p><p>This diversification, along with decades of design expertise, positions the company to maintain a strong market presence despite sector volatility.</p><p>In terms of recession performance, Hooker Furnishings has historically faced challenges during economic downturns due to its reliance on new-home sales and discretionary spending. While the company experienced consistent growth before 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent inflationary pressures highlighted its vulnerability to macroeconomic shocks.</p><p>Nevertheless, Hooker’s established brand, broad distribution, and cost management initiatives provide some resilience, allowing it to navigate recessions better than smaller, less diversified competitors.</p><h3><br/><strong>Dividend Analysis</strong></h3><p>Hooker Furnishings offers a relatively attractive dividend yield of 10.4%, reflecting its commitment to returning capital to shareholders despite recent earnings volatility.</p><p>While the company has faced multiple quarters of weak performance, its ability to sustain dividends is supported by cost management measures and a diversified product portfolio. Investors should view the dividend as a strong income component, though potential fluctuations in earnings may affect its long-term stability.</p><p>However, the dividend is at risk of a cut this year, as the company has an over-100 % payout ratio. The company is expected to earn $0.25 per share this year while paying a dividend of $0.92 per share.</p><h3><br/><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p>Hooker Furnishings has declined by over 36% this year due to the effects of high interest rates and inflation. While a recovery is likely over the coming years, investors should expect a gradual turnaround. However, the dividend is at risk of a cut this year because of the high payout.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/high-dividend-50-permrock-royalty-trust?post=532038\">High Dividend 50: PermRock Royalty Trust</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/high-dividend-50-golub-capital-bdc-inc?post=531808\">High Dividend 50: Golub Capital BDC, Inc.</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/10-of-the-right-retirement-stocks-for-income-investors?post=531175\">10 Of The Right Retirement Stocks For Income Investors</a><br/></div>",
