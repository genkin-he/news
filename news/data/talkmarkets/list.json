            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2% in January and increased 2.4% year-over-year, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/cpi_02132026.htm\">according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.3% in January and 2.5% year-over-year. While inflation continues to moderate, core CPI remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The broader CPI was helped by a 1.5% monthly decline in energy prices.</p><p>The CPI components suggest that inflation’s glide path through the “final mile” will remain sticky. Services less energy services rose 0.4% in January and are up 2.9% year-over-year. Shelter increased 0.2% on the month and 3.0% over the past year. Medical care services rose 0.3% in January and are up 3.9% year-over-year. These service categories continue to keep core inflation above the Fed’s target.</p><p>Progress is real. The chart below shows core CPI has finally taken an incremental step to a lower inflationary regime. Yet the path lower remains gradual and sticky.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/inflationwatch.drduru.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260214-core-CPI-vs-core-PCE.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"core CPI vs core PCE\" height=\"226\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/inflationwatch.drduru.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260214-core-CPI-vs-core-PCE.png?resize=640%2C226&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"640\"/></a></p><p><em>Sources: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Personal Consumption Expenditures Excluding Food and Energy (Chain-Type Price Index) [PCEPILFE], <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCEPILFE\">retrieved from FRED</a>; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items Less Food and Energy in U.S. City Average [CPILFESL], <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPILFESL\">retrieved from FRED</a>, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, February 14, 2026.</em></p><h2>The Tariff Effect on Core Goods</h2><p>The CPI for commodities less food and energy commodities increased 1.1% year-over-year and remains a key contributor to overall disinflation. This category could contribute to even lower inflation this year if the U.S. avoids enacting new tariffs.</p><p><a href=\"https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2026/02/who-is-paying-for-the-2025-u-s-tariffs/\">In Liberty Street Economics</a>, the New York Federal Reserve published a quick study that demonstrates a tariff incidence of roughly “94 percent” in the first eight months of 2025 and “86 percent” by November, meaning the vast majority of tariff costs showed up in import prices paid by U.S. consumers. The average tariff rate rose to about 13 percent, and tariffed goods experienced price increases of roughly 11 percent relative to comparable untariffed goods. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/q5Q7h0HB5JQ?si=BD1y6O500kG9AZMg\">the January press conference on monetary policy</a> that inflation could be closer to target absent tariff effects. This study provides supporting data.</p><p>However, from a policy of economic warfare, tariffs have likely achieved a primary aim: a significant reduction in imports from China. The study pointed out that “in the first eleven months of 2025, China’s share of U.S. imports fell by another 5 percentage points, slipping below 10 percent”. Chinese imports accounted for nearly 25% of U.S. imports in 2017 and declined to around 15% in 2024 following the tariff increases implemented in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>The inflationary consequences of tariffs could be secondary to this strategic goal. Importers have shifted supply chains to blunt the otherwise inflationary impact of the higher tariffs. The general disinflationary environment during the first round of tariffs also likely helped embolden today’s heightened tariff regimes.</p><p>The strategic objective may be clear. The inflationary implications are less so.</p><h2>Are Tariffs an Enduring Inflationary Force?</h2><p>The New York Fed study does not argue that tariffs create a self-sustaining inflation spiral. It documents substantial pass-through into prices during 2025. If no new tariffs are enacted, year-over-year comparisons will eventually absorb this price shock. Base effects alone would allow the tariff impulse to fade.</p><p>However, continued or expanded tariffs would introduce new price-level increases. Repeated rounds would transform a one-time adjustment into recurring upward pressure on core goods. Ongoing uncertainty around tariff policy remains a significant wildcard. Persistent uncertainty could encourage firms to raise prices preemptively in anticipation of future cost increases.</p><h2>Reluctant Disinflation</h2><p>Disinflation is underway, but the path for the final mile to 2% remains sticky. Disinflation is underway, but the final mile to 2% remains sticky. This phase can best be described as reluctant disinflation, the mirror image of sticky inflation.</p><p>The bond market remains broadly unconcerned about renewed inflationary pressure. Bond prices rose following the CPI release. After gaining 1.3% ahead of the report amid rising equity volatility, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/TLT\">TLT</a>) added another 0.5% after the data. With TLT trading well above its upper Bollinger Band – a signal of short-term extension – I took profits on a large TLT position.</p><p>In recent weeks, I have shifted toward buying dips and selling rallies in TLT rather than fading strength. As long as the bond market remains confident that inflation will continue moderating, my inflation hedge remains concentrated in commodities as the U.S. in particular positions itself to run the economy hot with lower interest rates, high investment, and fiscal stimulus.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/inflationwatch.drduru.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260214_TLT-iShares-20-Year-Treasury-Bond-ETF.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT)\" height=\"388\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/inflationwatch.drduru.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260214_TLT-iShares-20-Year-Treasury-Bond-ETF-1024x621.png?resize=640%2C388&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"640\"/></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT)</em></p><p>Be careful out there!</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/australian-dollar-breaks-out-as-economic-winds-blow-toward-rate-hikes?post=552504\">Australian Dollar Breaks Out As Economic Winds Blow Toward Rate Hikes </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/the-feds-labor-market-divide-is-hardening-against-rate-cuts?post=551123\">The Fed’s Labor Market Divide Is Hardening Against Rate Cuts </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/why-this-market-feels-both-exciting-and-unsettling?post=549503\">Why This Market Feels Both Exciting And Unsettling </a></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Dollar, Money, Cash Money, Business, Currency, Finances\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/04/30/00/28/dollar-1362244_960_720.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/photos/dollar-money-cash-money-business-1362244/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em></p><p><br/>I continually get people asking me questions and sending me articles about how the dollar might lose its status as the world’s reserve currency and then something horrible is supposed to happen. Neither part of this story makes much sense and treating the issue in this manner confuses what is at stake.</p><p>As I, and many others, have pointed out, there is not a unique reserve currency. Many currencies, including the euro, the yen, the English pound, the Chinese renminbi, and even the Swiss franc are held as reserves by central banks. The dollar is the predominant reserve currency, but not the only one. It accounts for <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-international-role-of-the-us-dollar-post-covid-edition-20230623.html#:~:text=The%20dollar's%20international%20role%20has%20remained%20stable,**Stable%20share%20over%20the%20past%2020%20years**\">around</a> 60 percent of central bank reserves at present. </p><p>There is a similar story with the dollar being used as the medium of exchange in international transactions. Again, most international transactions take place in dollars, but only a bit more than half of all trade. Just about all the trade between European countries is conducted in euros.</p><p>One of the great myths that has formed the basis of endless conspiracy theories is that oil must currently be traded in dollars. A popular story of the rationale for overthrowing Saddam Hussein was that he was going to start selling Iraq’s oil for euros.</p><p>This is absurd for two reasons. First, there was nothing ever stopping Iraq or any other country from selling oil for euros or any other currency. There is no international law that requires oil to be sold for dollars. If any country finds it more convenient to sell oil for yen or renminbi, as is sometimes the case, they use the alternative currencies. </p><p>The second reason that this sort of switch is no big deal is that it has very little to do with demand for dollars. Around 60 million barrels of oil are traded internationally each day, which at current market prices would sell for a bit more than $3.6 billion. That would be the amount of dollars buyers would need to acquire for their purchases if all oil was sold in dollars. </p><p>But it is important to recognize that no one needs to hold these dollars for any substantial period of time. A purchaser of oil could acquire the dollars they need minutes or even seconds before the transaction. The seller could also dump their dollars immediately after the sale. If people don’t want to hold dollars, the demand for conducting oil purchases is trivial in foreign exchange market with almost $10 trillion <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/press/p250930.htm\">worth</a> of daily transactions.        </p><p>In short, the concern about the dollar losing its status as the reserve currency is silly. But there is a real issue with banks, pension funds, and other investors moving away from dollars. If there is less demand for dollars from investors, both foreign and domestic, it will fall in value relative to other currencies.</p><p>This is in fact exactly what we have seen since Trump came into the White House. In January of last year, it took just a little <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EURUSD%3DX/\">over</a> a dollar to buy a euro. Currently, it takes almost $1.20 to buy a euro. The lower value of the dollar means that it costs more for people in the United States to buy imported goods, sort of like tariffs. That adds to inflation here. </p><p>It also means that it is more expensive for US tourists to travel to Europe or other countries where the dollar has fallen relative to other currencies. It also means that US companies looking to invest overseas will find it more expensive, as their dollars don’t go as far. </p><p>On the flip side, US goods and services become cheaper for people living elsewhere. The US also becomes cheaper as a tourist destination. </p><p>That means the overall picture is a mixed story. But as investors increasingly move away from the dollar because of Trump’s erratic foreign and domestic policies, we should anticipate a further decline in the dollar against most other major currencies. This is not a cataclysm, but it does mean that investors holding dollars will lose out relative to those who hold other currencies. </p><p>The key point here is that no one is making a zero-one decision about the dollar. Most banks, both central and private, corporations, pension funds, and wealthy individuals will hold some amount of dollar-based assets and some amount of assets in other currencies. When they see Trump’s erratic and destructive policies they will opt to keep a smaller share of their assets in dollars. Generally, that share will not go to zero, but some could make that call. </p><p>Envisioning a post-Trump world, where the United States again has stable policies and the rule of law, the dollar might look more like the English pound does today. It would still be a widely used international currency, but much less important than it is today.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/more-thoughts-on-the-jobs-report?post=557448\">More Thoughts On The Jobs Report </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-two-big-revisions-in-the-jobs-data-fewer-jobs-and-fewer-people?post=555660\">The Two Big Revisions In The Jobs Data: Fewer Jobs And Fewer People </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-ai-bubble-consumption-is-outrunning-wages?post=554732\">The AI Bubble: Consumption Is Outrunning Wages</a></p></div>",

So far, it has certainly lived up to its name. This past week opened with investors selling technology, and particularly software stocks, to buy value sectors. Energy, financials, and industrials continued to attract flows as investors leaned into cash flow, dividends, and near-term earnings certainty. However, as I noted on X this past week, while those sectors may have better earnings <em>“certainty,”</em> the earnings growth rates don’t justify the recent valuation expansions. As shown, the valuations for industrials, staples, energy, and materials are <em>“cheap”</em> compared to the market <strong>but very expensive relative to their own history.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Sector Valuations\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HBClggUXAAAiAeg?format=jpg&amp;name=small\"/></p><p>As shown, the sectors investors are chasing most are the weakest-growth sectors of the economy in terms of revenue.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Revenue of energy companies\" height=\"367\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='624'%20height='367'%20viewBox='0%200%20624%20367'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"624\"/></p><p><br/>However, overall software stocks <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/igv\">IGV</a> took the worst of it. The S&amp;P 500 software and services group has lagged the S&amp;P 500 by roughly 24% recently, near the widest gap in decades. The index is also down about 25 percent from its October peak.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Software stocks vs the market.\" height=\"308\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-102.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Notably, the driver is not just one data point but rather a <em>“narrative”</em> in which investors believe that AI will render all software companies (SaaS) essentially useless. <strong>However, that narrative will likely fail to come to fruition, as while some companies may be replaced by AI, many, like Salesforce, Oracle, and ServiceNow, will embed AI into enterprise applications to deliver complementary value, expanding TAMs without displacement. </strong>As such, the software selloff is likely getting overdone in the short term, and investors may start to pick through the rubble for opportunities. Given that price has moved far faster than fundamentals for higher-quality names, this is where good research and selective stock picking could pay off.</p><p>Overall, FactSet shows the S&amp;P 500 tracking close to double-digit earnings growth in Q4, and information technology has led sectors in the number of companies issuing positive EPS guidance for the quarter. The recent market correction is unsurprising, as we discussed in early January, that any reversion of earnings estimates, which is happening, will force a reset in multiples. The opportunity is to start finding the companies that will be rewarded for execution in the future.</p><p>Economically, two catalysts this week were labor and inflation. The January employment report showed payrolls rising by 130,000 and the unemployment rate falling to 4.3%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4 percent on the month and 3.7 percent over the year. However, most of that employment gain was due to seasonal adjustments that will be revised away next month. The January CPI report showed inflation cooling to 2.4 percent year over year, with a 0.2 percent monthly gain, pushing Fed rate cut expectations higher after the report. The news overall lifted the bond market, with the 10-year Treasury yield sliding towards 4%.</p><p>Which brings us to the market.</p><h3><br/><strong>Technical Backdrop</strong> – <strong>Technology Gets Tripped Up</strong></h3><p>The S&amp;P 500 continues to fail at previous all-time highs and has shifted toward distribution in recent weeks. Price pushed to a new intraday high on Monday at 6,980.10, then reversed into the close and spent Tuesday and Wednesday stalling near 6,941. That sequence matters because it left a clear supply shelf under the prior peak and set the stage for the selloff on Thursday as buyers failed, and sellers pressed the tape into the close, ending at 6,832.76, a 1.6% drop and the second-worst day since Thanksgiving, according to the Associated Press market recap. Then, on Friday, that market attempted a rebound but faded into the close, keeping prices below the broken shelf near 6,940 and closing at 6,836.17. As such, the bounce reads as corrective, not trend repair.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Weekly trading chart\" height=\"308\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-108.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Overall, the market has remained in a broad consolidation pattern since last October and, as noted above, February is returning to its statistical nature of weakness. While the market remains close to all-time highs, there has been a vicious rotation from growth to value. Looking at the market on a technical basis, the Thursday selloff broke support at both the 20- and 50-day moving averages, as money flows turned negative. Momentum and relative strength continue to decline, suggesting that buyers are becoming more scarce, at least in the near term. The selling pressure remained mostly contained to Megacap names, which is what pulled the broader index lower, but the rotation from growth to value is getting very extended.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Market Trading Udpate\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-109-1024x781.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Volatility has also been steadily rising, but so far it remains relatively contained. Technically, the key is the 6,940 to 6,975 band, which is the prior close cluster and the breakdown launch zone. If the index reclaims that area and holds it, the path opens back toward 6,980 and the 7,000 handle. If price fails there, rallies invite sellers, and the market stays range-bound, potentially heading to lower levels. Currently, support sits at 6,790 to 6,825, defined by Thursday’s low and Friday’s undercut and reversal. A clean break below that band increases the odds of a move toward 6,780, then 6,720. Next week is also shortened by the Presidents Day market closure on Monday, February 16, which often amplifies moves around well-defined levels.</p><table border=\"1\"><thead><tr><th>Support Or Resistance</th><th>Price Level</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Support</td><td>6,790 to 6,825</td><td>Prior swing low reference.<br/>\t\t\tThe next downside target is 6,790 if it breaks.</td></tr><tr><td>Support</td><td>6,812</td><td>100-Day Moving Average</td></tr><tr><td>Support</td><td>6,550</td><td>Larger swing low reference.

US stock and bond markets are closed on Monday, February 16, which often reduces liquidity and increases the impact of any headline-driven moves once trading resumes on Tuesday. The calendar then turns busy fast. On Tuesday, investors receive the NY Empire State Manufacturing Survey and the NAHB Housing Market Index. Both matter because the market is trying to decide whether growth is stabilizing or slowing amid restrictive rates. Fed speakers also hit the tape early in the week, so rate expectations can shift quickly if the tone leans more hawkish.</p><p>Wednesday brings the weekly MBA mortgage data, along with housing-related releases such as building permits. Housing remains a key transmission channel for monetary policy. If mortgage demand weakens again, the bond market tends to price a slower growth path. Then on Thursday, the stakes rise with jobless claims, the Philadelphia Fed survey, and trade balance data. Claims matter most, as a rising trend in claims would likely move up the market’s rate-cut timeline. A steady print keeps the Fed in wait mode.</p><p>However, Friday is the main event, with core PCE, headline PCE, personal income, personal spending, and an advance Q4 GDP update. If core PCE reaccelerates, yields could back up, putting pressure on long-duration growth stocks. If PCE cools while spending holds, the market gets the soft landing mix and bonds tend to rally. Overall, it will be a busy 4-day trading week.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Key Catalysts\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-105.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><h3><br/><strong>The Weak Dollar Narrative</strong></h3><p>We have spent a lot of time over the last year debunking <em>“narratives,”</em> which are dangerous to investors, as <em>“narratives”</em> create a rationalization for overpaying for assets. Nonetheless, Wall Street loves a simple story and is happy to jump on a trend with momentum, selling products to unwitting consumers. A good example of that lately has been the<em> “weak dolla</em>r” narrative, which has pushed investors to chase foreign assets. The negative correlation between a weak dollar and rising international stock exposure appears to be a free return. Unsurprisingly, the story spreads fast because performance charts look clean during a dollar slide.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"USD Dollar vs Emerging Markets\" height=\"308\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-90.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Reuters recently reported that the US dollar hit a four-year low in late January after President Donald Trump said the “<em>value of the dollar”</em> was <em>“great.”</em> Reuters tied the move to rate cut expectations, policy volatility, and concerns about fiscal deficits and central bank independence. However, in reality, President Trump was more correct than not, as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the dollar trading at a more <em>“neutral level,”</em> as shown below.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"USD vs Neutral Levels\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-91.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>There are two very important points to take away from the chart above.</p><ol><li><em>The dollar has been in a very strong uptrend since the Financial Crisis and remains there.</em></li><li><em>Despite the recent pullback in the dollar, it is trading at its “Neutral Value” and is at the same level it was in 1970. Such certainly does not support the “debasement” or “demise of the US Dollar” narratives.</em></li></ol><p>What is true is that the decline in the value of the dollar, after its strong surge starting in 2021, does make foreign assets more appealing as investors seek a hedge against a weaker dollar. However, while the <strong><em>“purveyors of perpetual doom”</em></strong> claim this is evidence of the end of the US Dollar dominance, the recent decline in the dollar, as shown above, is simply part of its long history of rallies and declines as the dollar adjusts to flows as foreign governments seek to balance their currencies against the US Dollar.</p><p>If you take a look at the dollar chart above, you will notice that it trades in a band above and below 100 (the <em>“neutral value.</em>) This is because the US Dollar is measured against a “basket” of foreign currencies. It is crucial to understand that foreign governments manage their currency against the dollar through a <em>“peg”</em> or a managed band to reduce exchange rate swings and support trade. As such, foreign central banks set a target rate versus the dollar and defend that target by buying or selling dollars from foreign exchange reserves. This is why, when the dollar was <em>“above neutral,”</em> foreign central banks like China reduced their holdings of US Treasuries to strengthen the Yuan.</p><p>When demand for the local currency rises, the central bank buys dollars and sells local currency to keep the rate from rising. When demand falls, the central bank sells dollars and buys local currency to keep the rate from falling too much. Many countries also align short-term interest rates, capital controls, and bank liquidity rules with the peg, since rate differentials and hot money flows pressure the exchange rate.</p><p>There are several very important reasons why all countries need a stable currency relative to the dollar:</p><ol><li><em>It helps exporters price goods with less uncertainty,</em></li><li><em>Supports long-term contracts,</em></li><li><em>Limits imported inflation on energy and commodity prices priced in dollars, and</em></li><li><em>Lowers currency risk for foreign investors.</em></li></ol><p>The trade-off is less monetary policy freedom, greater reserve requirements, and a higher risk of sharp adjustments when the peg level no longer aligns with inflation, growth, or external deficits.</p><p>However, none of this supports any commentary about the <em>“death of the dollar,”</em> or the failure of fiat currencies in general. What those commentaries do is push portfolio behavior. When the dollar falls, international stock exposure often rises in the allocation model. <strong>The risk lies in the assumption that a weak dollar stays in place indefinitely.</strong></p><p>Looking at the chart above, it is clear that currency trends reverse when positioning crowds in either direction. <strong>A weak-dollar narrative encourages investors to pay less attention to valuation, earnings, and country-level fundamentals, leaving portfolios exposed when the thesis breaks.</strong></p><h3><br/><strong>A Potential For A Dollar Rally</strong></h3><p>Currency markets move on expectations more than anything else. Yes, interest rates, economic growth, and inflation can all impact the dollar, but it is more about the “expectations” of those variables for the dollar, trade, etc., that move the price. Therefore, investors need to be on the lookout for factors that could reverse expectations. Currently, several conditions are forming that could begin to reverse those expectations.</p><p>First, positioning and technicals matter. From a long-term technical perspective, the U.S. Dollar Index is attempting to stabilize after a 2025 downside move. As shown, using a 3-year price momentum measure, the dollar is as oversold now as it was at previous dollar bottoms. The current move lower is becoming increasingly stretched, reducing the catalyst needed to trigger a sharp reversal.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"US Dollar Technical backdrop\" height=\"308\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-89.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>A weak dollar trend also encourages leverage through unhedged international stock exposure. As shown, investors have piled into global sector funds (excluding technology) over the past year to boost returns. However, the last time we saw that kind of exposure shift was in 2021, just before the counter-trend rally in the dollar that hit returns fast.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Global fund flows ex-technology.\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HAyx9bLXgAE07vF?format=jpg&amp;name=small\"/></p><p>Second, relative economic growth still supports the U.S. over international economies. <a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/us-economy-recent-data-suggests-risk-to-earnings/\" target=\"_blank\">As we noted previously</a>,</p><blockquote><p><em>“While investors are exceedingly bullish on the stock market, forecasts for 2026 are sobering. Even the IMF, which recently produced its global growth estimates, has the US economy growing at 2% for the next two years, and the Eurozone near 1%.”</em>.</p></blockquote><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Growth projections by regions\" height=\"447\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-28.png\" title=\"\" width=\"680\"/></p><p><br/>Relative growth drives capital flows, and capital flows drive currencies. Therefore, when U.S. growth beats expectations while other regions disappoint, the weak-dollar theme loses its power.</p><p>Lastly, policy messaging still matters. Reuters reported that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reaffirmed <em>“a strong dollar policy.”</em> Furthermore, the expected monetary policy under Kevin Warsh, the new Federal Reserve chairman, is also dollar-bullish. While a single statement does not set a multi-month trend, repeated statements and eventual actions will shift short-term psychology toward a stronger dollar view.</p><p>Most crucially, a dollar rally does not require booming U.S. growth. <strong>A dollar rally only requires growth and rates to look less negative than they’re priced, and the current oversold conditions lower that hurdle.</strong></p><h3><br/><strong>The International Valuation Risk</strong></h3><p>Investors often stack a second argument on top of the weak dollar story. International markets look cheaper than the U.S.; therefore, international stock exposure offers better value. The problem lies in relative valuation, when we should really look at each market’s valuation relative to its own history and earnings path. As shown, when you do that, those markets trade at historically high valuations.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"12-Month Forward P/E Ranges (MSCI Regions)\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='0'%20height='0'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E\"/></p><p>MSCI data shows the MSCI EAFE Index (ex-US) forward P/E at 15.3 as of January 30, 2026. The level looks reasonable in isolation; however, the key issue is what investors receive for that multiple. Given that earnings growth rates, margins, and sector mix are vastly weaker than in the U.S., overvaluation will matter in those countries, just as it does in the U.S.</p><p>On the U.S. side, FactSet reported S&amp;P 500 analysts project 2026 earnings growth of 14.1 percent and a forward 12-month P/E of 21.5, below 22.0 at the end of the fourth quarter. The U.S. multiple still sits above long-run averages, yet the direction matters, as the U.S. has cheapened at the margin while earnings expectations have remained resilient and profit margins have improved.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Non-financial corporate profit margins\" height=\"402\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-92-1024x588.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/><strong>International markets also carry concentration risk.</strong> A significant portion of EAFE performance is tied to financials, industrials, and exporters, all of which are sensitive to global trade cycles and demand from China. Those forces can change quickly, but when the weak-dollar narrative drives the trade, investors often ignore the macro risk.</p><p>A currency-driven bid also inflates valuation abroad. A weak dollar lifts translated returns and encourages inflows, which in turn raise price multiples. However, when the dollar turns higher, international stock exposure faces a double drag as currency hedging reverses. When that translation turns negative, the valuation premium compresses as flows reverse.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Wall Street's Hunt for Cheaper Stocks Goes Global - WSJ\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-04131555/social\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>While international stock exposure is fine, and there are certainly periods when it performs better than domestic markets, over the last 17 years it has trailed domestic markets by a large margin. Such is because, at the end of the day, it isn’t about dollar weakness; it is about earnings growth, profit margins, and future expectations. Currently, that growth remains in the U.S.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Performance of US vs Foreign Markets\" height=\"308\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-93-1024x451.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><h3><br/><strong>Investment Tactics Dollar Reversal</strong></h3><p>As shown, the move in Emerging Market Stocks (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/EEM\">EEM</a>) has been extremely sharp, making it much more exposed to a deep reversal if the dollar rallies.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"EEM Technical Chart\" height=\"523\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-94.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Therefore, investors should treat international stock exposure as a tool, not a narrative. The goal, as always, is to maintain diversification but only to the point where you can control risk. Once it becomes a momentum chase, that risk control fails.</p><ul><li><em><strong>Start with position sizing.</strong> Set a strategic range for international stock exposure based on your risk tolerance and drawdown limits. Critically, keep that range stable and don’t allow the recent weakness in the dollar to dictate long-term weights.</em></li><li><em><strong>Use rules-based rebalancing.</strong> When foreign equities run above target due to a weak dollar surge, trim toward policy weight. When foreign equities lag, add slowly. Rebalancing reduces the damage of an unexpected reversal</em>.</li><li><em><strong>Add currency awareness.</strong> Consider a split allocation between hedged and unhedged developed exposure. Hedged exposure reduces the impact of a dollar rally, while unhedged exposure keeps diversification benefits when the weak dollar resumes. MSCI publishes a 100% hedged EAFE benchmark that helps investors compare results across hedged and unhedged frameworks.</em></li><li><em><strong>Focus on earnings quality</strong> as fundamentals will always matter in the end. Continue to favor markets and sectors with stable cash flows, strong balance sheets, and pricing power, as those traits matter when currencies swing and financial conditions tighten.</em></li><li><em><strong>Avoid valuation shortcuts.</strong> Do not rely on “cheaper than the U.S.” Use local history and earnings trends. If international multiples rise while earnings lag, reduce exposure, even if the weak-dollar story remains popular.</em></li><li><em><strong>Finally, stress test the portfolio</strong>. Model a 5 percent to 10 percent dollar rally and a 10 percent drawdown in foreign equities at the same time. If the model shows unacceptable damage, reduce unhedged international stock exposure before the market enforces the change.</em></li></ul><p>The weak-dollar narrative is just a narrative, and a reversal will arrive again. That is just how markets operate. The question is whether your process will protect you or hurt you when that reversal comes.</p><h2><br/><strong>Market Statistics &amp; Analysis</strong></h2><p>Weekly technical overview across key sectors, risk indicators, and market internals</p><h3><br/><strong>Market &amp; Sector X-Ray: Pullback To Support</strong></h3><p>Despite what seemed like a rough week in the market, it really wasn’t as most sectors and markets, outside of technology, moved into very overbought territory on a short-term basis. Energy, Materials, Industrials, and Staples, or rather <em>“value,”</em> have strongly outperformed every other market and sector this year. These areas are the most overbought, and a rotation back to growth seems increasingly obvious.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Market Sector Relative Performance\" height=\"638\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Market-Sector-Relative-Performance-1024x934.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><h3><br/><strong>Technical Composite: 61.95 – Deterioration Despite Internals</strong></h3><p>The overall technical condition remains bullish, but has weakened slightly over the last month. After hitting more extreme overbought conditions heading into October, the market has continued to consolidate, working off some of that state. While not bearish, some further weakness early next week would be unsurprising, providing a better entry point for a rally at some point. However, as noted above, this weakness is very selective and is driven by Technology, Communications, and Financials. The next market rally will likely be driven by a rotation into these areas.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Technical Gauge\" height=\"367\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Technical-Gauge-1024x537.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><h3><br/><strong>Fear/Greed Index: 72.14 – Greed Remains (In Certain Sectors)</strong></h3><p>Positioning in equities remained strong this week, driven by continued strength in Materials, Industrials, Staples, and Energy as noted above. Overall, retail investors continue to remain aggressively invested, while professional managers slightly reduced net exposure this past week. We could see a further decline if weakness continues next week.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Fear Greed Index\" height=\"280\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Fear-Greed-Gauge-1024x410.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><h3><br/><strong>Relative Sector Performance</strong></h3><p>As selling intensified in Financials, Discretionary Communications, and Technology this past week, those sectors are now very oversold. With Industrials, Energy, Materials, and Staples exceedingly overbought, it seems likely we are closer to a rotation back to growth.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Relative Analysis\" height=\"317\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-106-1024x464.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><h3><br/><strong>Most Oversold Sector Holdings</strong></h3><p>While Financials are technically the most oversold sector, I wanted to look at Technology, which is also oversold, to identify potential opportunities. MSFT, IBM, and PLTR are extremely oversold following the recent drubbing and are positioned to rally if a rotation begins.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Most oversold sector analysis\" height=\"505\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-107-1024x739.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><h3><br/><strong>Sector Model &amp; Risk Ranges</strong></h3><p>Over the last month, we repeatedly noted the extreme deviations in some sectors and markets. Basic Materials, Industrials, Energy, Transportation, Small-cap, and Gold and Gold Miners are at extremes. This past week, those extremes extended in those areas, pushing risk higher. As we stated previously, <em>“These extremes can persist for a while; therefore, it is important to maintain exposure while managing risk along the way.”</em> Investing isn’t risk-free, so continue to manage risk accordingly.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Risk range report\" height=\"310\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Risk-Range-Report-1024x453.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/financial-nihilism--the-trap-young-investors-are-walking-into?post=557328\">Financial Nihilism &amp; The Trap Young Investors Are Walking Into</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/bonds/century-bonds-a-long-term-bet-on-google?post=557242\">Century Bonds: A Long Term Bet On Google</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/bls-labor-report-defies-consensus?post=556922\">BLS Labor Report Defies Consensus</a></p></div>",

The post-World War II, American-devised <strong>rules-based international order</strong>—upheld through multilateral organizations, open trading rules, and US enforcement—is rapidly unraveling. “The rule-based international order was conceived by the Americans…about promoting democracy,” Woo explains. The US benefitted as both architect and guarantor: “As a reward for being the guarantor of the system…the dollar became the reserve currency of choice in the world.”</p><p>But with rising competitors like China, Woo posits, the logic that held this order together has eroded. “The system benefited the US as long as the US military, political, and economic domination was total. That’s very clearly no longer the case,” he argues. America, he says, has shifted from upholding global principles of democracy and free markets to more transactional power politics. Now the US has decided it’s going to do everything it takes to better position itself in this rivalry against China, Woo said. “That changes everything.”</p><h2><br/><strong>Venezuela: A Case Study in the Shifting Rules of Engagement</strong></h2><p>One of the clearest illustrations Woo offers is what recently took place in Venezuela on January 3, 2026.</p><p>“When the US went into Venezuela, it was not to promote democracy… Trump doesn’t even pretend that he’s interested in promoting democracy. He went to Venezuela to take the oil… because the US now needs to take control of Venezuela since China, not the US, is the largest trading partner for Latin America.”</p><p>As Woo sees it, the U.S is no longer even concerned about justifying its actions as attempts to advance democracy or free markets. It’s simply about doing whatever it takes to maintain hemispheric dominance within US’s backyard, whether Venezuela, Cuba, Greenland, or elsewhere.</p><h2><br/><strong>Middle Powers Adapt: Pragmatism and a Multipolar World</strong></h2><p>As the US and China battle for dominance, Woo says a pivotal role is emerging for “middle powers”—countries like Canada, the UK, and the EU—who are “taking a much more transactional and pragmatic approach.” These states, he says, are forging new alliances and pursuing independent trade deals, sometimes tilting toward China to gain leverage with both superpowers.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><br/><em>Video Length: 00:05:43</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OIkSUXxk1Zc?si=RNaedtgO2Lp7vUGw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p><p>Woo observes this “pragmatic revival of balance-of-power politics” already in motion. “I strongly suspect that [middle powers] have decided the best way to regain their leverage…is by essentially getting closer to China now,” Woo says. Recent moves, such as Canada, the UK, and Europe negotiating directly with Beijing, underscore this pivot. “They feel, and rightly so, that they’ve been taken advantage of by the Americans because they’re American allies. So it makes more sense for them to act collectively, to be seen as being more neutral.” The outcome could be less a new bipolar Cold War than a highly fluid multipolar world where middle powers try to act as stabilizers.</p><h2><br/><strong>The Market Consequences: Risk, Instability, and Hard Assets</strong></h2><p>The shifts in the global order are being felt throughout financial markets. According to Woo, this is a key reason behind gold’s strong performance, as major international investors seek to diversify and adapt to a rapidly evolving landscape. The unraveling of the rules-based system has heightened concerns about the security of dollar-denominated assets—particularly US Treasuries—for foreign holders. As Woo puts it, “If the US can take your oil today, tomorrow they can say…whatever US Treasuries you’re holding are now worthless.” Regardless of whether these fears ultimately manifest, the perceived risk of such events has increased.</p><h2><br/><strong>Constraints and the Path Forward</strong></h2><p>While the transition to a power-based system brings volatility, Woo notes that all major powers face severe constraints. The US faces political constraints, including checks and balances, political polarization, and frequent leadership changes; China is saddled with high levels of public and private debt; and Russia is constrained by years of war: “The economic constraints all the major powers face are very, very serious,” Woo says.</p><p>It’s these checks—domestic and international—that may prevent any one nation from unilaterally reshaping the global order, and could foster a fragile but lasting new equilibrium: “You’re not going to see anybody upsetting the apple cart…I think there is going to be a new equilibrium that will be established.”</p><h2><br/><strong>Conclusion: Navigating a New Geopolitical Cycle</strong></h2><p>David Woo’s analysis paints a picture of a world in transition: the American-led era of global rules is ending, but the vacuum is being filled not by a simple US-China rivalry, but by agile coalitions of middle powers. For markets and investors, this means preparing for heightened volatility, shifting correlations, and the rising importance of hard assets. Already, the early contours of this new era are taking shape across global markets.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/this-weeks-market-wrap-ai-moving-fast-and-breaking-things?post=557379\">This Week's Market Wrap: AI Moving Fast And Breaking Things</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/end-of-an-era-what-a-reversal-in-us-dollar-strength-means-for-investors?post=556772\">End Of An Era: What A Reversal In US Dollar Strength Means For Investors </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/tech-rotation-defensive-shift-changing-market-outlook?post=555820\">Tech Rotation, Defensive Shift: Changing Market Outlook</a></p></div>",

I’ve been hearing about it in places that I’d never have expected to before, but many people are talking about EM with limited understanding. That’s where Louis comes in, with a reframing of how to think about investing outside developed markets.</p><p dir=\"auto\">If you’re one of the many US investors suddenly discovering the world of opportunities beyond our borders, you need to hear this because simplifying the opportunity abroad into one big blob is a mistake. “There are many ways to skin a cat,” as Louis points out, whether you’re looking to invest in Latin America, South Africa, Asia, or elsewhere.</p><p dir=\"auto\">The very structure of most emerging financial markets has changed—in fact, Louis and I found ourselves in agreement that “EM” is an ill-fitting term.</p><h2 dir=\"auto\"><br/>A Marketing Gimmick</h2><p dir=\"auto\">Louis doesn’t pull any punches in this week’s <em>Global Macro Update</em>. “Emerging markets,” he notes, is a term invented decades ago as a marketing ploy. After our conversation, I did some digging on the term. Turns out, “emerging markets” was coined by Antoine van Agtmael, an economist at the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a division of the World Bank, in 1981.</p><p dir=\"auto\">Van Agtmael introduced the phrase at a Thailand conference to rebrand the IFC’s Third-World Equity Fund after learning that investors reacted negatively to “third world.” He felt the new terminology conveyed growth and momentum rather than poverty and despair.</p><p dir=\"auto\">Forty-plus years ago, you had the US, Europe, and Japan. Everything else was small enough to lump together and give it a catchy name. Yet here we are, still using that limited framework. We’re treating Vietnam the same as Brazil, Mexico the same as South Africa, India the same as Indonesia. It’s like saying “everything that’s not New York or LA” in the US and expecting that to be a useful guideline for making investment decisions.</p><p dir=\"auto\">The problem isn’t just semantic. When you think of emerging markets as one monolithic block, you dilute the real opportunities by adding everything else.</p><h2 dir=\"auto\"><br/>Know What You Own</h2><p dir=\"auto\">Here’s a key takeaway: If you’re buying an emerging markets ETF, you need to understand what you’re actually getting.</p><p dir=\"auto\">As Louis noted before we started recording, if you are an institutional investor, you can develop a view and take a targeted position. For example, you can buy Brazilian bonds if you believe Brazil’s interest rates will drop (and their bond prices will increase). But if you are an individual, you cannot (yet) be so targeted. </p><p dir=\"auto\">In the past few years, there has been a big increase in the number of niche ETFs. Many are focused on markets outside the US, ranging from the ill-informed “emerging markets” monicker to ETFs tied to the public markets in individual countries. You can now buy an ETF with equities solely from Vietnam, Singapore, South Korea, etc. </p><p dir=\"auto\">Better, but still, you need to know what you are buying. For example, the iShares MSCI South Korea ETF (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/EWY\">EWY</a>), an ETF I own, currently has 93 positions. That sounds well diversified. But when you look at the individual holdings, you’ll see (as of this writing) that EWY has two holdings comprising 46.77% of the entire ETF. Those companies are Samsung and SK Hynix. If you are bullish South Korea but bearish information technology, this might pose a problem for you. None of this discussion is a recommendation, just an example of what you’ll find when you are mining the prospectus of niche ETFs.</p><h2 dir=\"auto\"><br/>Early Days</h2><p dir=\"auto\">US investors are waking up to opportunities outside our borders, and that’s a good thing. Louis notes these are early days for growth in many markets outside the US, giving us a few ways to think about various emerging markets in an environment where so much has changed since the term was coined.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><br/><em>Video Length: 00:43:18</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SqsuQuVthjs?si=n2H3CaYfaT7VjAt7\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/forget-the-old-narratives-geomacro-has-arrived?post=555671\">Forget The Old Narratives: GeoMacro Has Arrived</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/economics--politics/the-order-is-rapidly-fadin?post=552352\">The Order Is Rapidly Fadin’</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/rethink-the-mag-7?post=550813\">Rethink The Mag 7</a></p></div>",

The fear was that thanks to rising oil (and oil products) prices, the figure would come in hot, fostering hawkish Fed fears – the sentiment leaned heavily on the bearish side, allowing me to call instead for S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq <a href=\"https://x.com/Monica___K/status/2022375953725264083\">spike and then relief rally</a> after the data was published (and came in line, which the market understood as \"inflation under control\" message).</p><p>Inflation worries are again on the back burner, and that made for quite some moves in cyclicals and interest rate sensitive names.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p><strong>Is the application of leverage a warranted tool for capital efficiency, or a psychological weapon that corrupts while exacting an existential toll?</strong></p><p>Archimedes once said, “Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the Earth.”</p><p>Leverage is often presented as a sterile Greek Lambda letter—a component of a formula designed to juice internal rates of return (IRR). But beneath the spreadsheets lies a darker reality. When we move from the theoretical to the systemic, leverage ceases to be a tool and begins to function as a weapon of existential proportions. Perception is often reality.</p><p><strong>I. The Threshold of Hubris: The \"Loser’s\" Leverage</strong></p><p>The transition of leverage from benefit to threat begins with Hubris. In wealth management, this is the assumption that the \"worst-case scenario\" has been modeled and mitigated. However, history—and the present—suggests that actors consistently fail to anticipate the moment a tool fails to provide the assumed buoyancy - the other law of Archimedes.</p><p>Consider the fulcrum of \"the losers\" in the retail and mid-market space: leverage is viewed as a shortcut to bypass the natural timeline of wealth accumulation. When actors validate this by offering 5x or 10x margin to clients who lack the psychological fortitude for a 2% draw-down, they aren't managing wealth; they are facilitating a gamble on existence.</p><p><strong>The Hubris Principle:</strong> Leverage is an existential threat, specifically when complexity is high, and redundancy is low. If the environment shifts, leverage provides the kinetic energy for total erasure.</p><p><strong>II. Case Study: The \"Paper\" Reset of 2026</strong></p><p>The failure of major institutions to anticipate the \"exaction\" of leverage was recently exemplified in the precious metals volatility of early 2026.</p><p><strong>The Event:</strong> As silver prices surged nearly 200% due to industrial deficits and a \"paper\" short squeeze, reports surfaced of Tier-1 entities, including whispers surrounding JP Morgan's massive short positions, struggling to meet aggressive margin hikes by the CME Group.</p><p><strong>The Failure of Anticipation:</strong> Wealth managers had largely dismissed the possibility of a \"physical vs. paper\" decoupling. When margin requirements for silver were hiked to 15%, the resulting \"Long Flush\" wasn't just a market correction—it was a systemic heart attack.</p><p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> The \"weapon\" of leverage, used for years to suppress price volatility, suddenly turned on its handlers. The perceived stability of the bullion banks was revealed to be a fragile construct of interconnected debt obligations. History repeats itself.</p><p><strong>III. The \"God Complex\": The Institutional Corruption</strong></p><p>This systemic fragility is driven by the God Complex: the belief that one has mastered the market \"beast.\" This is not just a retail phenomenon; it is an institutional one.</p><p><strong>California’s $1 Trillion Shadow:</strong> The California public pension systems (CalPERS/CalSTRS) exemplify the \"slow-burn\" existential threat. While ostensibly \"funded\" at ~80%, the massive $1 trillion national shortfall often cited represents a fundamental misuse of temporal leverage.</p><p><strong>The Corruption:</strong> By using high-leverage private equity and \"clean energy\" bets to bridge a 7% return hurdle, managers are effectively leveraging the future taxes of the citizenry to pay for today’s promises.</p><p><strong>The Social Cost:</strong> When these leveraged bets fail—such as CalPERS' 71% loss in its CETF private equity fund—the \"Gods\" of finance do not pay. The taxpayers do. This is the ultimate \"existential corruption\": the realization by the public that the financial elite have leveraged the stability of the state to protect their own hubris.</p><p><strong>IV. Leverage as a Weapon: The Adversarial Shift</strong></p><p>Perhaps the most dangerous evolution is the perception of leverage as a weapon of dominance rather than a tool of commerce.</p><p><strong>Predatory Leverage:</strong> Institutional players use \"weaponized\" margin hikes to \"hunt\" the stop-losses of smaller investors.</p><p><strong>The Death of the Future</strong>: Leverage is a time machine that pulls future earnings into the present. By spending tomorrow’s wealth today, the investor loses their connection to their \"future self.\" Debt lacks buoyancy, and there may not be a lever long enough to lift the weight of tomorrow’s obligations today.</p><p> </p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/to-know-all-there-is-to-know-and-will-be-known?post=545107\">To Know All There Is To Know And Will Be Known </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/the-auto-markets-unwillingness-to-bend-a-looming-economic-catastrophe?post=524539\">The Auto Market's Unwillingness To Bend: A Looming Economic Catastrophe </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/synchronicity-denying-the-unexplainable?post=483854\">Synchronicity: Denying The Unexplainable </a></p></div>",

It keeps sending me Delta flight notifications.</p><p>I was originally scheduled to fly to Milan, Italy, today to watch Olympic Hockey all week. But I changed my plans (because it’s Valentine’s Day and my daughter is eight years old), and I elected to go to the World Baseball Classic finals in March instead.</p><p>I’m having a little bit of remorse. I’m a huge fan of the Winter Olympics, whether it's half-pipe, hockey, skating, or cross-country. Last night was brutal for U.S. men’s skater Ilia Malinin. But I enjoyed the lead-up and moment when Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Shaidorov won the men’s gold medal for skating instead.</p><p>At the onset of his program, NBC commentator Tara Lipinski said Shaidorov was just planting the seeds for future success, all but writing him off while suggesting he might be in the mix to win a medal in 2030. The expectation went that Malinin would win easily, followed by his rival in Japan.</p><p>But then, seconds later, Shaidorov’s music changed, and it was <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XnTE2h0ZY74\">the song from the Diva Dance</a> in the <em>Fifth Element</em>. He went off from there. I had to root for him solely on the basis of his song selection, but his performance was also flawless. Then we saw many people fall after him, including Malinin. And in Olympic spirit, anything did happen. Congratulations to Shaidorov on that title, and be sure to watch it.</p><p>Meanwhile, that flight I mentioned is supposed to leave in three hours. I’ll spend Valentine’s Day with my wife and daughter instead. It's a fair trade off. Now, let’s talk about the markets.</p><h3><br/><strong>With Momentum Negative</strong></h3><p>For the last two weeks, we’ve been juggling some very choppy momentum conditions. Momentum conditions peaked on Jan. 12 and experienced a significant rise in selling pressure, which carried us into the end of the month.</p><p>You may recall, I threw my hands up and dumped silver and gold ETFs <a href=\"https://themoneyprinter.substack.com/p/raising-the-yellow-flag-it-shouldnt\">on Jan. 26</a>. Our S&amp;P 500 Capital Wave reading <a href=\"https://themoneyprinter.substack.com/p/were-red\">went negative on Jan. 28</a>. Since then, we’ve had a collapse in gold and silver prices, a blowout in the cryptocurrency world, and one of the worst momentum selloffs in over a decade (two Thursdays ago).</p><p>Selling pressure has increased, aided by this chart.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!i90G!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e47d086-86f2-4996-8254-7ca62418c97d_1278x1052.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"535\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!i90G!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e47d086-86f2-4996-8254-7ca62418c97d_1278x1052.png\" width=\"650\"/></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: ZeroHedge and Bloomberg</em></p><p><br/>That first week of the month was ferocious on the short-selling side. For those who don’t know, short selling is not about buying put options on stocks and hoping they rise as stock prices drop.</p><p>Short selling is the process of borrowing shares from someone, selling them into the market, hoping they will go down, and then buying them back at a lower price. Then, traders make money by pocketing the difference between the selling price (first step) and the repurchasing price (second step).</p><p>There are a few key factors fueling this frenzy. First, we are on the backside of a cycle where we tend to see higher Beta tech names give way to consumer defensives and materials/energy. More importantly, this “AI Apocalypse” trade seems to be catching more fire.</p><p>You may recall the “Retail Apocalypse” trade from the last decade. The basic argument was that companies like Kohl’s, Toys R Us, Sears, Caldor, etc. would all go the way of the dinosaur because of Amazon, e-commerce, and huge slumps in retail traffic. A lot of names disappeared.</p><p>This AI theme has been on a warpath. AI threatens software stocks, law firms, brokerages, white-collar work, and the underlying real estate on which so many companies pin their operations. This narrative will be a dominant one for the next 18 to 24 months. What will also matter is how these concerns around disruption bleed into election issues this fall.</p><p>That said, when we see these signals go red, pay attention to key moving averages on the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. Last Thursday (Feb. 5), the S&amp;P 500 bounced right off its 100-day moving average. It then gave us a nice, two-day 'Dead Cat' bounce.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kY93!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03fed912-7d60-4f40-946f-4a524990ee45_1392x862.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kY93!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03fed912-7d60-4f40-946f-4a524990ee45_1392x862.png\" width=\"650\"/></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: ZeroHedge</em></p><p><br/>That black line is the 100-day moving average for the S&amp;P 500. We’ve double-tapped it in the last few weeks.</p><h3><br/><strong>Extreme Margin</strong></h3><p>As we stand at the top of this financial cycle, markets have benefited from support from the Federal Reserve, ongoing Treasury action at the front end of the yield curve, Japan’s stimulus and fiscal plans, and now China’s 3.2 trillion yuan targeting.</p><p>But this next chart still looms. Because when we see margin debt cycles peak, that’s where the threat of valuation compression emerges if there is a broader unwind. The last top (2021) was a month before the markets pushed higher into November, and then began the long, sluggish march down 25% over the next 12 months.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wFSW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a0b0254-c98e-44b9-94f0-819dd73846d8_1294x1012.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"508\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wFSW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a0b0254-c98e-44b9-94f0-819dd73846d8_1294x1012.png\" width=\"650\"/></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: WolfStreet.com and BraVoCycles Newsletter</em></p><p><br/>If this market does experience a broader pullback, I will remind you that the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq will not go straight down like an elevator. It instead tends to be a process of lower highs and lower lows, occasional squeezes, shifts from oversold to overbought, and then a shift to the next leg down.</p><p>All the while, money will likely flow into defensives first -- and then, ultimately, mid-tier bond duration.</p><p>I think it may be a good time to start talking about corporate bonds on the backside of the year, and the debt of countries with strong natural resource profiles and high economic freedom indices -- if you’re looking for peace of mind. You have time to do your research.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p>Spring may be approaching (even if the cold weather outside says otherwise). 'Green shoots' are once again poking through in the global economy. But which ones will flourish, and which will turn to weeds? James Smith sorts optimism from overgrowth in the US jobs market, Germany, and even rainy Britain – all in your guide to the week ahead.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://think.ing.com/uploads/hero/_webp/w1280h720_shutterstock_editorial_16484524b_.jpg_webp_40cd750bba9870f18aada2478b24840a.webp\" width=\"400\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Crocuses flowering in Berkshire bring a welcome sign that spring is on the way</em></p><h3><br/><strong>Sorting the Green Shoots From the Weeds</strong></h3><p>In case it had escaped your notice, we economists love a good cliché. True aficionados will tell you every cliché has its season: hot inflation summers, dark economic winters, and the ever-reliable sports metaphors. I’ll spare you the comparison between US GDP and the luge doubles at the Winter Olympics (who came up with that, by the way?).</p><p>So it was a great delight to see the absolute classic-of-the-genre “green shoots” metaphor spring up in US commentary again this week. A little early, sure, but you know, global warming and all that.</p><p>True, an economy growing at 3%-4% hardly screams “fragile seedlings”. But the argument goes that this is now finally spilling into the long-embattled jobs market. Cue those other cliché bingo terms: “turning a corner”, “underlying momentum”, and dare we even say, “robust fundamentals”?</p><p>Private payrolls growth surged last month. The six-month moving average of jobs growth is picking up, hinting that the worst of the hiring drought is behind us. The unemployment rate is down – red meat for the hawks that argue lower immigration is the driving force of the labor market right now.</p><p>Markets responded by pushing the next Fed cut back to July, and with inflation running a little hotter in January, expect more people to ask whether cuts are needed at all. “Soft landing” and all that.</p><p>We don’t really buy it. <a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/why-the-feds-jobs-market-confidence-could-prove-misplaced?post=555748\">I pointed out last week</a> that nearly all the jobs in 2025 were created by private healthcare. Virtually all other sectors shed workers. That dispersion has only become more extreme after the latest revisions.</p><h3><br/><strong>Healthcare and Hospitality Accounted for All the Jobs Growth in 2025</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"335\" src=\"https://think.ing.com/uploads/charts/_w800/NFP_by_sector_1102.png\" width=\"650\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: Macrobond, ING</em></p><p><br/>Sure, that light pink “other” bar has become a little less negative. But it’s partly thanks to a construction worker boom in January, which probably has more to do with unseasonably warm weather than new “tailwinds”. Remember: job openings are falling, layoff announcements are trending up, and consumers are still downbeat about their job prospects.</p><p>None of this means the US can’t continue growing above-trend for now, dominated by AI capex and wealth effects. But we’re sticking to our call for two Fed cuts this year – in June and September.</p><p>In Europe, there seems to be genuine signs of metaphorical spring. Germany’s fiscal story has been a roller-coaster; optimism 12 months ago quickly gave way to pessimism as it became clear that infrastructure doesn’t get built overnight. Add in a hint of creative accounting to the budget, and it looked like more brown leaves than green shoots.</p><p>That seems to be changing. Defense spending, though below the government’s target last year, came in some EUR10 billion above 2024 levels – and more so if you include borrowing in the special funds. Much of that gap opened up very late in the year, shortly before the German parliament finally approved the budget for 2026 – an announcement that coincided with the approval of a raft of new defense contracts.</p><p>The real surprise, though, is that more of this defense spending is going to get spent locally; production capacity is ramping up quickly, it seems. Carsten Brzeski is getting more optimistic about the multiplier effect of defense spending – economist-speak for “this might actually do something to growth.\"</p><p>New orders are rising rapidly. Next week’s purchasing managers indices (PMIs) should give us a better steer. The hope is that production will increasingly follow as we move through the year – and particularly in 2027. Carsten’s 1.9% growth forecast for next year is above consensus.</p><p>None of that subtracts from the multitude of structural challenges Germany faces. But for now, it does seem the green shoots are genuine.</p><p>Britain, rain-sodden as ever, also shows flickers of optimism. Not on growth, which rounded out 2025 weaker than expected. Nor politics, which is a major banana skin for markets. But on inflation, there’s a growing sense that the Bank of England could go further with its cutting cycle than previously thought. That’s the message from various investors I’ve seen in London this week.</p><p>We agree that inflation is set to drop dramatically over the next few months, even if the January data is unlikely to drastically change next week. The jobs market has cooled a lot and hiring surveys are still getting worse. Private sector wage growth is falling like a stone.</p><p>But the Bank itself is cautious, albeit divided. Staunch resistance from the hawks is the main reason we’re reluctant to pencil more than two rate cuts in for this year, even if there’s a decent economic case to be made for more.</p><p>So, yes, the green shoots are there if you want to find them. And if they turn out to be weeds, fear not – economists are always ready with the next seasonal metaphor. Easter bunny, prepare for battle.</p><h3><br/><strong>Ahead in Developed Markets</strong></h3><p>United States (James Knightley):</p><ul><li>Labor Market: Financial markets continue to favor two 25 bp Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year and we agree. While the jobs numbers seem decent, the details are more concerning, showing zero employment growth in three years outside of government, leisure &amp; hospitality, and private education &amp; healthcare services.</li><li>PCE (Friday): The weekly ADP numbers this coming week will tell a similar story, with a clear slowdown in hiring shown in the data. Durable goods orders will be depressed by a swing downwards in Boeing aircraft orders, while the trade balance will see more elevated deficits as the pre-tariff inventory build is exhausted. The key data point will likely be the Fed’s favored measure of inflation – the core PCE deflator – which we expect to post a 0.3% increase, limiting any further near-term momentum behind the Fed being more aggressive on policy easing.</li></ul><p>Eurozone (Bert Colijn):</p><ul><li>Industrial production (Monday): The Eurozone has seen a cautious increase in industrial production in the autumn of last year, and December is likely to pour some cold water on imminent rebound hopes. Germany and Italy saw a tick down in production, making an overall increase less likely. Mind you, optimism is returning to manufacturing due to improving domestic demand, and we do expect a more sustained increase in 2026.</li><li>PMI (Friday): The January sentiment data by the European Commission was very upbeat. Across countries and across sectors, a jump was noted. This leaves us intrigued for February survey data. The PMI had not been exuberant in January, although it still reflected decent output growth. A sign of acceleration here may give more weight to the rosy EC survey of last month.</li></ul><p>United Kingdom (James Smith):</p><ul><li>Inflation (Wednesday): Headline inflation is set to dip back on airfare noise, lower food price pressure, and the fading of last year's private school tax hike. But we aren't expecting any drastic changes in \"core services\" inflation, the Bank of England's main preoccupation. The bigger fall in inflation will come in April, when we expect headline CPI to dip back to 1.8%.</li><li>Jobs report (Tuesday): Expect further signs of cooling in the UK jobs market and a further drop in annual wage growth. Assuming those trends continue into the next round of data in March, we expect a rate cut at next month's Bank of England meeting.</li></ul><h3><br/><strong>Ahead in Central and Eastern Europe</strong></h3><p>Poland (Adam Antoniak):</p><ul><li>Industrial output (Thursday): December’s industrial production reading was well above market expectations, but this performance is unlikely to be repeated in January. External demand remains lackluster, the calendar effect is negative (with one fewer working day compared with January 2025), and weather conditions were harsh. Average temperatures in January 2026 were below the multi‑year average, with severe frosts particularly in the eastern part of the country, which could potentially disrupt transport and cause delays to delivery times, with adverse consequences for production plans. Producers’ prices continue to decline, and deflation in PPI persists as manufacturers face competition from cheap imported goods from China.</li><li>Labor market (Thursday): Wage growth in enterprises surprised to the upside in late 2025, but the stronger figures were largely attributable to annual bonus payments in certain sectors, predominantly mining. We believe that the downward trend in wage dynamics resumed in January and is likely to continue over the coming months. The minimum wage was increased by 3% at the start of 2026, compared with a 9.2% rise in 2025. As for employment, we forecast a 0.6% year-over-year decline. Employment levels in enterprises fell throughout 2025, so we expect a negative statistical effect from the update of the statistical sample (the data cover businesses employing 10 or more people). However, its magnitude should be similar to that observed in January 2025. An insufficient supply of labor remains a key challenge for enterprises in several sectors of the economy.</li></ul><h3><br/><strong>Key Events in Developed Markets Next Week</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://think.ing.com/uploads/charts/_w800/1202DM_Cal.png\" width=\"431\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: Refinitiv, ING</em></p><h3><br/><strong>Key Events in EMEA Next Week</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://think.ing.com/uploads/charts/_w800/1202EMEA_Cal_1.png\" width=\"650\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: Refinitiv, ING</em></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/aluminium-tariff-rollback-talk-brings-little-relief?post=557451\">Aluminium Tariff Rollback Talk Brings Little Relief </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/polands-current-account-deficit-expands-but-external-balance-remains-healthy?post=557426\">Poland’s Current Account Deficit Expands, But External Balance Remains Healthy </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/asia-week-ahead-key-growth-data-from-japan?post=557302\">Asia Week Ahead: Key Growth Data From Japan </a><br/></div>",

In fact, I have often <a href=\"https://wealthyretirement.com/financial-literacy/whole-vs-term-life-insurance-which-do-you-need/\" target=\"_blank\">argued strongly</a> against many life insurance products in my columns. Instead, I’m urging you to be proactive about giving your loved ones everything they will need. Here are 3 ways to lighten their burden after you pass.</p><h3><br/><strong>A “Trustworthy” Option</strong></h3><p>When my dad died a few years ago, an emotional time was made much easier by the fact that my parents had all of their funeral arrangements pre-planned and all of their financial information available in one place.</p><p>Financially, everything was simple. They had arranged their affairs so that everything flowed directly to my mom without probate. To do that, they set up trusts.</p><p>Most people think of “trust fund babies” when they hear the word “trusts.” But in its simplest form, a trust helps avoid probate, which costs money and can take a very long time. It’d be a shame for your family to potentially incur court costs and have to wait for what you generously want to give them.</p><p>By the way, establishing a trust doesn’t mean the money is put aside for your heirs and you can’t access it. Not at all. You can have full access to your money whenever you want it. Then, once you pass, it is very clear what happens next to those assets.</p><p>You can also set up rules. For example, my kids are in their very early adult years. Should something happen to both my wife and me, my kids would get enough to live on, but they wouldn’t get the full amount until a certain age.</p><p>My kids are good kids. But an exponential increase in one’s net worth in their early 20s may be too tempting for even the most responsible young adults.</p><p>If you do have significant assets, a trust can help your heirs avoid taxes as well. You worked hard for your money and have already paid taxes on it. The last thing you want is for your kids or other heirs to give up a sizable portion of your estate to Uncle Sam.</p><p>It does cost some money to set up a trust – usually a few thousand dollars, depending on how complicated the trust will be. But simple ones take an hour or so of meeting with an attorney, and then reviewing and signing the paperwork.</p><p>Every financial planner I know has said a trust is worth every penny. You don’t have to be rich to set up a trust. I strongly recommend looking into it rather than using a simple will.</p><h3><br/><strong>Make Your Funeral Arrangements in Advance</strong></h3><p>Another thing that made it easier when my dad passed was that the funeral was prearranged. My mom just had to make one call to the funeral home, and everything was taken care of. When I asked what I could do to help with the funeral, there was literally nothing left to do.</p><p>I remember what it was like when other family members passed – and the intense scrambling to put a service together and honor the deceased’s wishes.</p><p>If you can, prearrange your funeral and make sure your family knows how to put everything in motion. That way, they can spend more time comforting each other and less time trying to figure out details.</p><h3><br/><strong>The Password Is...</strong></h3><p>It’s hard enough to remember our own online passwords, much less to figure out the passwords belonging to our loved ones. Make a list of passwords, and make sure your heirs know where that list is. I would also code it somehow.</p><p>We have two electronic documents, one with usernames and another with passwords. I suggest that the documents have fake names, like “SummerTrip2015” or “WeddingSongs” – something no one would care about if they got access to your computer. Our kids have copies of the documents, and they also know how to access our computers.</p><p>If something happens to us, I don’t want my kids wasting hours on hold with the cable company, my cellphone provider, etc., trying to explain the situation and getting bounced from department to department. I want them to be able to log on and cancel my service with the click of a button.</p><p>These aren’t pleasant topics to talk about – and certainly not your typical Valentine’s Day fare. But in my opinion, taking care of these things now is the ultimate expression of love that you can show your partner or heirs.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/dmlp-a-12-yielder-with-a-recent-dividend-hike?post=556782\">DMLP: A 12% Yielder With A Recent Dividend Hike</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/gambling-and-prediction-markets-vs-building-real-wealth?post=556600\">Gambling And Prediction Markets Vs.

But history and evidence suggest that now could be a great time to buy beaten-down software stocks, suggests Lucas Downey, co-founder of <a href=\"https://moneyflows.com/solutions/individual/\" target=\"_blank\">MoneyFlows</a>.</p><p>Software companies have been doomed. As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to make productivity advancements, investors have discounted the group substantially. In fact, we are witnessing some of the largest outflows in the sector -- ever.</p><p>To give you an idea of the magnitude of the software selloff, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/IGV\">IGV</a>) has plunged 28% since November. This fund holds a basket of the largest tech stocks on the planet, including Microsoft Corp. (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/MSFT\">MSFT</a>) and Palantir Technologies Inc. (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/PLTR\">PLTR</a>).<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"chart\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://msgraphics.blob.core.windows.net/content/article-img/tradingidea64862.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p><br/>Programmatic forced selling has hit the group extremely hard. This brings us to our signal study. The widely followed Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures technical momentum, fell to 14.16 on Feb. 5. This is the lowest reading going back decades.</p><p>Normally, you don’t want to catch a falling knife. However, forced-selling events present a rare oversold signal. I went back and found that the IGV ETF has measured an RSI of 17 or lower just six times in history, including the tech routs in 2001 and 2006.</p><p>Here’s what happened next:</p><ul><li>One week later, software stocks fell 1.8% on average</li><li>But one month later, they jumped 12.1%</li><li>Three months later, they ramped 35.2%</li><li>Six months later, they soared 31.2%</li></ul><p>Now, should you definitely expect these types of gains in 2026? No. But the evidence points to better days ahead -- and I personally agree. Top-tier software stocks will likely thrive again.</p><p>Just make sure you bet on the best names loved by institutional investors. Bet on the outliers.

Constellation Energy, Excelerate Energy, and Par Pacific Holdings’s Earnings ESP readings are currently pegged at +3.13%, +1.03%, and +1.24%, respectively.</p><p>Constellation Energy, Excelerate Energy, and Par Pacific Holdings reported average earnings surprises of 3.23%, 26.72%, and 77.46%, respectively, in the past four quarters.</p><h3><br/><strong>Factors Likely to Have Shaped Energy Transfer’s Q4 Earnings</strong></h3><p>Fee-based contracts are estimated to have generated nearly 90% of Energy Transfer’s earnings, a pattern that is expected to persist in the performance of the to-be-reported quarter. These largely fee-driven arrangements offer a stable and predictable revenue base, which is likely to have supported the company’s fourth-quarter performance.</p><p>Energy Transfer has entered into multiple long-term natural gas supply agreements with major customers, which are similarly expected to have positively impacted fourth-quarter earnings. In addition, the company has brought new processing plants online, enabling it to meet rising demand in service areas and further enhance earnings.</p><p>The company’s earnings are expected to have benefited from robust NGL export volumes. Energy Transfer’s export terminals provide exceptional flexibility and ship-loading capabilities, enabling exports to more than 55 countries. With roughly 1.4 million barrels per day of export capacity, this segment is likely to have played a meaningful role in the company's fourth-quarter performance.</p><p>The company has continued to leverage its extensive pipeline network across major production basins to benefit from rising hydrocarbon output. After higher volumes of natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids were transported in the third quarter, a similar trend is likely to have carried into the fourth quarter.</p><h3><br/><strong>Energy Transfer Stock Trading at a Discount</strong></h3><p>Energy Transfer units appear to be somewhat inexpensive on a relative basis, with the stock's trailing 12-month Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization (EV/EBITDA TTM) being 9.38X compared with the industry average of 11.27X.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Zacks Investment Research\" height=\"223\" src=\"https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d2/146276.jpg?v=1016213956\" width=\"650\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</em></p><h3><br/><strong>Energy Transfer Stock’s Price Performance</strong></h3><p>Energy Transfer’s units have gained 5.1% in the past six months compared with the Zacks <a href=\"https://www.zacks.com/stocks/industry-rank/industry/oil-and-gas-production-pipeline-mlb-221\">Oil and Gas Production Pipeline – MLB</a> industry’s rise of 9%.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Zacks Investment Research\" height=\"372\" src=\"https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/5e/146282.jpg?v=856441265\" width=\"650\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</em></p><h3><br/><strong>Investment Thesis</strong></h3><p>Energy Transfer manages a vast network of nearly 140,000 miles of pipelines and associated infrastructure across 44 states, giving it a strong strategic advantage to benefit from rising U.S. production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.</p><p>Continued investments to expand pipeline and processing capacity are set to reinforce Energy Transfer’s leadership in the midstream space. Its robust LNG export capabilities, alongside growing domestic demand, are expected to continue supporting performance growth.</p><p>Yet, the company relies on several major producers for its natural gas supply, and the loss of any one of them could negatively affect financial results unless comparable sources are quickly replaced.</p><h3><br/><strong>Summing Up</strong></h3><p>Energy Transfer has continued to capitalize on rising demand by efficiently utilizing its expansive U.S. asset base. Strategic acquisitions, alongside organic growth initiatives, have further enhanced the company’s overall performance.</p><p>The long-term outlook remains favorable, underpinned by the company’s wide geographic reach and continued focus on expanding operations through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions. That said, near-term softness in the Bakken region might have weighed on storage margins.</p><p>In the quarter to be reported, earnings estimates have gone down over the past 60 days. The stock has also returned lower than its industry in the past six months. So, investors should exercise caution, and perhaps consider staying on the sidelines for now and waiting for a better entry point after the earnings release.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/tech-stocks-down-50-buy-the-dip-or-a-major-market-shift?post=557500\">Tech Stocks Down 50%: Buy The Dip Or A Major Market Shift?</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/the-surge-in-micron-technology-stock-looks-poised-to-continue?post=557423\">The Surge In Micron Technology Stock Looks Poised To Continue </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/nvidia-vs-smci-which-ai-hardware-stock-is-the-better-buy-now?post=557399\">Nvidia Vs.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Free illustrations of Recession\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/05/03/12/27/recession-5124813_960_720.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/illustrations/recession-economic-crisis-business-5124813/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em></p><p><br/>When will the market bottom? That's the question everyone seems to be pondering at the moment. I’ve warned folks for weeks about rising risks in the stock market. The wrong sectors led us higher while the right ones faded. Now the crowd is finally noticing the pattern.</p><p>Look, I’ve seen this exact setup play out dozens of times. So, naturally, I’ve learned how to get ahead of the turn. Today, I’ll take you through the specific signal I watch to identify when selling is about to exhaust itself.</p><h3><br/><strong>The Fear Story Always Changes, The Pattern Never Does</strong></h3><p>Every correction needs a narrative. This time, it is AI taking everyone's jobs and leaving us all poor. A few months ago, it was inflation. Before that, the banking crisis. The story continues to rotate while the mechanics underneath stay the same.</p><p>I think the AI fear is exaggerated. But it does not matter what I think. This narrative has to play out in the coming weeks to bring stocks lower. We need to see real fear and real liquidation. We are not there yet. Just this week, industrials, consumer staples, and basic materials all hit new all-time highs. Utilities have been surging, too.</p><p>When a real pullback arrives, nothing gets spared. I do not care how defensive the sector is. Forced liquidation hits everything. It is the reason I brought up bonds to you last week. Bonds tend to do well when stocks do not, and they have been surging recently. That rotation is confirmation, not coincidence.</p><p>Let me be clear about the bigger picture. I do not think we are heading into a bear market. I am still very bullish on the long-term and intermediate-term trends. Every single year has meaningful drawdowns. To demonstrate this, I went back through the data from 2010 forward:</p><ul><li>2011 had a 21% drawdown and still finished positive</li><li>2018 had both a 12% and a 20% drawdown in the same year</li><li>2020 had four separate drawdowns, including a 36% crash</li><li>2022 had seven distinct pullbacks ranging from 6% to 19%</li><li>Even 2024 had a 6% and a 10% drawdown before rallying to new highs</li></ul><p>Corrections are the price of admission. The traders who refuse to sit through them will miss the recoveries.</p><h3><br/><strong>The One Signal I Am Watching</strong></h3><p>The most important sector in the stock market is technology. It leads on the way up and on the way down. The Nasdaq topped out back in October. It has not made a new all-time high since, even while the S&amp;P 500 hit fresh highs last week. That divergence has been the warning signal all along.</p><p>Right now, tech is leading to the downside. At some point, that will reverse. The turn does not look like a sudden rally. It looks like a subtle shift.</p><p>Picture a day where the S&amp;P 500 drops 1%, but the tech sector only drops 0.5%. That is relative strength. Even though tech is still falling, it is falling less than the broad market. That tells me bigger buyers are stepping in and absorbing supply.</p><p>It is one of the earliest and most reliable signals that a bottom is forming. I will be watching for this shift over the next two to four weeks. My base case is a bottom by mid-March at the latest.</p><p>The target on the downside is the Nov. 21 low on the S&amp;P 500. That would represent a 5%-8% washout that shakes out all the longs and flips sentiment from greed to fear. That is when the real buying opportunity arrives.</p><h3><br/><strong>How I Am Positioned</strong></h3><p>I am sitting on 90% cash right now. In some accounts, closer to 95%. I have a <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/QQQ\">QQQ</a> put on for about six weeks out, targeting a retest of previous support. I also added a small <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/SOXS\">SOXS</a> position to hedge against semiconductor weakness.</p><p>When I say I am bearish, I mean I am short with the intention of getting long. The real money is on the long side once this market finds its footing.</p><p>The Trinity Terminal has been picking up setups in inflationary sectors. Energy, consumer staples, and utilities are all leading while tech gets hit. That is textbook risk-off behavior. It seems to be telling me exactly where to look when the turn comes.</p><p>Stay patient. The biggest opportunity of 2026 is approaching fast. Positions matter more than opinions. I have mine on. Make sure you have yours ready.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/dont-fix-broken-markets-trade-them?post=557377\">Don't Fix Broken Markets.

Analysts originally estimated a 19% increase in AI hyperscaler capital expenditures for 2026. The revised figure now stands at 70%, pushing total spending to roughly $650 billion.</p><p>Goldman Sachs renewed its Buy rating for Nvidia on Feb. 5 with a $250 price target. The firm expects a beat-and-raise quarter from the chipmaker, though it also acknowledged that high expectations have already been built into the stock price.</p><p>The investment bank stated it believes near-term stock growth will depend on visibility into 2027 revenue. Potential catalysts include continued positive adjustments to hyperscaler spending through 2027 and growing confidence in demand from AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic.</p><h3><br/><strong>Tech Giants Open Their Wallets</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://coincentral.com/amazon-amzn-stock-dips-fcc-approves-4500-new-leo-satellites-expands-satellite-internet-network/\">Amazon</a> has been leading the pack with planned capital expenditures of $200 billion in 2026, up 56% from $128 billion in 2025. CEO Andy Jassy stated that customers want AWS for core and AI workloads, adding that the company is monetizing capacity as fast as it can install it.</p><p>Google has followed closely behind with $180 billion in projected spending, nearly doubling its $91 billion from 2025. The company initially estimated $75 billion in spending last year, but it has exceeded that figure by a wide margin. Cloud revenue backlog more than doubled in the fourth quarter on strong demand for Gemini models.</p><p><a href=\"https://coincentral.com/microsoft-msft-stock-slight-dip-as-tech-giants-launch-trusted-tech-alliance-for-digital-sovereignty00/\">Microsoft</a> has been on pace to spend more than $140 billion in fiscal 2026, representing a 59% increase from $88 billion in fiscal 2025. CEO Satya Nadella said the company will increase AI capacity by over 80% this year and roughly double its total data center footprint over the next two years.</p><p>Meta Platforms has planned to invest $125 billion at the midpoint in 2026, up 74% from $72 billion in 2025. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said AI investments are driving meaningful growth across its social media platforms and advertising business.</p><h3><br/><strong>Nvidia’s Profitable Position</strong></h3><p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://coincentral.com/nvidia-nvda-stock-could-jump-28-according-to-this-bullish-analyst/\">Nvidia</a> has continued to dominate the market for data center accelerators with more than 80% market share. AllianceBernstein estimated the company has captured 30% of total AI data center spending as profit.</p><p>The company’s advantage extends beyond its graphics processing units. Nvidia offers a complete solution for AI infrastructure that includes CPUs, networking equipment, and software tools. Networking revenue alone jumped 162% in the most recent quarter.</p><p>The CUDA software platform has remained the industry standard for developing GPU-accelerated applications. This full-stack approach allows Nvidia to capture a substantial portion of overall data center capital expenditures.</p><p>Allianz Technology Trust disclosed Nvidia as its largest holding at 10.11% of its portfolio as of Jan. 31, 2026. The position is valued at GBP210.9 million within the trust’s GBP2.09 billion in total gross assets.</p><h3><br/><strong>Historical Underestimation Pattern</strong></h3><p>Wall Street has consistently underestimated AI spending growth in recent years. The consensus forecast predicted AI hyperscaler capital expenditures would increase 19% in 2024, but actual spending soared 54%.</p><p>The pattern repeated in 2025. Analysts predicted a 22% increase, while actual spending jumped 64%, according to Goldman Sachs. The 2026 projections appear to be following the same trajectory. The initial 19% estimate has been revised upward to 70% as the four hyperscalers announced their expanded budgets.</p><p>Nvidia shares closed at $182.81 on Feb. 13, 2026, down 2.21% for the day. The stock has gained 1,180% since early 2023. The median analyst price target of $250 per share implies 33% upside from recent levels.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/bitcoin-and-ethereum-etfs-see-outflows-as-investors-eye-international-markets?post=557457\">Bitcoin And Ethereum ETFs See Outflows As Investors Eye International Markets </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/xrp-price-may-stage-a-recovery-if-it-successfully-backtests-the-8-year-resistance-line?post=557354\">XRP Price May Stage A Recovery If It Successfully Backtests The 8-Year Resistance Line</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/bitcoin-futures-data-suggests-bears-targeting-60k-amid-price-drop?post=557063\">Bitcoin Futures Data Suggests Bears Targeting $60K Amid Price Drop</a><br/></div>",

That tells you serious money is still being committed to this space, despite cryptocurrency sentiment souring recently.</p><p>This week gave us a clear real-world example of that gap between short-term mood and long-term strategy. Because cryptocurrency investors were pulling back while the world’s largest asset manager was wiring traditional assets into DeFi rails.</p><h3><br/><strong>Big Money Isn't Leaving Crypto</strong></h3><p>BlackRock, which manages more than $12.5 trillion in assets, said this week that its tokenized Treasury fund known as BUIDL can now trade through infrastructure tied to Uniswap.</p><p>BUIDL is basically a digital version of a conservative bond fund that was launched in 2024 and is now valued at roughly $2 billion. It holds short-term U.S. government debt and cash, and investors earn income from those holdings the same way they would in a traditional fixed-income product.</p><p>The difference is how ownership is tracked. Instead of shares sitting inside brokerage accounts and clearing networks, investors hold blockchain tokens that represent their stake. These tokens can now be bought and sold using decentralized trading systems rather than relying entirely on traditional middlemen.</p><p>Because Uniswap <a href=\"https://links.mb.banyanhill.com/s/c/kHlHWA6dvgY7XRmOZcLe_qG2ngXG2BwGU6xubB1Bx_2RXJeWsv1chkw1uLPfqoCUXzEuEEHLHJ_WKgupoLAEYKsg-TF84d8Z1p1mlT8FwDFgi5M3jesOCyqMhDt6YVie-MHNFZzTx05a42_tBUrjFxJw6G-TYr7SLObGSSBOEO1fJ3TIwTLUUZk8uhNcEMrUEl38KsCM-7_MFCZHniMNSUMCvT2Lrsz6kf3t-WGFSUNGkZBBazO6-_CLvQWImvvpRWWLccmC9jls-__sYk4coGKKthv8d8mDvUQEZ3Ok6DJgt6Fesfy-7jlVHXWiEEJmZJIccTnONyfPrAi3TVw1dHLhmVLQdQg9rFWmkY-a_ZPDfzbFbvMT1QEeEnWVnnh5cbUXB5jIIdvqcFjBR3oxUcXxDcGWU94mwbx43PwKRonWQOZU0XBDQNq74LHU1l_CqC31a1kezm632MjrHb0DVHiZOXx9EDggrNtwrZffgMHM3j-TEi2cNNCmK-yxpxE2bT65Ab-BZRZ5jx9xJmKwfvQx1uYSy9BTtCScXK-dd4U4UKL1OCQhYCATYvBRgfTN54l4jeXIib3cJ56E5UhtQ4H_idhOpJPR38eXNeesCFebi8Cayt5JnQRF5Snld8Y55S3ewyG1GQuv6PKiCEdCpWy8FxJPEJT1EtZNdn0N6OVDdPC-LEMUD0Mpp8wElVRkhLgbJac3N20YTN31Bcn7-U17-GvL3AhS7KpHn0yC_LHsdMOQEvwh3Ae-Cq1R9TdNM3kATHruMDKjbR4XAwWUX_K867vI13wq_nik6cez2x6WvH7phQzq2NhXcPwNSflZJBiduFY1v2rNNvpuczWho_N3lzRafWG0Y4OvSoHMiw/tSyiBnoDILJn7gsMSYvZv-2YRtQdn6_p/17\" target=\"_blank\">isn’t a stock exchange</a>. It’s software that runs on a blockchain.</p><p>Uniswap allows assets to trade through shared pools of capital supplied by participants. When someone wants to buy or sell, those pools provide the other side of the trade. The software sets prices and completes transactions automatically, and people who supply capital earn a portion of the trading fees.</p><p>This is what keeps activity flowing. But access to this setup isn’t open to the public. Only large, approved investors can trade BUIDL this way. Professional trading firms commit capital on both sides of the market so transactions can happen without big price swings.</p><p>And it’s worth remembering that Bitcoin still sits at the center of this ecosystem. It remains the primary benchmark asset and institutional entry point into the space. That’s why I said this past week that short-term volatility doesn’t change Bitcoin’s structural role in the market.</p><p>So why did BlackRock make this move now? It has nothing to do with retail cryptocurrency speculation. Instead, it’s a test of whether blockchain systems can handle real financial assets at scale. In other words, it’s a test of the plumbing that keeps markets running.</p><p>Traditional trades move through middlemen and can take days to settle. But blockchain systems handle matching and ownership directly with software, which can drastically speed things up.</p><p>Think about sending money overseas 20 years ago compared with how instant digital payments work today. That’s the type of efficiency experiment underway here. Roughly $100 billion already sits in DeFi liquidity pools, and large institutions are exploring whether those systems can improve how traditional assets trade and settle.</p><p>BlackRock isn’t migrating markets yet. The company is simply testing whether some of the core functions behind traditional markets can run on these newer blockchain rails.</p><p>But the timing lines up perfectly with <a href=\"https://links.mb.banyanhill.com/s/c/rUsdj6ComPO8oqn3uDcUlQqTAkRH2Bvjs492Q9C60hkBsg7viiCaBwajCsBKjAw7yr01DlHYFgMuMYGNemqZMrYrdVgLRccyXZsL7gjBnoKu64MkIrQPSdF0SpoewqB9R51gbci0kpgZm_hUjx74j5N-zx47wgu5vGXfkUOtqwcCekQfvR1Fx70JoK53sxeHq7IKqr25CnV7v_ProJx3mi3gpCaJ3cUgbmyNvxJZG3CVTzbE3-weeFSoKJLpVTGgfKWgn_HtXfFqnAOii_qxstQmgMb2jomXQOudWa7P-5vEgWbe94ou0NcBfi7MSipj9Kz3vKopT1_1dobDPAN29tTmynqNTBqqEnXYKO56AmHyCa3ER6c297vqVx06dFzEbu3w9z8Pgo9lcUsUKbxCl90zKyVQvCCJSc_xv-Tp2LI9dovbKzw2bjDyjexwzpvDOpOUFE4ZVzpxDWEwfkXjtgU2oLXgLDgfizGN5WZ_vViykAev45LA4g3i5apVHPcX_DUf5iPn5FKea_whcqg069AyA2tc6w7JdLxI9bPqYmjkopqVCw8YzJUIfIkoB8uBKOi94dtIviUKDD9LF_X4en8Gfh_lVizRXrGr9FdmcsMIeViltpmtHleRRlrnX7fiATeyygEDqFTGhhYorK0hQf8OiL5THoLo_gItnB0dPqXiTuvqiJjBv9poPLWBDhEJhnimfX-5yxeIZG7PTvno8j_DsvUq2TCPwawvmxGtj4qFan1ziu9sbqXd0Z2JYWmBkzLtwTVBRjyYWiy3FsVYv3rhCy3sDx0W-pUbvHm1NCzoPDZ9QAy8cEZeHAvmmjh2l33cYRGF6MOLAyI5QO8nnGlvX1zfjGs-tOQQTI_qyyHxTY5h3Nh0gPdONOlpEcPbvuD7/7DFrDISm-jEKzjbHWJW6PghtmPLQm0hm/17\" target=\"_blank\">what I wrote about earlier this week</a> and what I talked about during the summit. Major infrastructure advances in cryptocurrency rarely coincide with peak enthusiasm. They tend to happen during rough patches like this, when most people are focused on falling prices.</p><p>After the 2018 crash, decentralized lending began gaining traction. After the 2020 shock, tools for institutional custody expanded. And following the 2022 downturn, tokenization efforts accelerated.</p><p>During all of those downturns, development kept moving forward even as the mood turned negative. That’s because retail investors often react to volatility, while institutions tend to look further ahead That doesn’t mean the big money ignores price swings.

Even after Bitcoin fell from above $125,000 in October 2025 to around $90,000 by year-end, roughly 70% of institutional investors still viewed it as undervalued, compared to about 60% of non-institutional investors who agreed.</p><p>That helps explain what’s happening right now. Many investors are reacting to volatility, but financial institutions are focused on where the technology is headed over the long run. Short-term price swings don’t change that trajectory.</p><h3><br/><strong>Here's My Take</strong></h3><p>While media coverage has focused on fears of potential “crypto winter,” the world’s largest asset manager was busy testing blockchain trading systems.</p><p>BlackRock’s latest move reinforces something I keep coming back to: Market sentiment and capital don’t always move together. Even though cryptocurrency sentiment has soured recently, major financial firms continue to invest in blockchain infrastructure. That tells me the technology is being evaluated as a long-term tool, not a short-term trade.</p><p>I’ve seen this same dynamic play out across previous cycles. It has been consistent enough that I factor it into how I read the market. And there’s another pattern that tends to form when fear peaks. I’ve seen it three times in my career, and each time it led to some of my biggest gains. That same setup is forming again today.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/chart-of-the-week-the-ai-race-is-now-a-spending-race?post=557385\">Chart Of The Week: The AI Race Is Now A Spending Race </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/technology/chart-of-the-week-how-ai-is-learning-to-stay-on-the-job?post=555322\">Chart Of The Week: How AI Is Learning To Stay On The Job </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/chart-of-the-week-two-superpowers-two-energy-futures?post=553658\">Chart Of The Week: Two Superpowers, Two Energy Futures </a><br/></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Old People, Pensioners, Pension, Money, Currency, Euro\" height=\"220\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/07/29/14/31/old-people-1553348_960_720.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/images/id-1553348/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em></p><p><br/>Getting a lump sum to invest sounds like a good problem—and it is—but it can also feel like an anxiety-inducing puzzle. Maybe the money came from an inheritance, selling a cottage, cleaning up your portfolio, or simply letting dividends pile up for longer than you meant to. However it happened, the question remains: what do you buy, and when do you buy it?</p><p>Most investors get stuck because they’re trying to avoid regret:</p><ul><li>Buy today and the market might drop tomorrow. </li><li>Wait for a pullback and the market might keep rising without you. </li></ul><p>The solution isn’t a perfect prediction. It’s a plan that removes emotion from the driver’s seat. A good lump-sum plan has two parts. First, you decide where the money will go. Then you decide how you’ll deploy it over time.</p><h3><br/><strong>Where to Invest Your Lump Sum</strong></h3><p>Before you think about timing, you need clarity on what you’re buying. If you skip this step, market noise will fill the gap and you’ll end up reacting instead of executing.</p><p>Start by revisiting your investment goals. In plain terms, what do you want your portfolio to do for you? </p><ul><li>Some investors want maximum long-term growth and are comfortable with volatility. </li><li>Others want income now, with steady dividend growth, so their income rises over time. </li><li>Many may want a blend of both. </li></ul><p>Goals aren’t fixed, either. Earlier in the accumulation phase, it’s common to take more risk and lean into growth. As retirement gets closer, stability and reliability become more important.</p><p>Once you’ve clarified the goal, the structure becomes easier to define. You’ll have a better idea of your asset allocation—whether you want a stock-only portfolio or a mix that includes ETFs, bonds, or GICs/Certificates of Deposits. </p><p>You’ll also be able to set a sector allocation that makes sense for you, meaning the mix of economic sectors you want exposure to and the role each one plays.</p><h3><br/><strong>Review Your Current Portfolio</strong></h3><p>If you already have a portfolio, a lump sum can become a powerful tool. Review what you own and identify areas that need reinforcement. The most common issues fall into three categories: </p><ol><li>Overweight positions</li><li>Lightweight positions</li><li>Loser stocks</li></ol><h3><br/><strong>The Overweight Sectors or Positions Issue</strong></h3><p>Overweight sectors or companies can make a portfolio more vulnerable, because you can get hit by a problem that affects a single industry. Diversification isn’t about owning many names—it’s about avoiding one event ruining the year. <br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://thedividendguyblog.com/wp-content/themes/leia-en/imagenes/2026/02/aqn-drop.png\"><img alt=\"Algonquin (AQN.TO) 5-year Total Return Chart.\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://thedividendguyblog.com/wp-content/themes/leia-en/imagenes/2026/02/aqn-drop-1024x678.png\" width=\"650\"/></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Algonquin (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AQN\">AQN</a>) Five-Year Total Return Chart</em></p><p><br/>If you are overweight, you can use the lump sum to add exposure elsewhere and rebalance, or you can trim a position that has become uncomfortably large.</p><p>If you’re near retirement or already retired, there’s an extra layer that many people miss. You shouldn’t only look at diversification by market value; you should also look at diversification by dividend income. </p><p>A smaller position in a high-yield stock can produce more income than a much larger position in a low-yield stock. If you rely on dividends to fund your lifestyle, income concentration can sneak up on you even when your portfolio looks diversified on paper.</p><h3><br/><strong>The Lightweight Positions Issue</strong></h3><p>Lightweight positions are the opposite issue. Those tiny holdings—one percent here, another percent there—rarely change your results. Even if they double, you won’t feel it. </p><p>If you truly like the company and still believe in the thesis, a lump sum may be the perfect time to dip that “toe in the water” into a meaningful position. If you don’t have conviction or you barely follow the company anymore, it may simply be clutter.</p><h3><br/><strong>The Losers Issue</strong></h3><p>Then there are loser stocks. A stock that’s down 40% needs to rise about 66% just to get you back to even. That math is unforgiving. Sometimes a stock is down for temporary reasons and it can recover, but holding a loser for years just to “break even” isn’t a strategy—it’s hope. </p><p>A lump sum can often be the right time to conduct an honest review: </p><ul><li>Why is the stock down?</li><li>How long has it been down?</li><li>Is the business still strong enough to justify staying invested? </li></ul><p>If not, selling and reallocating into something more resilient can improve your portfolio faster than waiting for a comeback that may never arrive.</p><h3><br/><strong>Building a New Portfolio</strong></h3><p>If you don’t have a portfolio yet and the lump sum is your seed money, the process is similar. </p><ul><li>Start with goals</li><li>Select a mix of sectors you understand</li><li>Decide how many stocks you want to own</li></ul><p>You don’t need every sector in the market, but you do want enough diversity to avoid being overly dependent on one part of the economy. As a general guideline, I prefer exposure to at least seven or eight sectors aligned with the portfolio’s objective. I’m also careful not to let a single sector become the entire story. Even within a sector, I prefer to diversify by industry. </p><p>Owning five companies that all behave the same way isn’t much protection. Here are quick steps to choosing between similar candidates:</p><ol><li>Start with the differences in their business models. </li><li>If they still appear equally compelling, comparing their 'Dividend Triangl'e—revenue growth, earnings growth, and dividend growth—usually clarifies the decision.</li><li>If not, dig deeper: Cash flow, debt ratios, payout ratios, etc.</li></ol><h3><br/><strong>When to Invest Your Lump Sum</strong></h3><p>Once you know what you want to buy, the emotional tug-of-war shifts to timing. This is where many investors freeze, because putting a large amount to work can feel like stepping onto a moving escalator. The market could drop right after you buy, and nobody enjoys seeing a new position immediately in the red.</p><p>The financial literature often says the best time to invest is “now,” because markets trend upward over time and money can’t compound if it’s parked on the sidelines. </p><p>That’s true, but it doesn’t automatically mean investing 100% in a single day is right for you. If doing so causes stress that leads to poor decisions later, the “optimal” plan becomes impractical. Waiting for the perfect moment is the other common trap. It usually starts reasonably: </p><ul><li>You wait to see what happens next month. </li><li>Then you wait for inflation or interest rates to improve. </li><li>Then you wait for a pullback.</li><li>Then you wait for political tensions to cool down or for the elections to occur.</li><li>When the pullback finally arrives, you hesitate because it might fall further. </li></ul><p>That pattern doesn’t protect your portfolio; it protects your anxiety.</p><p>A practical middle ground is to invest the lump sum in planned intervals over a defined period, such as six to nine months. This approach works because it removes the need to time the market. </p><p>If the market falls early, you average down with later purchases. If the market rises, you still got started and you’re averaging in. Most importantly, you replace emotional decision-making with a schedule.</p><h3><br/><strong>Make Your Plan and Buy</strong></h3><p>Here’s what that can look like in real life. Choose your time window—let's say six months—and decide in advance when you will invest. Then divide your planned purchases into equal parts. A simple version may look like this:</p><ul><li>Invest one-third now.</li><li>Invest one-third in three months.</li><li>Invest the final third three months after that.</li></ul><p>Before each buy date, take a few minutes to review the latest quarterly results and make sure nothing fundamental has changed. You’re not looking for perfection; you’re simply confirming the thesis is intact.</p><h3><br/><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p>A lump sum often feels intimidating because it concentrates a lot of emotion into one decision. But with a clear plan—what you’ll buy, how it fits your goals, and how you’ll deploy the money over time—you don’t need a perfect market call. </p><p>You just need a process you can stick with long enough to let your portfolio do its job.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/cdrs-convenient-pizza-slices-or-should-you-just-buy-the-whole-pizza?post=555734\">CDRs: Convenient Pizza Slices, Or Should You Just Buy The Whole Pizza?</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/when-ai-stops-being-tech-and-starts-being-the-economy-investment-themes-for-2026?post=551990\">When AI Stops Being “Tech” And Starts Being The Economy - Investment Themes For 2026</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/4-tech-stocks-immune-to-the-ai-bubble?post=551670\">4 Tech Stocks Immune To The AI Bubble </a><br/></div>",

Its lead product is Afrezza, an inhalable form of insulin for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics, highlights Nate Pile, editor of <a href=\"https://www.notwallstreet.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nate’s Notes</a>.</p><p>While the slow rate of adoption of this game-changing way to manage blood sugar has been frustrating for many shareholders to live through, there is good news. Not only is the product slowly but surely making inroads against traditional ways to administer insulin, but the company has filed with the FDA to officially expand the label to include pediatric patients – along with the adult population it is already approved for.</p><p>To be sure, there are never any guarantees when it comes to how the FDA will rule on such things. But I believe the odds are good that the product will be approved for this important segment of the market sometime in the second quarter of 2026.</p><p>Though only time will tell how the new label will change the landscape, common sense suggests that there is plenty of room for the product to surprise on the upside once doctors and parents alike are made aware of the option for their newly diagnosed patients/children.</p><h3><br/><strong>MannKind Corp. (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/MNKD\">MNKD</a>) Stock Chart</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"chart\" height=\"213\" src=\"https://msgraphics.blob.core.windows.net/content/article-img/tptp64742.png\" width=\"650\"/></p><p><br/>Along with manufacturing and marketing Afrezza on its own, MannKind also produces a form of inhalable treprostinil called Tyvaso DPI for its partner, United Therapeutics Corp. (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/UTHR\">UTHR</a>). United not only pays MannKind to manufacture the product, but also shares 10% of all sales of the product with MannKind.</p><p>I am also very pleased to report that MannKind recently acquired another small company. It has submitted a Supplement New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA for approval of a rapid-acting furosemide auto-injector for treating edema in heart/kidney disease. It will cut the time required to administer the drug from several hours to roughly 10 seconds – and analysts are optimistic that this product will help drive additional revenue growth for MannKind.</p><p>Biopharma stocks tend to be more volatile than stocks in most other sectors. So, investors are encouraged to build positions by making several small purchases over an extended period of time rather than with a single large purchase all at once. But I believe the risk-reward ratio on this stock is more attractive than it is for many others.</p><p>My recommended action would be to consider purchasing shares of MannKind Corp.</p><h3><br/><strong>About the Author</strong></h3><p>While earning a degree in Mathematics from U.C.

Yet despite the severity of these drawdowns, the broader market has remained surprisingly resilient.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has been sitting only about 2% below record levels, a divergence that highlights a powerful shift occurring beneath the surface. Capital has rotated. Energy, industrials, consumer staples, and a range of international markets have absorbed flows as investors have repositioned toward areas with more attractive valuations and cyclical tailwinds.</p><p>The move has been particularly evident overseas. Korean equities have benefited from semiconductor leadership, South African markets have rallied alongside metals, and several European exchanges have advanced on the back of defense spending and financial sector strength. This expanding participation has provided critical support to index performance even as many headline technology stocks have corrected.</p><p>The central question now is whether this represents a more durable, structural change in market leadership or a more cyclical rotation within an ongoing bull market.</p><p>While certainty is impossible, disciplined portfolio construction has proven far more valuable than prediction. Remaining balanced across factors and sectors, emphasizing valuation awareness, exposure to uncorrelated trends, and rigorous risk management can allow investors to navigate the turbulence more effectively. The recent strength in areas such as gold and energy serves as a reminder that leadership rarely remains static.</p><p>My base case is that this rotation is cyclical rather than structural, ultimately creating opportunity within selectively beaten-down technology stocks, including several members of the Magnificent Seven. However, the depth and duration of this selloff remain unknowable, which is precisely why investors should avoid anchoring their strategy to forecasts.</p><p>Success in environments like this does not require perfect foresight. It requires owning durable businesses at reasonable valuations, maintaining diversification, and managing risk with intention. Investors who execute on those principles can survive and even thrive through these bouts of change.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Zacks Investment Research\" height=\"377\" src=\"https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/aa/146285.jpg?v=1590563899\" width=\"600\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</em></p><h3><br/><strong>What’s Driving This Stock Market Rotation?</strong></h3><p>The forces behind the recent market rotation appear to be largely cyclical rather than structural, which is an important distinction for long-term investors.</p><p>Several catalysts have converged at once. Concerns about AI overspending, a recurring theme throughout this bull market, resurfaced just as valuations across parts of the technology complex had become stretched. While some members of the Magnificent Seven were affected, the sharpest repricing occurred in higher-beta technology names where expectations had drifted furthest ahead of fundamentals.</p><p>Software stocks faced an additional headwind as investors grappled with the disruptive implications of AI, prompting questions about which business models may ultimately prove durable. At the same time, rising uncertainty surrounding prospective Fed leadership, particularly fears of a more hawkish policy stance under Kevin Warsh added another layer of caution, though those concerns currently appear somewhat exaggerated.</p><p>Taken together, these developments triggered a meaningful repositioning rather than signaling a deterioration in the macro backdrop. Encouragingly, the capital that exited crowded trades did not leave equities altogether, but rather rotated.</p><p>The economy remains resilient, inflation continues to moderate, and the labor market is stable. Moreover, the recent correction has helped reset valuations among market leaders, improving forward return potential. Just as importantly, expanding participation across sectors and geographies is typically a hallmark of durable bull markets, not their end.</p><h3><br/><strong>How Investors Should Position for the Next Phase</strong></h3><p>Investors can still participate in the market’s new leadership, but selectivity is becoming increasingly important as some areas may already be approaching overextended territory. The strongest opportunities are likely to be found in companies that remain tied to durable secular growth trends but have not yet experienced dramatic multiple expansion.</p><p>Healthcare and biotech stand out as attractively positioned. Industrials should continue to benefit from the infrastructure buildout required to support AI and electrification, while energy companies remain leveraged to a stable global economy and disciplined supply dynamics. Some international segments remain appealing as well.</p><p>At the same time, the recent selloff has created pockets of opportunity among former leaders. Several Magnificent Seven stocks have been trading at more compelling valuations, and while high-beta technology names offer significant rebound potential, investors should recognize that these exposures come with elevated volatility. Leading software companies, in particular, have repriced sharply and may warrant renewed attention as the market gains clarity on AI’s long-term winners.</p><p>The key mistake investors often make during rotations is assuming they must choose between yesterday’s winners and today’s leaders. In reality, balanced exposure tends to be more effective. Rotations rarely end bull markets, they often extend them by diffusing excess concentration and resetting expectations. For disciplined investors, periods like this are less about prediction and more about positioning.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/the-surge-in-micron-technology-stock-looks-poised-to-continue?post=557423\">The Surge In Micron Technology Stock Looks Poised To Continue </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/nvidia-vs-smci-which-ai-hardware-stock-is-the-better-buy-now?post=557399\">Nvidia Vs.

The company has a reputation as the “king of private equity.” And for good reason.</p><p>It boasts $1.2 trillion in assets under management (“AUM”) from a wide range of institutional and individual investors.

For value-oriented investors, it deserves to be on your radar.</p><h3><br/><strong>Blackstone’s One-Two Punch</strong></h3><p>We’re not even two months into the year, and Blackstone has already had two big developments that hit the stock.</p><p>The first came when President Trump attacked institutional investors buying up single-family homes (“SFH”), then renting them out. He went so far as to propose a ban on larger investors buying these properties. And while revenue from Blackstone’s residential portfolio is pretty marginal, the news was still enough to send the stock lower about 6%.</p><p>I addressed that <a href=\"https://www.widemoatresearch.com/wide-moat-daily/trumps-war-on-corporate-landlords/\" target=\"_blank\">unexpected development</a> about a month ago. At the time, I said these large investors were not the villains most people made them out to be. In many ways, they saved the day after the housing market crashed in 2008. From that article:</p><blockquote><p>[By] 2010, a record of approximately 3 million homes were foreclosed on. And, given the dire straits of the economy, not many individual buyers were stepping up to claim them.</p><p>So institutional investors stepped into the mess by buying distressed single-family homes… at very attractive prices and renting them. Very often, they’d rent them back to the former owner who was still living there.</p></blockquote><p>That housing carnage continued for years, prompting Blackstone to enter the market in 2012 through its affiliate, Invitation Homes – now an independent real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that trades under the ticker symbol <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/INVH\">INVH</a>. Blackstone has since divested its position in that venture, but it remains a major player in the game.</p><p>So it does make some sense that it has taken a hit since Trump’s announcement that he was “immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from” the SFH stage – even though, to my knowledge, nothing concrete has come of that pledge so far.</p><p>Then came the second punch.</p><p>Earlier this month, artificial-intelligence (“AI”) startup Anthropic and OpenAI released their latest AI models on the same day. Those would be Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3 Codex. The new models go beyond just being “chatbots.” They’re explicitly designed to automate tasks typically done by enterprise software. The software stocks took a big hit as investors pondered if these businesses were in the early innings of being disrupted.</p><p>Blackstone is not a software company. But private credit is a large part of its business. And as Stephen Hester wrote in a recent edition of Intelligent Options Advisor:</p><blockquote><p>In short, investors are worried that the growth story for many Software as a Service (“SaaS”) companies is over. These companies aren’t going bankrupt overnight, but they could be under pressure if new AI tools disrupt their business models.</p><p>This fear has bled over into the firms that lend to these companies. After all, enterprise software is typically 15% to 25% of every diversified private-credit portfolio. That’s the thinking, anyway.</p></blockquote><p>The result is that Blackstone's stock moved down about 12% year-to-date. And it shifted down about 30% from its 52-week high.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://files.widemoatresearch.com/WM/main/2026/02/12145843/021226-Wide-Moat-Blackstones-Tough-Few-Weeks.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"325\" src=\"https://files.widemoatresearch.com/WM/main/2026/02/12145843/021226-Wide-Moat-Blackstones-Tough-Few-Weeks.png\" width=\"510\"/></a></p><p><br/>But, as they say, if you come at the king, you’d best not miss. And, to me, Blackstone still looks like the king -- one with a tantalizingly cheap price tag.</p><h3><br/><strong>Taking a Closer Look at the King</strong></h3><p>Like most asset managers, Blackstone doesn’t limit itself to just one department, operating in business segments such as:</p><ul><li>Real estate, where it’s a global leader with $319 billion of AUM across the world</li><li>Private equity, with $416 billion of total AUM</li><li>Credit and insurance at $443 billion</li><li>Multi-asset investing, with $96 billion in AUM – making it the world’s largest discretionary allocator to hedge funds</li></ul><p>I’ve been covering this asset manager for over a decade. Back in 2014, I wrote on Seeking Alpha how, “I’m keenly aware of the growth behind this powerful private equity firm, and I consider [its] more recent track record to be very attractive.” Sure enough, shares have returned over 618% since that article was published, compared with 270% for the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>In the fourth quarter of 2025, Blackstone posted solid results with AUM increasing 13% year-over-year, outpacing quarter three’s 12% growth. Inflows were stronger, too, a sign that investors are confident in the company’s business model. And it recorded an 11% boost to fee-earning AUM, another jump from quarter three’s 10% increase.</p><p>Generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) net income was $2 billion. Plus, distributable earnings (“DE”) were $2.2 billion, or $1.75 per common share, resulting in a $1.49 dividend. These were Blackstone’s best results ever.</p><p>For the year, DE increased 20% to $7.1 billion, or $5.57 per share. This was powered by strong growth in fee-related earnings and a significant acceleration in net realizations.</p><p>In a recent <a href=\"http://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/03XwCM8gWWI9LBOLhwf6I8zY1O?domain=widemoatresearch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>, I presented Blackstone as a good way to access the data-center sector. After all, the company owns QTS Realty – an enormous global data-center player – and is a major investor in the modernization and growth of the U.S. electric grid through Blackstone Energy Partners.</p><p>And with its fortress balance sheet, complete with $198.3 billion in investable cash, Schwarzman was completely right to declare “that Blackstone is more than ready to capitalize on any major opportunities that come up.”</p><p>Yet shares have recently been trading at around $135, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.6 times and a 2.5% dividend yield. That makes Blackstone one of the cheapest big-name asset managers around based on the spread between its recent and normal multiples, as shown below.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://files.widemoatresearch.com/WM/main/2026/02/12145906/Screenshot-2026-02-12-at-2.52.16%E2%80%AFPM.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"129\" src=\"https://files.widemoatresearch.com/WM/main/2026/02/12145906/Screenshot-2026-02-12-at-2.52.16%E2%80%AFPM.png\" width=\"540\"/></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: Wide Moat Research</em></p><p><br/>It’s hard not to see good things ahead for Blackstone -- and its investors who believe today’s bad PR doesn’t define its future.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/5-high-yield-stocks-to-buy-now-up-to-1385-yield?post=555795\">5 High-Yield Stocks To Buy Now (Up To 13.85% Yield)</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/real-estate--reits/elon-musk-boldly-goes?post=555730\">Elon Musk Boldly Goes</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/real-estate--reits/9-stocks-with-near-monopoly-power-were-buying-these-now?post=554111\">9 Stocks With Near-Monopoly Power (We’re Buying These Now)</a><br/></div>",

As <a href=\"https://haymaker.substack.com/p/haymaker-daily-c65?r=m7j5t&amp;utm_medium=email\">David Hay</a> writes, “The Roots of Populism in the U.S. can be seen in the flip side of the long ascension by Corporate America’s profit margins: the long bear market in labor’s share of income.”</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"346\" src=\"https://thefelderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/bafkreiafnnthvrt3rn67rqbqxr24nbeazxg2ic76s3ttj5vxmgixsdhnhe.jpg\" width=\"600\"/></p><p><br/><strong>CHART</strong></p><p>Supportive demographics trends and increasing globalization explain much of this dynamic. However, both are now in the process of shifting back in the other direction. As to the former, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/12/jobs-report-health-care-boomers\">Axios</a> reports, “Forget K-shaped, try gray-shaped: Older Americans are powering the economy.”</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"517\" src=\"https://thefelderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/bafkreig3gonnqflmfceulej7splkbi3d3n7r7b6k5ztxfk3t5sobjywolq.jpg\" width=\"600\"/></p><p><br/><strong>CHART</strong></p><p>As to the latter, the cost of deglobalizing the economy may be only starting to materialize. According to <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/carlquintanilla.bsky.social/post/3meqv4i23es2k\">Brean</a>, “Core CPI excluding used vehicles and shelter has edged up.

As <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/topdowncharts.bsky.social/post/3memqkyqrdn27\">Callum Thomas</a> writes, “Gold is the best performing asset during the 2020’s so far… (and bonds are the worst).

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"U.S. dollar banknote with map\" height=\"335\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1502920514313-52581002a659?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/ir5MHI6rPg0\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/><strong>Last week began with the LDP's stunning victory in Japan.</strong> However, rather than sell-off as the market expected, the yen and JGBs rallied. It appears that the yen's use as a levered funding leg for carry trades had already been adjusted. At the start of the week, reports circulated that Chinese officials were encouraging local financial institutions to de-risk from US Treasuries. Yet despite it and the better-than-expected January US employment data, the 10-year Treasury yield fell nearly 15 bp last week, the most in five months. The yield slipped below 4.05% ahead of the weekend the lowest in more than two months. The greenback fell against the G10 currencies last week but consolidation seemed to be the main feature. At the end of the week, the futures market discounted nearly 65 bp of Fed cuts this year, up from almost 56 bp at the end of the previous week. This is to say, the derivatives market is discounting two Fed cuts fully and about a 60% chance of a third. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Although it is not in economic diaries, February 20 is a \"decision day\" for the US Supreme Court.</strong> It is possible that the court delivers its decision about the president's use of emergency powers to levy broad tariffs. Judging from the event markets, most expect the court to rule against the administration. As we have noted some companies reported have sold their tariff refund claims to non-bank financial institutions for 40-50-cents on the dollar. Such a ruling may weigh on US yields, as a couple of rating agencies had cited the tariff revenue as credit positive. Although the House of Representatives approved a measure that would rescind the 25% emergency tariff on Canada over fentanyl, it seems largely symbolic. Even if it is approved by the Senate, the president will veto it. </p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/><strong>U.S.</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Drivers:</strong> The market remains sensitive to any confirmation of the so-called debasement trade. News that Chinese officials are encouraging de-risking from US Treasuries hit the dollar hard. However, the unexpected strength in the January employment data helped steady the greenback. Still, after the CPI figures, the futures market is fully discounting two rate cuts this year and little more than a 50% chance of a third. The odds of a June cut, possibly the first that Warsh chairs, have eased to almost 85% from around 97% at the end of last week. Eight Fed officials speak this week but the market seems to be more aggressive than most. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Data:</strong> It is a packed week for US data and is squeezed into four sessions due to Monday's holiday. The highlights include what will likely soft January retail sales after the large drop in vehicle sales, an increase in manufacturing output despite the continued loss of jobs, and the first estimate of Q4 data. The Atlanta Fed's GDP tracker is 3.7% growth, while the median forecast in Bloomberg's survey is for 2.8%. Lastly, the December core PCE deflator is expected to have risen to 2.9% at the headline level from 2.8% in November. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Prices:</strong> At last week's lows, the Dollar Index retraced (61.8%) of its rally off the late January low. After the midweek low, DXY remained confined to Wednesday's range (~96.50-97.25). The 96.20-40 area may cap the upside. The momentum indicators are mixed, perhaps warning of continued consolidation in the coming days. </p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/><strong>EMU</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Drivers:</strong> US considerations seem to be the key force in moving the exchange rate. European developments seem scarce and steady. The ECB is widely seen on a protracted hold. There is a small bias in the swaps market toward a cut, but the odds no more than around 15% through H1. The correlation changes in the exchange rate and interest rates (US two-year yield, German two-year yield, and the differential) are hovering near zero. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Data:</strong> With the eurozone estimate initial estimate of 0.3% quarter-over-quarter growth in Q4 25, matching the Q3 pace, the remaining December data, which this week includes industrial output, the current account and construction output is of passing interest. Germany's ZEW February survey is due February 17, but it rarely has much market impact. That leaves the highlight of the week, the flash February PMI on Friday. As of January, the manufacturing PMI was still below the 50 boom/bust level, while the service PMI was at 51.6. The composite has been above 50 since the end of 2024.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Prices:</strong> The euro rose to start the week but remained within mostly Monday's range (~$1.1810-$1.1925) for rest of the week. The 20-day moving average is around $1.1840, and the euro has not closed below it in nearly a month. The euro's bounce stalled near the halfway point of the losses from the January 27 high (~$1.2080) and the February 6 low ($1.1765). The momentum indicators are mixed and not particularly helpful now. </p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/><strong>China</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Drivers:</strong>Chinese officials continue to sanction a gradual appreciation of the RMB. Beginning last May, the daily reference rate rose in only month (September). Last week was the 12th consecutive week the fix has been lowered. In fact, a week in late November is the only week that the fix has risen since the end of September. This seems to be more a signal that some estimate that the state-owned banks are intervening on behalf of the PBOC.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Data:</strong> Chinese markets are closed from February 16 through February 23 for the Lunar New Year. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Prices:</strong> With no onshore yuan trading next week and near is best levels in several years, the market may be reluctant to push the offshore yuan far from where it was trading when the onshore market closed (~CNH6.9065). The dollar's range last week was roughly CNH6.8910-CNH6.9330. </p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/><strong>Japan</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Drivers:</strong> The market was positioned for an LDP victory in the February 8 election. The outcome was anticipated to be good for Japanese equities and negative for JGBs and the yen. While the equity call was correct, the JGBs and yen were bought not sold. It turned out that lower yields did not prevent yen strength. Market positioning seems to be a more important driver of the exchange rate than interest rates presently. The rolling 30-day correlation between changes in the dollar-yen exchange rate and the Dollar Index bottomed last month near 0.50 and reached 0.80 last week, the highest since last October. It is now a little below 0.75. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Data:</strong> The busy week for Japanese economic data kicks off with the first look at Q4 25 GDP early Monday. The world's third-largest economy is expected to have grown by around 0.5% in the quarter after it contracted by 0.6% in Q3. Consumption seems to have remained soft but business spending likely expanded and net exports may have contributed in a small way after it shaved 0.2% off Q3 GDP. The January trade balance is due, and it has deteriorated without fail at the start of the year. It recorded a surplus of JPY113.5 bln in December. At the end of the week, Japan's January CPI will be reported shortly before the preliminary February PMI. We already know from the Tokyo figures released in late January that moderating food and energy prices will likely drag the headline rate below 2.0% for the first time since March 2022. The market typically has a muted response to the PMI series, but for the record, Japan 's January composite PMI of 53.1.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Prices: </strong>In what appears to be a classic \"sell the rumor buy the fact\" type of activity, the yen defied expectations after Takaichi led the LDP to a historic victory and rallied. In fact, last week's approximately 2.8% advance was the yen's biggest weekly rally since November 2024. The dollar found support near JPY152.25, a little above last month's low (~JPY152.10). The momentum indicators warn of the risk of further dollar losses, but we are less convinced. A break could signal a move toward the JPY150.80 area, which hosts the (61.8%) retracement of the dollar's rally from last September 17, when the Fed delivered its first of three rate hikes in 2025, and the 200-day moving average, which the dollar has not settled below since October 3. A move above JPY154.50 may be an early indication that a low is in place. </p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/><strong>UK</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Drivers:</strong> The immediate risk that UK Prime Minister Starmer is forced out has receded, and that appears to have taken some pressure off sterling, as an idiosyncratic factor. The dollar seems to be driving the exchange rate. The 30-day rolling correlation between changes in sterling and the Dollar Index is around -0.80. This year's range has been about -0.70 to -0.85. The 30-day correlation of changes in sterling and the UK's two-year yield is near 0.20, and correlation with the US two-year yield is only slightly lower.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Data:</strong> The three most market significant economic reports are due this week: jobs, CPI, and retail sales. Government finances (January budget) and the preliminary February PMI also will be released. The dovish hold by the Bank of England on February 5 saw the market boost the odds of a hike at the next meeting (March) to a little more than 70% from about 20% before the meeting. Any weakness in price prices and/or activity will likely lift the chances.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Prices:</strong> After jumping from about $1.35 to $1.37 in two sessions (February 6 and February 9), sterling traded mostly sideways. It had the dubious honor of being the worst G10 currency last week, rising by about 0.20% against the dollar and falling by about 0.25% against the euro. It briefly traded at a four-day low ahead of the weekend, a little below $1.3600. A close below $1.3600 weakens the technical tone, while it may take a move above $1.3730 to indicate an upside break. </p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/><strong>Canada</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Drivers: </strong>The rolling 30-day correlation of change in the Dollar Index and in the US dollar against the US dollar has approached 0.85, the highest since June 2024. The inverse correlation of the exchange rate changes and Canada's two-year yield is about -0.42. Last March, it recorded 2025 extreme near -0.65. It reached almost +0.40 in early October 2025. The 30-day correlation of changes in the exchange rate and the US two-year note is near zero. It has not been above about 0.20 since last October. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Data:</strong> Canada saw the foreign appetite for its stocks and bonds wane last year as the merchandise trade deficit grew three-fold. The December updates are due this week. Though November, the merchandise trade deficit stood at C$30.6 bln compared with C$8.9 bln in the first 11 months of 2024. Foreign portfolio net inflows were about C$121 bln in the January-November period, down from C$179 bln in the comparable 2024 period. Canada also reports December retail sales, coming after a 1.3% surge in November (1.7%) excluding autos sales. The January CPI is on tap, as well. Headline inflation finished last year at 2.4%, with the core at 2.5%. Bank of Canada Governor Macklem has suggested that the underlying core measures (median and trimmed mean at 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively) may be exaggerated. The Bank of Canada is widely understood to be on hold, and the bar to another cut seem high.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Prices:</strong> The US dollar recorded a bullish outside up day in the middle of last week as it recovered from a test on CAD1.3500. Follow-through buying lifted it to almost CAD1.3640 ahead of the weekend. This largely met the (61.8%) retracement objective of the decline from February 6 high (~CAD1.3725) to the midweek low. The 20-day moving average is near CAD1.3660, and the greenback has not settled above it since January 21. A move above it could signal a return to the CAD1.3750 area. </p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/><strong>Australia</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Drivers:</strong> The bull case for the Australian dollar is predicated on the prospects of tighter monetary policy, as a G10 proxy for China, and its exposure to commodities, especially the metals. The rolling 30-day correlation with changes in gold is near 0.80, the highest in two years. It is around 0.48 with copper. It peaked last June twice as much. The inverse correlation with the Dollar Index is around -0.70, the most extreme since last October. The correlation of changes in the Aussie and Australia's two-year yield is a little below 0.25. It has not been above 0.40 for nearly three years. The correlation with changes in the two-year US yield is a little above 0.40. Except for a brief period last month, the counter-intuitive positive correlation has been the case since the middle of last October. Last year, it was inverted in January and February and was positively correlated between March and late May, when it became inverted until early Q4. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Data: </strong>The minutes from the recent meeting at which the central bank lifted the target rate by 25 bp, will be reported early Tuesday, followed by Q4 wage data the following day. On Thursday, the January employment data will be reported. In 2025, Australia's full-time positions increased by an average 8.3k a month. In 2024, the average was about 22.3k a month. The unemployment rate stood at 4.1% in December 2025 and 4.0% in December 2024. The participation rate eased to 66.7% at the end of 2025 from 67.1% at the end of 2024. Lastly, at the end of the week, the flash February PMI will be released. Recall that in January, the composite PMI jumped to 55.7 from 51.0, the highest since April 2022, with new orders and employment rising. Separately, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand meets early on February 18. Its easing cycle is over, and the swaps market has a hike fully discounted by the end of October. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Prices:</strong> The Australian dollar peaked on February 12 slightly shy of $0.7150, a three-year high. Profit-taking kicked in and the Aussie fell to about $0.7045 before the weekend. The momentum indicators are mixed. Chart support is seen in the $0.7000-20 area. It would seem that much of the good news has been discounted in the Aussie's nearly 6% rally in the first half of Q1. The four-week rally in tow is the longest since June-July 2024. </p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/><strong>Mexico</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Drivers:</strong> The dollar remains stuck it its trough against the Mexican peso. It is generally true for many Latam currencies, including the Brazilian real, and the Colombian and Chilean pesos. Two shared characteristics stand out: relatively high rates and commodity exposure. The Mexican peso may also benefit from mostly global liquidity (admittedly it is not evenly distributed) and relatively low volatility. Over the past 30 sessions, changes in the US dollar against the peso are more inversely correlated with the JP Morgan Emerging Market Currency Index than the MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index (~-0.80 vs. -0.38). To dollar-based investors, between the yield pickup and the peso's gains, the return so far this year is about 5.7%. It is 4.7% for euro-based investors and 3.3% for yen-based investors.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Data:</strong> There are two notable reports in the coming days, and both are due in the second half of the coming week. On Thursday, the record from the recent Banxico meeting that seemed to confirm an extended pause in policy will be reported. On Friday, December retail sales will be announced. In November, they rose by an unexpectedly sharp 1.0%. That helped lift the average gain in the first 11 months of 2025 to 0.4%, compared with a 0.1% decline in the January-November 2024 period. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Prices:</strong> The dollar remained stuck in its trough against the Mexican peso last week. It traded in a range of about MXN17.1265 to MXN17.2820. The high was recorded ahead of the weekend. Given the strength of the yen and the resilience of the peso, it appears that the long peso/short yen carry trades were already adjusted. President Trump reportedly indicated he is considering ending the USMCA, which he negotiated in his first term and had said it was the best trade deal ever. The market hardly reacted as it looked more like a negotiating ploy. Continued consolidative trading, even if choppy, seems to be the most likely near-term scenario. </p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/the-dollar-is-firm-ahead-of-january-cpi?post=557323\">The Dollar Is Firm Ahead Of January CPI</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/consolidation-featured-after-yesterdays-big-fx-moves?post=557018\">Consolidation Featured After Yesterday's Big FX Moves</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/us-jobs-data-due-while-the-confrontation-with-iran-is-approaching-a-climax?post=556700\">US Jobs Data Due While The Confrontation With Iran Is Approaching A Climax </a></p></div>",

Suddenly, it’s become a marauder, and virtually no corner of the equity market looks safe from its impact. Just in the past 10 days, investors have delivered swift routs to companies toiling in industries as disparate as logistics, real estate, software, private credit, insurance and wealth management. In each case, the release of a new artificial intelligence tool, most famously from Anthropic PBC but also from small, lesser-known startups, prompted a rapid reassessment of business prospects… ‘All we have done and seen in the past few weeks is the market torch the perceived AI losers. Obviously the definition of AI losers is changing almost daily to the point where you can’t track it via themes or baskets,’ said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. The one constant is that AI applications have become the market’s bogeyman, capable of erasing billions in value in a matter of hours as investors question the very viability of large swaths of the corporate landscape… ‘The perception is spreading like a wildfire, and it’s spreading horizontally,’ Joseph Shaposhnik, portfolio manager at Rainwater Equity, said. ‘In other words, it was once confined to a particular sector, and now it’s spreading across sectors, the fear of the risk’.”</em><br/><br/>For starters, the “AI scare” is a catalyst exposing underlying market fragility. In a robust market environment, we would not see such a proliferation of individual stock and sector blowups. It’s become a minefield out there. And it’s the type of market vulnerability consistent with incipient financial conditions tightening. With deleveraging rocking crypto and gaining momentum in Big Tech, we’re on watch for waning liquidity and tightened conditions.<br/><br/>Things are anything but straightforward. For the most part, financial conditions remain extraordinarily loose. The iShares Investment-Grade Corporate Bond ETF (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/LQD\">LQD</a>) returned 0.93% this week, increasing y-t-d returns to 1.65%. The iShares High Yield ETF’s (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/HYG\">HYG</a>) marginal weekly gain (0.05%) boosted 2026 returns to 0.77%. At 79 bps, investment-grade (IG) spreads (to Treasuries) widened four bps this week. Yet IG spreads are only nine bps off multi-decade lows – and compare to the five-year average of 104 bps. Up a more noteworthy 30 bps from January’s multi-decade low, to 280 bps, high yield spreads have started to move (two-month highs), signaling nascent risk aversion (5-yr avg. 346bps).<br/><br/>To be sure, global liquidity abundance persists. South Korea’s KOSPI equities index surged another 8.2% this week, with major indices up 5.8% in Japan, 5.6% in Thailand, 4.9% in Turkey, 4.1% in Taiwan, 3.9% in Vietnam, 3.5% in Indonesia, 2.4% in Australia, and 1.9% in Brazil and Canada. The South Korean KOSPI’s 30.7% y-t-d gain has inflated y-o-y gains to 113%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Index has jumped another 13.1%, boosting one-year gains to 45.4%.<br/><br/>Particularly for U.S. stocks, mounting fragility coupled with general market liquidity excess stokes volatility and escalating instability. This dynamic has manifested into extraordinary stock and sector performance dispersion, foreshadowing more systemic de-risking/deleveraging. Such chaotic and unpredictable performance dispersion wreaks havoc on many levered hedge fund and derivatives strategies. So-called “pairs trades” turn precarious. Moreover, with the breakdown of traditional correlations, hedging stock market risks has turned problematic. While many stocks and some sectors have been clobbered, the S&amp;P500 index has declined only 1.4% y-t-d.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, sections of the U.S. equities market (most stocks) have performed well, offering ongoing enticing opportunities despite the “AI scare.” The (this week) highflying Utility stocks surged 6.7% this week, boosting y-t-d gains to 8.6%. Down this week (2.8%), the Transports still enjoy an 11.4% y-t-d gain. The broader market has been strong. The Midcaps are up 7.8% y-t-d (about six weeks), while the small cap Russell 2000 has gained 6.6%. The “average stock” Value Line Index is 5.8% higher.<br/><br/>Providing a notably poor hedge, the Goldman Sachs Most Short Index has gained 6.8% so far in 2026. The Mag7 Index was hit 3.2% this week (Apple down 8.0%, Amazon 4.5%, Alphabet 5.3%, Meta 3.3%), boosting 2026 losses to 7.2%. The Crowded (previously free money) trade, long Big Tech versus short the broader market, is blowing up. Loose conditions have combined with squeeze dynamics to create ongoing speculative opportunities. Clock ticking.<br/><br/><em>“AI Borrowing Boom Shakes Bond Market.” “AI Spending Surge to Pressure High-Grade Credit.” “The AI Debt Binge is Transforming Big Tech: Everything Risk.” “AI Debt Deluge: Tip of the Iceberg as Big-Tech Borrowing Swells.” “AI Bond Blitz Spurs Biggest Tech Spread Penalty Since the GFC.” “Investors Sour on Listed Credit Funds Over AI Hit to Software Sector.” “AI Fears Weight on Call Center Operator’s $600 Million Bond Sale.” “UBS Says Credit Markets to Price in More Pain From AI Disruption.” ‘AI-Driven Debt Binge Threatens to Disrupt Passive Credit Funds.” “AI Scare Trade Goes Cross-Asset.” “How Private Equity’s Big Bet on Software Was Derailed by AI.”</em><br/><br/>Stock performance from the big “private Credit” players continues to warn of an approaching Credit storm. Apollo sank 6.0% this week (down 13.6% y-t-d), with Ares Management 1.8% lower (down 17.2%), and KKR declining 1.4% (20.2%). Up marginally this week, Blue Owl and Blackstone are still down 17.7% and 14.8% y-t-d.<br/><br/>Seemingly signaling an uptick in crisis dynamics, bank and financial stocks came under heavy selling pressure this week. The KBW Bank Index was slammed 5.5%, the largest decline since “liberation day” week April 4th. The Broker/Dealers slumped 3.7%, also the biggest drop since April.<br/><br/>Notable losses this week included Ameriprise Financial 12.8%, Charles Schwab 10.8%, Citigroup 9.6%, Robinhood 8.3%, Raymond James 7.8%, Wells Fargo 7.4%, Bank of America 7.0%, Truist Financial 7.0%, Capital One 6.9%, and JPMorgan 6.2%. Real estate kingpin CBRE Group sank 16.3%. It’s worth noting that European Banks stocks (STOXX index) sank 5.5% - the “worst week since April amid AI worries.”<br/><br/>Leveraged Loan prices remained under pressure, ending the week down another 0.03 to 95.37. This boosted one-month losses to 1.29 – the steepest decline since “liberation day” April 2025.<br/><br/>Treasury bonds caught fire this week. Ten-year yields sank 16 bps to 4.05%, the low back to December 1st. This was the largest weekly yield decline since early September (dovish Waller comments). Data were generally supportive. A weak December Retail Sales report (flat m-o-m) followed by favorable January CPI data were bond friendly. Stronger-than-expected January payrolls data - 130k jobs added, 4.3% Unemployment Rate, 0.4% gain in Average Hourly Earnings – were disregarded.<br/><br/>I view this week’s bond market (safe haven bid) action as corroborating mounting systemic deleveraging risks. The rates market priced a 3.00% year-end policy rate Friday, eight bps lower on the week and down 20 bps over 16 sessions – to the low since November 28th.<br/><br/>De-risking/deleveraging was ongoing throughout the cryptocurrency universe. Bitcoin dropped 2.5% Tuesday, declined 1.2% Wednesday, sank 2.9% Thursday, and then rallied 5.0% (trading from 65,000 to 69,000) Friday. “Bitcoin Traders Warn the $60,000 Mark is a Liquidation Trigger.”<br/><br/><em>February 9 – Decrypt (Vismaya V): “Crypto’s Super Bowl presence has shrunk from a multi-company marketing blitz to a single exchange’s sing-along, with Coinbase returning to the big game alone this year, as Seattle… defeated New England… to win Super Bowl LX. Four years after Coinbase brought its viral bouncing QR-code commercial to the ‘Crypto Bowl,’ the exchange aired the only major crypto ad during this year’s Super Bowl broadcast—unlike Super Bowl LVI, which featured celebrity campaigns from multiple firms, including the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX.”</em><br/><br/><em>February 9 – New York Times (Andrew Ross Sorkin, Bernhard Warner, Sarah Kessler, Michael J. de la Merced, Niko Gallogly, Brian O’Keefe, Ian Mount, Grady McGregor and Lauren Hirsch): “Big Tech’s artificial intelligence spending spree has roiled the market lately. The wallet was open for Sunday night’s Super Bowl LX broadcast, too, with a flood of A.I.-related ads that may prove more memorable than the game. The A.I. Bowl, as some are calling it, appeared to overshadow the… Seahawks’ victory. Yes, there were some creative gems among the commercials. But the torrent of spending is reminding some of previous years when tech companies tried to capitalize on the Super Bowl limelight. Those efforts didn’t end well for the advertisers. The numbers: Almost a quarter of this year’s Super Bowl ads — 15 of the 66 spots, which sold for an average of $8 million for 30-second slots — featured A.I…”</em><br/><br/>Whether it was Super Bowl ads, equities trading or corporate Credit performance, AI dominates. Headline of the week: “Former Karaoke Company Drags Logistics Into the ‘AI Scare Trade’.” AI might be the Bogeyman, but newfound negative market impacts are only a symptom.<br/><br/>The mind is a peculiar thing. My thoughts this week kept returning to early 1991. The Dow traded below 2,500 in mid-January. GDP printed negative 3.6% during Q4 1990. The economy was in recession, markets were in the tank, the banking system was severely impaired, and our nation was heading to war. Prospects couldn’t have appeared much bleaker.<br/><br/>The S&amp;P500 surged 3.7% on January 17, 1991, as it became clear that Saddam Hussein’s army had no answer to initial Operation Desert Storm strikes. What unfolded was a short squeeze for the ages. From January lows, the S&amp;P rallied 35% into year-end.<br/><br/>The squeeze triggered the start of a transformative surge in marketplace liquidity. The Greenspan Fed had commenced aggressive rate cuts. Starting with 25 bps (from 8.25%) on July 13, 1990 – rates were down to 4.00% to end 1991, while on their way to a then unprecedented 3.00% by September 4, 1992.<br/><br/>Alan Greenspan orchestrated a steep yield curve to drive banking system recapitalization, a godsend for the fledgling leveraged speculating community. When bond Bubble deleveraging erupted in 1994, the GSEs operated as quasi-central banks to stabilize marketplace liquidity and the hedge fund industry – a role they would replay during the 1998 liquidity crisis (LTCM) and again in 1999 and 2000. The bursting of the nineties “tech” Bubble saw the Fed slash rates 475 bps in 2001 to 1.75%, unleashing mortgage finance Bubble leveraged speculation.<br/><br/>The Fed responded to the spectacular 2008 bursting Bubble with an unprecedented $1 TN of QE liquidity injections. Our central bank doubled down on QE, doubling its balance sheet to almost $4.5 TN between 2011 and 2014. The 2020 pandemic deleveraging crisis provoked liquidity injections to the tune of $5 TN, reckless monetary inflation that unleashed history’s greatest Everything Bubble of Levered Speculation. The March 2023 bank mini crisis triggered a swift (Fed/GSE) $500 billion liquidity injection. More recent repo market instability elicited the restart of QE.<br/><br/>Back in early 1991, the financial system was deeply impaired, and illiquid markets were in the toilet. Prospects looked dreadful. And for 35 years, government and central bank officials have done everything imaginable (and more) to ensure liquid markets. It’s to the point where virtually the entire market structure is built on the assumption of liquid and continuous markets. Astounding speculative leverage has accumulated over decades, ever more certain of liquid and continuous markets. Hundreds of Trillions of derivatives have enveloped global finance, premised on liquid and continuous markets. Trading strategies have proliferated, and ETF structures have ballooned to the many Trillions on the assumption of liquid and continuous markets.<br/><br/>It's been a Credit, asset inflation, and leveraged speculation super cycle Bubble for the ages. And, importantly, it all regressed to self-destructive “terminal phase excess” throughout the global government finance Bubble finale. More specifically, the recent years’ government debt, “repo,” “basis trade,” money market fund, “private Credit,” and AI mania/arms race blow-off excesses went completely off the rails. Boy do things go crazy at the end of super cycles.<br/><br/>I thought of 1991 this week, as I monitored the makings for a super cycle deleveraging that would conclude three decades of ever-growing confidence in the capacity of governments to ensure marketplace liquidity abundance. Market history is strewn with booms turned bust, where liquidity excess spurred speculative Bubbles that ended in illiquidity and panic. No one thirty-five years ago contemplated the monumental transformation in liquidity dynamics that was to unfold. Today, seemingly everyone is unprepared for liquidity challenges ahead (mildly said).<br/><br/>The yen’s 3% rally was another of the week’s notable developments.<br/><br/><em>February 11 – Bloomberg (Greg Ritchie): “The carry trade in the yen is ‘a ticking time bomb,’ with the popular hedge-fund strategy vulnerable to a massive unwind, according to BCA Research... The trade — broadly defined as borrowing in the low-yielding Japanese currency to fund purchases of higher-yielding assets — benefits from the greater ‘carry’ on these foreign investments. But the trade unravels if the riskier assets tumble or the yen rallies. The BCA team led by Arthur Budaghyan sees the risk of a similar collapse in the trade to those seen in 2008, 2015 and 2020… ‘Our hunch is that the next unwinding case will also be triggered by a combination of a drop in ‘carry assets’ and/or a rebound in the yen,’ the team wrote… ‘It is impossible to know which will occur first. But they will reinforce each other, resulting in a major reversal of the yen carry trade’.”</em><br/><br/><em>February 12 – Bloomberg (Tasos Vossos): “The largest wave of corporate bond supply in history is set to be met by a rapidly-growing pool of passive buyers. Some investors are warning that disruption will follow. As Big Tech firms rush to raise unprecedented amounts of money to build out artificial intelligence, a growing share of those deals will be bought by passive funds. These strategies — which follow an index or buy a basket of bonds and wait until maturity — have ballooned in recent years, raising concerns that their indiscriminate style of bond buying has distorted metrics of risk and left investors vulnerable.”</em></p><p>For the Week:<br/><br/>The S&amp;P500 declined 1.4% (down 0.1% y-t-d), and the Dow fell 1.2% (up 3.0%).

Any shift away from US sovereign debt reinforces a broader global trend of diversification away from the dollar. Such a move might accelerate the repatriation of capital into Chinese assets, providing a fundamental tailwind for the yuan… The latest move is adding momentum for the yuan, which is already the third-best-performing currency in Asia since the end of September with a gain of around 3%.”<br/><br/>For the week, the U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.7% to 96.915 (down 1.4% y-t-d).

The surge marks a sharp step-up from a year ago. Equity turnover averaged a record $1.03 trillion in January, a roughly 50% increase from the same period in 2025… More than 19 billion shares traded hands daily over the span, the second-most ever... The jump reflects a broad-based increase in participation across the market. Mom-and-pop investors and institutional players alike have become more active as US stocks hover near record highs… ‘There’s more trading from retail, pod shops and hedge funds, and market makers, while automated trading is more prevalent than ever,’ said Bloomberg Intelligence… analyst Jackson Gutenplan.”<br/><br/>February 12 – Financial Times (Richard Waters): “Wall Street is getting extremely jumpy about the threat of AI disruption to a widening range of industries. That is the best explanation for the hammering that brokerage and wealth management stocks took this week, thanks to a little-known US fintech company called Altruist. The idea that an upstart armed with better technology can threaten giants of the finance industry has fuelled various waves of fintech mania over the years. Generative AI has just given a new twist to this — as it has in other industries. As with previous waves of tech disruption, the most exposed are those whose basic product is information — finance, legal services, media and software.”<br/><br/>February 7 – Bloomberg (Emily Graffeo and Caleb Mutua): “The biggest tech companies are gearing up to spend even more on artificial intelligence than investors had anticipated, and money managers increasingly fear that whatever happens, credit markets will get hit… A chunk of those investments will come from the high-grade corporate bond market… But the more tech companies borrow, the greater the potential pressure on bond valuations. The securities are already expensive by historical standards, trading at close to their tightest spreads since the late 1990s. ‘The AI spending bonanza is finding buyers today but leaves little upside and even less room for error,” said Alexander Morris, chief executive officer and co-founder of F/m Investments. ‘There is no asset class that can’t and won’t spoil’.”<br/><br/>February 10 – Financial Times (Peter Wells): “Shares in Charles Schwab, Morgan Stanley and Raymond James sank on Tuesday, in the latest bout of selling triggered by investor concerns about the disruption AI start-ups will have on established companies. The sell-off of several US financial services companies began in late-morning trading after fintech Altruist announced the launch of a tax-planning tool within its AI platform, Hazel… Schwab and Raymond James had their share price gains for 2026 wiped out, with the stocks closing 7.4% and 8.7% lower, respectively. Rival Stifel Financial was down 3.8% and ETrade parent Morgan Stanley shed 2.4%.”<br/><br/>February 10 – Bloomberg (Paul J. Davies): “Artificial intelligence doesn’t only threaten to put herds of software businesses out to pasture. Anthropic PBC’s schooling of its Claude models in financial modelling has also sent a cold shiver down the spines of bankers and analysts. While I mostly suspect that the banking industry’s talent for self-preservation will defend it from technological change, I do wonder if the extreme version of our fully automated AI future could make financial services as irrelevant as everything else. Finance has a very long history of always finding new ways to get paid even as the world of money keeps changing. In only the past few decades, collecting peoples’ savings, buying and selling securities and sending money to the other side of the world have all become faster and cheaper. The internet and smartphones have taken out the frictions and delays that were long a source of revenue for intermediaries.”<br/><br/>February 9 – Bloomberg (Stephanie Hughes): “US insurance broker stocks were pummeled Monday as the launch of an artificial intelligence tool from privately held online insurance shopping platform Insurify sparked fears about the industry facing disruption. The S&amp;P 500 Insurance index closed down 3.9%, in its biggest drop since October.”<br/><br/>February 10 – Bloomberg (Winnie Hsu): “The relentless surge in memory chip prices over the past few months has driven a vast divide between winners and losers in the stock market… Companies from game console maker Nintendo Co. to big PC brands and Apple Inc. suppliers are seeing shares slump on profitability concerns. Memory producers, meanwhile, are soaring to unprecedented heights. Money managers and analysts are now assessing which firms can best navigate the squeeze by locking in supplies, raising product prices or redesigning to use less memory.”<br/><br/>February 12 – Bloomberg (Arvelisse Bonilla Ramos): “Commercial real estate stocks nosedived Thursday as traders worried about risk to demand for office space from higher use of artificial intelligence tools, broadening a selloff that began Wednesday... Shares of CBRE Group… fell 8.8%, bringing the two-day decline to 20% in the worst such move since 2020. Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. fell 7.6% Thursday, Cushman &amp; Wakefield Ltd. dropped 12% and Newmark Group Inc. slid 4.2%.”<br/><br/>February 12 – Bloomberg (Alice Atkins): “Markets are complacent on the outlook for US inflation, making trades that pay out if price pressures climb look attractive, according to… Citigroup... Investors may be underestimating the resilience of the US consumer and market expectations for inflation are likely to be revised slightly higher, said Benjamin Wiltshire, a rates trading desk strategist at the US bank. ‘Markets seem to have this conviction that inflation is going to come down,’ Wiltshire said... ‘We’re still in a structurally higher inflation environment’.”<br/><br/>U.S. and Global Credit Excess Watch:<br/><br/>February 11 – Reuters (Jamie McGeever): “The global economy is at an odd juncture, one that points to an ugly few years for bond markets. The fiscal picture across developed economies is deteriorating rapidly and uniformly, yet unlike previous bouts of huge government spending in the last two decades, there is no global financial crisis or pandemic requiring trillions of dollars. Far from it. Growth appears solid, an unprecedented private sector capex boom is underway courtesy of the artificial intelligence arms race, and stock markets are at record highs. All these dynamics are clearly feeding off each other. Governments are loosening their purse strings because they are adjusting to a new world reality: globalization is fraying – or, some might say, dying - and being replaced by polarization, isolationism, and rising geopolitical tensions. Promises to ramp up spending on defense, energy and resource security, and technological advancements – alongside pledges to help voters with affordability issues – threaten to put enormous strain on public finances that have never fully recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic.”<br/><br/>February 12 – Wall Street Journal (Heather Gillers and Sam Goldfarb): “A new AI borrowing frenzy and lingering fears about potential defaults haven’t deterred investors hungry for bonds from U.S. companies, states and cities. The extra yield—or spread—that investors demand to hold highly rated corporate bonds instead of ultrasafe U.S. Treasurys hit a 27-year low in late January. Spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds dropped to an 18-year low. In the $4 trillion municipal bond market, the spread between interest rates on triple-A and triple-B bonds is at one of its lowest points in two years. Those tight spreads are the latest sign of how bonds remain stubbornly resistant to concerns rattling other markets.”<br/><br/>February 12 – Financial Times (Ian Smith and Michelle Chan): “A rally in corporate bonds has pushed the reward for taking extra credit risk to historic lows, prompting warnings from some investors of ‘bubble-like behaviour’ in parts of the market. Corporate bonds have been swept up in a huge rally for risky assets since early last year… The average additional borrowing cost — or spread — that highly rated US and European companies pay compared with government debt has fallen to its lowest since before the 2008 global financial crisis, while the extra yield offered by more risky debt has also shrunk markedly… ‘Credit markets have increasingly exhibited bubble‑like behaviour since late last summer,’ said Nuwan Goonetilleke, head of capital markets at FTSE 100 insurer Phoenix Group…”<br/><br/>February 9 – Bloomberg (Laura Benitez): “Apollo Global Management Inc. set a record in its business of making loans, a crucial plank in the firm’s ambition to become one of the largest underwriters on Wall Street.

In its annual financial report…, the Google parent highlighted the potential impact of AI on the company’s core advertising business and the possibility of ending up with ‘excess capacity’ from its costly commitments. ‘To meet the compute capacity demands of AI training and inference, as well as traditional cloud computing services, we are entering into significant leasing arrangements with third party operators, which may increase costs and operational complexity,’ the company stated… Large commercial agreements could also increase ‘liabilities and obligations in the event of nonperformance by us, our counterparties, or vendors’…”<br/><br/>February 9 – Bloomberg (Rachel Graf and Scott Carpenter): “In the $1.3 trillion market for collateralized loan obligations — where money managers sell bonds to finance buying pools of buyout loans — ugly math used to kill a deal. Less so now. Money managers are increasingly raising special funds known as captive equity: pools of capital they control that buy any and all CLO equity a firm might sell. By becoming their own guaranteed buyer of the deal’s riskiest portion, managers can quickly launch CLOs without needing to prove immediate profitability to the broader market — a hurdle that could have swiftly torpedoed an offering… This shift has allowed CLO issuance to hit record levels…”<br/><br/>February 10 – Wall Street Journal (Jack Pitcher and Juliet Chung): “BlackRock went all in on Wall Street’s booming business of private lending last July when it acquired HPS Investment Partners, a firm founded by alumni of Goldman Sachs… Days after the deal closed, an analyst at HPS’s… headquarters spotted a big problem. The company was the lead lender on a more-than $400 million credit agreement with a telecom entrepreneur, Bankim Brahmbhatt, accepting as collateral accounts receivable the executive’s firm had acquired from other businesses. Reviewing those invoices, the analyst noticed that the email address domain on one didn’t match what was on the website of the company it was supposed to be from. HPS dug deeper, and found the same issue again and again. The lender scrambled to get answers from Brahmbhatt, but he had left for India and eventually stopped picking up the phone. Two weeks later, HPS was in court accusing Brahmbhatt of carrying out a ‘breathtaking’ fraud. The emails were fake, the invoices were fake—and the collateral was worthless, they alleged.”<br/><br/>U.S. Credit Trouble Watch:<br/><br/>February 9 – Financial Times (Michelle Chan): “Investors are souring on listed private credit funds that lend to software companies as concerns grow over AI’s potential to disrupt their business models and eat into their profits. Worries over some software companies’ ability to service their debt have intensified this month after start-up Anthropic launched a new AI model that can automate a variety of professional tasks such as sales, finance and legal work… Bonds and shares of business development companies (BDCs), which make loans to middle-market groups, have also fallen sharply, despite a rebound on Friday and Monday, highlighting the large exposure that the private credit industry has built to the sector in recent years. ‘The software sector is facing an existential crisis right now,’ said Christian Hoffmann, head of fixed income at Thornburg Investment Management. ‘The recent product rollouts have really accelerated those fears. Both private credit and software are facing significant pullbacks,’ he added.”<br/><br/>February 11 – Bloomberg (Shannon D. Harrington): “Private credit funds are seeing another sign of growing stress: the share of private equity-backed companies deferring cash interest payments increased for a third consecutive quarter. So-called ‘bad PIK,’ where borrowers opted to delay interest during the life of the loan rather than when it was originated, now represent 6.4% of private loans, up from 2.5% in late 2021, according to… Lincoln International.”<br/><br/>February 10 – Bloomberg (Laura Benitez): “Ares Management Corp. Chief Executive Officer Michael Arougheti downplayed the idea of trouble in the private credit market and fears of AI disruption, two factors that hammered shares of alternative asset managers recently. Arougheti said the firm’s institutional investors are not anxious about private credit risks and that 97% of its wealth clients have not asked to redeem from such products. ‘It’s frankly a frustrating narrative to folks like us that have been doing it a long time,’ Arougheti said…”<br/><br/>February 10 – Reuters (Michael S.

A look at the data on China’s Treasury holdings suggests why traders were so quick to move on from the report that Beijing had urged Chinese banks to limit their Treasury purchases. Once the largest foreign lender to the US government, China has quietly halved its holdings of Treasuries since 2013... The danger now is whether President Donald Trump’s unpredictable policies alienate US allies further, and encourage traditional lenders like Europe and Japan to follow in China’s footsteps.”<br/><br/>Trump Administration Watch:<br/><br/>February 7 – Wall Street Journal (Angus Berwick and Eliot Brown): “In the depths of Donald Trump’s interregnum, his eldest two sons huddled in a Mar-a-Lago conference room with boyhood pal Zach Witkoff to conjure up a new money machine. Two other would-be cryptocurrency entrepreneurs showed up… That pre-election confab sowed the seeds for World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture that, with the senior Trump back in power, is generating cash far faster than the president’s decades-old real-estate business. While his father Steve Witkoff acts as President Trump’s all-purpose special envoy, 32-year-old Zach Witkoff now heads up World Liberty, which has doled out at least $1.4 billion to both families since the president’s re-election… Among the payouts: a secret $500 million deal to sell almost half the company to an Abu Dhabi royal and his co-investors. Witkoff is part of a small cadre of Trump administration offspring who, since their fathers moved to Washington, have metamorphosed into wealthy financial celebrities in their own right. Key to their transformation has been the crypto sector…”<br/><br/>February 9 – Financial Times (Aime Williams): “Donald Trump’s administration intends to spare companies including Amazon, Google and Microsoft from forthcoming tariffs on chips as they race to build the data centres powering the AI boom. The commerce department is planning to provide US hyperscalers with tariff carve-outs, which would be tied to investment commitments made by Taiwan-based chip group Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), people familiar with the matter said.”<br/><br/>February 11 – Bloomberg (Josh Wingrove): “President Donald Trump is privately musing about exiting the North American trade pact, people familiar… said, injecting further uncertainty about the deal’s future into pivotal renegotiations involving the US, Canada and Mexico. The president has asked aides why he shouldn’t withdraw from the agreement, which he signed during his first term, though he has stopped short of flatly signaling that he will do so, according to the people who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions.”<br/><br/>February 7 – CNBC (Spencer Kimball): “The Trump administration’s portfolio of equity stakes in U.S. companies has reached a scale that is unprecedented outside economic crisis or wartime. The administration has taken stakes or has agreements to do so with at least 10 companies, most of which are publicly traded. The government announced its latest investment, USA Rare Earth, at the end of January… ‘It is a invisible barrier to startups and new market entrants,’ said Scott Lincicome, an international trade lawyer affiliated with Cato Institute. ‘Why would you ever want to enter a market that you know your chief competitor is backed by the U.S. government?’”<br/><br/>February 10 – Financial Times (Christian Davies): “Donald Trump has threatened to block the opening of a new suspension bridge connecting the US and Canada, escalating tensions between the two neighbours… The US president wrote… that the Gordie Howe International Bridge — which is set to open this year and connects the key auto hubs of Detroit, Michigan and Windsor, Ontario — had been built with ‘virtually no US content’. ‘I will not allow this bridge to open until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them, and also, importantly, Canada treats the United States with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve… We will start negotiations, IMMEDIATELY,’ he added. ‘With all that we have given them, we should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset’.”<br/><br/>February 10 – Associated Press (Joey Cappelletti, Steve Peoples and Steven Sloan): “An annual meeting of the nation’s governors that has long served as a rare bipartisan gathering is unraveling after President Donald Trump excluded Democratic governors from White House events. The National Governors Association said it will no longer hold a formal meeting with Trump when governors are scheduled to convene in Washington later this month, after the White House planned to invite only Republican governors. On Tuesday, 18 Democratic governors also announced they would boycott a traditional dinner at the White House.”<br/><br/>February 9 – Wall Street Journal (Rebecca Picciotto): “The White House is at loggerheads with Congress over one of President Trump’s signature housing proposals, a ban on Wall Street investors buying single-family homes. Trump officials pressured congressional Republicans in recent weeks to include the investor ban as an amendment in either of the major housing bills currently winding through the House and the Senate… But lawmakers in both chambers have resisted adding the investor ban, which traditional free-market advocates, Wall Street executives and the home-builder industry generally oppose.”<br/><br/>February 6 – Bloomberg (Olga Kharif): “The government didn’t pay for it — and it’s not planning to sell. But for the US Treasury, now sitting atop billions of dollars worth of stockpiled Bitcoin tokens, the recent selloff has delivered an uncomfortable lesson in what it means to treat ‘digital gold’ like a reserve asset — and whether the notoriously volatile token deserves the backing of the world’s largest economy. Since President Donald Trump signed an executive order last March to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, the market value of the government’s holdings of the digital currency has cratered.”<br/><br/>February 12 – Bloomberg (Catherine Lucey): “The White House sought to ramp up pressure on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s Jamie Dimon to cap credit card interest rates, a demand of President Donald Trump amid his push to address affordability. ‘James Dimon, lower your friggin’ credit card interest rates. You are a criminal the way you charge the American people at 22, 25 and 30% and the president wants you to lower that,’ White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said… ‘Jamie, until you do that, please refrain from commenting on other public policies’.”<br/><br/>February 9 – Financial Times (Jude Webber, Joe Daniels and Michael Stott): “Cuba has told international airlines that it will not be able to supply them with jet fuel from Tuesday, as US President Donald Trump squeezes the communist island’s oil supplies.

The notice, issued at the weekend, said the measure would last until March 11.”<br/><br/>Budget Watch:<br/><br/>February 11 – Associated Press (Fatima Hussein): “The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s 10-year outlook projects worsening long-term federal deficits and rising debt, driven largely by increased spending, notably on Social Security, Medicare, and debt service payments. Compared with the CBO’s analysis this time last year, the fiscal outlook has deteriorated modestly. Major developments over the last year are factored into the latest report…, including Republicans’ tax and spending measure known as the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act,’ higher tariffs, and the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration…, the projected 2026 deficit is about $100 billion higher, and total deficits from 2026 to 2035 are $1.4 trillion larger, while debt held by the public is projected to rise from 101% of GDP to 120% — exceeding historical highs.”<br/><br/>February 11 – Financial Times (Myles McCormick and Kate Duguid): “Donald Trump’s policies will expand the federal budget deficit by $1.4tn over the coming decade, Congress’s fiscal watchdog has warned… ‘Our budget projections continue to indicate that the fiscal trajectory is not sustainable,’ said CBO director Phillip Swagel… ‘There’s no sugarcoating it: America’s fiscal health is increasingly dire,’ said Jonathan Burks at the Bipartisan Policy Center. “Our debt is now 100% of GDP, and rather than pumping the brakes, we are accelerating’.”<br/><br/>February 11 – Wall Street Journal (Richard Rubin): “The U.S. budget deficit will remain roughly flat for the next two years and then widen over the next decade as interest costs consume an increasing share of spending, the Congressional Budget Office said… in a forecast that highlighted the country’s long-run fiscal challenges. The U.S. is projected to run a deficit of $1.85 trillion, or 5.8% of gross domestic product, in the year that ends Sept. 30, and then stay about level at 5.7% of GDP in fiscal 2027.

Meeting in a Belgian castle, the EU leaders agreed an ‘action plan’ with a strict timeline for the economic restructuring, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. ‘The pressure and the sense of urgency is enormous, and that can move mountains,’ she said. The plan, to be presented formally in March, would include measures to coordinate upgrading energy grids, deepen financial integration and loosen merger regulations to allow European firms to grow to better compete globally, she said. ‘We need European champions,’ von der Leyen said.”<br/><br/>February 7 – Wall Street Journal (David Luhnow, Kim Mackrael and Bertrand Benoit): “In a world increasingly shaped by two unpredictable great powers—the U.S. and China—the world’s middle powers are boosting cooperation in areas from trade to security in a bid to ensure they don’t become roadkill in the new world order.

Another OpenAI employee, Hieu Pham, wrote on X: ‘I finally feel the existential threat that AI is posing.’ Jason Calacanis, tech investor and co-host of the ‘All-In’ podcast, wrote on X: ‘I’ve never seen so many technologists state their concerns so strongly, frequently and with such concern as I have with AI.’ The biggest talk among the AI crowd Wednesday was entrepreneur Matt Shumer’s post comparing this moment to the eve of the pandemic.”<br/><br/>February 11 – Axios (Madison Mills): “Spending by hyperscalers — the data center behemoths in the vanguard of the AI revolution — is expected to total $610 billion at the midrange of company guidance estimates, about triple the spending from just two years ago.

Retail traders have continued to drift away from digital art and memecoins, while token prices have crashed — a casualty of the rug pulls and day-trader blowups that followed last year’s market crash.”<br/><br/>February 10 – Bloomberg (Matt Wirz): “Wall Street’s first public bitcoin-backed bond sale hit a snag after the cryptocurrency’s recent plunge. Bankers at Jefferies have been pitching big investors for months on a $188 million bond sale backed by thousands of loans that crypto lender Ledn made to individuals. Ledn’s customers put up cryptocurrency as collateral for one-year loans… But Ledn recently had to liquidate about one-quarter of the loans meant to back the deal… The forced sales happened after the price of bitcoin plunged by 27% since mid-January, triggering margin calls on the loans.”<br/><br/>Inflation Watch:<br/><br/>February 9 – ABC News (Elizabeth Schulze): “President Donald Trump’s tariffs cost the average American household $1,000 last year, according to… the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. The cost is set to go even higher this year to $1,300 per household, assuming the existing tariffs stay in place, the research said. The research called Trump’s tariffs ‘the largest U.S. tax increase as a percent of GDP since 1993’.”<br/><br/>February 12 – New York Times (Ana Swanson and Sydney Ember): “President Trump has frequently claimed that foreign countries were paying for his tariffs, not Americans. But as economists predicted, that is largely turning out not to be the case. Research… by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Columbia University suggests that, through November 2025, 90% of the economic burden of the president’s tariffs fell on U.S. companies and consumers… In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 30 defending his tariffs, Mr. Trump wrote, ‘the data shows that the burden, or ‘incidence,’ of the tariffs has fallen overwhelmingly on foreign producers and middlemen, including large corporations that are not from the U.S’.”<br/><br/>February 9 – Bloomberg (Naureen S. Malik): “Electricity costs on the largest US grid more than doubled in January as a deep freeze drove up heating demand and operators shored up supplies to keep the lights on. Total wholesale power costs on the grid operated by PJM Interconnection LLC, which serves about a fifth of Americans, jumped to $15.38 billion in the first month of the year, up from $7.34 billion in January 2025, according to… Monitoring Analytics LLC.”<br/><br/>February 12 – CNBC (Spencer Kimball): “Families won’t see relief from rising electricity prices anytime soon, as demand from artificial intelligence data centers soars while power supply grows slowly, according to Goldman Sachs. Electricity prices jumped 6.9% in 2025 year over year, more than double the headline inflation rate of 2.9%, Goldman analysts told clients… Prices will continue to rise through the end of the decade, as data centers make up 40% of electricity demand growth, the analysts said.”<br/><br/>February 11 – Reuters (Che Pan and Brenda Goh): “China’s Lenovo Group warned… about mounting pressure on PC shipments as a ‌worsening memory-chip shortage grips the industry. Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing told ‌Reuters after the company released third-quarter results that the world's largest PC maker has raised prices to offset surging memory costs…”<br/><br/>February 10 – Axios (Los Angeles Times): “Los Angeles, Long Beach and San Diego are among the world’s least affordable cities for homebuyers… When the price of a regular home is compared to regular local salaries, Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Diego and San José were among the five least affordable cities in the world, according to a survey from… Remitly… Relative to local pay scales, the cities are more expensive for homebuyers than New York, Paris and Singapore… In Los Angeles, a single buyer earning the local average salary could afford a home worth only 28% of the average property in the region… Residents of San José can afford to buy a home worth only about a quarter of the average.”<br/><br/>February 9 – Bloomberg (Philip Aldrick): “President Donald Trump’s trade wars are contributing to UK inflation as China raises prices on exports to Britain to recover the cost of US tariffs, Bank of England policymaker Catherine Mann said… Mann dismissed arguments that the UK will benefit from disinflation as China diverts trade from the US… One of the reasons why US inflation has not risen sharply despite a near $300 billion increase in import duties ‘is because import prices going into the US have been falling,’ Mann, an external member of the BOE’s Monetary Policy Committee, said... ‘In contrast, everybody else is paying more. That is true for the UK as well’.”<br/><br/>February 9 – Bloomberg (Erin Hudson and Amanda L. Gordon): “The top private schools in New York City plan to charge more than $70,000 this year for tuition, an amount exceeding that of many elite colleges, as they pass on the costs of soaring expenses including teacher salaries. Spence School, Dalton School and Nightingale-Bamford School on Manhattan’s Upper East Side are among at least seven schools where the fees now exceed that threshold… Fees among 15 private schools across the city rose a median of 4.7%, outpacing inflation.”<br/><br/>Federal Reserve Watch:<br/><br/>February 12 – CNBC (Kevin Breuninger): “Sen. Thom Tillis… rejected a proposal aimed at ending the Department of Justice’s controversial criminal probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and clearing a path for his successor, Kevin Warsh, to be confirmed. The proposed off-ramp…, would see the Powell investigation handed off from the DOJ to the Senate Banking Committee. The idea is an attempt to thread a political needle: It would drop the threat of criminal prosecution against Powell… while still satisfying President Donald Trump, who supports the DOJ probe. But Tillis poured cold water on that proposal... ‘I’m not going to have an investigation out there,’ Tillis told reporters... ‘We have to have an independent Fed. And we can’t finesse this’.”<br/><br/>February 9 – Bloomberg (Alex Harris): “Federal Reserve Chair nominee Kevin Warsh is likely to take a gradual approach to shrinking the central bank’s $6.6 trillion portfolio to avoid rekindling money market tensions, according to… Citigroup... Any attempt by the central bank to resume unwinding its balance sheet… could revive pressures in the $12.6 trillion repurchase market… The Fed abandoned the process in December after rates in the repo market… surged. ‘The bar for restarting QT is quite high given the large volatility that repo markets experienced last year,’ strategists Alejandra Vazquez Plata and Jason Williams wrote. ‘Presumably, the FOMC would prefer to avoid a repeat of October 2025 and instead opt to take a gradual approach to balance sheet management’.”<br/><br/>February 10 – Bloomberg (Alexandra Harris): “The Federal Reserve’s transition to a smaller balance sheet will require significant coordination between the central bank and Treasury Department to prevent excess market volatility, according to Barclays... The process will result in tighter financial conditions, which Chair nominee Kevin Warsh — who has called for dramatically paring back the $6.6 trillion portfolio — may have to offset with a lower policy interest rate, they wrote. ‘Balance sheet normalization will be a multiyear process,’ Barclays strategists Anshul Pradhan, Samuel Earl and Demi Hu wrote. ‘Given Warsh’s desire to shrink the balance sheet, and the fact that the Fed and Treasury’s goals need not always be in sync, investors are likely to demand a risk premium during the transition process’.”<br/><br/>February 10 – Bloomberg (Jonnelle Marte): “Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Beth Hammack said interest rates could be on an extended hold while officials evaluate incoming economic data. ‘Rather than trying to fine tune the funds rate, I’d prefer to err on the side of patience as we assess the impact of recent rate reductions and monitor how the economy performs,’ Hammack said…\"<br/><br/>February 10 – Bloomberg (Catarina Saraiva and Alex Harris): “Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Lorie Logan said she’s hopeful inflation will continue to come down, though it would take ‘material’ weakness in the labor market for her to support more interest-rate cuts. ‘We will learn in coming months whether inflation is coming down to our target and whether the labor market will remain stable… If so, this would tell me that our current policy stance is appropriate and no further rate cuts are needed to achieve our dual mandate goals,’ she said. ‘If instead we see inflation coming down but with further material cooling in the labor market, cutting rates again could become appropriate’.”<br/><br/>February 11 – Wall Street Journal (Matt Grossman): “Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid reaffirmed his resistance to further interest-rate cuts, arguing that further Fed easing would risk allowing inflation to remain too high… Schmid said that the economy is entering 2026 on strong footing, and cited persistent inflation as a signal that demand may be outpacing supply… ‘In my view, further rate cuts risk allowing high inflation to persist even longer,’ Schmid said… ‘We must remain focused on our headline inflation objective, otherwise I believe there is a real risk that inflation will get stuck closer to 3% than 2% in the long run,’ he added… ‘It is the actions of monetary policy that determine whether a price shock is transitory or not,’ he said.”<br/><br/>February 11 – Bloomberg (Catarina Saraiva): “Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas Cit President Jeff Schmid said the US central bank should hold rates at a ‘somewhat restrictive’ level, as he expressed continued concerns over inflation that remains too high. ‘In my view, further rate cuts risk allowing high inflation to persist even longer,’ Schmid said… He added that interest rates should still be putting some pressure on the economy, but that may not be the case. ‘With growth showing momentum and inflation still hot, I’m not seeing many indications of economic restraint,’ Schmid said.”<br/>February 9 – Bloomberg (Enda Curran): “Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran said the central bank’s balance sheet needs to be smaller, but that shouldn’t preclude policymakers from opting for large-scale asset purchases during an economic crisis… ‘Expanding our balance sheet when you’re at the zero-lower bound, at the middle of a financial crisis, is the right move,’ Miran said... ‘But you should keep your powder dry for when you need to make a move like that’.”<br/><br/>U.S. Economic Bubble Watch:<br/><br/>February 9 – Bloomberg (Josh Wingrove): “President Donald Trump said his pick to lead the Federal Reserve can stoke the economy to grow at a rate of 15%... Trump… said Warsh was the ‘runner up’ in his last search and that it was a big mistake to pick Fed chair Jerome Powell. If Warsh ‘does the job that he’s capable’ of, then ‘we can grow at 15%, I think more than that,’ Trump told host Larry Kudlow… ‘I think he is going to be great, and he’s a really high quality person’.”<br/><br/>February 11 – New York Times (Kailyn Rhone): “The U.S. economy is growing, but not evenly. What began as an uneven rebound from the Covid-19 pandemic has hardened into what many economists describe as a ‘K-shaped’ economy, in which higher-income households pull ahead while lower-income households fall further behind... ‘We are returning to a typical pattern of extremely high income inequality, and it now stands at a 60-year peak,’ Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank, wrote… ‘The worry is not just where we stand now, but also whether ongoing developments will worsen the situation.’ The net worth of the top 1% of households climbed to a record share of nearly 32% of the national total in the third quarter of 2025… Spending patterns have also split: Households earning under $75,000 a year are spending less on discretionary categories like travel and experiences than they did in 2019, while those making more than $150,000 are spending more, according to Bank of America Institute.”<br/><br/>February 11 – Associated Press (Paul Wiseman): “U.S. employers added a surprisingly strong 130,000 jobs last month, but government revisions cut 2024-2025 U.S. payrolls by hundreds of thousands. The unemployment rate fell to 4.3%... The report included major revisions that reduced the number of jobs created last year to just 181,000, a third the previously reported 584,000 and the weakest since the pandemic year of 2020. The job market has been sluggish for months… But the January numbers were much stronger than the 75,000… expected. Healthcare accounted for nearly 82,000, or more than 60%, of last month’s new jobs. Factories added 5,000, snapping a streak of 13 straight months of job losses. The federal government shed 34,000 jobs. Average hourly wages rose a solid 0.4% from December to January.”<br/><br/>February 12 – Associated Press (Matt Ott): “The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week, remaining within the historically healthy range of the past few years. Applications for jobless aid for the week ending Feb. 7 fell by 5,000 to 227,000 from the previous week… The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Jan. 31 increased by 21,000 to 1.86 million…”<br/><br/>February 10 – Associated Press (Anne D’Innocenzio): “Shoppers unexpectedly paused their spending in December from November… The report… surprised economists who were looking for growth… And it raised questions about shoppers’ ability to spend after they have remained resilient for months despite souring consumer confidence, economists said. Retail sales were flat in December from November, when business was up 0.6%... Economists were expecting a 0.4% increase for December. The report was delayed because of the 43-day government shutdown. Sales in October fell 0.1%, rose 0.1% in September, but jumped 0.6% in July and August and 1% in June…”<br/><br/>February 10 – Bloomberg (Jarrell Dillard): “Sentiment among US small-business owners edged down in January for the first time in three months… The National Federation of Independent Business optimism index slipped 0.2 point to 99.3… Seven of the 10 components that make up the gauge decreased, while three increased. The net share of owners who expect business conditions to improve fell 3 points to 21% after climbing to a four-month high in December. An easing in hiring plans and a smaller share of companies reporting job openings also weighed on the index. At the same time, a net 16% of owners said they expect… sales to improve in the next three months, up 6 percentage points from December and the largest share in a year. Also, 15% of owners reported that now would be a good time to expand their business, a six-month high.”<br/><br/>February 7 – Bloomberg (Julia Fanzeres): “US consumer borrowing increased in December by the most in a year, reflecting a pickup in both revolving and non-revolving credit. Total credit outstanding rose $24 billion following a $4.7 billion gain in the prior month, Federal Reserve data showed... The reading topped all estimates… Non-revolving credit, such as loans for vehicle purchases and school tuition, increased $10.2 billion in December, the most in seven months. Meantime, credit-card and other revolving debt outstanding jumped $13.8 billion, the biggest monthly gain in over two years.”<br/><br/>February 12 – CNBC (Diana Olick): “High home prices, faltering supply and weaker consumer confidence in the economy all continue to weigh on the U.S. housing market. The chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, Lawrence Yun, is calling it ‘a new housing crisis.’ Sales of previously owned homes in January dropped a much wider-than-expected 8.4% from December to a… annualized rate of 3.91 million... Sales were 4.4% lower than January 2025. That is the slowest pace since December 2023 and the biggest monthly drop since February 2022… Inventory came down in January from December but was still up 3.4% year over year. There were 1.22 million homes for sale at the end of January, which at the current sales pace is a 3.7-month supply. A six-month supply is considered a balanced market…”<br/><br/>February 9 – Axios (Sami Sparber): “U.S. homeowners are staying in their houses for the longest time in at least 25 years… That — along with still-high home prices and tight inventory — is keeping the housing market on ice. Sellers at the end of 2025 had owned their homes for an average of 8.6 years — a record in data going back to early 2000… Homeowner tenure has increased steadily in almost every major metro area over the past two decades, according to ATTOM... The ‘trend is especially pronounced in coastal and Northeast metros, where tenure often exceeds a decade, while many Sun Belt and Midwest markets continue to see comparatively shorter ownership periods,’ CEO Rob Barber tells Axios.”<br/><br/>China Watch:<br/><br/>February 9 – Bloomberg (Nectar Gan, Shawna Kwan and Laura Davison): “A Hong Kong court sentenced former media mogul Jimmy Lai to 20 years in prison, handing the pro-democracy advocate the heaviest penalty ever meted out under a Beijing-imposed national security law. Three judges hand-picked by the government… ordered the 78-year-old to effectively spend the rest of his life behind bars for two counts of conspiring to collude with foreign forces and a separate sedition conviction. ‘Lai was no doubt the mastermind of all three conspiracies charged and therefore he warrants a heavier sentence,’ the judges said...”<br/><br/>February 8 – Bloomberg: “The People’s Bank of China is boosting the supply of money available to banks to ensure they can meet the surge in demand for cash during the Lunar New Year holidays. The central bank injected a total of 600 billion yuan ($86.4bn) via 14-day repurchase agreements late last week… Industrial Securities forecasts the PBOC to add as much as 3.5 trillion yuan of funds via similar tools before the holidays kick off on Sunday.”<br/><br/>February 9 – Bloomberg: “Chinese government bonds’ recent recovery is drawing more traders into derivatives, reflecting stronger demand for safety and hedging as confidence in the debt market grows. The number of open futures contracts tied to China’s 10‑year government bonds rose on Monday to 344,171, the highest since they started trading in 2015… That’s a 46% jump since the beginning of the year, outpacing the 24% rise seen in all of 2025.”<br/><br/>February 10 – CNBC (Anniek Bao): “China’s consumer inflation rose less than expected in January… The consumer price index rose 0.2% in January from a year earlier…, below economists’ forecast of 0.4% increase... That followed a 0.8% growth in December, its highest level in nearly three years. Prices rose 0.2% month-on-month, below economists’ forecast of a 0.3% increase. Core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, jumped 0.8% from a year earlier, easing from the 1.2% in December.”<br/><br/>Central Banker Watch:<br/><br/>February 10 – Wall Street Journal (James Glynn): “Australia’s inflation rate is too high and the costs of allowing it to remain elevated don’t bear thinking about, RBA’s Deputy Gov. Andrew Hauser said… ‘That’s we acted last week to raise the official cash rate by 25 bps, and why I wanted to say we will continue to do to do whatever is necessary to ensure that inflation does return to the target band,’ he told a business luncheon. The rise in the official cash rate last week reversed a cut delivered in August… Both core and headline inflation have moved above the RBA’s 2% to 3% target band… The RBA decided to reverse the direction of monetary policy from easing last year to tightening this month because ‘the facts changed’ on several fronts, with the strength of the world economy a key factor, he said. ‘I don’t think anyone thought that we would be sitting here in 2026 with the global economy powering ahead,’ he said.”<br/><br/>Europe Watch:<br/><br/>February 10 – Financial Times (Euan Healy): “Billionaire Andrea Pignataro’s heavily indebted fintech empire is under increasing pressure in credit markets, as concerns over AI’s impact on software companies hit one of Europe’s largest sellers of junk bonds. The sell-off in bonds issued by Ion Group, a debt-fuelled roll-up of financial data companies including Mergermarket, Fidessa and Dealogic, has accelerated in the past week…”<br/><br/>February 12 – Bloomberg (Zoltan Simon): “Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar said he was secretly taped having sex with his former partner in 2024, preempting a potential release of a video that he called a ‘Russia-style’ attempt to blackmail him before pivotal elections in April.”<br/><br/>EM Watch:<br/><br/>February 12 – Bloomberg (Zijia Song): “Bitcoin’s crash has hit few places as hard as El Salvador, exposing the risks of President Nayib Bukele’s high-stakes embrace of crypto and whipsawing the country’s debt markets. Bukele, an ardent advocate who made the token legal tender alongside the dollar, has kept buying one Bitcoin a day even as the latest rout erased hundreds of millions of dollars from the government’s holdings and complicated talks with the International Monetary Fund over a $1.4 billion loan. The focus is now catching up with him in financial markets, where investors have pushed credit default swaps to the highest level in five months, signaling growing unease over the country’s crypto-heavy strategy.”<br/><br/>February 10 – Bloomberg (Vinicius Andrade and Giovanna Bellotti Azevedo): “It’s just two companies. But their escalating financial strains have sent bondholders racing to the exits and sown fear that more Brazilian businesses will be driven to the brink by the nation’s highest interest rates in two decades. The worries were thrown into sharp relief on Monday, when Raízen SA was hit by back-to-back downgrades that knocked it from investment grade to deep into junk status… The reaction was swift: Investors unloaded the securities, extending a selloff that’s slashed the price of some bonds nearly in half over the past week to around 46 cents on the dollar.”<br/><br/>Leveraged Speculation Watch:<br/><br/>February 8 – Bloomberg (Iris Ouyang): “China’s low-interest rate environment is driving a surge in interbank borrowing, as financial institutions take advantage of cheap funding to buy bonds. The daily volume of overnight repurchase contracts rose to a record 8.2 trillion yuan ($1.2 trillion) on Friday… Financial institutions are increasingly using this tool to fund leveraged bond purchases. Trading has surged after the People’s Bank of China injected liquidity, driving interbank borrowing costs to multi-year lows as it cushions banks against higher demand for cash during the Lunar New Year holidays.”<br/><br/>Social, Political, Environmental, Cybersecurity Instability Watch:<br/><br/>February 11 – Bloomberg (Mark Gongloff): “The Trump administration will soon make it the official policy of the US government that greenhouse gases don’t endanger Americans’ well-being and therefore don’t need federal regulation. Insurance companies, meanwhile, live in a parallel universe where greenhouse gases are heating the atmosphere and intensifying natural disasters, harming human health, destroying property and raising insurance costs. The US government’s universe is an increasingly lonely fantasy world. You’re trapped in the real one. The oxymoronically named Environmental Protection Agency will this week formally renounce its 2009 ‘endangerment finding,’ which gives it regulatory power over emissions from cars, power plants, factories and more. This move, which the climate-change deniers running the White House call a ‘total victory,’ is for now mostly symbolic.”<br/><br/>February 7 – Axios (Nathan Bomey): “Gambling culture is enveloping American sports, politics, media and trading, bringing betting out of the shadows and into the mainstream in a way that disturbs some and exhilarates others. What was once a fringe vice is fast becoming a mass-market habit — raising urgent questions about addiction, fairness and who should regulate the business of betting on almost anything. ‘Wanna bet on that?’ That age-old contemplation has become more realistic than ever with the explosion of online sportsbooks and prediction markets… The American Gaming Association projects that $1.7 billion will be legally wagered on the Super Bowl… News media orgs like CNBC, CNN, Yahoo Finance and Dow Jones have struck partnerships to showcase prediction market data to viewers and readers.”</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/economics--politics/weekly-commentary-deleveraging-watch?post=555745\">Weekly Commentary: Deleveraging Watch</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/economics--politics/weekly-commentary-kevin-warsh-and-regime-change?post=554072\">Weekly Commentary: Kevin Warsh And Regime Change </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/economics--politics/weekly-commentary-issues-2026?post=552358\">Weekly Commentary: Issues 2026</a></p></div>",

Its core value proposition is discovery and intent-driven demand: users search with purchase intent, and businesses pay for visibility and lead generation.</p><p>The model is straightforward but powerful:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Consumer demand aggregation</strong> (reviews, search, discovery)</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance-based advertising</strong> (primarily CPC)</p></li><li><p><strong>Local services monetization</strong> (home services, reservations, waitlists)</p></li></ul><p>Unlike many ad-tech platforms, Yelp’s revenues are tightly tied to local transaction intent rather than broad brand advertising. This creates relatively resilient unit economics and measurable ROI for merchants.</p><p>Key structural advantages include:</p><ul><li> entrenched brand recognition</li><li> high-intent user traffic</li><li> repeat advertiser behavior among SMBs</li><li> limited capital intensity</li></ul><p>Yelp today is not a growth-at-any-price company — it is a <strong>harvesting, optimizing cash generator</strong>.</p><p><br/><strong>What Is IV/P? (Intrinsic Value to Price)</strong></p><p>IV/P measures the relationship between intrinsic value and market price:</p><ul><li><p><strong>IV/P &gt; 1</strong> → price undervalues intrinsic business value</p></li><li><p><strong>IV/P &lt; 1</strong> → price overvalues intrinsic business value</p></li></ul><p>For <strong>YELP, IV/P = 1.30</strong>, implying intrinsic value is estimated to be ~30% above the current market price.</p><p>This is notable given Yelp’s consistency in profitability and free cash flow, particularly for a platform business with minimal balance-sheet risk.</p><h3><br/><strong>Supporting Metrics</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Market Cap:</strong> ≈ US$1.6B</p></li><li><p><strong>Enterprise Value:</strong> ≈ US$1.4–1.5B (net cash position)</p></li><li><p><strong>Free Cash Flow (TTM):</strong> ≈ US$310M</p></li><li><p><strong>FCF Yield on EV:</strong> ~20–22%</p></li><li><p><strong>Acquirer’s Multiple (AM):</strong> <strong>6.5</strong></p></li></ul><p>An <strong>AM of 6.5</strong> places Yelp firmly in deep-value territory. At this level, an acquirer could theoretically recover the full enterprise value in roughly <strong>6–7 years</strong> of operating earnings — before any growth, pricing optimization, or margin expansion.</p><h3><br/><strong>Revenue &amp; Profitability Profile</strong></h3><p><em>(TTM basis)</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Revenue:</strong> ≈ $1.47B</p></li><li><p><strong>Gross Margin:</strong> ≈ 90%</p></li><li><p><strong>Operating Income:</strong> ≈ $190M</p></li><li><p><strong>Operating Margin:</strong> ≈ 13%</p></li><li><p><strong>Net Income:</strong> ≈ $150M</p></li><li><p><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ≈ $2.24</p></li></ul><p>Yelp’s margin structure reflects its platform economics:</p><ul><li><p>high gross margins</p></li><li><p>modest capex requirements</p></li><li><p>scalable operating cost base</p></li></ul><p>While revenue growth is modest, <strong>profitability has steadily improved</strong>, driven by cost discipline, product simplification, and focus on higher-ROI advertiser cohorts.</p><p>This is not a turnaround — it’s an optimization story.</p><h3><br/><strong>Balance Sheet Structure</strong></h3><p>Yelp’s balance sheet is conservative and shareholder-friendly:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ≈ $985–990M</p></li><li><p><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ≈ $260M</p></li><li><p><strong>Shareholder Equity:</strong> ≈ $730–745M</p></li><li><p><strong>Net Cash:</strong> positive</p></li><li><p><strong>Debt:</strong> minimal (primarily lease obligations)</p></li></ul><p>There is <strong>no financial leverage propping up returns</strong>. Cash flow is organic, recurring, and unencumbered — giving management flexibility across cycles.</p><h3><br/><strong>Cash Flow &amp; Capital Allocation</strong></h3><p>Yelp’s cash flow profile is the core of the thesis.</p><p><em>(TTM)</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Operating Cash Flow:</strong> ≈ $360M</p></li><li><p><strong>Capex:</strong> ≈ $45–50M</p></li><li><p><strong>Free Cash Flow:</strong> ≈ $310M</p></li></ul><p>That translates into a <strong>very high FCF yield</strong> for a business with:</p><ul><li> entrenched market position</li><li> no existential disruption narrative</li><li> strong pricing power with advertisers</li><li> limited reinvestment requirements</li></ul><p>Capital allocation has been rational and shareholder-oriented:</p><ul><li><p>aggressive <strong>share repurchases</strong></p></li><li><p>no empire-building acquisitions</p></li><li><p>no leverage escalation</p></li><li><p>focus on maintaining platform relevance and efficiency</p></li></ul><h3><br/><strong>Why YELP Might Be Undervalued</strong></h3><p>Market skepticism around Yelp typically centers on:</p><p>• perceived stagnation in user growth<br/>• competition from Google local search<br/>• long-term SMB advertising cyclicality<br/>• lack of a “growth narrative”</p><p>However, what appears underappreciated is that <strong>Yelp no longer needs growth to justify its valuation</strong>.</p><p>At current prices, the market is implicitly assuming:</p><ul><li><p>flat to declining relevance</p></li><li><p>structurally pressured margins</p></li><li><p>minimal long-term durability</p></li></ul><p>Yet the financials suggest otherwise:</p><ul><li> strong recurring advertiser economics</li><li> durable cash generation through cycles</li><li> platform operating leverage already realized</li><li> valuation pricing in excessive pessimism</li></ul><p>With <strong>IV/P = 1.30</strong> and <strong>AM = 6.5</strong>, Yelp is priced more like a melting ice cube than a stabilized, cash-harvesting platform.</p><h3><br/><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>With an <strong>IV/P of 1.30</strong>, an <strong>Acquirer’s Multiple of 6.5</strong>, and over <strong>$300M in trailing free cash flow</strong>, Yelp screens as a compelling cash-flow value opportunity in the internet platform space.</p><p>Growth expectations are low, sentiment is muted, and coverage is thin — but the valuation embeds a margin of safety that appears to underestimate:</p><p>✓ the durability of local intent-driven search<br/>✓ the resilience of SMB advertising demand<br/>✓ the power of high-margin platform cash flow<br/>✓ the optionality of continued buybacks at depressed prices</p><p>For investors focused on <strong>cash yield, balance sheet strength, and valuation discipline</strong>, YELP stands out as a quietly attractive, underappreciated compounder — not because it is exciting, but because it is <strong>cheap relative to what it reliably produces</strong>.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/thermo-fisher-scientific-inc-our-calculation-of-intrinsic-value?post=557305\">Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.: Our Calculation Of Intrinsic Value</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/westlake-chemical-partners-lp-deep-value-in-the-chemical-infrastructure-sector?post=555519\">Westlake Chemical Partners LP - Deep Value In The Chemical Infrastructure Sector</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/our-calculation-of-intrinsic-value-the-walt-disney-company?post=555354\">Our Calculation Of Intrinsic Value: The Walt Disney Company</a></p></div>",

On uranium, Rick explains why ~$90 term pricing and long-term contracts can change producer economics, and why he prefers Cameco over the juniors.

Depending on who you read, things are either finally starting to turn for the better, or the underlying numbers portend a disaster. I read dozens of such reports, trying to discern some underlying key themes and trends.</p><p dir=\"auto\">You can indeed see this latest slew of results in a positive manner. You can also see underlying data that makes you uncomfortable, if you take a historical view. Why is<em> this</em> tried-and-true employment sector shrinking? Why are we adding more jobs here? Are we getting the “right kind” of jobs? If there are problems over “there,” why is it not showing up in the overall unemployment number? Wages and hours went up. Unemployment went down. The number of people employed went up. We have boomers to thank for much of the rise in the number of workers. Etc.</p><p dir=\"auto\">Let’s start with my prediction: we are at the beginning of an employment paradigm shift. I think what we are experiencing is a paradigm shift, so we’re getting data that seemingly conflicts, when really it doesn’t. What it is telling us is that the nature of employment is once again shifting (as it has since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution). And given what we know about some of the direction and its causes, employment is going to shift faster than it ever has in the past, causing more disruption but also creating a great deal of opportunity, for both employees and employers. Why would the outcome from this paradigm shift be that much different from the last three or four (depending on how you count)?</p><p dir=\"auto\">Past paradigm shifts caused considerable angst while they were happening, but they all resulted in an explosion of new opportunities and whole new industries. None of which was envisioned beforehand. It is human nature to want to improve our own personal situation. And we are seemingly pretty good at it.</p><p dir=\"auto\">Today we’re going to look at the recent employment data, and begin our exploration of what it will be like to be in the midst of a paradigm shift, on top of all of the other changes in society and finance. Without trying to be cliché, it is part and parcel of The Fourth Turning.</p><p dir=\"auto\">Note: if I see the same piece of data in three letters, I am assuming it is commonly known. If an idea is unique to a source I will give a hat tip, and of course I’ll link to anything I quote. If I make a comment in the middle of a quote I will put it in brackets []. There will be a lot of charts in this letter.</p><h2 dir=\"auto\"><br/>The Employment Glass is More Than Half Full</h2><p dir=\"auto\">First of all, the monthly employment numbers were solid: 130,000. Both average hours worked and average wages went up. Unemployment went down to 4.3%. There has never been more people employed in this country then today at 159 million. The fly in the ointment? As Brian Syztel noted, “while that has doubled in my lifetime, it would be significantly higher if the participation rate weren't five points below where it was in the mid-nineties.” Although it did tick up last month to 62.5%.</p><p dir=\"auto\">The private sector contributed 173,000 jobs. Predictably, 34,000 jobs were lost at the government level. “The household survey said 528k jobs were added and as it was above the 387k person rise in the labor force, the unemployment rate fell to 4.3% from 4.4%. The all-in U6 rate fell to 8% from 8.4%, helped by a drop in those working part time because they can’t find full time work.” (Peter Boockvar)</p><p dir=\"auto\">I will go into the huge negative revisions in the overall employment numbers, but first let’s focus for a minute on private sector growth.</p><p dir=\"auto\">“Since the beginning of 2025, [the private sector] added 539,000 jobs. Since the beginning of 2024, it added 1.56 million jobs, with six of those months showing job <em>declines</em>, much weaker than previously reported, according to today’s revised figures.</p><p dir=\"auto\">“But private sector job growth has ramped up in recent months.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Source: Wolf Street\" height=\"529\" src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c8f3c2_b11e452cf2514670a093e7573560f856~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_756,h_571,al_c,lg_1,q_90,enc_auto/c8f3c2_b11e452cf2514670a093e7573560f856~mv2.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: </em><a href=\"https://wolfstreet.com/2026/02/11/private-sector-ramps-up-hiring-job-losses-mount-at-federal-state-governments/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><u>Wolf Street</u></em></a></p><p dir=\"auto\"><br/><strong>“The Fed should keep its eyes on private-sector jobs</strong> for its monetary policy decisions<strong>.</strong> While the drop in government employment impacts the unemployment rate, consumer spending, and the economy, it is the result of a political decision by the White House, and not the result of weak demand, slow consumer spending, or other economic weakness that might be considered a reason for rate cuts.”</p><p dir=\"auto\">The unemployment rate moved down slightly to 4.28%.

That trend is not our friend, especially in a future world of AI and robotics.</p><p dir=\"auto\">GDP is growing nicely at +3.

David Rosenberg posted this one paragraph in a group thread:</p><p dir=\"auto\">“Over 100% of the job gain was in health/education – the other 80% of the economy lost jobs. Over 100% of the job gain came from the Birth-Death model … employment from the actual survey declined.”</p><p dir=\"auto\">[Rosie is highlighting the fact that the Birth/Death model has been significantly revised. I have gone into this in detail in the past, but the short version is that there is no way the Establishment Survey can capture new small businesses whenever they are created or they fail. So they had to create a “plug factor” to try to capture it. Which means you have to look at backward looking data. Which means that when there is a change in the economy, either positive or negative, the Birth/Death model will be wrong, sometimes significantly. It always gets revised. Given the modest weakness in small business surveys, it suggests there will be some significant revisions here as well.]</p><p dir=\"auto\">“The response rate [to the BLS survey questionnaire] at 64% is at a record low and compares to 82% pre-pandemic, which is why we see unusually large revisions.”</p><p dir=\"auto\">[This is important. The data revisions for the last three or four years have been rather dramatic. When over 25% of the data comes in later, it is illogical to think there won’t be significant revisions. Businesses are just not responding to the surveys as fast as they have in the past, which renders the first month number (which the market moves on) to be almost guaranteed to be revised significantly. I will confess I don’t understand.]</p><p dir=\"auto\">The raw non-seasonally smoothed data showed a 2.65 million plunge in payrolls … a generous SA adjustment factor …</p><p dir=\"auto\">We noted above that private-sector employment is rising. But if you look at the overall data, you get a completely different picture. The revisions they made this month essentially wiped out much of the job growth in 2025. For the full year in 2025, the economy only added 229,000 jobs. From July through December, the economy lost 45,000 jobs</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Source: Mike “Mish” Shedlock\" height=\"449\" src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c8f3c2_14ed4d9f42d2436ab972d2a2b7d057e6~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_756,h_485,al_c,lg_1,q_90,enc_auto/c8f3c2_14ed4d9f42d2436ab972d2a2b7d057e6~mv2.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: </em><a href=\"https://x.com/MishGEA/status/2021608725715243468\" target=\"_blank\"><em><u>Mike “Mish” Shedlock</u></em></a></p><p dir=\"auto\"><br/>That being said, we reduced government jobs by 317,000. Plus Boomer retirement issues are a factor, and while it was clearly not a great year, it wasn’t a disaster. Diving even deeper, it does get a little bit more disconcerting.</p><p dir=\"auto\">Next let’s look at some data from Karen Harris of Bain and Company’s Macro Trends Group  (they do serious work and are one of my favorite sources). Here’s some slides from the latest deck she sent me. This first one does not portend well.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Source: Bain &amp; Company\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c8f3c2_600367fdf6e148f7b083f78693543ae5~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_756,h_432,al_c,lg_1,q_85,enc_auto/c8f3c2_600367fdf6e148f7b083f78693543ae5~mv2.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.bain.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><u>Bain &amp; Company</u></em></a><br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Source: Bain &amp; Company\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c8f3c2_3ea084184e1a4b08a24d845338779b84~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_756,h_432,al_c,lg_1,q_85,enc_auto/c8f3c2_3ea084184e1a4b08a24d845338779b84~mv2.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.bain.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><u>Bain &amp; Company</u></em></a></p><p dir=\"auto\"><br/>This begs the question: “Why isn’t the unemployment rate going up in?” My speculation below.</p><p dir=\"auto\">This next chart needs a little setup. They analyzed 17 industry segments. All but one of them are seeing a reduction in job openings, and some of them significantly. Healthcare sticks out, but looking down the chart I noticed that “professionals” dropped even more. AI, anyone? Even restaurants/hotels dropped.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Source: Bain &amp; Company\" height=\"396\" src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c8f3c2_7bbb57907ef74d18849bb7c747701893~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_756,h_428,al_c,lg_1,q_85,enc_auto/c8f3c2_7bbb57907ef74d18849bb7c747701893~mv2.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.bain.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><u>Bain &amp; Company</u></em></a></p><p dir=\"auto\"><br/>What this says is that the drivers of employment are softening. Not falling out of bed, just softening. Which is strange in a 3% GDP world.</p><p dir=\"auto\">Another anomaly: the rather low unemployment rate is partially a reflection of the fact that the number of not-employed persons (people who are not counted as in the labor force) has risen significantly in the past few years. Remember, when they do the employment survey they asked if you have looked for a job in the last 30 days. If you haven’t, they basically take you out of the total workforce. This can happen for all sorts of good reasons, like you’re going to school, you had to quit work to take care of one of your parents for a period of time, etc. Or it could be that you keep trying to get a job and are discouraged and give up. Either way, you are not in the workforce and are not counted as unemployed.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Source: Bain &amp; Company\" height=\"399\" src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c8f3c2_edb7f7d451774a2fb4f6ea4a1d7d25b0~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_756,h_431,al_c,lg_1,q_85,enc_auto/c8f3c2_edb7f7d451774a2fb4f6ea4a1d7d25b0~mv2.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.bain.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><u>Bain &amp; Company</u></em></a></p><p dir=\"auto\">One final chart from Karen. As we noted above, education and health services has been the driver of recent employment growth. Within that sector, family services is driving the surge. These are people helping with home healthcare, social services, mental health and so on. As our Boomer generation ages, we need more help.</p><h2 dir=\"auto\"><br/>The Migration of Jobs</h2><p dir=\"auto\">Historically, the relatively slow growth in jobs would suggest a higher unemployment rate and lower GDP. That is not the case, which begs the question, why?</p><p dir=\"auto\">I think there are several reasons. The first is immigration. There has been a significant reduction in immigrants, legal or otherwise in the US. If I am skeptical of BLS data, I am a magnitude more skeptical of the data from Homeland Security or opposing groups massaging their own data. That being said, trying to more or less average the rather disparate claims, ICE says they deported 605,000 illegal immigrants in 2025. Give or take. Actually, given that this number was exceeded by Obama and Trump 1, that doesn’t seem excessively high. The interesting thing is how many immigrants have self-deported. DHS says it’s 2.2 million. Others claim it’s less than 1 million, but whatever the number, it is significant.</p><p dir=\"auto\">It means that roughly 2 million people who presumably were spending money and therefore had jobs (or government or close family assistance) are no longer in the workforce. Somebody has to do the jobs they had and that is why I suspect that we’ve seen a tick up in the participation rate and the number of people in the labor force. That is more than 1% of the workforce. Have any of those people had jobs? We don’t know. But a lot of them did.</p><p dir=\"auto\">Are we still getting legal immigrants? Yes. Which is a good thing because we need immigrants for our workforce at all levels.</p><p dir=\"auto\">I would also point out reducing 300,000+ federal workers is no small thing. If we talked about 300,000 jobs in the auto industry being lost in one year, it would be a headline disaster in every paper. I suspect there will be more federal jobs lost this year.</p><h2 dir=\"auto\"><br/>AI Is Showing Up In the Data</h2><p dir=\"auto\">Secondly, supporting my labor paradigm shift is that we can actually begin to see some impact from AI. Remember, AI wasn’t a significant factor even two years ago. Today it is everywhere (I’m at the “trying to figure out what the hell this is” stage).</p><p dir=\"auto\">There is a famous quote from 1987 by Robert Solow (1987), who got the Nobel Laureate for his work on economic growth. It was great work. But when asked about the effect of computers on productivity he quipped, “<em>You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.”</em></p><p dir=\"auto\">Now in just two years, from the beginning of 22 through 2025 you can actually see the increase in productivity in the productivity statistics. This chart from the Financial Times via Adam Tooze contrasts time savings with actually increase in productivity.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Source: Financial Times via Adam Tooze\" height=\"618\" src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c8f3c2_363f33d2fb0d411ba5062c7bb73b89e6~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_756,h_667,al_c,lg_1,q_90,enc_auto/c8f3c2_363f33d2fb0d411ba5062c7bb73b89e6~mv2.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: </em><a href=\"https://x.com/adam_tooze/status/2021943460412936466\" target=\"_blank\"><em><u>Financial Times via Adam Tooze</u></em></a></p><p dir=\"auto\"><br/>The recent releases from Anthropic/Claude AI and chat GPT 5.3 have produced a paradigm shift in AI. Hallucinations are down and ease of use is up. It didn’t help the software as a service (SaaS) stocks, as it is becoming a powerful coding tool with the potential to reduce the need for SaaS.</p><p dir=\"auto\">This makes sense, as developers are focused on creating software which will allow them to improve their own AI software. It makes them more productive. We are now beginning to see the beginnings of AI writing its own software, improving it as it goes through iterations and debugs its own code. This is a huge step forward.</p><p dir=\"auto\">Of course, many other professions think they are fine because their jobs aren’t writing software. But that same software will soon be turned on other professions with repetitive work that can be analyzed and programmed.</p><p dir=\"auto\">Remember the chart above where I noted that the number of job openings in professional services was dropping significantly over the last year? This is a reflection of AI. So yes, AI is coming for a lot of professional jobs. But it is going to create a lot more potential jobs as everyone will seek to optimize their personal circumstances. We just don’t know what those jobs will be yet.</p><p dir=\"auto\">My true concern is not that in 2040 we won’t have figured out how to adapt and expand human progress and employment and well-being. It is that the change is going to happen so rapidly that it makes adaptation far more difficult than it has been in the past in any generation.</p><p dir=\"auto\">And we are going to do this during a period of major social change (The Fourth Turning/elite overproduction/sovereign debt crisis…) which will make the response cycle even more difficult. I think I can make one prediction fairly confidently: politicians are going to increase their competition to make promises to voters about how they will “fix” things.</p><p dir=\"auto\">And in a crisis, voters on the margin are going to respond to those promises. The political swings will be significant. Stay tuned and strap in.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/federal-regime-change?post=555669\">Federal Regime Change</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-real-affordability-problem?post=554071\">The Real Affordability Problem</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/economics--politics/big-time-change?post=552357\">Big Time Change</a></p></div>",

Airline fares rose 6.5% in January, while used cars and trucks fell 1.8%, and motor vehicle insurance slipped 0.4%, the BLS said.</p><p>Taken together, the picture is consistent with disinflation continuing, but not in a perfectly smooth line, and that nuance is what keeps rate expectations sensitive to each new CPI print.​</p><h2><br/>How US jobs data fits the bigger picture</h2><p>The labor market, meanwhile, looks steady rather than overheated.</p><p>The BLS said total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 130,000 in January, and the unemployment rate “changed little” at 4.3%.</p><p>Job gains were concentrated in health care (82,000), social assistance (42,000), and construction (33,000), while federal government employment fell by 34,000, and financial activities declined by 22,000.​</p><p>Wages are still rising at a pace that supports consumers, but not so fast that it automatically implies runaway inflation.</p><p>Average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose 0.4% in January to $37.17, and were up 3.7% over the past 12 months.</p><p>The average workweek edged up to 34.3 hours in January, another sign that labor demand is holding together.​</p><p>Investors also had to digest revisions that temper any single-month read.</p><p>The BLS revised November payroll growth down to 41,000 from 56,000, and December to 48,000 from 50,000, making the two months combined 17,000 lower than previously reported.</p><p>More broadly, the annual benchmark process revised the March 2025 level of total nonfarm employment down by 898,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis, and it cut 2025 job gains from 584,000 to 181,000.</p><p>That kind of adjustment doesn’t change the fact that hiring is continuing in 2026, but it does reinforce the idea that the labor market has cooled from its earlier post-pandemic pace.​</p><h2><br/>The soft landing narrative: How real is it?</h2><p>A “soft landing” is the scenario where inflation comes down without the economy tipping into recession, slower price growth without a surge in unemployment.</p><p>January’s data fit that storyline better than many recent months: headline inflation eased, and job growth continued at a moderate clip.</p><p>For the Fed, the combination argues for patience, not victory laps.</p><p>The January CPI rose less than expected, while the underlying inflation remained firm as businesses raised prices at the start of the year.</p><p>In markets, the immediate reaction was consistent with that read, with Treasury yields slipping after the slightly lighter CPI print.</p><p>The risk case is still easy to sketch. If shelter and other service-heavy categories keep core inflation elevated, the Fed may feel less urgency to cut rates, even if headline inflation looks comfortable.</p><p>And if hiring cools too quickly, especially after the benchmark revisions reminded investors how noisy the jobs data can be, the soft landing could start to look more like a slowdown.</p><p>For now, January’s cooler inflation and steady hiring give the soft-landing camp fresh evidence heading deeper into 2026, but the next few CPI prints and labor reports will matter more than any single “good” month.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/why-tesla-stock-is-climbing-even-as-big-tech-sells-off?post=557396\">Why Tesla Stock Is Climbing Even As Big Tech Sells Off </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/micron-stock-plunges-on-friday-has-the-rally-run-too-far?post=557363\">Micron Stock Plunges On Friday: Has The Rally Run Too Far? </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/hang-seng-index-dips-to-a-key-support-as-global-stocks-retreat?post=557138\">Hang Seng Index Dips To A Key Support As Global Stocks Retreat </a></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p>Before I get to the main point at hand, let me make a quick note about this morning’s existing home sales report for January: it was more of the same. Sales remained within the sideways range they have been in for nearly the past three years; prices were nearly flat YoY, up only 0.3%; and inventory was above its post-pandemic levels but well below pre-pandemic levels. </p><p>But on to the main course. I have seen a surprising amount of commentary on the Seeking Alpha investment site that yesterday’s jobs gain of 131,000 for January means that employment is on the upswing, completely neglecting that one month does not make a trend, that revisions have been relentlessly downward, and that January is perhaps the most difficult month for the BLS to accomplish seasonal adjustments — in January there were 2,649,000 layoffs! It’s just that the adjustment mechanism expected even more.</p><p>By far more important for the trend, and in particular the trend for the leading indicators within the jobs report, were the revisions to the past 12+ months of data. And as we saw from the headline adjustment, it was very large and very bad. So let’s start there, and then go through the most important leading sectors and metrics.</p><p>The total adjustment over the relevant data was nearly a -1,000,000 jobs. For the year 2025, the adjustment was just over -400,000, causing a previous 584,000 gain to turn into only a 181,000 gain, for an average of only 15,000 jobs added per month:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"317\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMox2v2LTQKG2yxCgHWjY-hkAnBmCaG3l8Q0_9vCqZX4J7bMph9EUg01oxSTy0pO9bTHdmiLCLmPUCcLkjygvh8z7r8xyEzZuDPrEuxclTRKA8QrjQqC6yYHYKue3OdsEp6f6qIRa5eb2ZNrio5_zcN4Lxk87Lz0iaV7E3IKxPJ_OeCONu9vtJwM8bM4eX/s2086/IMG_2729.jpeg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Even worse, for the eight months from April through the end of the year, a grand total of only *12,000* jobs were added, and no that’s not a typo. That’s 1,500 jobs per month! That’s about as close to recessionary as you can get without actually being in one (that we know of, at this point).</p><p>So let’s turn to the leading sectors, starting with manufacturing. There a -166,000 decline through December since Mary 2024 turned into a -251,000 decline, before its very slight 5,000 increase in January:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgiGQArYLKHHVG_JNoLB7L-oRX4Coj2NFuolI0xdknsj6M0jpmmjVYMXLGwfWA0Ab64hYNzHyvKTGxU0rvI1inWcgDpcvIF-2njzH0ey2D34zxqyA2DqE2wdLAp1PmIE8KbOQdV6tX8Mffk3kVSLxhkrgQqdpjKiF_bOT99S9XecF3UCxpmRkD6gBgusDk5/s1913/IMG_2734.jpeg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Next, here is construction. There, a slightly increasing trend throughout the year that added 14,000 jobs turned into a declining trend through October that ended up with a net -1,000 decline for the year:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"327\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjygIWza9RvJYjiue_P1At5MVxrZBMev_6t-UGOuCB9-v6_NbyMqg8t9X0Y_ccBIA9sr7QDF1RmR_CM92GG3NmYYt8iv8m0kW-ZBkNJC-TQF8EMHuu-VTO_pYjyq2nhGAnPLy8cbTqsb-i7quEF_jDGgAvwRM1U9nGb_XHYy7WwW5PaZB1O_weDTHVng7HP/s2006/IMG_2735.jpeg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>But even the rebound since October disappear when we look at the even more significant residential construction sector. There, an increase through March followed by a slightly declining trend thereafter, resulting in a -1,400 decline for the year turned into a nearly relentless decline since March 2024 that ended with a -12,900 decline during 2025:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"331\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6jLHZ3txF6IDUn92ZkoUQ7bz0_k10_SSVAHh7zBZMtpMxKPDaNA0ONLwHnc0gARHHTCBVVnPpqEkYi_uXHN4QYHehmkg7UDS5cuRG44DgYwPu9dp5HSPGx-dymuhmZpKEpRBwkx_b94UFdWo1YuNO8ZIXAwk4qr4awpE-ysRAWg31wk0ez4vsRwO4NTUO/s1995/IMG_2736.jpeg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>The entire rebound in construction was because of nonresidential building construction (and asociated specialty trades, not shown below):</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJchqFEGavxrJoE4kTvczgfqyyrfhVCjNbeh-Bxrwj-DSww8IFUg5umH7s4mfEt0tBZyLWiTY6hbSwM_1j_24d7AuZ5EG8g0-vlpmcGE2Tz45YbAj91ouHkdEp_qr7AtJ1_1HwdDZj3scJ1OR1UhM3M_UQFwU_uI4htG9tfopOsVqw4dYAKFeQMwUDHP5M/s2005/IMG_2737.jpeg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Through October of last year revisions added 3,700 jobs, and then 12,000 more since.</p><p>For the goods producing sector as a whole, the -90,000 decline from its April peak through December turned into a nearly relentless-184,000 decline from a peak in July 2024 through last October, before increasing 49,000 since (again, all due to nonresidential building construction and associated specialty trades):</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhphh3iYptSqQpEt8sUzbDDGen3q65kndJ-h-3G5_lyAOIeHm7xldqP8aZXnqJuPC2rSKTwlHXvWgL-uZp9Ejc0frhAmQdG85h887lAPy-BUMqFHh_vphS9fthgoNyErR-jH43ROSiVLgvapwtsLQ1mF329s7pWOAP5XoaYIAooqLv9W7zQ1xnUROgHp1hq/s2091/IMG_2738.jpeg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>In short, *all* of the leading employment sectors of the economy declined during 2025. The only significant leading indicator in employment that remained postive was the average workweek in manufacturing, but even that did not improve:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"319\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjy-cniiXSniuiZ_MG2oNvL-zQdDamYht2nEpTLTkyuFIcCxzdoTUag2LMCspyNGkNelzKtRIX7nDMqFkW-ttY_5m0OhVjmgoBluxqBIFvck4PSVe6ItFcNzFk09TxhcAoQ_IAXUljAXXzlrLuCzihDgbaulpTGt86Z4DOmxD6nPXlrCzdlZhG0Dfo0aTsK/s2089/IMG_2746.jpeg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Finally, let’s turn to aggregate nonsupervisory payrolls. We won’t know what the “real” number was for January until we get tomorrow’s CPI report, but since there was a nominal 0.8% gain last month, it is likely the “real” number will be positive as well. Here the revisions subtracted roughly -1% from the previous trend, but retained an almost identical positive trajectory:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"325\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh34XllE40lec-Bgp53Ne9KIkucrKs8vqm3XmGpmA8q-1k4LhLWIoWNqmHDyXXZtcoOh2Eqt2YjpyQq4hiXV8UXFnht-Gpul2TjUlRZoEirVsrJPLhx1J3PR2nQwTQQrIdr1XmCA20qEexWYfUwyM7-kfxNY08LYF6n1sx0eKq8Z4l_m8iBEVajAHHqUbJK/s2008/IMG_2730.jpeg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Decomposing the metric, revisions indicated a -0.6% decline compared with the previous index for aggregate hours worked:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJC6P4w-HsEZyz3W8dt9YneabXRX6qM5D1EzManYCNuFTBXZHgJ239RSW1axVILxzqLTptPcPYehLNsD6irfIx3xWZYehMJV3jPISbJVo8g3bNxfsUHyQo8Mdh56_QK2hMdGVU7PUI_9MwrBOcVce2ND4MbLjeyRKFdAONbd4PXPGmHwfX2r9OtKvgGuTu/s2091/IMG_2747.jpeg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>But the previous vintage showed a 0.7% gain for the year, which was reduced to 0.4%, but still a gain.</p><p>This further compensated for by a 0.2% increase in average hourly earnings over the year ending in December:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"342\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-UqnNhF4uJykX0gk3metDQuK2W2EGBNRUt7gkOtS-WJZRra-CgVTEZ539fbIAgB-OfDOb_RlxQK2bwLrjnJkCXHDLXED7JFYJH4Sll_jDcGPlC0FJwTE0dxqlrvCFj_Nw5U1cswQoFso_p_59-VtrCMUHrYnqO5XKb6sLUFT_sGAFAGUVp7MorJToU6-D/s1924/IMG_2731.jpeg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>In other words, while the absolute number for aggregate payrolls was revised downward, the upward *trend* remained intact. That, along with the intract trend of increased average weekly hours in manufacturing, were the sole leading positives that came out of the benchmark revisions. All of the others were negative.</p><p>This feeds into the dominant “K-shaped economy” narrative which I believe is correct: the AI data center boom has led to a stock market boom, which - aside from being a likely source of the increase in nonresidential construction employment - has been feeding a “wealth effect” increase in spending by the top 10%-20% of consumers.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/disinflating-shelter-prices-and-deflating-gas-prices-work-wonders-for-january-cpi?post=557364\">Disinflating Shelter Prices And Deflating Gas Prices Work Wonders For January CPI</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/unresolved-post-pandemic-seasonality-likely-continues-in-jobless-claims?post=557034\">Unresolved Post-Pandemic Seasonality Likely Continues In Jobless Claims </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/january-jobs-report-superb-monthly-gains-but-the-birds-came-home-to-roost-for-2025?post=556796\">January Jobs Report: Superb Monthly Gains, But The Birds Came Home To Roost For 2025 </a><br/></div>",

Earlier this year, EGA and Century Aluminium announced plans to build the first new US smelter since 1980 - a 750kt/year plant in Oklahoma - but with construction only starting later this year and production not expected until the end of the decade, it does little to change the near‑term supply picture. This means the US will continue to rely heavily on imported primary metal regardless of tariff policy. The potential rollback under discussion appears to focus on derivative products rather than primary aluminium, meaning the core levy on metal would remain unchanged.</p><h3><br/><strong>US aluminium prices soar</strong></h3><p>Trump doubled the levies to 50% in June last year and later expanded them to cover derivative products. Since then, aluminium prices in the US have risen faster than global prices, with the US Midwest premium climbing to an all‑time high this week - more than double its early‑June level when the 50% tariff took effect.</p><p>But if there was any rollback on the primary metal levies, the premium will be the first to react.</p><h3><br/><strong>Premiums have diverged since tariffs took effect</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://think.ing.com/uploads/charts/_w800/premiums_ali_feb.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: Platts, Fastmarkets, ING Research</em></p><h3><br/><strong>Trade re-routing</strong></h3><p>Tariffs reshaped US aluminium flows - primary imports fell, scrap imports rose (as a raw material scrap is only subject to reciprocal tariffs), and Canadian metal was diverted to Europe (Canadian metal can go to Europe duty free).</p><p>Still, US dependence on Canadian aluminium remains dominant.</p><h3><br/><strong>US aluminium imports have slowed down</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"323\" src=\"https://think.ing.com/uploads/charts/_w800/us_alu_imports_feb.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: US Department of Commerce, USGS, ING Research</em></p><h3><br/><strong>US import sources have shifted</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"323\" src=\"https://think.ing.com/uploads/charts/_w800/us_imports_sources_ali_feb.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: Trade Map, ING Research</em></p><h3><br/><strong>More Canadian metal flows to Europe</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://think.ing.com/uploads/charts/_w800/canada_ali_flows_feb.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: TradeMap, ING Research</em></p><h3><strong>US inventories are tight</strong></h3><p>Very little supply is left on the ground in the US.</p><p>Imports have been running below 2024 levels since the tariffs came in, reflecting both weaker demand and ongoing destocking.

From lows around the $60 to $90 per share range in early 2025 to current levels near $410 per share, the rally reflects booming AI-driven memory demand.</p><p>The stock stuttered briefly amid broader market fears of am \"SaaS-pocalypse\" – concerns over slowing AI spending and software growth – but those worries proved overblown. MU has quickly rebounded and resumed its upward trajectory. With AI infrastructure spending accelerating, investors are left wondering just how much higher can Micron go this year?</p><h2><br/>An AI-Fueled Memory Hog</h2><p>Demand for memory chips is skyrocketing, fueled by explosive growth in artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators, data centers, and high-performance computing. This surge was dramatically confirmed by Japanese flash and solid-state drive maker <strong>Kioxia</strong>, which reported a blowout quarter and announced that its entire NAND memory production capacity for 2026 is fully sold out.</p><p>Kioxia's outsized Q4 guidance – revenue and profits far exceeding consensus estimate – underscored persistent supply constraints as hyperscalers make relentless AI investments, projected for as much as $600 billion this year by the likes of <strong>Amazon</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AMZN\">AMZN</a>), <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/META\">META</a>), and <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/MSFT\">MSFT</a>). Executives noted that strong demand from AI-related customers has locked in supply through long-term contracts, with imbalances likely extending into 2027. This tight market dynamic supports higher average selling prices (ASPs) and limited relief from new capacity in the near term.</p><p>Micron itself is <a href=\"https://moneymorning.com/2026/01/05/micron-technologoy-picks-up-right-where-left-off/\">capitalizing aggressively</a> on this environment. During a recent <strong>Wolfe Research</strong> conference presentation, CFO Mark Murphy revealed that the company has achieved high-volume production of its next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM4). Shipments to customers commenced in Q1 2026 – one full quarter ahead of its prior December guidance. Yields are on track, with the product delivering speeds exceeding 11 gigabytes per second while meeting stringent reliability standards.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"311\" src=\"https://moneymorning.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2026/02/MU-Chart.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><h2><br/>A Global Rise in Memory Production</h2><p>This acceleration directly counters earlier skepticism about Micron's progress and positions it strongly against rivals <strong>Samsung</strong> and <strong>SK Hynix</strong>, who are also <a href=\"https://moneymorning.com/2026/01/26/need-another-reason-to-buy-micron-samsung-just-gave-you-100-of-them/\">advancing HBM4 efforts</a>, uch as Samsung targeting mass production for <strong>Nvidia</strong>'s (<a href=\"https://moneymorning.com/stocks/nvda/\">NVDA</a>) Vera Rubin platform.</p><p>Micron has already committed its entire 2026 HBM output to customers. Murphy emphasized that overall demand continues to outpace supply, with constraints expected to persist into 2027. The company is balancing HBM4 ramp-up alongside HBM3E production throughout the year, maintaining pricing power in a supply-constrained market. Industry-wide challenges in yields and performance testing persist, but Micron's early execution highlights its competitive edge in securing volume commitments amid AI memory shortages.</p><h2><br/>Bottom Line</h2><p>Despite Micron's impressive run, significant upside remains available in 2026 and beyond. The stock trades at just 9 times forward earnings – a fraction of its projected earnings growth rate, estimated at 77% annually over the next five years. This undervaluation exists even at current elevated prices, as massive EPS expansion from HBM4 adoption, sold-out capacity, and sustained AI demand should drive further re-rating.</p><p>With tight supply, pricing power, and a fortress balance sheet, Micron Technology represents a compelling opportunity in the AI memory boom for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/copper-prices-are-expected-to-explode-is-this-the-best-way-to-profit-from-it?post=557366\">Copper Prices Are Expected To Explode.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1640161704729-cbe966a08476?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/kM6QNrgo0YE\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></em></p><p><br/>Over the past several weeks, Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US have experienced sustained outflows. These funds have seen significant declines in total assets, with the trend pointing to a major shift in investor behavior. Instead of reinforcing bullish momentum, the outflows from crypto ETFs are adding pressure to the broader cryptocurrency market. Meanwhile, international equity ETFs, particularly those outside of the US, have seen a substantial increase in inflows.</p><h3><br/><strong>Outflows from US Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs</strong></h3><p>Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US have experienced a <a href=\"https://sosovalue.com/assets/etf/us-btc-spot\">noticeable</a> downturn in assets since the start of 2026. Bitcoin ETF assets have fallen sharply from near $115 billion to approximately $83 billion, while Ethereum ETFs have seen an even steeper <a href=\"https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/2022409442554175703?s=20\">contraction</a>, dropping from around $18 billion to $11 billion. This marks a clear shift, with institutional investors pulling capital out of US-based crypto assets in favor of international markets.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://assets.beincrypto.com/img/PBUzp2WUnjHKvX8OTTUi0qvKwuU=/smart/a6d1149204584f749520908fa2e00ef5\" width=\"655\"/></p><p><br/>The reasons behind these outflows are linked to broader economic conditions, including rising Treasury yields and tightening liquidity. The US labor market’s strength has also played a role in shifting investor priorities toward safer assets, such as bonds. As Treasury yields climb, risk assets like <a href=\"https://coincentral.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-etfs-suffer-record-outflows-amid-market-turmoil/\">Bitcoin and Ethereum</a> become less attractive, prompting a rotation into international equities and safer, yield-generating investments.</p><h3><br/><strong>Shift Toward International Equity Markets</strong></h3><p>While US-based Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are losing investor capital, international equity ETFs are seeing record levels of inflows. January 2026 saw an exceptional surge in global ex-US equity fund allocations, with these funds absorbing a large share of ETF inflows despite comprising a smaller portion of total <a href=\"https://coincentral.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-hits-5b-volume-as-bitcoin-surpasses-120k/\">ETF assets</a>.</p><p>The shift towards international markets reflects a growing preference for equities in regions offering relatively cheaper valuations and improving macroeconomic conditions.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"417\" src=\"https://assets.beincrypto.com/img/lV5-pSq-sBGN1aZfq0K0MRKXcIA=/smart/1e02b24395e745d5be42b0ff6e44ee1c\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>This growing interest in overseas markets highlights a significant rotation in institutional investor portfolios. As many investors trim their exposure to crowded US growth sectors, they are reallocating capital to international markets, where economic conditions are more favorable. The shift toward international equities also comes amid easing inflationary pressures in several markets outside the US, making these assets more appealing for investment.</p><h3><br/><strong>Impact of Rising Treasury Yields on Crypto ETFs</strong></h3><p>The rise in US Treasury yields has been a central factor in the capital outflow from Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Higher yields make safer, yield-generating investments more attractive compared to risk assets like cryptocurrencies. As the US economy shows signs of resilience, Treasury bonds, with their guaranteed returns, are drawing capital away from riskier assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p><p>The high beta nature of <a href=\"https://coincentral.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-etfs-see-massive-outflows-after-historic-20b-liquidation/\">Bitcoin and Ethereum</a> means they are more sensitive to changes in financial conditions. When liquidity tightens and safer investments rise in value, assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum typically experience downward pressure. Investors, particularly institutional ones, are increasingly looking for more stable returns, pushing them to seek opportunities outside the crypto space.</p><h3><br/><strong>Short-Term and Long-Term Outlook for Crypto ETFs</strong></h3><p>The capital outflows from Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs do not necessarily reflect a long-term bearish outlook for cryptocurrencies. While short-term liquidity challenges may weigh on the performance of crypto assets, the fundamental outlook for the crypto market remains intact. However, until the rotation of capital slows or macroeconomic conditions improve, the pressure on <a href=\"https://coincentral.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-etfs-face-713-million-in-combined-outflows/\">Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs</a> is likely to persist.</p><p>In the short term, investors will likely continue to favor international equities and safer bonds. Over time, the crypto market may rebound as conditions change, but for now, the outflows from US crypto ETFs are a significant development to watch.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/xrp-price-may-stage-a-recovery-if-it-successfully-backtests-the-8-year-resistance-line?post=557354\">XRP Price May Stage A Recovery If It Successfully Backtests The 8-Year Resistance Line</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/bitcoin-futures-data-suggests-bears-targeting-60k-amid-price-drop?post=557063\">Bitcoin Futures Data Suggests Bears Targeting $60K Amid Price Drop</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/is-bitcoin-price-entering-a-bear-market-historical-data-and-trends-say-so?post=556775\">Is Bitcoin Price Entering A Bear Market?

It was definitely stronger than I expected. Now that I have had a day to reflect on it, I thought I would share some thoughts. Briefly, I will deal with four issues:</p><ol><li>Was it fake? (quick answer, no)</li><li>What does the establishment data tell us about the economy?</li><li>What does the household data tell us about the labor market?</li><li>Are there reasons to discount the January data?</li></ol><h3><br/><strong>Is it Fake?</strong></h3><p>I’ve had many people ask me this one. We know the Trump administration would have no moral qualms about faking jobs data. Why not, they lie about everything. But as a practical matter it would not be easy. </p><p>They couldn’t just fake a single number, like the unemployment rate. They would have to fake a whole set of numbers so that they lined up without any one of them calling attention as being obviously absurd. This would be made harder by the fact that the underlying data in the household survey are made public, so researchers around the country would be able to quickly check the numbers BLS reported.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that the data couldn’t be faked, but it would almost certainly require a large number of people to be in on the process. The people who work BLS are serious professionals with integrity. If they got orders from Trump to cook the data, we would have heard about it.</p><p>There may be some point down the road where Trump has MAGArized BLS and the data are no longer trustworthy, but we are not there yet.</p><h3><br/><strong>130,000 Jobs Used to be a Bad Month</strong></h3><p>Many folks have lost their bearings in looking at the January jobs number. It was much better than expected (my monthly prediction to my wife, just before the report, was 40k), so in that sense it was good, but we created an <em>average</em> of 103,000 jobs a month in 2024 and 188,000 in 2023. The January figure was hardly something to brag about, which of course the Trump administration did.</p><p>In fairness, with immigration largely shut down, the labor force is growing far more slowly. This means we need many fewer jobs, likely 30,000-50,000 a month, to keep pace with the growth of the labor force.</p><p>Moving below the aggregate, it is striking how concentrated job growth was. The category “healthcare and social assistance” accounted for 123,500 of the job growth, 95 percent of the total. If we add in the 27,800 jobs in restaurants, we’re up to 151,300 jobs. That means on net, everything else lost jobs. </p><p>There is nothing in principle wrong with jobs in health care and social assistance, but this is a very narrow base for the economy. It certainly is not the manufacturing renaissance Donald Trump has promised.</p><p>There were some positives in traditional blue-collar jobs. Manufacturing added 7k jobs, its first monthly gain since Trump took office. Construction added 33,000 jobs in January, but that makes the average gain in the sector less than 4k per month since Trump took office. </p><p>The oil industry lost just under 1,000 jobs in the month, bringing the loss since Trump took office to just under 14k, 3.5 percent of employment in the sector. Apparently, Trump has not realized that low oil prices reduce incentives to drill. The trucking industry also lost jobs in January, bringing the loss since Trump took office to 30,000, 2.0 percent of employment in the industry. </p><p>Wage growth was 3.7 percent year-over-year. That’s still a healthy pace, but down from the 4.0 percent pace in 2023-2024.</p><h3><br/><strong>Bad Employment Trends Were Largely Reversed in January</strong></h3><p>In addition to the small downtick in overall unemployment, many of the disturbing rises for specific demographic groups were at least partially reversed in January. At the top of this list is the drop in the unemployment rate for Black workers from 7.5 percent in December to 7.2 percent. The unemployment rate for Black workers had been 8.2 percent in November, so this is a substantial decline, although it still leaves the unemployment rate for Black workers a full percentage point above its year-ago level.</p><p>In the same vein, the unemployment rate for young workers, ages 20-24, fell by 1.1 p.p. in January to 7.1 percent and is now 0.9 p.p. below its year-ago level. It was 9.2 percent in September. The share of unemployment due to voluntary quits rose to 13.7 percent from 11.1 percent in December. Involuntary part-time employment fell by more than 400k and the share of multiple jobholders was back to its year-ago level.</p><p>Data fans know the household survey is highly erratic, so when we see a big turnaround in these numbers in January, as we did for youth unemployment, there are three possible explanations. One is that the prior months’ numbers were the result of measurement error. A second is that the January numbers are the result of error. The third is that there was an actual change in the economy that is responsible for the shift.</p><p>Put me down as a skeptic for number three. I don’t believe that the unemployment rate for Black workers actually fell by 1.0 p.p. in two months. Of course, it could be a mix of the three. Maybe the fall numbers were driven in part by measurement error, as was the improvement in January, and the labor market could have improved somewhat. Anyhow, the data in the household survey show a markedly better labor market than what the data showed in the fall.</p><h3><br/><strong>January Weather May Have Made the Employment Picture Look Better</strong></h3><p>We all know about the bad storms that hit much of the East in January, but these storms all hit in the second half of the month, <em>after</em> the reference period for the surveys. The weather in the first half of the month was actually pretty good in most of the country.</p><p>This matters because our seasonal adjustment factors are looking for bad January weather. This is easily seen by comparing the unadjusted data with the adjusted data. The unadjusted data <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t01.htm\">show</a> that instead of falling from 4.4 percent to 4.3 percent, the unemployment rate rose from 4.1 percent in December to 4.6 percent in January. (Part of this story is the holiday shopping season.) To be clear, I’m not advocating using unadjusted data, I’m just pointing out that the adjustment factors, especially in January are large. Just as especially bad weather would make the employment picture look worse than it is, unusually good weather can make it look better.</p><p>To see this story with the establishment survey, instead of the 130k job gain we’re all discussing, the unadjusted data show a loss of more than 2.6 million jobs. Instead of the 30k job gain reported for construction, the unadjusted data show a loss of 213k jobs. Manufacturing lost 86k jobs in the unadjusted data. And the 27.8k job gain reported for restaurants is a loss of 246k jobs in the unadjusted data.</p><p>Again, there is nothing illicit in using seasonally adjusted data. If we didn’t adjust the data, it would look like we’re going into a recession every fall and seeing a boom in the spring. The point is simply that the seasonal effects are large, and better or worse than normal weather will have an impact on the data we see.</p><h3><br/><strong>The Jobs Report Matters, But it is Just One Month and One Report</strong></h3><p>We can think of our efforts to understand the economy as being like putting together a jigsaw puzzle. Each data report gives us a piece, but none of them can tell the whole picture. Many of us saw a story of a weak labor market based on more than half a year of weak job growth, rising unemployment, and slowing wage growth. We also have data on job turnover showing workers are very reluctant to leave their jobs. This also fits with the stories from the consumer confidence indexes showing unhappy customers.</p><p>In addition, we have independent data sources like Indeed, showing very weak job listings data and ADP, which show very weak job growth. The January jobs report is an important piece of data pointing in the other direction, but it is just one piece of the puzzle.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-two-big-revisions-in-the-jobs-data-fewer-jobs-and-fewer-people?post=555660\">The Two Big Revisions In The Jobs Data: Fewer Jobs And Fewer People </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-ai-bubble-consumption-is-outrunning-wages?post=554732\">The AI Bubble: Consumption Is Outrunning Wages</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/doing-well-by-doing-good-dump-your-american-stocks?post=554097\">Doing Well By Doing Good: Dump Your American Stocks </a><br/></div>",
