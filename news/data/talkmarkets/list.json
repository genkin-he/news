            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Money, Money Laundering, Seem, Euro Bills, Currency\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/05/31/20/13/money-5244058_960_720.jpg\" width=\"450\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/photos/money-money-laundering-seem-5244058/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em></p><p><br/>Thanks to easing energy base effects – what a snooze, I know – headline inflation in the eurozone has ticked back down from 2.2 to 2.1% again. The European Central Bank calls this ‘the good place’ that it's currently in, illustrating that boring times are the best times for central bankers. It made yesterday’s decision to hold rates quite straightforward, and today’s numbers emphasise that this was probably the right call. Eurozone inflation has moved within 0.2ppt of the 2% target since March, and we don’t expect it to deviate much for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Still, at the ECB press conference yesterday, President Christine Lagarde emphasised the concern around services inflation being persistently too high to balance out downside risks to inflation. Today’s data actually showed a further acceleration in services inflation, from 3.2 to 3.4%. The focus has been a bit more on downside risks to the inflation outlook in recent weeks, which could well push the inflation outlook lower. Today’s data stresses that the risks to the outlook do remain quite balanced, though, and resulted in a still-elevated core inflation rate at 2.4%.</p><p>Inflation is measured on a year-on-year basis, but the shorter-term developments do show a slight pickup of momentum in core inflation on the back of services prices. The three-month rate of core inflation is currently increasing to an annualised 2.7% rate. Then again, selling price expectations for services have eased further, which is a decent predictor of future price developments. For the months ahead, we do expect a further easing of the inflation rate, but not much below the 2% mark. The 'good place’ seems to be with us for some time to come.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/asia-week-ahead-rba-rate-decision-and-key-data-on-china-japan-korea-taiwan-and-philippines?post=532193\">Asia Week Ahead: RBA Rate Decision And Key Data On China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, And Philippines </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/fx-daily-dollar-squeezing-every-bit-of-powells-hawkishness?post=532173\">FX Daily: Dollar Squeezing Every Bit Of Powell’s Hawkishness </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/strong-japanese-industrial-output-and-accelerating-inflation-raise-chances-of-december-rate-hike?post=532152\">Strong Japanese Industrial Output And Accelerating Inflation Raise Chances Of December Rate Hike </a><br/></div>",

The much ballyhooed US-China Trade Deal that has been bantered about for some time looks to become reality tonight – despite weeks of doubt &amp; negative rhetoric! Already, China has bought some small shipments of beans – the first of the season! But the amount China buys from the US is in question – as the mkt has rallied substantially in the past weeks when news of the deal first leaked out! Plus US beans are over South American beans currently! But a deal is certainly really good news for a mkt starved for a continuation of Chinese buying! With harvest well past the half-way point &amp; technical confirmation clearly s<strong>hown</strong> on the above charts, harvest lows are in at the current low historical levels – plus non-China demand for our beans has been strong!</p><p><br/><strong>DEC CORN</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"408\" src=\"https://blog.pricegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_6904d51988bfe.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Despite the fact that the US-China trade deal mostly involves beans, Dec corn was the beneficiary of spillover support – rallying to 4 month highs today! Support also surfaced from a reported grain deal with South Korea! Corn exports are already running 50% over last year -as well, ethanol demand is rising due to rallying energy prices – finally the Fed should be lowering interest rates today – the 2<sup>nd</sup> drop this year – which will apply downward pressure on the US Dollar! Corn is historically cheap – still the lowest on the global mkt!</p><p><br/><strong>DEC WHT</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"408\" src=\"https://blog.pricegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_6904d55a4dc55.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Dec Wht was also the welcome beneficiary of spillover support from the US-China trade deal – plus it’s cheap enough on the world mkt to attract demand!

It turns out his “plan” mostly involves increasing imports from Arg &amp; Brazil by lowering tariffs &amp; opening the US-Mexican border – previously closed due to screw-worm! But now, the mkt has over done it – becoming extremely oversold &amp; today has rallied sharply!

Discovery’s studio and streaming assets</a> adds another bullish layer to its investment case.</p><p>With a market cap north of $470 billion and minimal regulatory baggage, NFLX is well-positioned to execute such a deal – especially compared to Comcast, whose bid could <a href=\"https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/30/why-trump-may-block-comcast-from-buying-wbd/\">face antitrust scrutiny and political resistance</a>.</p><p>Netflix’s clean balance sheet, global footprint, and lack of legacy cable entanglements make it a more palatable buyer.</p><p>If successful, the acquisition would supercharge the streamer’s content moat with HBO’s prestige programming and Warner Bros.’ blockbuster IP, including DC and Harry Potter.</p><p>The strategic fit and deal feasibility make this a credible catalyst for sustainable long-term upside in NFLX stock.</p><h2><br/>Wall Street recommends owning Netflix heading into 2026</h2><p>Finally, <a href=\"https://invezz.com/stocks/netflix/\">Netflix stock</a> are worth buying heading into 2026 also because their valuation has turned much more compelling in recent months.</p><p>Since late June, the mass media and entertainment conglomerate has lost over 15%, compressing its valuation (forward price-to-earnings P/E) multiple enough to make it more attractive relative to its growth profile and strategic momentum.</p><p>Wall Street firms remain bullish as ever on Netflix stock as well.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/NFLX/analyst-ratings\" target=\"_blank\">According to Barchart</a>, consensus rating on the streaming company remains at “moderate buy” – with price targets going as high as $1,600, indicating potential upside of another 40% from here.</p><p>All in all, with a 10-for-1 stock split on deck and a possible WBD acquisition in play, Netflix Inc is positioning itself for a new phase of scale and content dominance.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/why-trump-may-block-comcast-from-buying-wbd?post=532008\">Why Trump May Block Comcast From Buying WBD</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/msft-meta-stock-sink-on-ai-spending-plans-analyst-view-only-one-as-buy?post=531979\">MSFT, META Stock Sink On AI Spending Plans: Analyst View Only One As Buy </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/snap-ceo-downplays-metas-smart-glasses-our-ar-glasses-will-be-infinitely-more-capable?post=531650\">Snap CEO Downplays Meta’s Smart Glasses: ‘Our AR Glasses Will Be Infinitely More Capable’ </a></p></div>",

Despite the <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed\">Federal Reserve</a> (Fed) delivering a widely anticipated interest rate cut <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar\">this week</a> and the Dow posting a new all-time high just north of 48,000, equity markets remain overall unimpressed. Bullish momentum has been thin throughout the week, with disappointment at the Fed’s cautious rate-cutting tone offset by hopes that the latest reignition in trade tensions between the US and China will be tamped down by the Trump administration’s general unwillingness to follow through on its own threats.</p><p>AI spend continues to be both the golden goose and Achilles' heel of the ongoing tech rally. Key tech giants posted strong earnings on the back of eternally growing demand for hardware architecture to meet the bottomless demand for hardware and storage solutions for learning models. However, a notable lack of profit generation at the actual point of contact between AI solution providers and the general market remains worryingly unmovable.</p><h2><br/>AI costs continue to rise, good news for the sellers of shovels</h2><p>Amazon (AMZN) saw a strong Friday rally that single-handedly lifted key indexes into the green for the day, rising after noting a 20% increase in its cloud computing unit’s revenue during the third quarter. On the other side of the same coin, Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) saw some declines through Friday’s American market session after softly revealing that its expenses in the LLM space have ballooned to tens of billions of dollars, with functionally no revenue to show for its continued investment in playing catchup to other, more established competitors who remain as equally unprofitable net of spiraling investment costs.</p><p>The recent flare-up of trade tensions between the US and China appears to have abated for the time being. While nothing is official and no paperwork currently exists, a common trade strategy for the Trump administration, talks between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping appear to have been at least hypothetically successful, with both sides agreeing to cool down recent protectionist threats for a one-year grace period. China has yet to actually remove any of the trade restrictions it recently imposed or make purchases of US agricultural products at the scale it promised to. In exchange, Donald Trump has promised not to impose new tariffs and trade restrictions that have not yet taken effect. How the trade truce will unfold remains to be seen.</p><h2><br/>Dow Jones daily chart</h2><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"392\" src=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feditorial.fxsstatic.com%2Fmiscelaneous%2Fimage-1761936225121-1761936225122.png&amp;w=1536&amp;q=95\" width=\"700\"/></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/gbpusd-tests-six-months-lows-as-pound-sterling-continues-to-sink?post=532044\">GBP/USD Tests Six Months Lows As Pound Sterling Continues To Sink </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/gbpusd-resumes-bearish-ways-as-fed-rate-cut-bolsters-greenback?post=531550\">GBP/USD Resumes Bearish Ways As Fed Rate Cut Bolsters Greenback </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/dow-jones-industrial-average-retreats-after-feds-powell-reconsiders-third-rate-cut?post=531531\">Dow Jones Industrial Average Retreats After Fed’s Powell Reconsiders Third Rate Cut </a></p></div>",

The expected move for next week is still 105 points.</p><p>That combination should terrify you.</p><p>I recorded this breakdown Friday afternoon because the volatility stayed elevated with markets up. That rarely happens. When it does, experienced traders get uncomfortable heading into the weekend.</p><p>Here's what most people missed while celebrating tech earnings:</p><p>The materials sector (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/XLB\">XLB</a>) moved nearly three standard deviations to the downside. That's between 2.5 and 2.8 standard deviations outside its expected move. </p><p>The Russell 2000 hit the lower edge of its expected move. Utilities broke below theirs. Healthcare touched the bottom. Financials did the same.</p><p>Only two sectors held the entire market together. Semiconductors (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/SMH\">SMH</a>) and technology (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/XLK\">XLK</a>) both broke above their upper expected moves. But strip those out and you're looking at Nvidia, Google, Amazon, and Tesla carrying everything. </p><p>Amazon hit a two standard deviation move on earnings. Its expected move was $15. It hit $30 this morning before pulling back.</p><p>The concentration is extreme. Four names are masking broad market weakness.</p><p>Now here's where it gets dangerous. The market rallied this week. The Fed already cut rates. </p><p>We're past the biggest earnings week. Next week has no Fed announcement. No Amazon, Google, Microsoft, or Apple earnings to anticipate.</p><p>The expected move should be contracting. Instead it's sitting at 105 to 107 points. Volatility refuses to crush back down even though the obvious catalysts are gone.</p><p>The market sees something coming.</p><p>I closed three trades this week while this played out:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/XLU\">XLU</a> position closed for 55% profit</li><li><a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/SPY\">SPY</a> in-out spread closed in two days for 30%</li><li>Microsoft earnings flip closed for 297%</li><li>Google earnings flip closed for 203%</li></ul><p>I executed the Microsoft and Google trades live on Wednesday. Anyone could watch. Two out of three hit. The third went worthless but only cost 63 cents.</p><p>But those winning trades don't change what's happening underneath this market. The S&amp;P is up. Most sectors got destroyed. Volatility stayed high. That's a recipe for serious trouble.</p><p>The 30,000-foot view matters more than celebrating today's 40-handle rally. Markets don't crash from all-time highs. But you need to pay attention to what's moving beneath the surface right now.</p><p>Define your risk. Keep it under control.

In short, <strong>my</strong> <a href=\"https://www.goldpriceforecast.com/gold-price-analysis/gold-price-forecast-for-november-2025/\"><strong>gold price forecast for November 2025</strong></a> <strong>remains up-to-date.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Gold Price’s Powerful Monthly Reversal - Image 1\" src=\"https://articlemedia.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2025/10/31/4243/gold-prices-powerful-gold-price-1.webp\"/></p><p><br/>Gold, silver, and miners moved lower today, and miners are leading the way. Taking a closer look at the most recent upswing reveals that miners were the first to move higher, and silver caught up. This is typical for movement in the precious metals sector, and since <a href=\"https://www.goldpriceforecast.com/gold-trading-tips\">silver has already caught up</a>, it seems that the declines can now continue.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Gold Price’s Powerful Monthly Reversal - Image 2\" src=\"https://articlemedia.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2025/10/31/4243/gold-prices-powerful-gold-price-2.webp\"/></p><p><br/>The USD Index is moving higher slowly but surely. It started to move higher after the Fed cut rates – just like it did in September. Back then, it rallied for a few weeks, so it looks like this short-term upswing has only begun.</p><p>But… That’s not even the point. The point is that the USD Index declined severely since April while it should have moved higher given the tariff announcements and then their implementation. Instead, the sentiment kept worsening until it moved to the extreme. Remember my Peak Chaos theory? That the markets already discounted the max amount of chaos and that now they are going to reverse? I wrote about that too early with regard to the precious metals market, but it worked like a charm for the USD Index.</p><p>Anyway, just like I wrote yesterday – when the rally in the USD Index finally becomes obvious to everyone, the PMs can truly slide.

What indicators do we have for the state of the macroeconomy? Here’s one: delinquincies on auto loans (for pools of asset backed securities).</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://econbrowser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fitch_autodelinq_abs_sep25a.png\" width=\"663\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/structured-finance/abs/auto-indices#u.s.-auto-indices\">Fitch</a>, accessed 10/31/2025.</em></p><p><br/>Auto loan delinquencies (60+ days) on pools of loans in subprime ABS have surged to 6.5% in September. Since there appears to be seasonality, it’s useful to compare against September 2024: 6.12%. (Delinquency rates for the prime ABS pool is relatively unchanged over the year, at 0.37%).</p><p>The ABS deliquency rate is much higher than at any period of the 2007-09 recession, and higher than on the eve of the Covid recession, arguably when the economy was slowing drastically.</p><p>The annualized net loss (ANL) index is slightly down, 9.41 vs. 9.79 in September of 2024. This index is partly supported by the increase in used car prices, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/rising-auto-loan-delinquencies-and-high-monthly-payments-20240926.html?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">Manheim Index</a>, which has risen from 202.96 to 207.03, or 2%, over the corresponding period.</p><p>Is the delinquency rate of use in predicting an incipient recession? If the characteristics of the loans were constant, perhaps so. However, as <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/rising-auto-loan-delinquencies-and-high-monthly-payments-20240926.html?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">Adams et al. (2024)</a> point out, the post-Covid loans were of larger size than for previous origination years, and this factor appears to be an important factor in delinquencies. Hence, I would be wary of extrapolating from previous episodes the predictive power of the delinquency rate, at least in levels.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/aca-premiums-without-extension-of-expanded-tax-credit?post=532033\">ACA Premiums Without Extension Of Expanded Tax Credit </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/trump-china-to-buy-a-tremendous-amount-of-soybeans?post=531998\">Trump: China To Buy A “Tremendous” Amount Of Soybeans </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/everyday-prices-up-22-since-jan-2025?post=531492\">Everyday Prices Up 2.2% Since Jan. 2025 </a></p></div>",

FCF, which represents the cash remaining after a business meets its operational costs and capital investments, serves as a key barometer of company quality.</p><p>The S&amp;P Quality FCF Aristocrats Indices were initially introduced across two universes: the <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/dividends-factors/sp-500-quality-fcf-aristocrats-index\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> Quality FCF Aristocrats Index</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/dividends-factors/sp-developed-quality-fcf-aristocrats-index\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P Developed Quality FCF Aristocrats Index</a>, which both require positive FCF for at least 10 consecutive years. Both indices have outperformed their respective benchmark universes over the one-year period since their launch and on a YTD basis in 2025. The S&amp;P 500 Quality FCF Aristocrats Index notably outperformed during the tariff-related drawdowns, while the S&amp;P Developed Quality FCF Aristocrats Index saw a slightly higher drawdown, reflecting the different responses to the economic backdrop across regions.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"191\" src=\"https://www.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Exhibit-1-Performance-of-the-SP-Quality-FCF-Aristocrats-Indices-940x310.png\" width=\"580\"/></p><p><br/>Over the long term, including hypothetical back-tested performance, both indices have consistently outperformed their benchmark universes, demonstrating strong absolute terms as well as impressive risk-adjusted performance.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"626\" src=\"https://www.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Exhibit-2-Back-Tested-RiskPerformance-Profiles.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>An analysis of these indices across various <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/education/article/a-historical-perspective-on-factor-index-performance-across-macroeconomic-cycles/\" target=\"_blank\">macroeconomic</a> environments, including hypothetical back-tested performance, shows that they have excelled in a range of regimes characterized by rising and falling inflation and growth. Historically, the S&amp;P Developed Quality FCF Aristocrats Index outperformed or matched the S&amp;P Developed Large MidCap in all four environments.

Record-high cocoa prices are squeezing margins and threatening to push candy prices higher, even as companies like Mondelez and Hershey navigate shifting consumer behavior and input cost volatility. While some players are signaling resilience through revenue growth and strong StarMine model scores, analysts remain cautious on earnings surprises.</p><p>At the same time, retailers are leaning on aggressive discounting strategies to spur demand for costumes and décor. The discount penetration for costumes and accessories has surged to 83%, with average discounts at 36%, the highest since pre-pandemic levels, suggesting aggressive promotional strategies to drive demand.</p><h3><br/><strong>Trick or treat</strong></h3><p>Consumers may be spooked by higher chocolate prices this Halloween as record cocoa costs continue to pressure margins. Rising input costs are likely to translate into higher prices for smaller-sized Halloween candy bars.</p><p>Mondelez International, with brands such as Sour Patch Kids and Cadbury, just beat third-quarter earnings and revenue estimates despite the impact of cocoa cost inflation. CEO Dirk Van de Put noted: “Although we anticipate challenging conditions to continue in some markets, we are encouraged by recent moderation in cocoa prices, as well as promising signs for a strong cocoa crop this fall.” (Source: Mondelez International Q3 2025 Earnings Release)</p><p>The company is on track to deliver 13.4% earnings growth and 8.2% revenue growth in Q4 2025, which includes the Halloween season (Exhibit 1).</p><p><strong>Exhibit 1: Mondelez Revenue and Earnings Results/Estimates: 2019 – 2025</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"82\" src=\"https://lipperalpha.refinitiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture1-2.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: LSEG I/B/E/S data</em></p><p><br/>However, analysts surveyed by LSEG remain cautious. Consensus Q4 EPS stands at $0.74, but a five-star rated analyst with a strong accuracy record has issued a Bold Estimate of $0.67, below the mean, suggesting a potential earnings miss and negative surprise.</p><p>The StarMine SmartEstimate is a weighted average of analyst estimates, with more weight given to more recent estimates and more accurate analysts. Our studies have shown that when the SmartEstimate differs from the consensus (I/B/E/S mean) by more than 2%, the company is likely to post subsequent earnings surprises directionally correct 70% of the time. This percentage difference is referred to as the Predicted Surprise (PS%) (Exhibit 2).</p><p><br/><strong>Exhibit 2: Mondelez International StarMine SmartEstimate and Predicted Surprise %: 2025</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://lipperalpha.refinitiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture2-2.png\" width=\"367\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: LSEG Workspace</em></p><h3><br/><strong>Hershey’s seasonal slowdown challenge</strong></h3><p>Meanwhile, Hershey announced in its latest earnings release that margins were pressured by higher input costs. CEO Kirk Tanner also cautioned that the Halloween shopping season has started slower than expected, citing unseasonably warm weather and delayed purchases as the holiday falls on a Friday.</p><p>Despite these headwinds, Hershey remains on track to deliver its third consecutive quarter of positive revenue growth, including Halloween-related sales in Q4 2025 (Exhibit 3). However, elevated input costs, softness in Mexico and weaker Halloween performance are expected to weigh on profitability, with earnings projected to decline 41.4% for the quarter.</p><p><br/><strong>Exhibit 3: Hershey Revenue and Earnings Results/Estimates: 2019 – 2025</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"83\" src=\"https://lipperalpha.refinitiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture3-1.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: LSEG I/B/E/S data</em></p><p>Hershey ranks in the top quartile across several StarMine models, including Earnings Quality, Smart Holdings, and Analyst Revisions. The company’s StarMine Earnings Quality Score stands at 76, indicating that reported earnings are derived from sustainable sources (Exhibit 4).</p><p>Additionally, Hershey scores an impressive 87 on the Analyst Revisions Model, which forecasts future estimate changes and price movements, suggesting analysts maintain a bullish outlook on the confectioner. The StarMine Smart Holdings Model further reinforces positive sentiment, reflecting strong buy-side interest in the stock.</p><p><br/><strong>Exhibit 4: Hershey’s StarMine Model Scores</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"236\" src=\"https://lipperalpha.refinitiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture4-1.png\" width=\"465\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: LSEG Workspace.</em></p><h3><br/><strong>Tootsie Roll Industries</strong></h3><p>Tootsie Roll, a perennial Halloween favorite with over a century of history, continues to attract buy-side optimism. The StarMine Smart Holdings Model signals growing investor confidence, supported by strong fundamentals such as robust interest coverage and healthy return on assets (ROA) making the stock an appealing investment candidate. Year-to-date, Tootsie Roll shares have gained 11.28%.</p><p>Credit quality remains another bright spot. Tootsie Roll scores 84 out of 100 in the StarMine Credit Risk – SmartRatios Model, the most comprehensive credit risk framework in the StarMine suite (Exhibit 5). This model integrates insights from three proprietary approaches: Text Mining Credit Risk Model, Credit Risk – SmartRatios Model and Credit Risk – Structural Model, delivering a consolidated view of the company’s creditworthiness.</p><p><br/><strong>Exhibit 5: Tootsie Roll StarMine Model Scores</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://lipperalpha.refinitiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture5-1.png\" width=\"624\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: LSEG Workspace.</em></p><h3><br/><strong>Halloween discounts</strong></h3><p>In collaboration with Centric Market Intelligence, LSEG found that the discount penetration, the percentage of Halloween-related costumes and accessories on sale, has risen to 83%, up from 76% last year (Exhibit 6).</p><p>The average discount for these items is now 36%, marking the strongest level since pre-pandemic years. This indicates that retailers are offering more Halloween apparel at deeper discounts, betting that value-driven pricing will spur demand for costumes and accessories.</p><p><strong>Exhibit 6: Avg. Discount and Discount Penetration for Halloween Costumes &amp; Accessories</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"392\" src=\"https://lipperalpha.refinitiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture6-1-scaled.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: Centric Market Intelligence Co.</em></p><p><br/>Despite these higher discounts, consumer demand for Halloween costumes remains muted compared to last year.

For last-minute shoppers, this translates into a broader selection of merchandise on sale compared to previous years. However, average discount rates for home décor remain largely unchanged from prior Halloweens, indicating retailers are maintaining pricing discipline despite increased promotional activity.</p><p><br/><strong>Exhibit 8: Avg Discount &amp; Discount Penetration for Halloween Home Decorations</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><img alt=\"\" height=\"392\" src=\"https://lipperalpha.refinitiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture8-1-scaled.png\" width=\"700\"/></strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: Centric Market Intelligence Co.</em></p><p><br/>The fact that more than half of Halloween home décor items are on sale appears to be supporting demand. As of October to date, 21% of online Halloween décor is completely sold out, the highest level since 2019 (30%) (Exhibit 9).

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"316\" src=\"https://talkmarkets.com/user_content/ckimages/orig_33756576485_224a26afe9_c.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source:</em> <a href=\"https://www.gotcredit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.gotcredit.com</a><em> via <a href=\"https://flickr.com/photos/gotcredit/33756576485\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr</a></em></p><p><br/>In an industry where IPOs are typically driven by funding gaps, investor pressure, or fast-moving acquisitions, Nexus International is scripting a different story. The company’s plan to go public in March 2027 doesn’t hinge on raising capital; it’s about upgrading infrastructure. </p><p>With $847.9 million in revenue already booked by Q3 2025 and on track for $1 billion by year’s end, Nexus is proving that scale and sustainability can be achieved long before listing.</p><h2><br/>Nexus International’s revenue benchmarks and IPO plans</h2><p>Nexus’s Founder and CEO Gurhan Kiziloz has confirmed that the IPO will move forward only once the company hits $5 billion in annual revenue. But that threshold is more than just a number; it’s a filtering mechanism. It signals to markets that Nexus will enter the public sphere from a position of operational maturity and financial strength, not speculation or future projections.</p><p>Nexus International’s growth has unfolded without external capital, without venture dilution, and without noise. Its expansion has been fueled by reinvested earnings across three distinct brands, Spartans.com, Megaposta, and Lanistar, each tailored to specific market needs and compliance regimes. The result is a gaming operator already among the Top 100 worldwide, built entirely from within.</p><p>For Kiziloz, that independence is strategic. “We’re not listing to raise money. We’re listing because we’ve outgrown the advantages of being private,” he has explained in internal communications. That means the IPO is not an endpoint; it’s an evolution of Nexus’s operating structure to better support its expanding partnerships, global regulatory compliance, and long-term accountability.</p><h2><br/>Public listing for evolution, not expansion</h2><p>Going public will not mark the start of Nexus’s global push; it will simply make its infrastructure more transparent, auditable, and partnership-ready. In markets such as Latin America, Southeast Asia, and parts of Europe, being a publicly listed company can fast-track licensing, enable deeper payment integrations, and enhance brand credibility with institutions and regulators.</p><p>Rather than change the way Nexus operates, the IPO is expected to formalize it. The company already tracks metrics, growth, and treasury management with the discipline of a listed entity. The transition to public markets will simply add layers of governance without stripping away control. Gurhan Kiziloz will remain at the helm, preserving the founder-led agility that has made Nexus one of the gaming sector’s breakout performers.</p><p>Setting the $5B bar serves multiple purposes. First, it creates a timing filter that prevents Nexus from rushing into the public spotlight under pressure. Second, it protects the company’s valuation story; markets will be reacting to performance, not promises. Finally, it places Nexus among the upper tier of gaming companies by the time of listing, ensuring that its IPO is not just viable, but competitive with major names in the space.</p><p>Reaching $5 billion also means Nexus will likely enter the public markets with positive cash flow, diversified brand exposure, proven international presence, and a licensing footprint that spans traditional and crypto-friendly jurisdictions.</p><p>Few gaming companies today can claim this trajectory: bootstrapped origins, multi-brand global presence, near-billion-dollar earnings, and a path to IPO with the founder still fully in control. In a space dominated by acquisitions, VC backing, and rapid consolidation, Nexus stands out for its execution-first discipline.</p><p>Kiziloz has opted for a long-game strategy, prioritizing structure over speed and substance over headlines. It’s a bet that’s already paying off, and if the $5B IPO plan holds, Nexus International will be one of the few operators to go public without ever needing to go external.</p><h2><br/>The 2027 IPO as a statement of maturity</h2><p>The planned March 2027 IPO isn’t just a milestone for Nexus, it’s a statement. It signals that scale, credibility, and institutional readiness don’t have to come at the cost of independence. </p><p>With $847.9 million in revenue already earned this year and brand momentum across Spartans.com and Megaposta accelerating, the company isn’t preparing to go public to find its future. It’s doing it because its future has already been built, and the infrastructure just needs to catch up.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/microsoft-stock-sinks-on-ai-spending?post=532007\">Microsoft Stock Sinks On AI Spending? </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/one-of-the-best-ai-stocks-just-got-better-after-blowout-earnings?post=531538\">One Of The Best AI Stocks Just Got Better After Blowout Earnings</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/ai-bubble-ark-invests-cathie-wood-weighs-in?post=531157\">AI Bubble?

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Cutout paper illustration representing scheme and Stocks inscription\" height=\"293\" src=\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/5849595/pexels-photo-5849595.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=1&amp;w=500\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/cutout-paper-illustration-representing-scheme-and-stocks-inscription-5849595/\" target=\"_blank\">Pexels</a></em></p><p><br/>The UK stock market's benchmark index, the FTSE 100, is taking a hit on Friday, diving into negative territory, largely due to turmoil in the banking sector. After a remarkable nine-day winning streak, the index is set to end the day on a disappointing note. With no fresh economic data or earnings reports to energise the market, investors are adopting a cautious stance. Many are trimming their positions, wary of potential pitfalls ahead. The atmosphere is tense, as traders reassess their strategies amidst growing uncertainty. Market sentiment is decidedly jittery, and all eyes are on upcoming developments that could shift the tides. Will new economic indicators or corporate earnings reports provide the spark needed to revive confidence? Only time will tell, but for now, the FTSE 100 is feeling the pressure.</p><p>The Bank of England's November rate decision could be compelling for markets, as it may end the trend of quarterly cuts, but the outcome appears finely balanced. Gilt yields and the value of sterling have decreased following indications that UK inflation may have peaked. Additionally, speculation around the budget is intensifying, with rumours of more significant downgrades from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) regarding productivity. Meanwhile, delays in US data have shifted attention to the upcoming ADP and ISM releases for insights into the labour market.</p><p>Data from the Nationwide Building Society revealed that UK house prices rose at a slower rate in October as buyers became more cautious ahead of the budget announcement. The monthly increase in house prices was 0.3% in October, down from a 0.5% rise the previous month, according to the report. However, this figure exceeded the expectation of no growth. Year-over-year, house price growth unexpectedly quickened to 2.4%, up from 2.2% in September, surpassing economists' predictions of a 2.3% annual increase.</p><p>In the latest updates from UK businesses, TT Electronics Plc has turned down three unsolicited takeover bids from private equity firm DBAY Advisors in the past three months. The most recent offer from DBAY valued the company at 130 pence per share. However, on Friday, the British company announced its preference for a higher bid of 155 pence per share from Swiss-based Cicor Technologies, which was revealed just a day earlier. Cicor's proposal comes with a 19% premium over DBAY’s latest offer, making it the more attractive option.</p><p>Meanwhile, Moonpig Group has named Catherine Faiers as its new Chief Executive Officer. Faiers, currently serving as Chief Operating Officer at Auto Trader, will take the reins of the online greeting card and gift retailer after Nickyl Raithatha steps down from the role. Moonpig had previously announced in June that Raithatha would be departing as CEO, paving the way for Faiers to lead the company’s next chapter.</p><p><br/><strong>Technical &amp; Trade View</strong></p><p>FTSE Bias: Bullish Above Bearish below 9704</p><ul><li>Primary support 9500</li><li>Below 9600 opens 9500</li><li>Primary objective 9873</li><li>Daily VWAP Bullish</li><li>Weekly VWAP Bullish</li></ul><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"> </p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/daily-market-outlook-friday-oct-31?post=532174\">Daily Market Outlook - Friday, Oct. 31</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/the-ftse-finish-line-thursday-oct-30?post=532004\">The FTSE Finish Line - Thursday, Oct. 30</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/daily-market-outlook-thursday-oct-30?post=531756\">Daily Market Outlook - Thursday, Oct. 30</a><br/></div>",

AI Deal With Perplexity Boosts Shares\" height=\"279\" src=\"https://tokenist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/110803904_m-646x360.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://123rf.com/\">123rf.com</a></em></p><p><br/>Getty Images Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GETY\">GETY</a>) experienced a dramatic surge in trading on October 31, 2025, following the <a href=\"https://investors.gettyimages.com/news-releases/news-release-details/getty-images-and-perplexity-strike-multi-year-image-partnership\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> of a multi-year licensing partnership with AI-powered search engine Perplexity. The stock jumped over 50% in <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/investing/how-to-trade-after-hours/\">pre-market trading</a>, reaching $3.10, as investors responded enthusiastically to the strategic collaboration.</p><p>This agreement marks a significant milestone for Getty Images as it positions itself at the intersection of traditional visual content licensing and emerging AI technology, addressing ongoing concerns about content attribution and creator compensation in the age of artificial intelligence.</p><h3><br/><strong>AI Licensing Agreement Expands Getty’s Reach and Reinforces Content Attribution</strong></h3><p>The global multi-year licensing agreement provides Perplexity with access to Getty Images’ extensive library of high-quality creative and editorial imagery, which will be integrated into Perplexity’s AI-powered search and discovery platform. According to Nick Unsworth, Vice President of Strategic Development at Getty Images, the partnership acknowledges the importance of properly attributed content and its value in enhancing AI-powered products. The agreement leverages Getty Images’ API technology, allowing deep integration into Perplexity’s content creation and display workflows.</p><p>A critical component of the deal focuses on improving content attribution and creator recognition. Jessica Chan, Head of Content and Publisher Partnerships at Perplexity, emphasized that attribution and accuracy are fundamental to how people should understand information in the age of AI. The partnership will implement enhanced image display features, including image credits with links to sources, to better educate users on legal imagery usage. This approach addresses growing concerns about AI platforms using copyrighted content without proper compensation or attribution to original creators.</p><p>The strategic significance extends beyond immediate revenue, positioning Getty Images as a leader in establishing ethical AI content partnerships. With Perplexity answering over 150 million questions globally each week, the exposure for Getty’s content and contributors could be substantial. The agreement demonstrates how traditional content companies can successfully monetize their assets in the AI era while maintaining creator rights and attribution standards.</p><h3><br/><strong>Shares Spike on Heavy Volume as Investors React to AI Collaboration</strong></h3><p>As of 11:30 AM EDT on October 31, 2025, Getty Images stock was trading at $2.2799, up $0.2699 or 13.43% from the previous close of $2.01. The stock opened at $3.06 and experienced significant volatility throughout the day, with a trading range between $2.20 and $3.21. Trading volume exploded to 104.8 million shares, dramatically exceeding the average volume of 667,871 shares. The market capitalization stood at approximately $950.4 million following the announcement.</p><p>Despite today’s surge, Getty Images has faced challenges over longer time periods. The stock has declined 44.79% over the past year and 76.69% over five years, significantly underperforming the <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/investing/spx-vs-spy/\">S&amp;P 500’s</a> gains of 20.38% and 110.04% respectively. The company currently trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 0.91 and maintains a 52-week range between $1.25 and $4.485. Analysts maintain an average price target of $4.43, suggesting potential upside from current levels.</p><p>The company’s financial fundamentals reflect ongoing challenges, with a negative profit margin of 12.19% and diluted <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/investing/how-to-value-a-stock/\">earnings per share</a> of -$0.27. However, Getty Images generated $946.83 million in revenue over the trailing twelve months and posted positive levered free cash flow of $96.59 million. The upcoming Q3 2025 earnings report scheduled for November 10, 2025, will provide further insight into the company’s financial trajectory and the potential impact of strategic partnerships like the Perplexity deal.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/chevron-reports-mixed-q3-2025-results-earnings-beat-but-revenue-misses?post=532290\">Chevron Reports Mixed Q3 2025 Results, Earnings Beat But Revenue Misses</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/exxonmobil-delivers-solid-q3-2025-results?post=532229\">ExxonMobil Delivers Solid Q3 2025 Results</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/the-ai-arms-dealer-nvidias-path-to-5-trillion-and-beyond?post=531990\">The AI Arms Dealer: Nvidia’s Path To $5 Trillion And Beyond</a><br/></div>",

The company returned to profitability and the strong results helped drive the stock 6% up in the after-hours trading session.</p><h3><br/><strong>Intel’s Financials</strong></h3><p>For the quarter, revenues grew 3% over the year to $13.65 billion, ahead of the market’s estimates of $13.14 billion. It ended the quarter with an adjusted EPS of $0.23. Intel recorded a per-share loss of 37 cents in the quarter to account for shares in escrow that will be released to the U.S. government as part of its investment.</p><p>By segment, Intel’s Client Computing Group, which is primarily comprised of sales of central processors for PCs, saw revenues grow 3% to $8.5 billion. Revenue in the Data Center Group, which includes some AI chips, fell 1% to $4.1 billion. Foundry revenues were down 2% to $4.2 billion. Other revenues grew 3% to $1.0 billion.</p><p>For the current quarter, Intel expects revenues of $12.8-$13.8 billion, with the mid-point ahead of the market estimates of $13.37 billion. It expects to earn $0.08 per share for the quarter in line with the market estimates.</p><h3><br/><strong>Intel’s AI Focus</strong></h3><p>These have been interesting few months for Intel. Besides the U.S. government announcing its $8.9 billion investment and the $5 billion that it received from Nvidia, Softbank invested $2 billion and it sold its stake in chipmaker Altera for $5.2 billion.</p><p>Intel is focused on leveraging its latest tie-up with Nvidia to accelerate its AI push. Its core x86 franchise is playing a critical role in its AI strategy. x86 is well-positioned to power the hybrid compute environment that AI workloads demand. The collaboration with Nvidia is helping Intel create a new class of products spanning multiple generations that accelerate the adoption of AI for the hyperscale, enterprise, and consumer markets. By integrating architectures through Nvidia NVLink, Intel will combine Intel CPU and x86 leadership with Nvidia’s AI and computing strengths to offer solutions that can deliver better customer experiences.</p><p>Intel realizes the need for a focused effort on the initiative, and recently created a central engineering group that will unify its horizontal engineering functions to drive leverage across foundational IP development, test chip design, EDA tools, and design platforms. The group will also lead the build-out of a new ASIC and design service business to deliver purpose-built silicon for external customers. This will extend the reach of core x86 IP but also leverage design strengths to deliver solutions from general-purpose to fixed-function computing.</p><p>Earlier this month, Intel announced that its fabrication plant in Chandler, Arizona, known as Fab 52, is now operational. Codenamed Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest, these SKUs will begin shipping late this year. If successful, these new CPUs will put Intel’s chipmaking capabilities in direct competition with TSMC. Intel is yet to disclose the expected yields from Fab 52. Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest are expected to also help Intel solidify its position in the notebook segment across both consumer and enterprise. Intel will still need to secure a large customer for its foundry chips to accelerate margins.</p><p>For its AI accelerator strategy, Intel is focused on developing compute platforms for emerging inference workloads driven by agentic AI and physical AI. In the shorter term, it will deliver AI capabilities through Xeon, AI PCs, ARC GPUs, and its open software stack. In the longer run, it plans to launch generations of inference-optimized GPUs on an annual cadence that will offer enhanced memory and bandwidth to meet enterprise needs.</p><p>Intel’s stock has climbed over 90% since the Trump government announced its plans earlier this summer. Its stock is trading at $40.16 with a market cap of $191.40 billion. It hit a 52-week high of $42.47 earlier this week. The stock has climbed from the 52-week low of $17.67 that it was trading at in April this year.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/cloud-stocks-microsoft-and-openai-resolve-partnership-woes-agi-timeline-3-8-years?post=531997\">Cloud Stocks: Microsoft And OpenAI Resolve Partnership Woes; AGI Timeline 3-8 Years</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/cloud-socks-analysis-of-ibms-cognitus-acquisition?post=530304\">Cloud Socks: Analysis Of IBM’s Cognitus Acquisition</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/netflix-continues-to-monetize-beyond-streaming?post=529815\">Netflix Continues To Monetize Beyond Streaming </a><br/></div>",

Despite the modest recovery, Crude Oil prices remain on track for their third consecutive monthly decline as persistent oversupply concerns limit upside potential ahead of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) meeting on Sunday.</p><p>According to recent reports relayed by Reuters, eight OPEC+ members are preparing to increase output by a combined 137,000 barrels per day (bpd) in December as part of their effort to regain lost market share. In addition, Saudi Arabia’s exports reached a six-month high of 6.41 million barrels per day in August, while the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that the United States (US) Crude output climbed to a record 13.6 million barrels per day last week.</p><p>These developments have largely offset the potential bullish impact of Washington’s new sanctions on major Russian Oil producers. Traders report that Indian Oil Corp recently purchased five cargoes of Russian Oil for December delivery from non-sanctioned suppliers, signaling continued resilience in Russian exports despite Western pressure.</p><p>On the geopolitical front, the announcement by US President Donald Trump that China agreed to purchase American energy, including future Oil and Gas shipments from Alaska, has lent limited support to sentiment.

Analysts had been expecting around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN/earnings\" target=\"_blank\">$177.76 billion</a> in quarterly sales, according to Seeking Alpha, but it came in at $180.17 billion, up 13% YoY.</p><p>Moreover, its trailing 12-month (TTM) operating cash flow (OCF) remained strong, with 16% Y/Y growth, and its TTM OCF margin on revenue was 19%. That implies its future value could be higher. This article will show why it could be up to 26% too cheap.</p><p>As a result, <a href=\"https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AMZN/overview\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>AMZN</strong></a> stock is up over 10% in morning trading on Friday, Oct. 31, at <a href=\"https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AMZN/overview\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>$246.24</strong></a> per share. That gives it a market capitalization of <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>$2.631 trillion</strong></a>, based on 10.687 billion shares outstanding as of Oct. 30.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"392\" src=\"https://barchart-news-media-prod.aws.barchart.com/EXCLSV/803b75e5897586f4c189f8ef6eee7a5d/2hebbgwmn0yuyvok.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AMZN/overview\" target=\"_blank\">AMZN stock - last 3 months - Barchart - As of Oct. 31, 2025 midday</a></p><h2><br/><strong>Free Cash Flow Impacted By Heavy Capex Spending</strong></h2><p>However, the company's FCF growth was 69% lower than last year at <strong>$14.788 billion</strong>, albeit still positive on a TTM basis. That means that, based on the TTM revenue of<a href=\"https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/amzn/financials/?p=trailing\" target=\"_blank\"> $691.33 billion</a>, from Stock Analysis data, its FCF margin was 2.139%.</p><p>This is because Amazon is continuing to spend heavily on capex related to AI-driven projects, such as data centers.</p><p>For example, in the capex has risen from $102.953 billion last quarter (over the trailing 12-month period) to $115.9 billion in Q3 (again on a TTM basis). That's a huge +12.6% gain in spending in one quarter (over the last 12 months).</p><p>Amazon believes this spending of its operating cash flow will eventually pay off. Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/31/amazon-amzn-stock-earnings-revenue-ai-cloud.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC reported </a>that some analysts are bullish on Amazon's AWS (data centers) segment.</p><p>This is driven by Amazon's higher revenue and operating margins. For example, its Q3 TTM OCF of $130.691 billion, representing 18.9% of TTM sales, was higher than Q2's 18.1% TTM margin. This higher margin growth can be seen in the table from <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf#page=10\" target=\"_blank\">page 10 of Amazon's Q3 release</a> below (and my analysis of the OCF and FCF margins):</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://barchart-news-media-prod.aws.barchart.com/EXCLSV/803b75e5897586f4c189f8ef6eee7a5d/ktqw1ty12l7i3fux.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf#page=10\" target=\"_blank\">AMZN Q3 earninjgs release - page 10 - and Hake margin analysis - Oct. 30, 2025</a></p><p><br/>It shows that even though the operating cash flow margins have been rising each quarter, the FCF margins are lower consecutively as a result of accelerating capex spending. In fact, the company said it expects 2025 capex will rise even further to $125 billion, up from $116 billion on a TTM basis in Q3.</p><p>The reason is Amazon told investors, according <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/amazon-amzn-q3-earnings-report-2025-553e6d16#phrase-company\" target=\"_blank\">to the WSJ</a>, that demand for its cloud and AI products has “outpaced its ability to bring new data centers online.” Until that demand cools off, it's likely to continue to amp up its capital spending. That will depress its FCF margins in the near term.</p><p>But as long as its OCF margins stay strong - and they should as the capex spending pays off over time - the stock could continue to improve.</p><h2><br/><strong>Forecasting Operating Cash Flow and a Price Target</strong></h2><p>For example, let's use analysts' forecasts of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN/earnings\" target=\"_blank\">$785.38 billion</a> in revenue next year, and assume Amazon's OCF margin rises from 18.9% to <strong>20.79%</strong> FCF margin (i.e., up 10%):</p><p> $785.38 x 0.2079 = <strong>$163.28 billion</strong> operating cash flow</p><p>That would be $47.4 billion higher than its Q3 TTM cash flow of $115.9 billion, or an increase of +40.9%.</p><p>Moreover, assuming that Amazon spends $130 billion on capex next year, its FCF could rise to over $33 billion:</p><p>$163.28 - $130 b capex = <strong>$33.28 billion</strong> FCF</p><p>Assuming that the market gives AMZN stock a 1.0% FCF yield, even though its TTM FCF yield is about half that at 0.56% (i.e., $14.788b/$2,631 billion):</p><p>$33.28 billion / 0.01 = <strong>$3,328 billion</strong> market value</p><p>That is 26.5% higher than today's market value of $2,631 billion.</p><p>In other words, AMZN stock could be worth 26.5% higher than today's price of $246.24, or <strong>$311.50</strong> per share.</p><h2><br/><strong>Analysts See Higher Price Targets for AMZN</strong></h2><p>Some analysts have begun raising their price targets for AMZN stock. For example, the average of 67 analysts' price targets surveyed by Yahoo! Finance is now <strong>$280.77</strong> per share.</p><p>Moreover, Barchart's survey shows a mean price of <a href=\"https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AMZN/analyst-ratings\" target=\"_blank\">$268.84,</a> and AnaChart's survey of 41 analysts is <a href=\"https://anachart.com/ticker/amzn/\" target=\"_blank\">$260.94</a>.</p><p>The bottom line is that even after today's jump in AMZN stock, its value could be higher over the coming year. This could be due to higher demand for its cloud and AI products.</p><p>One way to play this for value investors is to set a lower buy-in price by selling short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options.</p><h2><br/><strong>Shorting OTM Puts for a Lower Potential Buy-In</strong></h2><p>For example, the <a href=\"https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AMZN/options?expiration=2025-11-28-w\" target=\"_blank\">Nov. 28 expiry</a> period shows that the $235.00 put option contract has a midpoint premium of $3.20.</p><p>That works out to an immediate short-selling put yield of <strong>1.36%</strong> (i.e., $3.20/$135.00). This is for an exercise price that is $10 lower, or -4.43% below the trading price.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"378\" src=\"https://barchart-news-media-prod.aws.barchart.com/EXCLSV/803b75e5897586f4c189f8ef6eee7a5d/t6wnbw0ubiiqpfjb.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AMZN/options?expiration=2025-11-28-w\" target=\"_blank\">AMZN puts expiring 11/28/25 - as of Oct. 31, 2025</a></p><p><br/>Moreover, it provides a potentially lower all-in buying point, after including the income received:</p><p>$235.00 - $3.20 = $231.80 breakeven point</p><p>That is 5.73% below today's price. The point is that a patient investor can collect the 1.36% yield while waiting for AMZN to fall 4.4% to set a 5.73% lower buy-in point.</p><p>That also could potentially provide better upside:</p><p>$311.50 / $231.80 breakeven -1 = 0.3438 = +34.38% upside</p><p>The bottom line is that AMZN stock still looks cheap, and shorting OTM puts is an attractive way to play it.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/options/huge-unusual-options-activity-in-nokia-after-nvidia-takes-1-billion-stake?post=531530\">Huge, Unusual Options Activity In Nokia After Nvidia Takes $1 Billion Stake</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/options/ibm-raises-its-fcf-outlook-for-2025-ibm-stock-could-be-undervalued?post=531133\">IBM Raises Its FCF Outlook For 2025 - IBM Stock Could Be Undervalued</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/options/lam-research-corps-strong-fcf-margins-from-ai-related-chip-equipment-sales-shows-lrcx-stock-is-cheap?post=530811\">Lam Research Corp's Strong FCF Margins From AI-Related Chip Equipment Sales Shows LRCX Stock Is Cheap</a><br/></div>",

The main drag was in renewable diesel and other biofuels – such as SAF and renewable propane – where capacity increased by just 391 million gallons per year, a fraction of the gains in prior years. Most growth came from two California projects: Phillips 66’s Rodeo refinery conversion (now 767 Mil Gal/year) and a new 138 Mil Gal/Year Bakersfield plant by Renewable Fuels LLC. Several facility closures partly offset those gains. The slowdown reflects weak biofuel margins and a lack of forward EPA policy visibility. RVO and SRE decisions by the EPA could be put off until 2026. Ethanol production capacity, however, expanded modestly – mainly in the Midwest – reaching 18.5 Bil Gal annually and now comprising about 73% of total US biofuel capacity. With domestic demand stabilizing, most of the additional ethanol output will be directed towards exports.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"green grass\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1565522734001-f00e62ec8424?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" width=\"450\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><small><em>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@waldemarbrandt67w?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\">Waldemar</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/nCQXxsSg3oo?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></em></small></p><p><br/><strong>US Weather Pattern Update</strong></p><p>Extreme Drought Present in IL, IN &amp; OH; Soil Moisture Improved Elsewhere:</p><p>On balance, the coverage of Central US drought continues to erode. Recent soaking rainfall has nearly eliminated drought from the Delta region, TN, and southern MI. Extreme/exceptional drought remains in place across pockets of E Midwest, but moisture improvement is expected in OH/PA over the next 48 hours. The change in drought coverage/intensity over the last 12 months is striking, particularly with respect to moisture available to winter wheat. ARC notes drought in late October 2024 covered 72-85% of Southern Plains, but today only covers 4-12% of TX, OK, and KS. The primary concern heading into late autumn/winter are negative soil moisture anomalies across the PNW.  Similar to Argentina &amp; Southern Brazil, a weal La Nina has not negatively impacted precipitation patterns across TX and the Sothern US. La Nina ends before December.</p><p><br/><strong>Corn Comments &amp; Analysis</strong></p><p>Corn Drops as it was Excluded from US/China Trade Deal:</p><p>CBOT corn futures ended lower with South American fob markets heavy and lack of new bullish input. There’s no sign of Chinese demand for US corn, nor a sign China needs feed grains this crop year. China has been loath to secure Brazilian or Argentine corn for import amid its own domestic oversupply. Spot Dalian corn settled at $2.96/MT, down from $298 last week and $3.10 in late October 2024. Corn import margins into China are nonexistent. Recall China bought no corn from any origin in the 24/25 crop year, is a repeat ahead? Dec CBOT’s failure to breach its 200-day moving average sets up a test of $4.10-$4.16 in November – a seasonally bearish month for corn. ARC maintains that the weather in Argentina &amp; Southern Brazil into January will dominate corn price discovery. 30% of Argentina’s corn will be near pollination without water issues – and there’s no sign of lasting dryness into mid-November. CBOT corn rallies will struggle with 1<sup>st</sup> Notice Day against December. ARC argues that large nearby US corn exports reflect frontloaded demand from traditional buyers. Catch-up sales/hedges on any modest rally with resistance above $4.50 March.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/china-to-resume-soybean--other-ag-purchases-the-corn--ethanol-report?post=531983\">China To Resume Soybean &amp; Other Ag Purchases - The Corn &amp; Ethanol Report</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/keep-the-trade-deal-momentum-going-the-corn--ethanol-report?post=531431\">Keep The Trade Deal Momentum Going - The Corn &amp; Ethanol Report</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/corn-fundamentals-remain-a-major-obstacle-for-bulls-the-corn--ethanol-report?post=531123\">Corn Fundamentals Remain A Major Obstacle For Bulls.

See below:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://43s.159.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GPC102925-1-1024x605.jpeg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/><br/>Bear in mind, we’re just talking about the U.S. revaluing its gold holdings to the market rate. Based on historical precedent, the U.S. could choose to revalue gold to a MUCH higher price than that: $10,000 per ounce or even $20,000 per ounce.</p><p>This is right along the lines of what Franklin Delano Roosevelt did with the Gold Reserve Act of 1934. At that time, FDR revalued gold from $20.67 to $35 per oz, which represents a revaluation 69% higher. Of course, the U.S.’s debt situation was nowhere its current levels (the Debt to GDP ratio was a mere 40% compared to 120% today).</p><p>This is why I believe if the U.S. were to revalue gold in 2026, it would do so to a MUCH higher price. As I noted in my last article, a revaluation of gold to $20,000 per ounce would immediately give the U.S. an additional $5 TRILLION in capital.</p><p>At that price, the U.S. could retire ~18% of its debt outstanding, which in turn would reduce its interest payments and improve its fiscal position.</p><p>It would also provide an implicit link between the $USD and gold, which would cement the $USD as the world’s reserve currency… defeating China’s current strategic goal of establishing a gold-backed Yuan to replace the $USD.</p><p>Conspiracy theory? The language is already laid out in the $BTC Act. And Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has made multiple statements about “monetizing the asset side” of the U.S.’s balance sheet.</p><p>I realize this sounds crazy… but if you had told someone a year ago that the U.S. would…</p><ol><li>Create a sovereign wealth fund.</li><li>Create a Strategic $BTC Reserve</li><li>Start buying stakes in publicly traded companies (MP, INTC, etc.).</li></ol><p>…those policies would have sounded crazy then too. And that’s precisely what has happened!</p><p>Finally, we have to consider that this kind of strategy is something the President himself has done throughout his career in commercial real estate. Do you really think the self-proclaimed “King of Cheap” debt… the man who has a history of revaluing the assets he owns to restructure/ procure lower debt rates, hasn’t thought of this?</p><p>Those investors who are correctly positioned for this could generate life-changing returns.

It’s close to midnight and Putin’s selling oil in the dark. Under new sanctions, the Urals price drop almost stops his heart.He tries to scream, but terror takes the sound before he makes it. Assets could freeze , as losses looks him right between the Eyes, he’s Paralyzed.<br/>Cause this is thriller, sanction’s night And no one’s gonna save you, Trumps sanctions are about to strike and without Luk Oil and Rosneftit will really start to bite. You’re fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller, ow,Trump’sgonna thrill you tonight.<br/>Dark falls in the Russian land the sanctions is close at hand. Creatures crawl in search of blood to terrorize y’all’s neighborhood (I’m gonna thrill you tonight) You’re fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller, ow<br/>In Venezuela the US might just hit its mark. Taking out military situations that have helped drugs move across our parks. Madura might leave as wasnever really was elected. It might seem that we could change the regime right before our eyes ,Creepin’ Up Behind<br/>You’re Out Of Time!!!!!!!Markets riseacross the Land, The trading Hour Is Close At Hand.Creatures Crawl in Search Of stops To Terrorize your equity.<br/>And Whosoever Shall Be Found Without the Soul For Betting Down<br/>Must Stand and Face The Hounds Of Sell, And Rot Inside A traders hell.<br/>The Foulest Stench Is in The Air, The Funk of those Maduro Putin Years.</p><p>Recent late-breaking reports suggest the US may strike Venezuela’s military sites, potentially paving the way for Venezuela’s elected government to return to power. This raises significant risks for oil markets, particularly diesel, as supplies are already low and Venezuelan heavy oil is an important source. The situation could overshadow concerns about new sanctions on Russia’s Rosneft and Lukoil, with the latter selling assets in response. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s use of new missiles is intensifying pressure on Russia, which is facing growing economic and geopolitical challenges—potentially its toughest period since the war began.<br/>So, natural gas prices just made a big jump, pretty much as we expected. Fox Weather is out with reports that it’s going to be chillier than we first thought as October wraps up and November gets going. That colder outlook has buyers snapping up gas in the Midwest and Northeast, and cash prices are hitting seasonal highs. There was a moment when the models showed a return of mild weather, which cooled off the rally a bit, but now that forecasts are back to calling for below-normal temps, the bulls are running again.<br/>This isn’t just a U.S. thing, either. It’s cold in Europe and Asia, too, and that’s tightening up their inventories—European stocks are actually down 11% since early October. All of this is keeping up the pressure on benchmark prices like Henry Hub.<br/>Meanwhile, U.S. LNG exports are really taking off. New facilities like Plaquemines LNG (Phases 1 and 2) and Corpus Christi Stage 3 are coming online and could add more than 5 Bcf/d between 2025 and 2026. Feedgas demand for these plants is expected to hit 17 Bcf/d by the end of the year, up from 13 Bcf/d earlier, which means less gas is sticking around for the domestic market—a recipe for higher prices.<br/>On the global stage, LNG demand is growing by about 2.5% in 2025. Europe is especially busy restocking ahead of winter, partly because of ongoing geopolitical worries like the Russia/Ukraine situation, so they’re competing hard for U.S. volumes.<br/>Back home, U.S. producers are being a lot more careful this year. After a stretch of oversupply, they’re drilling less and focusing on doing it more efficiently. That’s helped keep us from drowning in excess gas, even though storage levels are high (we’re about 4% above the five-year average, projected at roughly 3,917 Bcf for October 31).<br/>Still, the market doesn’t seem too worried about those big inventories. Everyone’s looking ahead to winter withdrawals and new sources of demand—especially from data centers and AI infrastructure, which could add another 1–2 Bcf/d to power needs.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/arms-race-the-energy-report?post=531985\">Arms Race - The Energy Report</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/trying-to-get-that-feeling-again-the-energy-report?post=530032\">Trying To Get That Feeling Again - The Energy Report </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/hey-dude-wheres-my-surplus-the-energy-report?post=529808\">Hey Dude Where’s, My Surplus?

With over 3 billion users across its platforms, Meta continues to dominate global digital advertising, while investing heavily in AI-driven engagement, short-form video monetization, and metaverse infrastructure.<br/>Over the past few years, Meta has shifted focus from pure user growth to efficiency, automation, and profitability. CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s “year of efficiency” delivered record margins and free cash flow, even as the company continued to allocate billions to long-term bets in AI and virtual reality. The combination of high operating leverage, strong balance sheet, and expanding ad monetization gives Meta one of the most durable economic moats in the digital ecosystem.<br/> </p><h3><strong>DCF Analysis</strong></h3><p><strong>Inputs:</strong></p><p>Discount Rate: 10%</p><p>Terminal Growth Rate: 3%</p><p>WACC: 10%</p><p><strong>Forecasted Free Cash Flows (in billions USD)</strong></p><p>2025: $52.0 → PV: $47.3</p><p>2026: $55.0 → PV: $45.5</p><p>2027: $58.0 → PV: $43.7</p><p>2028: $61.0 → PV: $42.0</p><p>2029: $64.0 → PV: $40.4</p><p>Total Present Value of FCFs = $218.9B</p><p><strong>Terminal Value Calculation</strong></p><p>Using perpetuity growth model with 2029 FCF = $64B:</p><p>TV = (64 × 1.03) ÷ (0.10 − 0.03) = $943.4B</p><p>Present Value of Terminal Value = $595.0B</p><p><strong>Enterprise Value</strong></p><p>Enterprise Value = 218.9B + 595.0B = $813.9B</p><p><strong>Net Debt</strong></p><p>Cash &amp; Equivalents: $77.8B</p><p>Total Debt: $49.0B</p><p>Net Debt = –$28.8B (Net Cash Position)</p><p><strong>Equity Value &amp; Per-Share Value</strong></p><p>Equity Value = 813.9B + 28.8B = $842.7B</p><p>Shares Outstanding: ~2.53B</p><p>Intrinsic Value per Share ≈ $333<br/> </p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>DCF Value: $333</p><p>Current Price: ~$667</p><p>Margin of Safety: –50%</p><p>Meta Platforms continues to be an exceptional digital cash generator with dominant network effects, a fortress balance sheet, and accelerating AI-driven monetization. However, under conservative assumptions, the shares trade well above intrinsic value.

Below are some highlights from the above linked analysis:</p><p><strong>Company Description:</strong> Caterpillar Inc. is the world's largest producer of earthmoving equipment, and a major manufacturer of mining equipment, electric power generators and engines used in petroleum markets.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.dividend-growth-stocks.com/2007/10/glossary.html#Fair-Value-Buy-Price\"><strong>Fair Value:</strong></a> In calculating fair value, I consider the NPV MMA Differential Fair Value along with these four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:</p><p>1. Avg. High Yield Price<br/>2. 20-Year DCF Price<br/>3. Avg. P/E Price<br/>4. Graham Number</p><p>CAT is trading at a premium to all four valuations above. When also considering the NPV MMA Differential, the stock is trading at a 243.7% premium to its calculated fair value of $152.1. CAT did not earn any Stars in this section.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.dividend-growth-stocks.com/2007/11/dividend-analytical-data.html\"><strong>Dividend Analytical Data:</strong></a> In this section, there are three possible Stars and three key metrics, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:</p><p>1. Free Cash Flow Payout<br/>2. Debt To Total Capital<br/>3. Key Metrics<br/>4. Dividend Growth Rate<br/>5. Years of Div. Growth<br/>6. Rolling 4-yr Div. &gt; 15%</p><p>CAT earned one Star in this section for 1.) above. A Star was earned since the Free Cash Flow payout ratio was less than 60% and there were no negative Free Cash Flows over the last 10 years. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1914 and has increased its dividend payments for 31 consecutive years.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.dividend-growth-stocks.com/2007/11/dividend-income-vs-mma.html\"><strong>Dividend Income vs. MMA:</strong></a> Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA) or Treasury bond? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a <a href=\"http://www.dividend-growth-stocks.com/2008/08/mma-rate-mystery-solved.html\">high yield MMA</a>. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:</p><p>1. NPV MMA Diff.<br/>2. Years to &gt; MMA</p><p>The negative NPV MMA Diff. means that on a NPV basis, the dividend earnings from an investment in CAT would be less than a similar amount invested in MMA earning a 20-year average rate of 3.75%. If CAT grows its dividend at 3.4% per year, it will never equal a MMA yielding an estimated 20-year average rate of 3.75%.</p><p><strong>Peers:</strong> The company's peer group includes: The <strong>Deere &amp; Company</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/DE\">DE</a>) with a 1.4% yield, <strong>Komatsu Ltd.</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/KMTUY\">KMTUY</a>) with a 3.4% yield, and <strong>Terex Corporation</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/TEX\">TEX</a>) with a 1.2% yield.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> CAT did not earn any Stars in the Fair Value section, earned one Star in the Dividend Analytical Data section, and did not earn any Stars in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of one Star. This quantitatively ranks CAT as a <strong>1-Star Very Weak</strong> stock.</p><p>Using my <a href=\"http://www.dividend-growth-stocks.com/p/tools.html\"><strong>D4L-PreScreen.xls</strong></a> model, I determined the share price would need to decrease to $152.09 before CAT's NPV MMA Differential increased to the $500 minimum that I look for in a stock with 31 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price, the stock would yield 4.0%.</p><p>Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $500 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 3.5%. This dividend growth rate is slightly higher than the 3.4% used in this analysis, thus providing no margin of safety. CAT has a <a href=\"http://www.dividend-growth-stocks.com/2010/06/finding-low-risk-dividend-stocks.html\">risk rating</a> of 1.75, which classifies it as a Medium risk stock.</p><p>CAT's business is highly dependent on global economic conditions. The company's Free Cash Flow Payout of 37% (up from 29%) is below my desired maximum. Its Debt To Total Capital of 69% (up from 66%) is well above my desired maximum. The stock is currently trading at a premium to my calculated fair value of $152.10. I will not be initiating a position in CAT in my Dividend Growth Stocks Portfolio at this time.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/dividend-stock-analysis-bank-of-the-ozarks?post=530294\">Dividend Stock Analysis: Bank Of The Ozarks </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/dividend-stock-analysis-consolidated-edison-inc?post=529087\">Dividend Stock Analysis: Consolidated Edison, Inc. </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/dividend-stock-analysis-hormel-foods-corp?post=527594\">Dividend Stock Analysis: Hormel Foods Corp.</a></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Businessman, Internet, Continents\" height=\"249\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/08/26/10/47/businessman-2682712__340.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/images/id-2682712/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em><br/> </p><p>The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to hold rates steady. Other highlights of the week include key data on China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Australia: RBA expected to maintain the current rate</strong></h3><p>We expect the Reserve Bank of Australia to hold rates steady on Tuesday after third-quarter CPI inflation came in above expectations -- and the 2.5% midpoint of its target range. That's likely to outweigh a surprise uptick in September's unemployment rate, even as other labour market indicators still point to underlying strength.<br/> </p><h3><strong>South Korea: Inflation expected to rise, while export momentum remains strong</strong></h3><p>South Korean exports are expected to decline by 3.5% year-on-year in October, primarily due to an unfavourable calendar effect. Underlying momentum should appear robust, with a 6% increase in daily average exports. Semiconductors and ship exports are expected to remain strong, while auto exports are likely to decline. Although we expect the purchasing managers’ index to decline slightly, as it was surveyed before the recent trade agreement, we believe the recovery in manufacturing is likely to continue. Consumer price inflation is expected to rise to 2.3% YoY in October as gasoline and manufactured food prices increase.<br/> </p><h3><strong>China: Trade growth expected to slow down</strong></h3><p>Last week’s much-hyped Xi-Trump meeting led to a de-escalation of bilateral tensions. Next week should be a calmer one in China. The main data point will be the trade data on Friday. We expect export growth to slow to 4.0% YoY, and imports to edge down to 3.2% YoY, leading to a rebound of the trade surplus to $101bn.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Taiwan: Inflation expected to remain below target while robust trade growth continues</strong></h3><p>Taiwan releases inflation and trade data. CPI inflation has been below target for the past 5 months. This should continue in October with only a moderate uptick to 1.4% YoY expected. Trade is expected to continue to post strong growth, with exports up 35.1% YoY and imports up 32.6% YoY for a trade surplus of $10.4bn.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Japan: Labor earnings and household spending expected to grow despite inflation</strong></h3><p>Japanese labour earnings and household spending figures are projected to increase, suggesting that consumption remains stable despite elevated inflation levels. Strong wage negotiation outcomes may continue to contribute to higher wages, and the asset market rally could influence household spending.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Philippines: GDP growth expected to slow down sharply</strong></h3><p>We expect third-quarter Philippine GDP growth to slow sharply to 5.1%, primarily due to a significant decline in government spending. This follows corruption scandals associated with flood control projects. Business sentiment also took a hit in the third quarter, with tariff uncertainties adding to the drag on growth.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Key events in Asia next week</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"913\" src=\"https://think.ing.com/uploads/charts/_w800/23f562ca-ce45-4178-ac0b-9c1c101e7900.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/fx-daily-dollar-squeezing-every-bit-of-powells-hawkishness?post=532173\">FX Daily: Dollar Squeezing Every Bit Of Powell’s Hawkishness </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/strong-japanese-industrial-output-and-accelerating-inflation-raise-chances-of-december-rate-hike?post=532152\">Strong Japanese Industrial Output And Accelerating Inflation Raise Chances Of December Rate Hike </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/the-commodities-feed-opec-set-for-another-supply-increase?post=532122\">The Commodities Feed: OPEC+ Set For Another Supply Increase </a></p></div>",

Of course, whenever any asset class experiences a more speculative melt-up, investors are quick to rationalize why <em>“this time is different.”</em> In stocks, it is about <em>“artificial intelligence” </em>and <em>“data centers.”</em> The cryptocurrency community believes all fiat currencies will fail and everything will move to the digital asset. But when it comes to gold, the voices have grown loudly, claiming the reasons for the rise are debasement of the dollar, de-dollarization, and soaring debt levels.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-13/the-great-debasement-debate-is-rippling-across-global-markets?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDQzNjczNSwiZXhwIjoxNzYxMDQxNTM1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUM1dUWFlHT1QwSkswMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIxOTlGODg4MzZFOTY0OTRGQjMyMjI2OTZGNjIzOTY1MCJ9.rNgOHm1CHgeIWW0epPYcx098kJnPEMW_5Z4Bj5fRPl8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall\"><strong><em>Bloomberg</em></strong></a> lumped all three worries into one article.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Beneath the surface of the short-term ups and downs of financial markets, a longer-term repricing of multiple assets may be underway as investors seek to protect themselves from the<strong> threats posed by runaway budget deficits</strong>.</em></p><p><em><strong>Those who believe in it are pulling away from sovereign debt and the currencies they are denominated in</strong>, fearful their value will be eroded over time as governments avoid tackling their massive debt burdens and even seek to add to them.Further fuel is coming from speculation that central banks will face increasing political pressure to hold down interest rates to offset what governments owe — and<strong> in the process fan inflation by continuing to crank out cash.</strong>“</em></p></blockquote><p>The problem with the Bloomberg article is that it was unresearched and just a recycling of already prevalent myths. In this article, we will go through each gold myth and present the data behind the analysis.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Myth 1: Central Banks Are Hoarding Gold to Get Out of Dollars</strong></h3><p>This gold myth is repeated across media outlets and investor circles. It suggests that the global financial system is rapidly moving away from the U.S. dollar, and a recent <em>“<a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/central-banks-now-hold-more-gold-than-u-s-treasuries/\">chart crime” by Statista</a></em> further adds to the crowd’s conviction. To wit:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Central banks have crossed a symbolic line: their combined gold reserves now exceed their U.S. Treasury holdings for the first time in nearly three decades. The crossover underscores a gradual diversification away from dollar-denominated securities and toward hard assets.”</em></p></blockquote><p> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-94.png\"><img alt=\"Foreign Central Banks Reserves, Gold vs Treasuries\" height=\"911\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-94-787x1024.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p><br/>The problem with this chart is that it is only a function of price differences. Yes, bond prices have declined in recent years as rates have risen, and gold prices have increased. However, what Statista wants you to believe is that this represents a significant change by Central Banks to buying gold and selling Treasuries, which, in reality, is not the case. As shown below, the actual change in gold as a percentage of foreign reserves has primarily been a function of price increase. Over the last 5 years, Central Banks have only increased the amount of gold they own by roughly 5%. In other words, they have not switched significantly to buying gold.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gold-as-percent-of-fx-reserves-scaled.png\"><img alt=\"Contribution of Gold to total FX reserves\" height=\"467\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gold-as-percent-of-fx-reserves-1024x683.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p><br/>They have also not been selling Treasuries to<em> “get out of US dollars.</em>” Instead, while they have been adding to gold holdings as the price has increased, they have also bought Treasury bonds in record amounts, with foreign holdings now exceeding $9 trillion.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-96.png\"><img alt=\"Federal Debt held by Foreign and International investors.\" height=\"280\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-96-1024x410.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p><br/>The reality is that while Central Banks have accumulated some gold over the last 5 years, it isn’t a function of <em>“fleeing the dollar.”</em> Instead, they are rebalancing their reserves, adding gold as a form of diversification, particularly if the dollar is weaker than their own currency, not as a replacement. <strong>In a recent survey by the World Gold Council, only a minority of central banks said they plan to reduce their U.S. dollar exposure, and even fewer intend to sell U.S. Treasuries. </strong>Most still see the dollar as the most liquid and stable reserve currency globally. <strong>The interest in gold is more about risk management than ideology.</strong></p><p>There are also the practical constraints. Gold is hard to store, expensive to transport, and doesn’t pay interest. Furthermore, gold offers no yield, so they depend solely on price changes to protect their reserve balances when holding the asset. Most critically, Central banks can’t swap extensive holdings of U.S. Treasuries for gold without triggering a liquidity crisis in global markets. <strong>While there has been a modest increase in the demand for gold, mostly from speculators, it’s incremental with respect to Central Banks and is not signaling the collapse of the dollar system.</strong></p><p>History supports this. Even during the Cold War, when ideological lines were clear and distrust in Western systems was high, countries didn’t entirely abandon the dollar. Gold served as a partial hedge, not a full replacement. Today’s environment is no different. Central banks aren’t dumping dollars; they manage risk across a broader portfolio.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Myth 2: The Death of the Dollar and Fiat Currencies Is Here</strong></h3><p>The claim that fiat currencies are on the verge of collapse, and that the dollar is finished, is primarily ideological. It’s popular with hard money advocates and gold bugs, but this gold myth has no historical or institutional basis.</p><p>First of all, fiat currencies don’t die in a day. Legal systems, state power, military force, tax policy, and institutional trust underpin them. If the dollar were truly being debased, you’d see a very different set of outcomes:</p><ul><li><em>Capital fleeing U.S. assets</em> <em>(stocks, bonds, gold, cryptocurrencies)</em></li><li><em>A collapse in Treasury demand</em>.</li><li><em>A breakdown in global trade settled in dollars.</em></li></ul><p>Instead, we see the opposite. The U.S. dollar remains the default unit for global trade, cross-border settlements, debt issuance, and central bank reserves. Treasury demand remains robust, as shown above, and the dollar is still used in <strong>80% of global transactions</strong> and represents nearly <strong>60% of international reserves</strong>. Central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and institutional investors continue to hold and accumulate U.S. assets. So, while media pundits scream about a<em> “loss of trust,</em>” global capital continues to support the dollar,</p><p>When people say the dollar is<em> “dying,”</em> they often conflate two things. <strong>First, they mistake a decline in purchasing power for systemic collapse.</strong> Inflation erodes the value of money, but it doesn’t mean the monetary system is failing. Yes, if you have held dollars in a <em>“coffee can”</em> since 1960, you have certainly lost purchasing power due to inflation over time. That is because the economy has grown sharply since then, leading to high standards of living.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Purchasing-Power-Of-Dollar-Inflation.png\"><img alt=\"Dollar purchasing power as measured by inflation.\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Purchasing-Power-Of-Dollar-Inflation.png\" title=\"\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p><br/>However, this is why we <em>“invest”</em> dollars into assets that consistently produce above-inflation rates of return over time. The chart below illustrates the returns on investments in stocks and gold since 1960. It is easy to see which has been a better long-term hedge against the loss of purchasing power. In fact, as shown, gold failed to outperform inflation until 2006.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-123.png\"><img alt=\"Stocks vs Gold vs Inflation over time.\" height=\"310\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-123.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p><br/>Second, they assume that any new currency alternative, whether gold, the yuan, or a digital asset, will instantly replace fiat. The evidence doesn’t support that. <strong>For example, the Japanese Yen and the British Pound have gained exposure in foreign exchange reserves in recent years, along with the Chinese Yuan, as those economies have prospered. However, they still only make up a minor share of the total.</strong> The euro remains burdened by fragmentation and political dysfunction and has declined in recent years. In other words, no single currency or system is poised to replace the dollar.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-126-1024x1024.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Even gold, which served as a reserve asset in the past, lacks the infrastructure to become a dominant medium of exchange. <strong>Gold-backed systems require convertibility, centralized control, and strict monetary discipline, which is politically difficult in modern economies dependent on flexible credit and fiscal spending.</strong></p><p>I am not arguing that fiat currency systems do not face challenges. They do, especially from inflation and debt. But those pressures create adjustments, not extinction.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Myth 3: Gold Is Surging Due to the Debt</strong> <strong>and Increased Money Supply</strong></h3><p>This narrative gets traction every time gold moves higher. Commentators argue that rising U.S. debt levels and persistent budget deficits erode confidence in the financial system, prompting investors to seek refuge in gold. The argument is straightforward: more debt equals more risk, resulting in increased gold demand. The problem remains the same as with all the other myths: the data does not support it.</p><p>Gold prices are not directly tied to government debt levels. If they were, gold would have surged in the 1980s and 1990s when debt-to-GDP ratios climbed steadily. Instead, gold stagnated for nearly two decades. The connection is more nuanced. Gold tends to respond to changes in interest rates, inflation-adjusted returns, and perceived instability. Not debt ratios in isolation.</p><p>But there is more to this story. U.S. debt-to-GDP ratios have improved in recent years after surging during the COVID crisis when federal debt peaked near 121 percent of GDP in 2020. As of 2024, it has declined to roughly 118 percent, according to data from the Congressional Budget Office. While that number remains historically high, the trend has moved lower, not higher. Part of that decline is due to stronger nominal GDP growth. The U.S. economy has expanded faster than expected, driven by resilient consumer spending, corporate profits, and job growth. If GDP continues to grow, debt levels become more manageable. A larger economy can support a larger debt load without triggering market panic or inflation.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"388\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-127.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/><strong>The other side of the debt argument is that an increased money supply leads to higher gold prices</strong>. Again, the data doesn’t support that claim either. As we <a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/debasement-what-it-is-and-isnt?post=512765\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>discussed previously</em></strong></a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>“It’s easy to point to M2 charts and scream “debasement. “ However, the <strong>money supply must grow</strong> as the economy grows. If it doesn’t, deflationary risks emerge. Therefore, the key is whether money creation exceeds economic growth in a sustained way. Since 1959, the money supply has grown in alignment with economic growth.”</em></p></blockquote><p> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/M2-vs-GDP.png\"><img alt=\"M2 vs GDP\" height=\"431\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/M2-vs-GDP.png\" title=\"\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p> </p><blockquote><p><em>“A better way to assess this is by comparing M2 to GDP. Historically, the two have tracked closely. Even during the COVID shock, <strong>M2 as a percentage of GDP remained below 100%</strong>, meaning money supply growth was broadly aligned with economic output. Today, that ratio is falling, not rising.”</em></p></blockquote><p> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/M2-as-Percent-Of-GDP-vs-M2.png\"><img alt=\"M2 as pct of GDP\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/M2-as-Percent-Of-GDP-vs-M2.png\" title=\"\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p> </p><blockquote><p><em>“The reality is, as you would expect, that the growth rates of M2 and the economy are highly correlated.”</em></p></blockquote><p> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"M2 vs GDP correlation\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/M2-vs-GDP-correlation.png\" title=\"\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Most importantly, markets understand this. Bond yields, although volatile, have not spiked in a disorderly manner and have been declining, not rising, over the past year. Treasury auctions continue to attract buyers, and, as noted above, foreign demand for U.S. Treasuries remains robust.<strong> You’d expect widespread U.S. government asset sales if debt drives the gold rally. That isn’t happening.</strong> This was a point made by Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal in <em><a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.bloomberg.com_news_newsletters_2025-2D10-2D14_maybe-2Ddebasement-2Disn-2Dt-2Dthe-2Dbest-2Dway-2Dto-2Dput-2Dit&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=PJgpDD_X4kvibnixE-spwza342hldu9uV5MjnfW1V1k&amp;m=W9D5HvHPHTTyJxX5-yzuLAZRGPwiD7iKuE8stx3pjbWH2jet28dMJ-ThLXuSlQCG&amp;s=NDUAC2YSXNgO48uiBMx4HeSoEJy4DKTEGKexVEAlP30&amp;e=\" target=\"_blank\">Maybe ‘Debasement’ Isn’t The Best Way To Put it</a>, </em></p><blockquote><p><em>“It’s not true that all real assets are surging in price. For instance, real estate is not doing particularly well. This is the ultimate “hard” asset, and yet, prices are barely going up. Now, you might say that homes are weird, because mortgage rates are high, and so forth. But on the other hand, one of the premises of the debasement trade is that rates are being kept artificially low. So in theory, there should be a lot of demand to borrow at these levels. But apparently not so much.</em></p><p><em>And speaking of rates, the 10-year yield is now trading close to its lowest levels of the last 12 months. If you weren’t paying attention, you’d think that bonds have been some terrible investment, and that rich countries are losing control over the long end of the curve. But the chart says otherwise. 2025 has been an excellent year for Treasuries.”</em></p></blockquote><p>The reality is that gold’s surge is a speculative price-chase feeding frenzy supported by these <em>“myths”</em> to rationalize and justify paying increasing asset prices. But such is always the nature of a speculative feeding frenzy, whether in gold, stocks, or cryptocurrency.<br/> </p><h3><strong>What This Means for Investors</strong></h3><p>While it is true that gold has performed well in recent years, it also experiences prolonged periods of underperformance. Gold does the same, like stocks, which cycle through bull and bear markets. As with all investments, it is crucial to manage the risk of ownership accordingly. The current trend is not guaranteed to continue, and given the extreme technical deviations, it is almost a certainty that it will not.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-177.png\"><img alt=\"Gold Price Monthly\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-177-1024x545.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p><br/>As a gold investor, our advice is to discard the <em>“gold myths” </em>and focus on what ultimately matters.</p><ul><li><em><strong>A strong U.S. dollar rally.</strong> Gold is priced in dollars, which is also a flaw in the debasement trade. Gold becomes more expensive for foreign buyers when the dollar strengthens against other currencies, reducing demand.</em></li><li><em><strong>U.S. economic growth continues to surprise to the upside</strong>. This will reduce the debt-to-GDP ratios and attract more foreign capital into U.S. dollar-denominated assets.</em></li><li><em><strong>Widening interest rate differentials</strong>. If interest rate differentials widen in favor of the dollar, it could trigger a broad-based move back into dollar-denominated assets, hurting gold.</em></li><li><em><strong>A continued decline in inflation</strong>. Gold often benefits from fears of rising prices, even if it’s not a perfect hedge. If headline CPI numbers continue to fall and inflation expectations decline, the urgency of owning gold as a protective asset may fade</em>. <em>Disinflationary forces, such as tighter credit, falling commodity prices, or global growth slowdowns, could reduce the inflation risk premiums embedded in gold.</em></li><li><em><strong>A drop in bond yields</strong>. A drop in yields, especially real yields, can hurt gold under the right conditions. Gold tends to do well when real yields are negative or falling. However, if bond yields fall because growth is weakening and investors flee to safety, gold may not benefit. In that environment, Treasuries often outperform as the preferred risk-off trade. Gold could lag.</em></li><li><em><strong>Investor sentiment is a significant driver of gold prices.</strong> If market psychology shifts, due to improving macro data, reduced geopolitical stress, or even a broad equity rally, flows into gold ETFs and futures can reverse quickly. Momentum fades. Positioning unwinds. A shift in narrative is often all it takes to break the trend.</em></li></ul><p>Gold is not immune to market cycles. It’s a volatile asset driven by shifting narratives and capital flows. If you’re buying gold today, understand what’s supporting the price, and what could shake that support loose. Treat gold as a hedge, not a core growth asset.</p><p>Manage your exposure accordingly, and leave the <em>“gold myths”</em> at the door.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/dow-theory-a-concerning-divergence-or-artifact?post=532179\">Dow Theory: A Concerning Divergence Or Artifact?</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/liquidity-concerns-put-an-end-to-qt?post=531785\">Liquidity Concerns Put An End To QT</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/rebasing-the-dollar-another-look-at-the-debasing-narrative?post=531399\">Rebasing The Dollar: Another Look At The Debasing Narrative</a><br/></div>",

With demand for advanced memory products skyrocketing, it was only natural that Micron enjoyed a practically hegemonic boost in market value. However, with MU stock rising over 166% on a year-to-date basis, investors are now questioning the viability of the bullish narrative.</p><p>It’s not just the raw ascension of Micron’s equity but the dramatic acceleration in upside. In the trailing half-year period, MU stock has nearly tripled in value. For context, the benchmark Nasdaq Composite — which is no slouch — has gained over 35% during the same frame. However, the price appreciation from the angle of market capitalization is quite extreme.</p><p>Right now, the company’s market cap stands at $205.64 billion. At the end of August — which wasn’t that long ago — this figure was 133.19 billion. Granted, the argument supporting is that on a forward earnings basis, MU stock trades at a<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MU/key-statistics/\"> multiple</a> of only 12.33.

Further, price clustering would be expected to occur predominantly at $228.</p><p>At the present juncture, MU stock is under a heavily accumulative behavioral state, which can be abbreviated as 7-3-U: seven up weeks, three down weeks, with an overall upward slope. Here, the risk-reward spectrum suffers a net decline, with outcomes ranging from $202 on the low side to $239 on the up.</p><p>Most concerningly, price clustering would be expected to occur at $225, which is almost on top of the anchor.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Chart, Trading, Courses, Forex, Analysis\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/12/13/22/15/chart-1905225__340.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/images/id-1905225/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em><br/> </p><p>Thermo Fisher Scientific ( <strong>“NYSE: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/TMO\">TMO</a>”</strong> ) shows fresh momentum after an October revenue beat and sustained analyst bullishness. The stock is trading well above key moving averages and near its 52‑week high, driven by earnings strength, durable demand across labs globally, and continued analyst conviction. In the short term, momentum and post‑earnings flows are weighing on price action. Over the long term, strong profitability metrics and capital allocation support resilience across the US, Europe, and Asia. Compared with prior quarters, the recent revenue upside continues a pattern of steady top‑line delivery amid a competitive but consolidating health‑care equipment market.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3><p>This report examines Thermo Fisher Scientific ( <strong>“NYSE:TMO”</strong> ), using recent price moves, proprietary scores, and fresh earnings data to give a multi‑dimensional view for market participants. The objective is to tease out what drove the October move, how the stock sits relative to technical and fundamental benchmarks, and how analyst expectations line up with current pricing.<br/> </p><h3><strong>“Trade Engine Score” — Central Signal</strong></h3><p>The platform’s “Trade Engine Score” for <strong>“TMO”</strong> is 57.03. This composite combines technical momentum, fundamentals, analyst sentiment and news flow. At 57, the score sits in a moderate zone: not extreme, but biased toward positive momentum. That aligns with a technical score of 67.65 — a bullish tilt — even as the fundamental score (26.56) flags valuation or near‑term fundamental conservatism. Put simply: market action and analyst conviction are carrying sentiment today, while deeper fundamental metrics signal caution for investors focused strictly on fundamentals.</p><h3>Recent Price Performance &amp; Context</h3><p>Thermo Fisher closed at $556.22. The stock gained $31.26 this month and $33.65 year‑to‑date. It is trading roughly 9% below its 52‑week high of $610.97 and well above its 52‑week low of $385.46, placing it near the upper end of its annual range.</p><p>Momentum indicators reinforce the move. RSI sits at 71.13, in overbought territory, and the 50‑day EMA ($477.19) and SMA ($482.08) are materially below the current price. The technical score of 67.65 reflects this strength: price trends are positive, but the elevated RSI warns of near‑term volatility and profit‑taking risk.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Earnings Watch and Recent Report</strong></h3><p>Thermo Fisher reported earnings on 2025‑10‑22. Revenue came in at $11,122,000,000 versus estimates of $11,016,735,196 — an upside of about $105 million, or near 1% above consensus. The print reinforces the company’s recurring top‑line resilience across instruments, consumables, and services.</p><p>Short‑term: the beat supported the October rally and sustained analyst coverage. Medium‑term: the revenue miss/beat magnitude is modest, so sustained share gains require continued execution and margin stability. The company’s earnings quality score (90.45, graded A+) is a notable positive, suggesting the reported figures are clean and reliable.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Sector Comparison and Financial Context</strong></h3><p>Compared with sector benchmarks, some metrics stand out. The sector PE (TTM) sits near 14.18, and sector revenue growth QoQ (YoY) is about 4.78%. Thermo Fisher’s market pricing implies a premium to the sector, supported by a high earnings‑quality grade and top‑tier profitability metrics listed in the profile.</p><p>Reported category scores show capital allocation at 100%, profitability at 100% and growth at 88.56%. Leverage is elevated at 73.23%, which is a neutral to modestly negative factor relative to peers with lighter balance‑sheet leverage. The dataset lists a net margin of 0.00% — an outlier figure relative to the company’s historical margins — and should be interpreted cautiously in light of the company’s otherwise strong profitability indicators.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Fundamental &amp; Technical Synthesis</strong></h3><p>Fundamentally, the profile is mixed. The high scores for profitability and capital allocation point to disciplined use of cash and robust operating performance. The low aggregated fundamental score (26.56) suggests valuation metrics or certain balance‑sheet elements temper a full fundamental endorsement. Earnings quality is high (A+, 90.45), which increases confidence in the reported results.</p><p>Technically, momentum is positive. The 50‑day averages lag price by a wide margin, and the technical score (67.65) supports a bullish bias. However, RSI above 70 signals a stretched condition. Put together, the technical picture favors the bulls near term, but it raises the odds of pullbacks or consolidation before further sustained gains.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Analyst Sentiment and Price Targets</strong></h3><p>Analyst coverage shows strong institutional conviction. The aggregator lists an analyst sentiment score of 100.00 based on 26 analysts. Consensus targets range from a low of $538.49 to a high of $708.75, with a mean of $624.54 and a median of $634.95. Versus the close at $556.22, the mean target implies roughly 12% upside and the median about 14%.</p><p>Aggregated rating counts in the platform indicate very heavy buy‑side bias (numerous buy and strong‑buy tallies). That aligns with the firm‑level coverage and supports the ongoing optimistic narrative among sell‑side analysts.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Synthesizing News and Market Reaction</strong></h3><p>News flow has been light but supportive. Recent coverage included Argus Research maintaining a buy stance. Combined with the October revenue upside, that steady analyst reinforcement helped push the stock higher during the month.</p><p>News sentiment sits at 45.00 on the metric scale, suggesting neutral‑to‑modestly positive headlines. When news is limited, market dynamics tend to be shaped by earnings prints and analyst revisions — both of which have favored Thermo Fisher this month and contributed to the Trade Engine Score’s moderate reading.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Thermo Fisher Scientific ( <strong>“NYSE: TMO”</strong> ) presents a mixed but broadly constructive picture. The “Trade Engine Score” of 57.03 captures the interplay between strong technical momentum, high earnings quality and very positive analyst sentiment, against a lower fundamental score that flags valuation and select balance‑sheet considerations. The recent revenue beat and sustained analyst backing support the near‑term bullish case, while an elevated RSI and modest fundamental cautions argue for readiness for pullbacks or consolidation.</p><p>Investors should weigh the immediate momentum and analyst targets against the broader fundamental score and leverage profile. The stock sits close to its 52‑week high, with upside to consensus targets but also signs of short‑term stretch. This is a momentum-and-sentiment-driven market setup layered atop solid underlying business performance.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/is-char-technologies-the-quiet-mover-in-canadas-clean-tech-space?post=531975\">Is CHAR Technologies The Quiet Mover In Canada’s Clean-Tech Space?</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/international-business-machines-nears-52-week-high-as-earnings-beat-lifts-momentum?post=531899\">International Business Machines Nears 52-Week High As Earnings Beat Lifts Momentum</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/meta-platforms-heads-into-earnings-with-ai-driven-ad-growth-and-tightened-power-competition?post=531397\">Meta Platforms Heads Into Earnings With AI-Driven Ad Growth And Tightened Power Competition</a></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p>Gold demand grew by 3 percent year-on-year in Q3, hitting 1,313 tonnes, the highest quarterly level in history.</p><p>Third quarter demand was even more impressive in dollar terms, increasing by 44 percent to a record of $146 billion.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"348\" src=\"https://www.moneymetals.com/uploads/content/q3-gold-demand-2025-min.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Year-to-date, gold demand is up by 1 percent at 3,717 tonnes, valued at $384 billion. That represents a 41 percent increase in value terms.</p><p>Third quarter demand grew even as <a href=\"https://www.moneymetals.com/gold-price\">the gold price surged</a> 16 percent and set 13 new all-time highs. The gold price averaged $3,456 during the quarter, up 40 percent year-on-year and 5 percent from the last quarter.</p><p>Investment buying drove overall demand higher, accounting for over half of total demand so far in 2025.</p><p>Total third-quarter investment demand came in at 537 tonnes, pushing the year-to-date total to 1,566 tonnes, just 6 percent shy of the peak through the first three quarters of 2020 during the pandemic.</p><p>In terms of value, the World Gold Council called it “uncharted waters.”</p><blockquote><p>“Investment for the first nine months of the year amounted to $161 billion – well over double that of the same period last year ($63billion) and 74 percent above the prior $92 billion record from 2020.”</p></blockquote><p>Gold bar and coin demand hit 315.5 tonnes, a 17 percent year-on-year increase. It was the fourth consecutive quarter of bar and coin demand over 300 tonnes. The last time that happened was in 2013.</p><p>China and India both reported strong physical gold sales. Year-to-date demand of 184 tonnes in India was the strongest for the first nine-month period since 2013. It came in just shy of the average post-COVID full-year demand of 196 tonnes.</p><p>The only region with a decline in gold bar and coin demand was the U.S., coming in at a paltry 7 tonnes. That was the lowest quarterly total since the 2017-2019 trough. According to the World Gold Council, U.S. demand picked up in September as the price broke through the $4,000 level.</p><p>ETFs globally added 222 tonnes of gold to their holdings.</p><p>At the end of Q3, global ETF gold holdings totaled 3,838 tonnes, just 2 percent below the peak in November 2020.  </p><p>A gold ETF is backed by a trust company that holds metal owned and stored by the trust. In most cases, investing in an ETF does not entitle you to any amount of physical gold. You own a share of the ETF, not gold itself. ETFs are a convenient way for investors to play the gold market, but <a href=\"https://www.moneymetals.com/news/2024/03/08/paper-gold-vs-real-gold-its-important-to-know-the-difference-003038\">owning ETF shares is not the same as holding physical gold</a>.</p><p>The World Gold Council projects strong investment demand to continue through the rest of the year.</p><blockquote><p>“The investment-friendly environment for gold that has persisted throughout the year so far remains in place for now, given still-heightened geopolitical uncertainty, ongoing U.S. dollar weakness and expectations for future U.S. rate cuts. Added to which, richly valued equity markets have not only highlighted gold’s role as a diversifier, but also its role as a hedge against potential equity market corrections. The stage therefore looks set for continued strength in investment flows, a trend that has been observed so far in Q4.”</p></blockquote><p>While investment demand surged, higher prices put a damper on gold jewelry demand. The third quarter came in as the weakest Q3 since the pandemic low in 2020.</p><p>Globally, gold jewelry demand was 371.3 tonnes, a 19 percent year-on-year decline.</p><p>The drag created by higher prices was particularly evident in India, where jewelry demand fell by 31 percent through the first nine months of the year.</p><p>Despite the drop in sales volume, the higher prices benefited retailers, with the value of total demand rising 13 percent to $41 billion.</p><p>Central bank gold buying continued to support the broader market. Central banks globally officially added 220 tonnes of gold in Q3. That was up 28 percent from Q2.</p><p>Year-to-date, central bank gold buying is down from last year, coming in at 634 tonnes, compared to 724 tonnes through the first three quarters of last year.</p><p>To put the numbers into context, central bank gold reserves increased by an average of just 473 tonnes annually between 2010 and 2021.</p><p>The National Bank of Kazakhstan was the biggest gold buyer in Q3, adding 18 tonnes of gold to its reserves. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Brazil added gold for the first time since 2021.</p><p>World Gold Council analysts expect the central bank gold buying trend to continue, with buying “<em>close to the range seen over the past three years on continued elevated trade-related risks and uncertainty premia in U.S. assets.</em>” </p><p>Interestingly, the World Gold Council estimates that 66 percent of the third quarter’s central bank demand remains unreported. This dovetails with work done by <a href=\"https://www.moneymetals.com/news/2025/04/02/chinas-gold-reserves-going-through-the-roof-003956\">Money Metals researcher Jan Nieuwenhuijs</a>. He estimates that the Chinese central bank is currently sitting on more than 5,000 tonnes of monetary gold located in Beijing – <em>more than TWICE what has been publicly admitted.</em></p><p>Demand for gold in technology and industry fell modestly by 2 percent in Q3, coming in at 82 tonnes. Electronics demand was flat year-on-year at 69 tonnes.</p><p>Electronics demand generally gets a bump in the third quarter as companies launch new production. However, according to the World Gold Council,<em> </em>the prospect of U.S. tariff hikes encouraged a surge in demand during H1 as a pre-emptive move to avoid customs levies. As a result, Q3 demand was negatively impacted. </p><p>Gold supply was up by 3 percent in Q3, with mine output up 2 percent year-on-year. A 6 percent year-on-year surge in recycling also helped boost supply.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/fed-cuts-rates-ends-balance-sheet-reduction-but-puts-on-a-hawkish-front?post=532148\">Fed Cuts Rates, Ends Balance Sheet Reduction But Puts On A Hawkish Front </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/silver-gold-and-debt?post=531161\">Silver, Gold, And Debt </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/why-exactly-is-the-federal-reserve-cutting-rates?post=531104\">Why Exactly Is The Federal Reserve Cutting Rates? </a><br/></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p>Estimating US economic activity for the third quarter remains a guessing game. The Bureau of Economic Analysis was scheduled to publish its initial estimate yesterday, Oct. 30, but the government shutdown has delayed the report, along with other crucial data releases. Private-sector numbers are filling in some of the blank spots, but uncertainty is on the rise about the economy. On the bright side, using the dwindling set of updated numbers available for nowcasting Q3 still suggests that the output probably rose at a solid pace.</p><p>Economic growth increased at an estimated 2.8% annualized pace in Q3, based on the median estimate for a set of nowcasts compiled by CapitalSpectator.com. If accurate, economic activity cooled from Q2’s strong gain 3.8%, according to <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/news/2025/gross-domestic-product-2nd-quarter-2025-third-estimate-gdp-industry-corporate-profits\">last reported estimate from the government</a> before the updates stopped on Oct. 1.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.capitalspectator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gdp.cs_.2025-10-31.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.capitalspectator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gdp.cs_.2025-10-31.png\" width=\"600\"/></a></p><p><br/>The current Q3 estimate should be viewed cautiously, of course. But the nowcast suggests that there was a fair amount of growth momentum in the previous quarter to keep recession risk low.</p><p>The partially updated <a href=\"https://www.dallasfed.org/research/wei\">Weekly Economic Index</a> (WEI), published by the Dallas Fed, suggests as much. WEI edged down to a 2.0% pace for the week through Oct. 25, an estimate that equates with a four-quarter GDP growth that’s slightly below the 2.1% pace reported for Q2. The report suggests that the economic trend is holding steady. But since some of WEI inputs – weekly jobless claims, for instance – aren’t updating, the latest estimate may be misleading.</p><p>Optimists can also point to the Atlanta Fed’s <a href=\"https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow\">GDPNow model</a>, which is currently estimating a strong 3.9% for Q3 economic activity (as of Oct.27) – well above the median estimate in the chart above and slightly faster than the Q2 advance. But here, too, the updates should be viewed with a non-trivial degree of skepticism due to the missing data for some of the model’s inputs.</p><p>The government shutdown is costing the economy about $7 billion per month,  according to a <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-10/61823-Shutdown.pdf\">new report</a> by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). That’s a rounding error for a $30 trillion economy, but it’s still another headwind at a time when signs of a labor market downshift has been persuading the Federal to cut interest rates.</p><p>This much is clear: the longer the shutdown lasts, the stronger the headwind. Meantime, it’s still reasonable to guesstimate that economic activity grew at a moderate pace in Q3. The outlook for Q4, by contrast, is far more uncertain from the perspective of developing a reasonably accurate nowcast.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/macro-briefing-thursday-oct-30?post=531986\">Macro Briefing - Thursday, Oct. 30</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/feds-powell-raises-doubts-about-another-rate-cut?post=531900\">Fed’s Powell Raises Doubts About Another Rate Cut</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/macro-briefing-wednesday-oct-29?post=531436\">Macro Briefing - Wednesday, Oct. 29</a><br/></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"macbook pro on black table\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1606189933777-a56d876d692d?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/B5NEfHJCRpY\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></em><br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The USD/JPY pair climbed to a nine-month high on Friday, approaching the key 154.00 level. The yen concluded October with losses of approximately 4%, marking a highly unsuccessful month. The currency's decline was exacerbated by domestic political shifts, following the election of Sanae Takaichi as Prime Minister. Takaichi is a known advocate for stimulative fiscal policy and the maintenance of ultra-loose monetary conditions—a combination that typically weighs on a currency.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This dovish political backdrop was complemented by the Bank of Japan's decision to hold interest rates steady in October. Governor Kazuo Ueda further dampened sentiment by warning that tighter global trade conditions could stifle economic growth and reduce corporate profits.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">In a notable shift, the new Finance Minister, Satsuki Katayama, clarified that she no longer views a yen exchange rate of 120-130 per dollar as appropriate. She emphasized that currency stability is now her primary focus, a comment markets interpreted as a step back from direct intervention.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The yen also faced pressure from a broadly strengthening US dollar. Market expectations for further Federal Reserve rate cuts have receded, while data showing higher-than-expected inflation in Tokyo for October complicated the domestic policy outlook.<br/> </p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Technical Analysis: USD/JPY</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\">H4 Chart:<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"319\" src=\"https://talkmarkets.com/contributor/andrey-goilov/user_content/ckimages/orig_usdjpyh4_638974947496932926.webp\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/>On the H4 chart, USD/JPY has completed a bullish wave structure, reaching 154.40. The pair is now likely to enter a period of consolidation at these highs. A decisive downward breakout from this range would signal the start of a correction, with an initial target at 151.88. Conversely, an upward breakout would open the path for the next leg of the rally towards 155.70.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This technical outlook is supported by the MACD indicator. Its signal line remains above zero and is pointing firmly upwards, confirming the underlying bullish momentum.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">H1 Chart:<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"319\" src=\"https://talkmarkets.com/contributor/andrey-goilov/user_content/ckimages/orig_usdjpyh1_638974947919019967.webp\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br/>On the H1 chart, the market completed an initial growth wave to 153.33, formed a tight consolidation range, and then broke upwards to achieve its local target of 154.40. Following this peak, a pullback towards at least 153.33 is anticipated. Upon finding support, the next upward wave is expected to target 154.83, with the potential to extend the broader bullish trend towards 155.15.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Stochastic oscillator aligns with this view. Its signal line is above 50 and rising sharply towards 80, indicating that short-term bullish momentum remains intact.<br/> </p><h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The yen's sharp decline in October was driven by a perfect storm of domestic political and monetary dovishness, coupled with a resurgent US dollar. Technically, USD/JPY's bullish structure is firmly established. While a short-term correction is possible, the path of least resistance remains skewed to the upside, with key targets at 155.70 on the H4 chart. All eyes will be on whether Japanese authorities will transition from verbal intervention to concrete action if the yen's weakness persists.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/gbpusd-finds-a-floor-at-13200-after-fed-induced-sell-off?post=531731\">GBP/USD Finds A Floor At 1.3200 After Fed-Induced Sell-Off</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/a-key-day-for-eurusd-as-the-fed-decision-looms?post=531324\">A Key Day For EUR/USD As The Fed Decision Looms </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/gold-rebounds-to-4000-usd-mark?post=530987\">Gold Rebounds To 4,000 USD Mark </a></p></div>",
