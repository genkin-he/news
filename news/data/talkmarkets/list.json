This week’s spotlight is <strong>Global Ship Lease, Inc. (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GSL\">GSL</a>)</strong> — a containership charter owner with long-term, fixed-rate contracts providing stable and visible cash flows in the volatile global shipping sector.</p><h3><br/><strong>Business Overview</strong></h3><p>Headquartered in London, GSL owns and charters a diversified fleet of mid-sized and smaller containerships on long-term time charters to leading liner companies. These charters typically provide multi-year revenue visibility and protection from short-term spot-rate volatility. The company benefits from fleet expansion and accretive vessel acquisitions during market downturns, positioning itself to compound value as freight rates and charter durations normalize.</p><p><br/><strong>What is IV/P (Intrinsic Value to Price)?</strong></p><p>IV/P tells you whether a stock offers more intrinsic value than the price you are paying for it. The calculation blends earnings power, reinvestment efficiency, and capital return policy to estimate intrinsic value — a conservative measure of what the business is worth.</p><p>The interpretation is straightforward:</p><ul><li>IV/P above 1 suggests undervaluation.</li><li>IV/P below 1 suggests overvaluation.</li><li>The further above 1, the more value you may be getting per dollar invested.</li></ul><p>GSL’s IV/P is <strong>1.70</strong>, meaning its intrinsic value is estimated to be roughly 70% higher than its current market price — a strong signal of potential undervaluation.</p><p><br/><strong>Supporting Metrics</strong></p><p><strong>Market Cap:</strong> ~$1.017 B<br/><strong>Enterprise Value (EV):</strong> ~$1.288 B<br/><strong>Free Cash Flow (TTM):</strong> ~$142 M<br/><strong>Free Cash Flow Yield:</strong> ~11%<br/><strong>Acquirer’s Multiple:</strong> 3.3</p><p>Global Ship Lease (GSL) trades at a market cap of about $1.0 billion and an enterprise value of $1.3 billion, generating roughly $142 million in free cash flow—equating to an ~11% FCF yield and an Acquirer’s Multiple of 3.3, highlighting strong cash generation relative to valuation.</p><p><br/><strong>Revenue &amp; Profitability</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Revenue (TTM):</strong> $730 M</li><li><strong>Operating Income (TTM):</strong> $381 M</li><li><strong>Operating Margin:</strong> ~52%</li><li><strong>Net Income (TTM):</strong> $383 M</li><li><strong>Net Margin:</strong> ~52%</li><li><strong>Diluted EPS (TTM):</strong> $10.70</li></ul><p>Profitability has remained robust, supported by long-term charters that lock in high-margin contracts. Even as freight markets cooled from 2022 peaks, GSL sustained strong operating margins and earnings stability — a rarity in the cyclical shipping space.</p><p><br/><strong>Balance Sheet Strength</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cash &amp; Equivalents:</strong> ~$167M</li><li><strong>Total Debt:</strong> ~$684M</li><li><strong>Net Debt:</strong> ~$533M</li><li><strong>Shareholder Equity:</strong> ~$1.46B</li></ul><p>GSL maintains a solid balance sheet with strong equity backing and ample liquidity relative to its vessel commitments. While leverage remains moderate due to fleet financing, the company’s substantial asset base and steady contracted cash flows provide flexibility for future fleet expansion and shareholder returns.</p><p><br/><strong>Capital Returns</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Dividend Yield (TTM):</strong> ~6–7%</li><li><strong>Total Dividends Paid (TTM):</strong> ~$76 M</li><li><strong>Capital Expenditure (TTM):</strong> ~$304 M</li></ul><p>GSL continues to return capital to shareholders through a growing dividend while reinvesting in its fleet. The company’s disciplined capital allocation — balancing fleet renewal with dividends — supports both sustainability and long-term compounding.</p><h3><br/><strong>Why Might GSL Be Undervalued?</strong></h3><p>Shipping stocks often trade at deep discounts due to cyclicality and investor hesitation following previous booms and busts. Yet GSL’s long-term charter coverage, strong free cash flow, and solid balance sheet differentiate it from typical shipping plays. Its Acquirer’s Multiple of 3.3 and IV/P of 1.70 suggest the market is mispricing a company that generates stable, contracted cash flows and yields double-digit free-cash-flow returns.</p><h3><br/><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>With an IV/P of 1.70, an Acquirer’s Multiple of 3.3, and a free cash flow yield of roughly 11%, <strong>Global Ship Lease (GSL)</strong> represents a compelling deep-value opportunity in the transportation sector. For patient investors, the combination of strong earnings visibility, high cash generation, and shareholder-friendly capital returns offers a rare setup: a cyclical business behaving like a compounding cash machine.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/meta-platforms-inc-our-calculation-of-intrinsic-value?post=532292\">Meta Platforms, Inc.: Our Calculation Of Intrinsic Value</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/why-small-caps-are-poised-for-a-multi-year-comeback?post=531162\">Why Small Caps Are Poised For A Multi-Year Comeback</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/tesla-inc-q3-2025-revenue-up-12-free-cash-flow-hits-new-record?post=530929\">Tesla, Inc.

Following the talks, both sides announced a modest set of agreements aimed at improving trade relations.</p><p>The U.S. agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese imports by 10%, while China committed to purchasing more U.S. agricultural goods—particularly soybeans—and delaying certain export controls on rare earth minerals. Both nations also postponed new port fees and trade restrictions on each other. While these measures fell short of a comprehensive trade deal, they represent a constructive step toward de-escalation in U.S.-China relations.</p><p>Equity markets responded to the news with restraint, with U.S. stocks even pulling back during the day on Thursday, as some investors may have been hoping for a broader deal. Still, the developments signal a cooling of tensions that could pave the way for more substantive negotiations between the two countries in the months ahead.</p><p>Next week, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear a case regarding the legality of certain reciprocal tariffs. Even if the Court were to strike down portions of them, there are still other ways for the U.S. to impose tariffs on key trading partners. From a macro perspective, we think the current tariff environment will only have a modest hit to U.S. growth. Our central scenario is still for the U.S. economy to achieve a soft landing.</p><h2><br/>Fed, BoC lower rates while BoJ stands pat</h2><p>Central bank announcements also made headlines this week, with both the Bank of Canada (BoC) and the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) lowering interest rates by 0.25%, while the Bank of Japan (BoJ) opted to stay on hold.</p><p>The BoC’s decision brought its policy rate down to 2.25%, which is the lower end of its estimated neutral rate—the rate that neither speeds up nor slows down the economy. With rates at this level, there will likely be a higher threshold for additional cuts, though the central bank still reiterated its data-dependent stance. If the Canadian economy weakens further—<a href=\"https://russellinvestments.com/content/ri/us/en/insights/russell-research/2025/09/economy-gdp-spike-mwir.html\">a plausible scenario</a> given its relative vulnerability compared to the U.S.—further easing in December or early 2026 can’t be ruled out.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Fed’s rate cut was also widely anticipated. Chair Jerome Powell noted that while the recent U.S. government shutdown has disrupted access to some official data, the central bank can use private-sector indicators to gauge the state of the economy. These numbers suggest the labor market has softened but is still resilient, which should allow the Fed to gradually lower rates.</p><p>By contrast, the BoJ left borrowing rates unchanged. However, officials signaled rate hikes may be on the horizon as Japan attempts to normalize its monetary policy. </p><h2><br/>U.S. earnings remain a bright spot</h2><p>Earnings reports this week underscored the <a href=\"https://russellinvestments.com/content/ri/us/en/insights/russell-research/2025/10/macro-vitals-data-dead-zone-mwir.html\">continued strength of corporate America</a>. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking above 12% year-over-year, while revenue growth stands near 8%—one of the strongest revenue growth readings in recent years.</p><p>This robust earnings performance supports the view that corporate profitability remains healthy, helping keep layoffs low and bolstering the case for a <a href=\"https://russellinvestments.com/content/ri/us/en/insights/russell-research/2025/10/why-gold-prices-falling-mwir.html\">soft landing</a>. </p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/us-economy-flexes-muscle-with-gdp-spike?post=525168\">U.S. Economy Flexes Muscle With GDP Spike</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/summer-sizzle-stocks-stay-hot-earnings-heat-up?post=515726\">Summer Sizzle: Stocks Stay Hot, Earnings Heat Up</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/us-economy-slows-is-a-soft-landing-still-likely?post=514380\">U.S. Economy Slows - Is A Soft Landing Still Likely?</a></p></div>",

Nexperia holds about 40% of the market for these essential chips, and roughly 60% of its $2 billion annual revenue comes from automakers.</p><p>China’s decision to grant selective exemptions appears directly linked to the Trump-Xi summit held Thursday in Busan.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/white-house-to-announce-auto-chip-shipments-to-resume-from-china-88ef4db0\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street Journal </a>reported that the resumption of Nexperia shipments was part of the broader trade deal agreed by the two leaders, which also included suspending Trump’s threatened 100% tariff on Chinese goods, halving the fentanyl-linked tariff from 20% to 10%, and pausing China’s export controls on rare earth minerals for one year.</p><h2><br/>Could Nvidia be next after the Trump-Xi meeting?</h2><p>The semiconductor discussions between Trump and Xi have raised hopes and questions about whether Nvidia could regain access to China’s massive market.</p><p>Trump confirmed aboard Air Force One that he and Xi “did discuss chips” and that China would be “talking with Nvidia and others” about purchasing American-made semiconductors.</p><p>However, the president quickly clarified that the talks did not cover Nvidia’s most advanced Blackwell chip, a state-of-the-art AI processor he had previously described as “super-duper” and “probably 10 years ahead of any other chip”.</p><p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed optimism about the potential for re-entering China while acknowledging the final decision rests with Trump.</p><blockquote><p>We always hope to go back to China, and I believe Nvidia’s being there is good for both the United States and China.</p></blockquote><p><br/>The stakes couldn’t be higher for Nvidia.</p><p>After Beijing urged tech giants like ByteDance and Alibaba to stop buying its H20 chip, a China-compliant version of its flagship AI hardware, Nvidia’s business in the country has basically vanished.</p><p>CEO Jensen Huang said in October that the company’s share of China’s AI accelerator market plunged from about 95% to zero, wiping out billions in revenue.</p><p>That’s a huge blow, considering China once made up 20–25% of Nvidia’s $41 billion data center business.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/amazon-shares-surge-12-lifting-markets-as-aws-revival-sparks-stock-surge?post=532462\">Amazon Shares Surge 12%, Lifting Markets As AWS Revival Sparks Stock Surge </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/twilio-stock-soars-20-on-record-q3-results-and-strong-ai-driven-outlook?post=532435\">Twilio Stock Soars 20% On Record Q3 Results And Strong AI-Driven Outlook </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/colgate-palmolive-posts-higher-q3-sales-as-pricing-gains-offset-volume-decline?post=532302\">Colgate-Palmolive Posts Higher Q3 Sales As Pricing Gains Offset Volume Decline </a></p></div>",

Over the past 10 years, <strong>Netflix stock has had an average annualized return of 26% per year</strong>.</p><p>This year, Netflix stock is right at that number, <strong>up 26% year-to-date, trading at around $1,122 per share</strong>. But soon, investors will be able to <strong>buy Netflix stock at a much lower entry price</strong>.</p><p>On Thursday, the <strong>company announced a 10-for-1 stock split</strong>, meaning that each share of Netflix will be split into 10.</p><h2><br/>Why is Netflix doing a stock split?</h2><p>Companies typically do stock splits when their share price gets too lofty. Last year, the big one was <strong>Nvidia</strong> (Nasdaq: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/NVDA\">NVDA</a>), which did a 10-for-1 stock split in June that brought the share price down from around $1,200 to around $120 per share.</p><p>While it doesn’t change the actual value of the stock, it allows investors to <strong>own more shares of a stock than they did before</strong>. <strong>Broadcom</strong> (Nasdaq: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AVGO\">AVGO</a>) also did a 10-for-1 split last year, while <strong>Chipotle</strong> (Nasdaq: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/CMG\">CMG</a>) did a 50-for-1 split. Other recent big name stock splits include a 3-for-1 split by <strong>Walmart</strong> (NYSE: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/WMT\">WMT</a>) in 2024 and 20-for-1 splits by both <strong>Alphabet</strong> (Nasdaq: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GOOG\">GOOG</a>) and <strong>Amazon</strong> (Nasdaq: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AMZN\">AMZN</a>) in 2022.</p><p>With <strong>Netflix, the 10-for-1 split should bring the stock price down to $110 to $120 per share</strong>, depending on its share price when the split takes effect on November 17.</p><p>Each Netflix shareholder as of the closing bell on <strong>November 10 will receive, after the close of trading on November 14, nine additional shares for every share held</strong>. Trading is expected to begin on a split-adjusted basis on November 17.</p><p>Netflix officials said the purpose of the stock split is to <strong>“reset the market price of the company’s common stock </strong>to a range that will be more accessible to employees who participate in the company’s stock option program.”</p><p>While it’s not always the case, a stock split like this can boost the stock price, as more investors buy in, wanting to get the additional shares at a lower price. That seemed to be happening on Friday, as <strong>Netflix shares were up about 3% on the day</strong>.</p><p>Looking ahead, there are some new prime candidates for stock splits, namely <strong>Booking</strong> (Nasdaq: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/BKNG\">BKNG</a>) trading at over $5,000 per share, <strong>AutoZone </strong>(NYSE: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AZO\">AZO</a>) at over $3,600 per share, and <strong>BlackRock</strong> (NYSE: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/BLK\">BLK</a>) at around $1,100 per share, to name a few.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/company-news/nexus-international-plans-ipo-in-2027-with-revenue-on-track-for-1b-by-year-end?post=532379\">Nexus International Plans IPO In 2027 With Revenue On Track For $1B By Year-End</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/microsoft-stock-sinks-on-ai-spending?post=532007\">Microsoft Stock Sinks On AI Spending? </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/one-of-the-best-ai-stocks-just-got-better-after-blowout-earnings?post=531538\">One Of The Best AI Stocks Just Got Better After Blowout Earnings</a></p></div>",

I read pieces in the business press and random articles that more knowledgeable friends pass along. But I can’t say I have any knowledge of the nuts and bolts of the technology. </p><p>However, I can understand costs and the story there does not look very good for the United States AI industry. It looks like the latest offerings from China offer comparable speed in computing at a small fraction of the cost. According to this <a href=\"https://winbuzzer.com/2025/10/28/chinas-new-minimax-m2-model-challenges-gpt-5-and-claude-4-5-with-ultra-efficiency-top-performance-low-cost-xcxwbn/\">piece</a> on the new MiniMax M2 Model, it can deliver performance that is comparable to the cutting edge U.S. models, at just 8 percent of the cost. This system is also open source. That makes it cheaper to adopt and alter than proprietary models. </p><p>The need to develop efficient techniques was forced on China’s AI companies by the decision to deny them the most advanced computer chips produced by Nvidia and other chip makers. It now looks as though this prohibition may not have been a smart path from a competitive standpoint, even if it meant that the United States might have better AI in some abstract sense. Given the enormous need for electricity and water by data centers, it is a great thing that China seems to have designed systems requiring far less computing power, and therefore less electricity and water.</p><p>It is also worth noting that, while access to low-cost electricity may be a real constraint on the progress of AI in the United States, that is not likely to be a problem in China. Electricity there is plentiful, and the average <a href=\"https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/China/electricity_prices/\">price</a> is less than <a href=\"https://www.energybot.com/electricity-rates/\">half</a> as much as it is here. </p><p>With tech stocks hitting ever higher levels (Nvidia <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/nvda\">NVDA</a> just crossed $5 trillion in market capitalization), it’s hard to believe there is not a serious bubble in the U.S. markets. Having lived through two major bubbles in my adult life, I am used to the optimists coming up with ever whackier stories. </p><p>For example, for Nvidia’s current stock price to make sense, the company would have to earn about 10 percent of all projected corporate profits five years out. That’s not impossible, but I wouldn’t bet on it. I heard similar projections about Cisco Systems and other tech companies in the 1990s bubble. </p><p>I also remember being assured in the 00s that house prices could never plummet because they are not traded like stocks on an exchange. (I believe Federal Reserve Board Chair Alan Greenspan once pushed that line.) They also said that we had never seen the sort of nationwide plunge in house prices I was predicting. I pointed out that we had never seen the sort of nationwide run-up in prices that the country saw from 1996 to 2005.</p><p>Anyhow, it sure looks like a bubble to me. It will be ironic if the success of China’s AI is what ends up being the proximate cause of its bursting.  </p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/economics--politics/the-economics-of-trade-and-trumps-little-water-pistol?post=530544\">The Economics Of Trade And Trump’s Little Water Pistol </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/no-economists-didnt-get-it-wrong-on-trumps-tariffs?post=530430\">No, Economists Didn’t Get It Wrong On Trump’s Tariffs</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-trump-boom-a-legend-in-his-own-mind?post=529325\">The Trump Boom: A Legend In His Own Mind </a></p></div>",

It allocates to equities, fixed income and alternatives based on a proprietary model. The fund holds some ETFs but a lot of individual issues.

I included <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AQRIX\">AQRIX</a> because it is risk-parityish and somewhere in the literature I saw a quick reference to risk-parity.</p><p>Here's how actual RAA has done since inception. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"322\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjETMyobur3P8PKUIK_i_GuKbfV8wOMYgFcDyFTloElOehw-tOg8BGp4Jedz6ioYjrTtVcdvfBAfxnREpbTDl5Go3AUEaDjqTBvxG5ewIysLEScdeuYyjdbG3EVQzaSjAEbpxNPx4KxIg7jN0ZuXOelUlRd35L-CracpE1EHh8k8ln5GTx95H0Prg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>I threw FAPYX in because it is also risk-parity but only been around a couple of years. Without knowing how RAA was positioned earlier, it's hard to know why it lagged the replication we built. Looking at the drawdown chart, really only FAPYX seems to differentiate in any noticeable way.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"144\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjyLFbUtlgm7h7WGvxs6lMByThTmP8A_l-Hcg3YWnBtXVSC5cbdOTh7PJB88Dx4qQGdEl8q7gkJJKGypGTVFfsknX3jKOrDpXbUAyCX7xtJsrSM5QCSEMqNYJ2qBqtIwXRTOhYpXxFwIGmBdxj2FXkeeDU2_vVbuVPPkWZCKUnjksoOeyvbrGO2GQ\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>If the idea is to differentiate, then it is not clear that RAA does that but in fairness it might be too soon to know. It has been a little more volatile than <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/VBAIX\">VBAIX</a> or either risk parity fund and had a slightly larger drawdown. If the idea is simply to be a better mousetrap versus VBAIX then it might very well do that, it has so far. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"312\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh88YYUbdPhj-HvpMTZt8ft5rnZuCJOZ4_VbHbkdix7Fw0WqBhH0BTESFk_4qKTU_XDwlC8UlrPIgRm3S8dK7_tWMXst6J7hvvOqOUynFAN_6UdZMSB60aYOuSSx47AvRgsQvYZCeLKWluKrceCL6yAiyjlUnX8cnbETgWmNVqh_R3Mp1zTZUJ3Qg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Portfolio 2 just has the S&amp;P 500 and <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/ACWX\">ACWX</a> for equities, cat bonds, bank loans and plain vanilla for fixed income and I narrowed alts to just managed futures, gold and client/personal holding <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/BTAL\">BTAL</a> but it uses there allocation weightings. </p><p>A lot of Portfolio 2's out performance came from going down a lot less in 2022 but it has also been a smoother ride. Unintended is the reiteration of how important it is to go down less during that part of the cycle. Portfolio 2 lagged by a lot in 2023 and has been nothing special in the other years except 2022 yet it came out ahead for four+ years. </p><p>There doesn't appear to be anything obviously wrong with RAA but at this point, as noted above, I'm not sure it will differentiate. As a believer in alts, it seems plausible that it could be a slightly better mousetrap than VBAIX.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/is-strategys-debt-junk?post=531169\">Is Strategy's Debt Junk?</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/options/am-i-diversified?post=530505\">Am I Diversified?</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/theyre-here-levered-derivative-income-funds?post=529524\">They're Here!

For example, the S&amp;P 500’s current yield is only ~1.2%.</p><p>High-yield stocks can be particularly helpful in shoring up income after retirement. A $120,000 investment in stocks with an average dividend yield of 5% creates an average of <strong>$500 a month in dividends</strong>.</p><p>Next on our list of <a href=\"https://www.suredividend.com/high-dividend-stocks/\">high-dividend stocks</a> to review is Delek Logistics Partners (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/DKL\">DKL</a>).</p><h3><br/><strong>Business Overview</strong></h3><p>Delek Logistics Partners, LP (NYSE: DKL) is a master limited partnership (MLP) based in Brentwood, Tennessee, formed in 2012 by Delek US Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DK). The company owns and operates an extensive network of midstream energy infrastructure, including roughly 850 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines and a 700-mile crude oil gathering system across the southeastern United States and West Texas. Its assets play a key role in supporting Delek US’s refining operations, particularly at refineries in Tyler, Texas, and El Dorado, Arkansas.</p><p>In addition to transporting and storing crude oil, Delek Logistics also markets, distributes, and stores refined petroleum products for Delek US and third-party customers. The partnership benefits from stable, fee-based revenue under long-term agreements, which helps reduce exposure to commodity price volatility. Through steady expansion projects and strategic acquisitions, Delek Logistics continues to strengthen its position in the midstream sector, providing essential infrastructure that connects crude oil production areas with key refining and distribution markets.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"381\" src=\"https://www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-28-at-6.10.21-PM-768x418.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: <a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/790371638/files/doc_presentations/2025/Apr/01/DKL-Investor-Update-Apr-2025.pdf\">Investor Relations</a></p><p><br/>Delek Logistics Partners reported strong Q2 2025 results, with earnings per share of $1.41—beating estimates by $0.22. Revenue was $246.35 million, down 6.9% year-over-year and below expectations. Net income reached $44.6 million, and Adjusted EBITDA rose 18% to $120.9 million. The company reaffirmed full-year Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $480–$520 million and announced its 50th consecutive quarterly distribution increase to $1.115 per unit. Delek also completed the Libby 2 gas processing plant in New Mexico and issued $700 million in new debt maturing in 2033, boosting total liquidity to over $1 billion.</p><p>The Gathering and Processing segment led growth, with Adjusted EBITDA climbing to $78 million from $54.7 million last year, driven by recent acquisitions. The Wholesale Marketing and Terminalling segment declined to $23.3 million due to a contract reassignment, while Storage and Transportation held steady at $16.9 million. Operating cash flow rose to $107.4 million, and distributable cash flow totaled $72.5 million. President Avigal Soreq highlighted plans to expand gas-treating capacity at the Libby Complex and to maintain strong balance-sheet discipline. With solid liquidity, consistent distribution growth, and improving cash generation, Delek Logistics remains well-positioned for steady midstream expansion.</p><h3><br/><strong>Growth Prospects</strong></h3><p>The company has a strong growth outlook, with analysts expecting distributable cash flow (DCF) per unit to rise at a 3.7% annual rate over the next five years. Growth will be driven by expanding sour natural gas treating and acid gas injection operations, integrating the Gravity Water Midstream acquisition, and pursuing additional strategic deals. These initiatives aim to increase efficiency, scale, and profitability across key U.S. basins while supporting steady cash flow generation.</p><p>The company also launched a $150 million unit repurchase program to enhance unitholder value and maintain financial discipline. While DKL’s payout ratio is currently high, management expects distribution growth to trail DCF growth to preserve flexibility for reinvestment. Backed by a fee-based business model and a strong track record of execution, Delek Logistics is positioned for stable and sustainable growth through 2030.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-28-at-6.11.10-PM-768x428.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: <a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/790371638/files/doc_presentations/2025/Apr/01/DKL-Investor-Update-Apr-2025.pdf\">Investor Relations</a></p><h3><br/><strong>Competitive Advantages &amp; Recession Performance</strong></h3><p>Delek Logistics Partners has key competitive advantages, including a large midstream network connecting major production areas to refineries and long-term, fee-based contracts that reduce exposure to commodity price swings. Recent expansions and acquisitions, such as Libby 2 and Gravity Water Midstream, further increase scale, efficiency, and service capabilities.</p><p>The company has proven resilient in economic downturns, with diversified operations generating stable cash flow even when commodity prices fall. Disciplined capital management and contracted revenue streams help maintain distributions and financial stability, making DKL well-positioned to perform across market cycles.</p><h3><br/><strong>Dividend Analysis</strong></h3><p>Delek Logistics Partners’ annual dividend is $4.46 per share. At its recent share price, the stock has a high yield of 9.8%.</p><p>Given the company’s 2025 earnings outlook, EPS is expected to be $5.95 per share. As a result, the company is expected to pay out75% of its EPS to shareholders in dividends.</p><h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p><br/>Delek Logistics Partners combines a high distribution yield, steady growth, and potential valuation expansion, with distributable cash flow per unit projected to grow 3.7% annually through 2030. Strategic acquisitions and infrastructure projects, including Gravity Water Midstream and sour gas treating, support its growth and distribution track record.</p><p>However, with an elevated payout ratio and a dividend risk score of F, distribution growth may be limited. While total returns could reach 15.3% annually, the company is rated a Hold due to this moderate dividend risk.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/high-dividend-50-hooker-furnishings-corp?post=532424\">High Dividend 50: Hooker Furnishings Corp.</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/high-dividend-50-permrock-royalty-trust?post=532038\">High Dividend 50: PermRock Royalty Trust</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/high-dividend-50-golub-capital-bdc-inc?post=531808\">High Dividend 50: Golub Capital BDC, Inc.</a><br/></div>",

The pattern recently broke out to the upside on the chart. This signals a potential trend reversal for the cryptocurrency.</p><p>XRP currently trades around $2.5127 after a slight retracement from recent highs. The asset tested resistance near the order block zone around $2.80. Price action shows consolidation at current levels following the breakout.</p><p>The chart shows a measured move projection with three take-profit targets. The first target sits at approximately $2.6668 for the asset. The second target aligns with the current price level at $2.5127.</p><p>The third target appears near $2.4281 on the technical chart. These targets derive from Fibonacci retracement levels of recent price swings. The projection uses the swing high and low for calculation.</p><p>Canary Capital’s XRP ETF could open doors for future altcoin-based products. The fund deepens crypto’s integration into mainstream finance through regulated access. November 13 represents a milestone for XRP in traditional capital markets.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/bitcoin-ethereum-etfs-hit-hard-672m-vanishes-in-two-day-streak?post=532417\">Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs Hit Hard: $672M Vanishes In Two-Day Streak</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/exxon-mobil-corp-stock-q3-earnings-beat-estimates-as-production-hits-records-in-guyana-and-permian?post=532331\">Exxon Mobil Corp.

Higher? Lower? Inflation points win prizes... like higher borrowing costs. And don't forget the Sudden Death round - available to anyone willing to push their luck and gamble.</p><p>Speaking of luck, it’s pretty remarkable that <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/snaps/eurozone-inflation-drops-back-to-21-while-services-inflation-ticks-up/\">eurozone inflation</a> has been within a whisker of the European Central Bank’s target for more than a year now, isn’t it? No wonder the ECB keeps telling us it's in its <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/articles/ecb-presser-in-florence-oct25/\">happy place</a>.</p><p>But luck tends to run out eventually, so in round one, we’re asking: will eurozone inflation be higher or lower in twelve months' time? The winner nabs themselves a signed Christine Lagarde scarf.</p><p>It’s a tricky one, though the downside pressures are clear. A stronger euro is one. Energy is another; our team expects Brent crude prices to head consistently below 60 USD/bbl in 2026. The oil market is in surplus, and our expert Warren Patterson isn’t convinced that US sanctions on Russia will change much.</p><p>Food inflation is also coming lower. Meat remains an issue, but pressure from fresh produce is rapidly abating. Unprocessed food inflation was 5.5% in August; it was just 3.2% in October. Global input price pressures are easing off, judging by UN data.</p><p>The problem is services, as <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/snaps/eurozone-inflation-drops-back-to-21-while-services-inflation-ticks-up/\">Bert Colijn discusses</a> in his write-up of October’s figures. This accounts for the bulk of eurozone inflation right now, and it actually picked up this month. Housing and recreation have been key areas of stickiness.</p><p>The good news is that selling price expectations among service-sector companies are falling. And the ECB suggests negotiated wage growth is plummeting. But for the time being, sticky services inflation is enough to keep eurozone inflation close to target, our team thinks. And <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/articles/ecb-presser-in-florence-oct25/\">enough to prevent the ECB from cutting rates further</a> for the time being, too.</p><p><strong>The Answer is: <em>Slightly lower</em></strong> – inflation averages 1.9% in Q4 next year.</p><h3><br/><strong>Chart of the week: Contributions to headline inflation (YoY%)</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"399\" src=\"https://think.ing.com/uploads/charts/_w1200/312025-chart-inflation.png\" width=\"750\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: Macrobond, ING</p><h3><br/><strong>Place your bets...</strong><br/> </h3><p>On to round two, and let’s ask the same question of the US. This one is easier; <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/articles/cooler-us-inflation-gives-the-green-light-to-rate-cuts/\">inflation’s at 3% now</a> and should be closer to 2% by late next year. The bigger question is how long it takes to get there.</p><p>So far, tariff revenue has undershot. The average tariff rate was roughly 10% through July and August, below the 18% you’d expect based on what has been announced and 2024 import data. That either hints at poor enforcement or that US companies are shifting towards lower-tariff countries. Either way, we expect tariff collection to increase and that will push up goods inflation into year-end.</p><p>Fed boss Jerome Powell presumably is thinking the same thing. It would explain his <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/articles/fed-cuts-rates-25bp-suggest-december-is-not-a-foregone-conclusion/\">pushback</a> against an automatic cut in December. Markets have pared back the implied probability of another cut this year to 60%.</p><p>The thing is, though, ‘core goods’ – the bit affected by tariffs - are only 20% of the inflation basket. And pressure elsewhere is downwards. Energy costs, slowing housing rental growth and a weaker jobs market all point to lower inflation next year. James Knightley’s inflation forecast falls back to 2.2% late next year.</p><p>That’s why inflation shouldn’t be a barrier to further rate cuts. All the while, what little data we have on the jobs market remains a point of concern. Watch out for next week’s ADP employment estimate, which has fallen in three of the past four months. We're not forecasting a fourth, though that would reinforce the rate cut story. So too, increasingly, does America's never-ending shutdown. Food stamp payments may not go through this weekend, something 13% of Americans receive. James K tells me that the $8.3bn/month it pays out amounts to 1 in 10 dollars spent in grocery stores.</p><p>All reasons to expect another cut in December, and two more next year.</p><p><strong>The answer is:</strong><em> <strong>Lower inflation through 2026</strong></em>.</p><h3><br/><strong>Bonus question</strong><br/> </h3><p>Time for a Brucie Bonus! What about the UK? Well, the answer really depends on who you ask.</p><p>The hawks at the Bank of England – which meets next week – argue that inflation at 3.8% risks morphing into a much more persistent episode of price pressure. Rising food prices risk sparking inflation expectations and leading to a second round of price and wage rises.</p><p>We’re more inclined to side with the doves, who say the weaker jobs market means wage growth is more likely to slow. That latest data hints at that, too. And it showed food inflation is actually slowing. For now, this is just one month’s data. And one month’s data won’t settle this debate just yet. That’s why we still think a pause is most likely next week.</p><p>But inflation should look better next year – and that’s overwhelmingly down to services. The Bank’s preferred measure of “core services” has already slipped below 4%. And together with slower wage growth, it should ease further in the new year – and particularly from April, where a lot of service-sector price hikes are concentrated.</p><p>That’s why I’m still calling for three cuts from the Bank of England. Whether the next one comes in December or February depends largely on the budget. I’m now leaning more towards the former, though that’s increasingly priced in now. Further downside to gilt yields looks limited, barring a more aggressive fiscal tightening. Check out our budget scenarios <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/articles/uk-budget-four-scenarios-for-markets-as-gilt-yields-tumble/\">here</a>.</p><p>Get this right, you could get your rent paid for a year! (Sorry, Rachel Reeves).</p><p><strong>We think the Answer is: <em>Lower </em></strong>– headline CPI should fall to 2.5% in the Spring.</p><p>That’s it for this week, but don’t forget to sign up for our webinars next week on <a href=\"https://webinars.think.ing.com/pharmas-global-reset-economic-and\">pharma</a> (4 Nov) and all things <a href=\"https://webinars.think.ing.com/the-budget-the-bank-and-britains\">UK budget and Bank of England</a> (5 Nov).</p><p>As Brucie would say, it would be nice to see you – to see you nice!</p><h3><br/><strong>THINK Ahead in developed markets</strong><br/> </h3><p><strong>United States </strong>(James Knightley)</p><ul><li>With the government shutdown showing little sign of ending due to ongoing political intransigence, the data calendar will remain light. Nonetheless, we will get some key business surveys and consumer confidence readings, which will likely continue to show the economy cooling somewhat. The ISM manufacturing and service sector indicators are currently running at levels historically consistent with annual GDP growth in the region of 1-2%. This is respectable, but down from the 2-3% rates we have seen in recent years.</li><li>Another survey gaining increasing relevance is the ADP employment change number. This has been a poor guide for non-farm payrolls growth in recent years, but given that the report isn’t being published due to the shutdown, ADP is now of major market relevance. It has been reported that private sector payrolls have contracted for three of the past four months. They are now going to be releasing weekly updates in addition to the monthly figure we get on Wednesday and we look for an increase of around 40,000 given the lumpy nature of job changes. This certainly doesn’t signal the start of a revival, especially in light of recent high-profile job loss announcements at the likes of Amazon and UPS.</li><li>Rounding out the numbers will be the University of Michigan sentiment index. It indicates consumer confidence is weak, likely due to worries about tariff-induced price hikes and a cooling jobs market. A strong equity market performance may be supportive, but worries about inflation and jobs remain elevated and suggest that middle and lower-income household spending growth will continue to underperform that of higher-income households.</li></ul><p><strong>United Kingdom </strong>(James Smith)</p><ul><li><strong>Bank of England </strong>(Thu): Better inflation and wage data has revived the possibility of a November rate cut, though we still think it's unlikely. The vote could be close; a 5-4 vote in favour of keeping rates on hold, with some dissenters potentially voting for big, 50bp cuts. We don't expect the Bank to offer up much of a signal on whether the next cut will come in December, largely because it will want to see the contents of the late-November Autumn Budget first. But increasingly, we think a December cut is likely, and two more cuts in 2026 would likely follow.</li></ul><h3><br/><strong>THINK Ahead in Central and Eastern Europe</strong><br/> </h3><p><strong>Hungary</strong> (Peter Virovacz)</p><ul><li>Industry/Retail (Thu): Following the weak flash estimate of Q3 GDP in Hungary, we expect another set of data confirming that consumption is the only driver of the Hungarian economy. Retail sales are showing small monthly growth and, with the help of the low base, the yearly figure will be impressive. Due to the impact of working days, the raw figures of industrial production will appear strong, but the 1.3% month-on-month increase is far from the revival we used to see after the summer shutdowns in manufacturing. Therefore, we would rather label this as another abysmal performance.</li></ul><p><strong>Czech Republic </strong>(Frantisek Taborsky)</p><ul><li>The CNB is expected to keep rates unchanged at 3.50% in its penultimate meeting of the year, with the spotlight on forward guidance and a new forecast. While headline inflation surprised to the downside, core inflation and wage growth remain elevated, reinforcing a hawkish bias. The August forecast is broadly on track, but wage dynamics and FX developments may prompt some upward revisions. Energy subsidies from the new government could ease headline inflation, but core pressures persist. Overall, the CNB is likely to maintain a restrictive stance and balanced guidance, keeping rate cuts or hikes off the table for now.</li></ul><p><strong>Turkey </strong>(Muhammet Mercan)</p><ul><li>We expect October inflation at 2.6% MoM, given continuing pricing pressures in food with adverse weather conditions, in addition to the ongoing stickiness in services, seasonality in clothing and hikes in cigarette prices, while risks are on the upside. Annual inflation, on the other hand, will slightly drop to 33% from 33.3% a month ago, thanks to a favourable base.</li></ul><h3><br/><strong>Key events in developed markets next week</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://think.ing.com/uploads/charts/_w800/3010DMCal.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: Refinitiv, ING</p><h3><br/><strong>Key events in EMEA next week</strong><br/> </h3><p> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://think.ing.com/uploads/charts/_w800/3010EMEA_Cal_1.png\"/></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/eurozone-inflation-drops-back-to-21-as-services-inflation-ticks-up?post=532414\">Eurozone Inflation Drops Back To 2.1% As Services Inflation Ticks Up </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/asia-week-ahead-rba-rate-decision-and-key-data-on-china-japan-korea-taiwan-and-philippines?post=532193\">Asia Week Ahead: RBA Rate Decision And Key Data On China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, And Philippines </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/fx-daily-dollar-squeezing-every-bit-of-powells-hawkishness?post=532173\">FX Daily: Dollar Squeezing Every Bit Of Powell’s Hawkishness </a><br/></div>",

more than 12% on Friday to a 52-week high after the company posted stronger-than-expected third-quarter results and signaled renewed momentum in its cloud computing and advertising businesses.</p><p>The performance eased investor concerns about Amazon Web Services (AWS), which had shown signs of slowing earlier this year, and reignited confidence in the tech giant’s growth trajectory amid rising AI demand.</p><p>The stock surge also powered the broader market indices in the session.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.31% to around 47,671.99, just below its record close of 47,706 set on October 28.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.8%, while the Nasdaq advanced roughly 1.5%, powered by Amazon’s surge.</p><h3><br/><strong>AWS growth accelerates after period of uncertainty</strong><br/> </h3><p>AWS revenue climbed <a href=\"https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/30/amazon-shares-surge-10-as-aws-posts-strongest-growth-since-2022/\">20% year-over-year to $33 billion</a> in the September quarter, topping analyst expectations of $32.5 billion and marking its fastest growth in nearly three years.</p><p>The cloud division’s rebound comes after several quarters of deceleration that had raised questions about Amazon’s competitiveness in artificial intelligence and enterprise computing.</p><p>Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney described the resurgence as an “AWS unlock,” highlighting a 150% sequential jump in revenue from Amazon’s Trainium custom-chip business—an area that had previously been a source of investor skepticism.</p><p>“The AI narrative has flipped positive for AWS,” Mahaney wrote, noting that demand for AI infrastructure and training workloads has reignited growth.</p><p>Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt echoed the sentiment, observing a “positive narrative shift” as AWS growth improved from 17.5% in the June quarter to 20.2% in the September period.</p><p>Devitt projects that AWS growth could reach 22% in the December quarter, citing rising demand, expanding backlog, and higher capital expenditures.</p><p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy emphasized that demand for AI and core infrastructure remains strong, saying the company has doubled AWS capacity since 2022 and plans to double it again by 2027.</p><p>The company now expects capital expenditures to reach $125 billion this year, up from $100 billion, and anticipates further increases in 2026.</p><h3><br/><strong>Broader business strengthens amid advertising and retail momentum</strong><br/> </h3><p>While AWS remains Amazon’s profit engine, other segments also posted strong results.</p><p>Advertising revenue jumped 24% year-over-year, accelerating from the 23% pace recorded in the prior quarter.</p><p>Analysts highlighted the segment’s growing importance to Amazon’s bottom line, given its high margins relative to the company’s retail operations.</p><p>Pivotal Research Group’s Jeffrey Wlodarczak noted that Amazon “operates two high-margin growthy businesses”—AWS and advertising—alongside its vast logistics network.</p><p>He said AI and robotics could help Amazon “materially juice margins” over the medium to long term.</p><p>Retail, though lower-margin, continues to be Amazon’s revenue backbone.</p><p>Mahaney called retail growth “robust” and “consistent,” while Mizuho’s Jordan Klein described both e-commerce and advertising as “monsters” with strong near-term catalysts.</p><h3><br/><strong>Earnings beat, analyst optimism push shares to record high</strong><br/> </h3><p>For the September quarter, Amazon reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.95, far exceeding Wall Street’s $1.57 consensus estimate.</p><p>Revenue reached $180.2 billion, ahead of expectations of $177.9 billion, with strong contributions from cloud and advertising.</p><p>The company guided fourth-quarter revenue between $206 billion and $213 billion, compared with analysts’ $208.4 billion forecast.</p><p>The strong results sent Amazon stock up as

But the subsequent launch of bilateral trade negotiations and the announcement of interim trade deals helped investors put the tariff issue behind them.</p><p>The prevailing consensus after the April tariff announcements is that, although many tariff-related matters remain outstanding, we now have a clearer understanding of the current situation.</p><p>A constructive view of the economy is that, while tariffs-induced uncertainty will likely affect near-term growth, the U.S. economy's fundamentals remain rock-solid. This view is also optimistic about the Trump administration's non-trade policy agenda, including taxes and regulatory reform. On top of all this is the ongoing AI-centric spending boom, largely independent of fiscal and monetary policy.</p><p>Market bears see this market optimism as without a fundamental basis. This line of thinking sees the tariff-induced uncertainty severe enough to push the economy close to a recessionary growth level.<br/><br/>Market bears doubt that the upcoming Fed easing will boost growth, expecting sluggish expansion even as inflation remains high. Worries about macroeconomic fiscal imbalances and stock market valuations also surface in the bearish view of the market.</p><p>The interplay of these competing views will determine how the market performs in the coming months and quarters. To that end, let's examine the landscape of bullish and bearish arguments to help you make up your own mind.</p><p>Let's talk about the <u><strong>Bull</strong></u> case first.</p><p><strong>The Economy's Strong Foundation:</strong> The U.S. economy has literally been the envy of the world over the last few years, and those fundamentals are still intact despite continuing worries about their durability. It is this inherent resilience that allowed the U.S. economy to continue growing in the face of extraordinary Fed tightening over the last couple of years and is expected to be at play in the current tariff-centric policy environment.</p><p>Growth is expected to decelerate amid uncertainty over the tariff issue. We see this in consensus GDP growth expectations for this year, which are notably below the +2.8% growth pace in 2024 and +2.9% in 2023. These expectations show that the economy entered the current period of policy uncertainty in excellent shape.</p><p>We will not see the Q3 GDP report until after the government shutdown is behind us (October 30th was the scheduled date), but the expectation is another +3%-plus growth reading. The ongoing shutdown will weigh on Q4 growth, but history suggests the negative impact mostly reverses in the following quarter.</p><p>A stable consumer and business spending backdrop, underpinned by a robust labor market, ensures that growth remains positive, albeit at a lower trajectory. Tied to all this is the secular boom in AI-centric spending, expected to remain in place for at least the next two years before decelerating.</p><p>This is beneficial to the central bank's fight against inflation, as moderating economic growth pushes inflation readings toward the Fed's 2% target. The Fed’s latest policy decision was no surprise to anyone in the market, and they remain on track to cut rates in the subsequent few meetings as well.</p><p>All in all, the strong pillars of the U.S. economic foundation run contrary to the signs of trouble typically seen ahead.</p><p><strong>The Fed's Easing Cycle:</strong> The government shutdown has come on top of the Trump administration's trade agenda, adding uncertainty to market inflation and Fed expectations. The absence of critical economic data due to the shutdown notwithstanding, the bulls see the inflation issue as heading toward a resolution satisfactory to the central bank, allowing the Fed to continue easing policy.</p><p>This view doesn't see tariffs as inherently inflationary, but acknowledges that emerging signs of labor-market softness are likely a result of tariff-induced moderation in economic growth.</p><p>The Fed’s decision to lower interest rates at the latest meeting was in line with market expectations, with a majority of market participants expecting the December meeting to bring in another rate cut announcement.</p><p>Market bulls expect the Fed to stay on an easing path, with the first two to three meetings of the New Year likely to produce consistent quarter-point rate cuts. This will allow the central bank to get ahead of any threats to the labor market, the other part of the Fed’s dual mandate.</p><p><strong>Valuation &amp; Earnings:</strong> Tied to the economic and interest rate outlook is the question of stock market valuation that still looks reasonable given the expected interest rate trajectory.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index is currently trading at 23.5X next year’s earnings estimates, up from 18.7X at the April 2025 bottom and 15.4X at the end of September 2022. This is close to the 10-year high multiple for the market, which is feeding the ‘AI bubble’ narrative in parts of the market. We should keep in mind that the index peaked at 26X at year-end 1999 in the Tech bubble.</p><p>The appropriateness or otherwise of valuation multiples has to be seen in the context of the interest rate outlook. Valuation multiples typically expand when the Fed eases policy, particularly when the catalyst for the easing is confidence about inflation rather than growth fears.</p><p>Earnings outlook is a key part of the valuation discussion. Contrary to the earlier doom-and-gloom fears, the ongoing 2025 Q3 earnings season is showing a steadily improving earnings outlook for the coming periods. You can clearly see this in earnings expectations for 2025 Q4 and beyond.</p><p>What we are seeing this earnings season is that while companies in several industries lack adequate visibility into their businesses, many others continue to drive sales and earnings growth even in this environment. We are seeing many of these leaders from a variety of sectors, including Finance and Technology, deliver strong quarterly results and describe trends in their businesses in reassuring terms despite tariff uncertainty.</p><p>Current consensus expectations for this year and next reflect broad-based, vigorous growth, not driven by one or two sectors. While estimates had come down sharply earlier this year, the trend has totally shifted now, with estimates broadly reflecting a stable-to-positive trend line.</p><p>In the absence of a nasty economic downturn, the earnings picture can actually serve as a tailwind for the stock market amid easing Fed policy.</p><p>Let's see what the <u><strong>Bears</strong></u> have to say in response.</p><p><strong>The Market's Fed Exuberance:</strong> The Fed did the expected at its latest policy meeting, despite being forced to ‘fly blind’ in the absence of economic data due to the government shutdown.</p><p>The expectation is for another rate cut in December, with many in the market hoping for continued rate cuts in the first few meetings in 2026, provided incoming economic data over the coming weeks remains supportive.</p><p>The view that tariffs cause only a one-time bump in inflation is plausible, but far from proven at this stage, particularly since the full tariff impact has yet to seep through to the economy.</p><p>An accelerated easing cycle along the lines outlined here to forestall softness in the labor market risks entrenching inflation expectations at a level that is materially above the Fed’s target. Inflation expectations become entrenched at elevated levels when households and businesses expect prices to remain high, potentially limiting the Fed’s ability to fight inflation.</p><p>Tied to the first risk is the prospect that the economy's true health may be far more fragile than recent GDP reading suggests. Low-income households have been struggling for a while, but anecdotal evidence from earnings calls suggests that even better-off consumers are getting more cautious in their spending plans. On top of this is the diminished outlook for business spending beyond the AI space, at least in the near term, due to policy uncertainty.</p><p>In the worst-case scenario, stalled progress on the inflation front may prevent the Fed from easing policy even as the economy continues to weaken, leading to the so-called 'stagflation' scenario. But even if that isn't the case and the Fed continues to ease in December and the subsequent meetings, the decelerating momentum in the economy may be hard to stop by then.</p><p><strong>The Valuation Reality Check:</strong> Given the bears' view that the prudent course for the Fed is to be in no hurry to start easing policy in the absence of any economic issues, they see no fundamental reason for valuation multiples to expand from current record levels.</p><p>Higher-for-longer interest rates should have a direct impact on the prices of all asset classes, stocks included. Everything else constant, investors will use a higher discount rate, a function of interest rates, to value the future cash flows of the companies they want to invest in.</p><p>This means lower stock prices in a higher-interest-rate environment.</p><p><strong>The Earnings Growth Question:</strong> Current consensus earnings estimates show +9.7% growth this year and +12.7% growth in 2026, following +10.7% in 2024.</p><p>Market bears see these earnings growth expectations as inconsistent with an economy facing a significant tariff increase. The full extent of the emerging tariff regime has yet to take effect, but the aggregate effective tariff rate is already more than five times higher than it was for the last many decades. It is hard to envision that this tariff jump will have no impact on inflation, economic growth, or corporate earnings.</p><p>Notwithstanding the tough going in the manufacturing sector and the growth implications of still-elevated treasury yields despite Fed easing, earnings expectations for this year and next will need to come down significantly to align with economic reality.</p><p><br/><strong>Where Do I Stand?</strong></p><p>While I acknowledge that the pace of Fed easing beyond the December meeting may be slower than many in the market expect, I am skeptical of the higher-for-longer Fed policy view and see this scenario as a low-probability event.</p><p>The current Fed Funds rate level is still almost twice what central bank officials and economists see as the 'neutral' policy rate. At the 'neutral' policy rate, Fed policy is neither 'stimulating' nor 'restricting' economic activity.</p><p>Even if further progress on the inflation front is much slower than the Fed and the market are currently projecting, the central bank has plenty of cushion in its policy arsenal to start easing without adversely affecting its inflation fight. This doesn't mean that the Fed should put rate cuts on autopilot, but it does suggest that they don't need to wait for an extended period to consolidate the inflation gains.</p><p>Regular readers of my earnings commentary know that the earnings picture remains resilient, with the latest development being upward revisions to estimates for the current and upcoming periods.</p><p>The overall policy thrust of the Trump administration is expected to be pro-growth and pro-market. Still, it is nevertheless reasonable to expect some period of market tentativeness as we sort through the bilateral trade negotiations. We remain confident that investors will soon come around to our view of inflation, earnings, and the much more positive times ahead. The market’s rebound from the April lows reflects this view of the economy and market.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-enormous-earnings-power-of-the-mag-7-group?post=532430\">The Enormous Earnings Power Of The Mag 7 Group </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/positive-picture-emerging-from-q3-earnings-season?post=531647\">Positive Picture Emerging From Q3 Earnings Season </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/previewing-mag-7-earnings-what-investors-should-know?post=530367\">Previewing Mag 7 Earnings: What Investors Should Know</a><br/></div>",

Money managers rotated out during quarter-end window dressing. Retail traders avoided it because the chart looked like death.</p><p>I stepped in and bought 50 shares at $165.</p><p>Not because I love yoga pants. Not because I'm bullish on retail. Because the math stopped making sense at these levels.</p><p>The stock traded at 11x earnings with 16% net margins and 22% return on assets. At that valuation, this isn't a trade. It's theft.</p><p>Charts show you what happened. Numbers show you what something's worth. When those two disconnect completely, that's your opportunity.</p><p>Every major reversal starts with stocks trading at absurd disconnects from their actual value. </p><p>The math says buy, but everyone stays away because the chart looks broken. Then algorithms finally recognize the setup, and the stock doubles in months.</p><p>Spotting one of these disconnects is straightforward when you dig into the numbers.</p><p>Finding all of them before algorithms confirm the reversal is impossible manually.</p><p>Today I'm showing you the five-minute framework that found this opportunity.</p><p><br/><strong>The Breakdown Nobody Believes</strong></p><p>Pull up Lululemon's two-year chart. What do you see?</p><p>Straight down. Relentless selling. No support. No bounce. Just algorithmic destruction walking the stock lower in a perfect downward channel.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://theotrade.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-31-at-1.44.48-PM.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"489\" src=\"https://theotrade.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-31-at-1.44.48-PM.png\" width=\"750\"/></a></p><p><br/>Most traders stop looking right there. The chart says sell. Momentum says avoid. Everyone who bought higher is underwater. Stay away.</p><p>That's exactly when I start digging into numbers.</p><p>The chart doesn't show fundamentals improving while the stock collapsed. It doesn't show valuation compressing to levels that make no mathematical sense. It especially doesn't show the algorithmic channel that just broke.</p><p><br/><strong>The Numbers Wall Street Ignores</strong></p><p>I ran a five-minute fundamental analysis. Not complex. Not academic. Just the metrics that actually matter.</p><ul><li><strong>Return on assets:</strong> 22%. For a retail company, that's exceptional. Compare that to Nike at 15% or any department store at 8%. Lululemon generates $22 in profit for every $100 in assets.</li><li><strong>Net margins:</strong> 16%. Nike delivers 10%. Under Armour barely scrapes 4%. Lululemon earns 16 cents on every dollar of sales while competitors struggle to maintain single digits.</li><li><strong>PE ratio:</strong> 11 times earnings. Nike trades at 33 times. The five-year average for Lululemon itself was 35 times. This stock compressed from bubble valuation to deep value territory in 24 months.</li><li><strong>Debt-to-equity:</strong> 23%. They're barely leveraged. Current ratio of 3.0 means massive cash reserves. They could acquire a competitor tomorrow without blinking.</li></ul><p>I ran this same analysis against every retail peer I could find. Lululemon beats them all on margins. Beats them all on asset efficiency. Trades at a fraction of their multiples.</p><p>The disconnect became impossible to ignore. Strong fundamentals, absurd valuation, pure chart-based selling with zero analysis behind it.</p><p><br/><strong>The Technical Signal That Triggered My Buy</strong></p><p>The stock broke outside the two-year downward channel at $165.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://theotrade.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-31-at-1.44.51-PM.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://theotrade.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-31-at-1.44.51-PM.png\" width=\"750\"/></a></p><p><br/>This matters for one specific reason. Algorithms that systematically sold every bounce for 24 months just detected a pattern change. The machines aren't defending the downward slope anymore.</p><p>The weekly MACD sits deep underwater at negative 40. But watch that indicator. If it pivots upward toward the signal line, this becomes the comeback trade of the year. That's the momentum shift that separates temporary bounces from sustained reversals.</p><p>Money flow tells the rest of the story. Nobody owns this stock anymore. All the overhead supply got flushed out during the two-year collapse. Everyone who bought at $300, $400, $500 has already capitulated. There's nothing left blocking a move higher.</p><p><br/><strong>The Risk-Reward Math</strong></p><p>I bought 50 shares at $165. My risk? Maybe $20 downside to book value support. That's $1,000 total exposure.</p><p>My reward? If this stock gets above $200 and algorithms confirm the reversal, it's going to $450. That's not hopium. That's the math of what happens when deep value meets technical breakout.</p><p>Once algos recognize a reversal setup, the move accelerates systematically. Buying pressure replaces selling pressure. Short covering adds fuel. Institutions rotate into beaten-down names with improving fundamentals. Retail finally notices after the move is already 30% complete.</p><p>I've watched this pattern repeat. FedEx collapsed to absurd levels, then doubled. Meta got destroyed, then ran 200%. Target broke down hard, then rallied 40% in weeks. Good companies get beaten to irrational prices. Charts look terrible. Everyone stays away. Then algorithms flip, and the stock explodes.</p><p><br/><strong>My Exit Strategy</strong></p><p>I'll sell 25 shares if it hits $185. Lock in some profit. Hold the rest through December 11th earnings.</p><p>If the weekly MACD turns positive and the stock breaks $200, I'll hold for $250. If I'm wrong and it drops to $145, I'll add more. Because at that valuation, this becomes a floor trade where fundamentals simply won't let it go much lower.</p><p>Michael Burry bought a block for around $180 for the same reasons I did. The fundamental disconnect was too obvious. When someone who predicted the housing crisis steps into a hated retail stock, that confirms the value proposition exists. I'm not following him. We're both following the math.</p><p><br/><strong>The Framework That Finds These Setups</strong></p><p>Wall Street trades momentum. They buy what's going up and sell what's going down. That works until it doesn't.</p><p>The opportunity exists in the gap between chart-based selling and fundamental reality. When those two things disconnect completely, you get setups like Lululemon.</p><p>The algorithms will eventually figure this out. They always do. The question is whether you're positioned when they flip from systematic selling to systematic buying.</p><p>Run your own five-minute analysis on beaten-down stocks. Check the margins against competitors. Compare the valuation to historical norms and peer groups. Look for the technical confirmation when downward channels break. Then size appropriately with defined risk.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/most-market-sectors-are-getting-smoked?post=532408\">Most Market Sectors Are Getting Smoked</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/three-consumer-names-about-to-get-crushed?post=532021\">Three Consumer Names About To Get Crushed </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-fed-cut-rates-bonds-collapsed-instead?post=531537\">The Fed Cut Rates.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Free stock photo of appartment, at home, beautiful home\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/4009402/pexels-photo-4009402.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/couple-love-date-sitting-4009402/\" target=\"_blank\">Pexels</a></em></p><p><br/>Netflix (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/nflx\">NFLX</a>) is one of the most recognizable companies in the world. It has a massive audience, strong brand awareness, and a long history of reshaping how we watch TV. Recently, Netflix announced a 10:1 stock split. A split does not change the value of the company, but it lowers the price per share and often makes the stock feel more accessible to everyday investors.</p><p>Financial media loves these moments because they tend to create attention, curiosity, and sometimes fear of missing out.</p><p>But here is the part many people are overlooking. The split announcement came right after an earnings call that did not land smoothly. The quarter included a large one-time tax expense from Brazil that affected the reported results and caught investors off guard. The reaction in the market was lukewarm. So now we have two stories happening at once: an exciting stock split that gets headlines and an earnings situation that introduces uncertainty.</p><p>This is why we are taking a deeper look. Instead of reacting to hype or fear, we want to understand what is actually happening underneath. What is strong. What is changing. And what matters for long-term investors. This blog will help you see beyond the headlines.</p><p>The IDDA Analysis framework is used to analyze companies and determine which are right for you. There are five steps to the process:</p><ol><li><strong>Capital Analysis</strong><br/>\tYour personal risk tolerance.</li><li><strong>Intentional Analysis</strong><br/>\tYour unique financial goals and timelines based on your age, health, and lifestyle.</li><li><strong>Fundamental Analysis</strong><br/>\tThe viability of the asset based on company performance, financial health, and market position.</li><li><strong>Sentimental Analysis</strong><br/>\tThe current emotions of Wall Street and other market participants.</li><li><strong>Technical Analysis</strong><br/>\tHistorical price action to identify key psychological levels and market patterns.</li></ol><p>Let’s dive into the IDDA analysis to assess <strong>Netflix’s</strong> fundamental, sentimental, and technical outlook.</p><p>IDDA Point 1&amp;2: Capital &amp; Intentional</p><p>The capital and intentional analysis need to be conducted by you.</p><p>Select your assets in alignment with your financial goals. Listen to your intuition about each asset, but remember to invest based on your own values, not just because of recommendations from others.</p><p>IDDA Point 3: Fundamental</p><p><strong>Revenue Growth and Business Model Strength</strong></p><p>Netflix continues to generate strong and steady revenue from monthly subscriptions. Their business model is simple. People pay every month to watch shows and movies. This gives Netflix predictable cash flow and the ability to invest in more content. Even with competition in streaming, Netflix remains one of the biggest platforms in the world.</p><p><strong>10:1 Stock Split Announced</strong></p><p>Netflix announced a 10:1 stock split. A split does not change the true value of the company, but it lowers the price per share and can make the stock feel more affordable to new investors. This often increases market attention and trading activity. It does not improve business fundamentals directly but can support sentiment and liquidity.</p><p><strong>Growing Advertising Business</strong></p><p>Netflix has started offering a lower priced plan with ads. This is bringing in new users who want something cheaper, and it also gives Netflix a new way to earn money from advertisers. As more big brands move their marketing budgets into streaming, Netflix benefits. This can be an important long term growth engine.</p><p><strong>Live Sports and Events Strategy</strong></p><p>Netflix is adding live events like WWE and NFL holiday games. Live content helps keep people subscribed because it creates habits and routine viewing. This is different from binge watching, which can lead to quick cancellations. Live programming can help Netflix keep users longer and attract new ones.</p><p><strong>Global Reach and Local Content</strong></p><p>Netflix creates shows in many languages for many regions. This helps the company connect with global audiences and reduces the risk of relying only on the United States market. Popular shows from Korea, India, Spain, and the Middle East help Netflix grow worldwide.</p><p><strong>Earnings Call Impact and One Time Tax Expense</strong></p><p>Recent earnings were affected by a large tax bill in Brazil, which reduced reported profit and surprised investors. This does not mean the business is weak, but it did create mixed reactions in the market. Investors may wait to see the next quarter before making big moves.</p><p><strong>High Content Costs</strong></p><p>Creating and buying shows is very expensive. Netflix must continue to invest to stay competitive. If content spending rises faster than revenue, profit margins can get squeezed. This is something long term investors should monitor.</p><p><strong>Strong Competition in Streaming</strong></p><p>Netflix competes with Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, and others. Viewers have many options. If other platforms offer more attractive content or better pricing, Netflix can lose audience attention. Competition pressure is still real.</p><p><strong>Fundamental Risk Level: Medium</strong><br/><br/>The business is strong and global with steady revenue. However, competition remains high and content costs must be managed carefully over time.</p><p>IDDA Point 4: Sentimental</p><p>Overall sentiment is <strong>cautiously bullish</strong> for Netflix. Investors are interested because the company continues to grow revenue and expand into new areas like advertising and live events. However, the recent earnings softness and the timing of the stock split have created mixed emotions. Some investors are excited. Some are waiting for more clarity.</p><p><strong>Strengths</strong></p><p><strong>Positive reaction to the 10:1 stock split</strong></p><p>Stock splits do not change the value of the company, but they can increase investor interest because the price per share becomes more accessible. This often brings new retail investors and can create fresh momentum.</p><p><strong>Growing confidence in the advertising strategy</strong></p><p>Analysts and advertisers see strong potential in Netflix’s ad tier. As more brands look for alternatives to traditional TV, Netflix is positioned to benefit from shifting advertising budgets.</p><p><strong>Live events are gaining attention</strong></p><p>Deals with WWE and NFL holiday games have attracted interest because live content helps improve subscriber retention. Investors see this as a strategic play to strengthen engagement and reduce churn.</p><p><strong>Strong brand loyalty and cultural relevance</strong></p><p>Netflix remains a household name with global reach. Even with competition, the brand is still one of the strongest in entertainment. This supports long term confidence.</p><p><strong>Risks</strong></p><p><strong>Earnings reaction created hesitation</strong></p><p>The recent quarter included a surprise tax expense from Brazil, which made results look weaker. Some investors prefer to wait for the next earnings call to see if it was truly a one time issue.</p><p><strong>Competition remains intense in streaming</strong></p><p>Disney, Amazon, YouTube, and others are fighting for viewer attention. If these platforms produce stronger content or pricing models, Netflix could face subscriber pressure.</p><p><strong>Content costs are still high</strong></p><p>To stay competitive, Netflix must spend heavily on producing shows and acquiring rights. If spending grows faster than revenue, profit margins may come under pressure, which can worry investors.</p><p><strong>Market sensitivity to headlines</strong></p><p>Streaming stocks tend to move based on emotion, trending stories, and subscriber expectations. This can create short term volatility even when long term fundamentals remain stable.</p><p><strong>Sentimental Risk Level:</strong> <strong>Medium</strong></p><p>There is optimism around the split and new business opportunities, but investors are watching competition and profitability carefully.</p><p><strong>Weekly Chart</strong></p><p><strong>Long-Term Uptrend</strong></p><p>On the weekly chart, Netflix has been in a clear upward trend since mid 2022. Even when the price has taken pauses or pullbacks, the broader direction remains upward. This shows that buyers have controlled the market over the longer term.</p><p><strong>Recent Pullback Inside the Uptrend</strong></p><p>There has been a downward move recently after reaching a local high. This type of pullback is common during long uptrends as the market rebalances and traders take profit. The key question is whether price holds above important support zones.</p><p><strong>Price Above the Ichimoku Cloud</strong></p><p>The price remains above the Ichimoku Cloud on the weekly timeframe. This is a standard signal that the long-term trend is still bullish. When price stays above the cloud, it suggests that buyers remain in control overall.</p><p><strong>Cloud Thickness Suggests Stable Trend Structure</strong></p><p>The cloud below the price appears wide rather than thin. A wide cloud indicates stronger trend support and can help the price avoid sharp reversals.</p><p><strong>RSI Shows Normal Trend Behavior</strong></p><p>On the weekly chart, the RSI is not in an extreme overbought or oversold zone. This suggests the market is not stretched and has room to move in either direction depending on momentum and news.</p><p><strong>50% Fibonacci Retracement Levels Matter Now</strong></p><p>The most important factor in the short term will be whether price holds above the 50% of the Fibonacci retracement level which is currently sitting in right now. A bounce from this level at $1,089 could continue the long-term uptrend. A breakdown below this level would suggest a deeper correction.</p><p><strong>Technical Summary</strong><br/>The long-term technical outlook remains bullish based on price staying above the Ichimoku Cloud and maintaining its higher-trend structure since 2022. The recent pullback does not break the overall uptrend, but investors may want to watch how price behaves near the level $1,089 to understand whether momentum is shifting or continuing upward.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"598\" src=\"https://investdiva.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-25-1024x598.png\" width=\"1024\"/></p><p><strong>Buy Limit (BL) levels:</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"> $1,085.72 – High Fill Probability</p><p> $1,021.91.XX – Moderate Fill Probability</p><p> $937.79 – Low Fill Probability</p><p>Profit Taking Ideas:</p><p>1,339.00 – High Fill Probability</p><p>1,451.55 – Moderate Fill Probability</p><p>1,537.93 – Low Fill Probability</p><p>Here are the Invest Diva ‘Confidence Compass’ questions to ask yourself before buying at each level:</p><ol><li>If I buy at this price and the price drops by another 50%, how would I feel? Would I panic, or would I buy more to dollar-cost average at lower prices? (hint: this question also reveals your CONFIDENCE in the asset you’re planning to invest in).</li><li>If I don’t buy at this price and the stock suddenly turns around and starts going up again, will I beat myself up for not having bought at this level?</li></ol><p><em>Remember: Investing is personal, and what is right for me might not be right for you. Always do your own due diligence. You should ONLY invest based on your own risk tolerance and your timeframe for reaching your portfolio goals</em></p><p><strong>Technical Risk Level:</strong> <strong>Medium</strong></p><p>The long-term trend remains upward and the price is still positioned above the Ichimoku cloud, which supports a bullish structure. However, the recent pullback means short-term movement could continue to fluctuate before direction becomes clear. If price holds key support levels, the uptrend can continue. If support breaks, the correction may deepen.</p><p>Summary: Final Thoughts</p><p>Netflix remains a strong global brand with a subscription model that generates steady revenue and supports long term growth. The company is expanding its business with an ad-supported plan and live event programming, which can improve engagement and create new revenue streams over time. The recent 10:1 stock split brings more attention to the stock, but it does not change the actual value of the company. It simply makes the shares appear more accessible and may increase trading activity among retail investors.</p><p>At the same time, Netflix faces meaningful challenges. The recent earnings reaction reminded investors that unexpected costs or financial adjustments can influence short term sentiment. The streaming industry also remains crowded, which forces Netflix to continue spending on new content to stay competitive. High content investment helps keep subscribers, but it can pressure profit margins if not managed carefully.</p><p>From a technical perspective, the long term trend is still upward, with price positioned above the Ichimoku cloud on the weekly chart. The recent pullback suggests caution in the short term, and price behavior around support levels will help indicate what comes next.</p><p>Overall, Netflix appears fundamentally stable with room for strategic growth, but it operates in a competitive environment that requires ongoing reinvestment. Patience and clarity are useful here. This is not a company that needs to be rushed into. It is one to watch with a long term mindset.</p><p><strong>Overall Risk Level:</strong> <strong>Medium</strong></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/beyond-meat-stock-900-million-debt-deal-news-lifeline-or-last-gasp-before-collapse?post=530559\">Beyond Meat Stock $900 Million Debt Deal News: Lifeline Or Last Gasp Before Collapse? </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/ferrari-stock-plunged-hard-is-it-a-short-term-drop-or-a-long-term-decline?post=529332\">Ferrari Stock Plunged Hard.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Gold, Bars, Wealth, Finance, Gold Bars, Deposit\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2013/07/18/10/56/gold-163519_960_720.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/photos/gold-bars-wealth-finance-gold-bars-163519/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em></p><p><br/>Investors chasing gold’s upside momentum was a major driver of its recent surge. Their relentless capital inflows helped catapult gold up to extraordinarily-overbought levels, really ramping risks for a reversal. As that indeed sure looks underway now, investors’ chasing has also turned on a dime to fleeing. While their capital outflows haven’t grown large yet, that selling could easily snowball deepening gold’s drawdown.</p><p>Gold investment demand is challenging to measure. The best-available data is only published once per quarter in the World Gold Council’s fantastic Gold Demand Trends, well-written must-read reports for all gold and gold-stock investors. Overnight into Thursday, the new Q3’25 version was just released. Like usual, it analyzes gold’s global supply-and-demand dynamics that fueled its enormous 16.5% rally last quarter.</p><p>Gold’s investment demand proved its biggest category in Q3, just under 3/7ths of overall total demand. The WGC has long subdivided that into bar-and-coin demand and gold-ETF demand. Physically-backed gold exchange-traded funds buy, hold, and sell actual gold bullion. So tracking their holdings reveals investment-capital flows into and out of gold. Gold-ETF buying was gold’s fastest-growing demand category in Q3.</p><p>Bar-and-coin demand last quarter grew 16.8% YoY to 315.5 metric tons. But <em>gold-ETF bullion demand skyrocketed 134.2% YoY</em> to 221.7t! The WGC also tracks the world’s biggest physically-backed gold ETFs quarterly. The largest has always been the American <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GLD\">GLD</a> SPDR Gold Shares, which has maintained an unassailable first-mover advantage since effectively birthing gold ETFs in mid-November 2004.</p><p>The second-biggest has always been the American <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/IAU\">IAU</a> iShares Gold Trust launched not much later in mid-January 2005. IAU has one key advantage over GLD that has left it more favored among many fund investors. IAU charges annual management fees of 0.25% of net assets, well under GLD’s 0.40%. In the super-competitive fund space, every basis point of returns matters. GLD and IAU have always dominated.</p><p>Exiting Q3, these two behemoths alone <em>commanded 38.9% of all the gold</em> held by all the world’s gold ETFs! Two UK gold ETFs were third and fourth with 6.3% and 5.7%, and a German one was fifth running 4.6%. But sixth place is really interesting, another way-newer American one called <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GLDM\">GLDM</a> SPDR Gold MiniShares. Born far later in late June 2018, it was designed to make gold ownership more accessible.</p><p>Its big-brother GLD under the same management is based on each share being worth 1/10th of an ounce of gold after cumulative annual management fees. GLDM tracks a smaller 1/50th of an ounce, making for a proportionally-lower share price for investors. But GLDM’s knockout advantage is its annual management fees <em>are only 0.1% of net assets</em>, merely 1/4th of GLD’s!So GLDM has to be cannibalizing GLD demand.</p><p>In Q3 GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings surged 7.8% or 120.7t. GLD grew 6.3% or 60.3t, IAU 8.9% or 39.2t, and GLDM enjoyed the strongest growth at 14.3% or 21.2t. They were much better than all the rest of the world’s physically-backed gold ETFs combined, as their collective holdings only climbed 4.9% or 101.0t last quarter. GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings are a great proxy for <em>American stock investors’ gold capital flows</em>.</p><p>While gold clocked in with that fantastic Q3 up 16.5%, it wasn’t particularly overheated yet. Most of the frenzied buying arose in the first several weeks of October, which the WGC’s Q3 report doesn’t cover. In that short span, <em>gold blasted another 12.9% higher</em> stretching an extraordinarily-extreme 33.0% above its baseline 200-day moving average!I had warned about <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/goldprst.htm\"><u>gold’s mounting overboughtness</u></a> and downside risk.</p><p>That also ballooned gold’s mighty cyclical bull since early October 2023 into its largest on record going way back to January 1971!In a mid-October essay on <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/goldbgbl.htm\"><u>gold’s biggest bull ever</u></a> right before it peaked, I warned that “History argues a 20%ish drawdown is probable, which gold stocks will leverage 2x to 3x like usual.”The next-ten-biggest gold bulls averaged subsequent big-and-fast gold selloffs of <em>20.8% over just 2.1 months!</em></p><p>One of the main reasons gold’s massive breakout accelerated so dramatically in October’s first few weeks was American stock investors increasingly chasing gold’s powerful upside momentum. In that short span this month when gold blasted up another 12.9%, GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings surged fully 3.8% or 62.9t!Again that compares to 7.8% and 120.7t for all of Q3, which was fully 3.6x longer in terms of total trading days.</p><p>Because American stock investors’ capital flows have been <em>one of gold’s major price drivers</em> for well over a decade now, I’ve done a lot of past research work on them. In mid-February 2025 before investors started chasing with GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings at just 1,372.2t compared to 1,696.7t midweek, I wrote an essay <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/amrchgld.htm\"><u>Americans to Chase Gold</u></a>. In mid-July with holdings at 1,538.6t, I wrote another one <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/gldchsmt.htm\"><u>Gold Chasing Mounts</u></a>.</p><p>One key thing past gold-ETF-holdings research revealed was their <em>major reversals tended to lag gold’s own</em>. In past major gold toppings, GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings would usually continue building for several weeks or more after gold crested. That implied American stock investors weren’t convinced those gold runs were over, so their differential gold-ETF-share buying persisted until it was clearer gold was rolling over.</p><p>But rather provocatively this time around, these dominant gold ETFs’ holdings look to have <em>peaked right with gold</em>. This chart superimposes GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings over gold prices during these last few years or so. While this is all still young, it sure looks like American stock investors’ gold chasing has already reversed with gold!This is certainly bearish, as gold-ETF selling pressure could easily cascade.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://talkmarkets.com/contributor/mirjana-mishevska/user_content/ckimages/orig_zeal103125a.webp\" width=\"700\"/></p><p>Gold’s latest record high was $4,350 on October 20th, capping that amazing 12.9% month-to-date surge. GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings technically crested the next day, but with a mere 0.1% build. Their daily builds in the prior three trading days including gold’s apparent topping were far-larger running 0.9%, 0.6%, and 0.7%!So for all intents and purposes, these gold-ETF bullion holdings <em>peaked simultaneously with gold</em>.</p><p>Had the usual post-gold-topping lag happened where differential gold-ETF-share buying continued for a few weeks or longer, that would’ve moderated gold’s nascent selloff. I suspect that didn’t happen because gold’s initial daily drop proved so darned violent. On the 21st right off that latest high, gold plummeted 5.3% which <em>ranked in its top-0.3%-biggest down days</em> since January 1971!I analyzed that in <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/gdskslam.htm\"><u>last week’s essay</u></a>.</p><p>The faster any plunge, the more they shock traders and forcibly change their herd sentiment. As gold was soaring into its latest peak, gold bullishness was universal. Major financial-media outlets were falling all over themselves running endless stories about gold’s strong gains and why they were likely to continue. CNBC, Bloomberg, and the Wall Street Journal were starting to feel like they were all-gold-all-the-time.</p><p>Not only was the frequency of gold reporting increasing, but its <em>near-term bullishness</em>. In early October a parade of billionaire hedge-fund managers and widely-respected investors were interviewed predicting much-higher gold prices still within the coming half-year. All that hype was getting frenzied, threatening to morph into a secular-bull-slaying popular speculative mania. Gold greed and euphoria were rapidly mounting.</p><p>With a psychological backdrop like that, there was little contrarian commentary about the risks of gold’s extraordinarily-extreme overboughtness. Despite intensely studying gold, actively trading gold stocks, and writing about all of it continuously for over a quarter-century now, I got plenty of flak from daring to point out how stretched gold just looked historically. Caught up in the hype, few wanted to view gold soberly.</p><p>So gold’s 39th-largest down day in 54.8 years hit gold-bewitched investors like a sledgehammer to the skull!Gold suddenly being clubbed like a baby seal out of the blue on no news catalyst <em>had to be deeply unsettling</em> for investors recently buying in high to chase. That was certainly a brutal wake-up call that gold has always been volatile and risky, and can’t power higher linearly indefinitely. Periodic selloffs are inevitable.</p><p>For grizzled battle-scarred veterans, gold plunging out of some of its most-extreme overbought conditions ever was no surprise. I started warning about that increasing likelihood in mid-September when gold was <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/goldprst.htm\"><u>already pretty stretched</u></a>. We had stopped adding new gold-stock trades in our popular weekly newsletter in mid-August, then tightened up their trailing stop losses in late September. The writing was on the wall then.</p><p>In mid-October when the gold-to-the-moon hype was deafening and overboughtness soaring, we added put options in GLD and a major gold-stock ETF. The entire modern history of gold argued that it couldn’t sustain such incredibly-overbought levels for long. But the great majority of investors not considering any studied contrarian perspectives likely had no idea what was coming. They figured gold would keep surging.</p><p>While momentum-chasing buying is powerful while underway as gold demonstrated in October’s first few weeks, it is brittle. When that fast-rallying price action wobbles then reverses, hot-money demand quickly vanishes. That leaves sellers in control, and the faster they force prices lower the more pressure exerted on recent investors to flee. In turn the more they sell, the more prices drop fueling snowballing capital outflows.</p><p>As of Wednesday’s data cutoff for this essay, gold had already plunged 9.5% in just seven trading days!That already proved the biggest drawdown of gold’s mighty 139.1% cyclical bull over 24.5 months since early October 2023. And gold was challenging a 10%+ correction, which would technically kill this epic gold bull. After cresting a single day past gold, GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings have <em>fallen six trading days in a row</em>.</p><p>That’s the longest streak of daily draws since mid-November 2024, during this gold bull’s previous largest selloff of 8.0%. The total GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings drop recently is 1.7% or 29.8t. Gold’s other primary driver in recent decades has been American speculators’ leveraged gold-futures trading. Normally with no government shutdown, their collective positioning is published weekly in Commitments of Traders reports.</p><p>Those are current to Tuesday closes, so CoT weeks end every Tuesday. During this latest one wrapping up this Tuesday, GLD+IAU+GLDM suffered a big 1.5% or 26.6t holdings draw. Rather forebodingly, that proved <em>the biggest single-CoT-week draw</em> in gold’s entire record cyclical bull!This recent differential gold-ETF-share selling not only didn’t lag gold, but it has already been the most intense this bull has yet witnessed.</p><p>American stock investors’ potential gold exodus cascading is a serious downside risk for gold already in a big-and-fast drawdown. The mission of physically-backed gold ETFs is to track the gold price. But the supply and demand of their shares are independent from gold’s own. So when gold-ETF shares are dumped faster than gold itself, their share prices threaten to decouple from their metal to the downside.</p><p>The only way gold-ETF managers can avert such failures is to buy back enough of their shares to absorb any excess supply. They raise the funds to finance these purchases by <em>selling some of their gold bullion</em>. So draws in GLD, IAU, or GLDM holdings reveal American stock-market capital flowing out of gold. And as this chart shows, investors still have lots of room to sell after those holdings paced gold’s massive breakout.</p><p>From mid-April to late August, gold was mired in a high consolidation after its previous episode of extreme overboughtness. And mid-April’s was considerably less extreme than mid-October’s. Gold’s upper resistance this past summer ran near $3,425. Gold didn’t break out above that until August’s final trading day, which <em>kicked off recent months’ chasing</em>. The day before that breakout, GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings ran 1,576.8t.</p><p>They surged 9.5% or 149.6t into mid-October as gold-ETF shares were bought much faster than gold. In that scenario of excess gold-ETF-share demand, their prices risk decoupling from gold to the upside. So gold-ETF managers issue new shares to offset that excess demand. They then plow the proceeds from those share sales into buying more physical gold bullion. These numbers can be rounded to 1,575t and 150t.</p><p>As gold plunged 9.5% since mid-October, American stock investors sold enough gold-ETF shares to force a 29.8t holdings draw. That’s close to 30t, <em>or just 1/5th of</em> the frenzied GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings build in September and the majority of October!What happens to gold prices if investors force another 45t draw unwinding half their recent frenzied build?What if they roundtrip the whole thing to 150t with 120t more selling?</p><p>Any more significant differential gold-ETF-share dumping will almost certainly <em>exacerbate gold’s drawdown</em>. Again previous massive gold bulls averaged big-and-fast subsequent selloffs around 20% over a couple months or so. Another one this time around implies $3,480 gold before the dust settles, which is hardly apocalyptic. Gold only first bested that level just two months ago on September’s opening trading day.</p><p>But the pain of a 20% drawdown would still be serious, <em>especially in gold stocks</em>. Historically the leading <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/gmq225fn.htm\"><u>GDX gold-stock ETF</u></a> has tended to amplify material gold moves by 2x to 3x. So if American stock investors’ gold chasing is indeed reversing as apparent so far, both the metal and its miners’ stocks still have long ways to fall before this drawdown runs its course. Both extreme sentiment and technicals need to be rebalanced.</p><p>The bottom line is American stock investors’ gold chasing via gold ETFs is reversing. Since gold peaked, major-gold-ETF bullion holdings have relentlessly fallen. This is unusual, as they’ve normally lagged major gold reversals historically. Gold plummeting out of its latest record close contributed to the urgency to exit, seriously damaging bullish psychology. This young exodus from gold ETFs could easily snowball.</p><p>So far investors have merely unwound about 1/5th of the holdings build from their frenzied differential gold-ETF-share buying in September and the first few weeks of October. If they keep selling, that will force the gold ETFs to dump more physical bullion intensifying gold’s necessary drawdown. That in turn will ramp pressure on investors to flee gold ETFs, which could spawn a vicious cycle of selling pounding gold much lower.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/gold-stocks-slammed?post=530356\">Gold Stocks Slammed</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/golds-biggest-bull-ever?post=529164\">Gold’s Biggest Bull Ever </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/more-gold-miner-records?post=527671\">More Gold Miner Records</a></p></div>",

For example, the S&amp;P 500’s current yield is only ~1.2%.</p><p>High-yield stocks can be particularly beneficial in supplementing retirement income. A $120,000 investment in stocks with an average dividend yield of 5% creates an average of <strong>$500 a month in dividends</strong>.</p><p>Next on our list of <a href=\"https://www.suredividend.com/high-dividend-stocks/\">high-dividend stocks</a> to review is Hooker Furnishings Corp. (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/HOFT\">HOFT</a>).</p><h3><br/><strong>Business Overview</strong></h3><p>Hooker Furnishings is a designer, marketer, and importer of furniture—including casegoods, leather, and fabric-upholstered pieces—along with lighting, accessories, and home décor for residential, hospitality, and contract markets. The company also produces premium custom leather and fabric furniture domestically. As the largest supplier of case goods and upholstery in the U.S., Hooker reaches over 75% of retail furniture distribution. Founded in 1924 and headquartered in Martinsville, Virginia, the company currently has a market capitalization of $93 million.</p><p>On September 11, 2025, Hooker Furnishings reported Q2 fiscal 2026 results (fiscal year ends January 2026), showing a 14% decline in net sales compared to last year, driven by weak demand and pre-pandemic home sales levels. High interest rates and elevated home prices have pressured the home furnishings sector over the past two years. Despite cost-cutting measures, loss per share widened from $0.11 to $0.31, missing analysts’ estimates by $0.19. This marked the seventh consecutive quarter of earnings misses. Consequently, our EPS forecast for fiscal 2026 has been reduced from $0.50 to $0.25.</p><p>Management cited weak new home sales and persistent inflation as key challenges. The company has reported weak sales and earnings for nine straight quarters. Assuming no significant tariffs are imposed on key trading partners, Hooker Furnishings could improve performance next year. The stock has fallen 22% this year due to these weak results.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-27-at-8.44.27-PM-768x250.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: <a href=\"https://investors.hookerfurnishings.com/\">Investor Relations</a></p><h3><br/><strong>Growth Prospects</strong></h3><p>Hooker Furnishings has experienced a highly volatile business performance, failing to grow its earnings over the past decade. The company posted steady earnings growth until 2020 but was severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Following a partial recovery, it faced another setback from surging inflation, which prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to a 23-year high. Combined with elevated home prices, these factors have constrained demand for new homes, creating a significant headwind for Hooker’s business.</p><p>Looking ahead, the outlook for Hooker Furnishings appears more favorable. Inflation is expected to moderate, and the Fed is likely to lower interest rates in the coming years. If these trends materialize, demand for new homes should strengthen, supporting a recovery in both sales and earnings for the company.</p><p>Given the business’s historical volatility, a conservative approach to growth expectations is warranted. Nevertheless, with this year’s exceptionally low comparison base, we project an average annual EPS growth of 32% over the next five years.</p><h3><br/><strong>Competitive Advantages &amp; Recession Performance</strong></h3><p>Hooker Furnishings’ competitive advantage lies in its scale, brand recognition, and extensive distribution network. As the largest supplier of case goods and upholstery in the U.S., the company reaches over 75% of retail furniture channels. Its combination of imported and domestically manufactured furniture, including premium custom leather and fabric pieces, allows Hooker to serve a wide range of residential, hospitality, and contract markets.</p><p>This diversification, along with decades of design expertise, positions the company to maintain a strong market presence despite sector volatility.</p><p>In terms of recession performance, Hooker Furnishings has historically faced challenges during economic downturns due to its reliance on new-home sales and discretionary spending. While the company experienced consistent growth before 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent inflationary pressures highlighted its vulnerability to macroeconomic shocks.</p><p>Nevertheless, Hooker’s established brand, broad distribution, and cost management initiatives provide some resilience, allowing it to navigate recessions better than smaller, less diversified competitors.</p><h3><br/><strong>Dividend Analysis</strong></h3><p>Hooker Furnishings offers a relatively attractive dividend yield of 10.4%, reflecting its commitment to returning capital to shareholders despite recent earnings volatility.</p><p>While the company has faced multiple quarters of weak performance, its ability to sustain dividends is supported by cost management measures and a diversified product portfolio. Investors should view the dividend as a strong income component, though potential fluctuations in earnings may affect its long-term stability.</p><p>However, the dividend is at risk of a cut this year, as the company has an over-100 % payout ratio. The company is expected to earn $0.25 per share this year while paying a dividend of $0.92 per share.</p><h3><br/><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p>Hooker Furnishings has declined by over 36% this year due to the effects of high interest rates and inflation. While a recovery is likely over the coming years, investors should expect a gradual turnaround. However, the dividend is at risk of a cut this year because of the high payout.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/high-dividend-50-permrock-royalty-trust?post=532038\">High Dividend 50: PermRock Royalty Trust</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/high-dividend-50-golub-capital-bdc-inc?post=531808\">High Dividend 50: Golub Capital BDC, Inc.</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/10-of-the-right-retirement-stocks-for-income-investors?post=531175\">10 Of The Right Retirement Stocks For Income Investors</a><br/></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Figma Down 54%: Can AI Save the Story?\" height=\"279\" src=\"https://tokenist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/169894953_m-1-646x360.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://123rf.com/\">123rf.com</a></em></p><p><br/>It has been three months since the design software company Figma began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/FIG\">FIG</a>. To put it mildly, shareholders are somewhat anxious about FIG’s future stock performance.<br/><br/>At the time, on July 31st, Figma’s IPO achieved a massive valuation of $19.3 billion, with initial FIG pricing at $33 per share. However, shortly after its NYSE debut, FIG shares surged to $142.92, a 4x increase that pushed its valuation close to $68 billion. This reflected prior Bloomberg reporting that the Figma IPO had been oversubscribed 40x.<br/><br/>That was not entirely surprising. Initial public offerings (IPOs) launch without the company’s trading history, making it difficult to anchor expectations. Moreover, leveraging the initial hype and a limited float, insider investors tend to lock up profits, resulting in a rapid selloff cascade. With three months of trading now behind it, FIG stock is down 54%, currently priced at $48.73 per share. Let’s examine the company’s prospects and potential valuation moving forward.</p><h3><br/><strong>Was It Wise to Invest in Adobe’s Competitor?</strong></h3><p>Both Adobe (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/ADBE\">ADBE</a>) and Figma (FIG) occupy the niche of interactive product design, offering Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions. Most customers for both companies come from marketing, social media, branding, graphic design, and the education sector. As the dominant player in this market, Adobe offered $20 billion to acquire Figma in 2022, nearly matching the company’s IPO valuation. However, the deal was canceled in late 2023 due to regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>From that cancellation, Figma greatly benefited as Adobe had to pay a $1 billion reverse termination fee. Investors have been particularly excited about Figma’s IPO due to its collaborative approach to product development. Namely, multiple users can work simultaneously on the same project, making changes visible as if they were working on a Google document.</p><p>Figma further integrated tools like Slack, Jira, and Adobe XD to enhance the workflow pipeline. Additionally, Figma operates a freemium model to attract users and expand its customer base. All of these ingredients would suggest that Figma could become as widespread as Google Workspace.</p><p>However, both Adobe and Figma face peril from that very same direction. Specifically, Google’s Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image), launched in late August, enables users to prompt AI to edit images as easily as they can generate them. This is a significant milestone, as generating content over and over again to luck out on the desired effect is not very conducive for professional use.</p><p>In fact, in June’s <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/adobe-inc-should-you-buy-the-dip/\">coverage of Adobe,</a> we posited that granular control of content editing would remain superior to AI-powered generation, especially since Adobe has its own competent Firefly model. Yet, if the trend of text-to-edit continues, both companies’ long-term valuations could hinge less on their design pedigree and more on how swiftly they pivot to AI-native workflows.</p><p>At a bare minimum, if Google integrates more of such features, considering the company’s <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/alphabets-paradox-why-googles-decay-strengthens-its-dominance/\">overwhelming reach</a>, the incentive to adopt Figma products for basic use cases would diminish.</p><h3><br/><strong>Figma’s AI Positioning Strengthens</strong></h3><p>Now that we understand why AI is such a big deal for both Adobe and Figma, it makes sense that the latter just recently, on Thursday, announced the acquisition of Weavy. The Israeli AI startup, launched a year ago, was acquired by Figma for $200 million.</p><p>Weavy weaves existing AI models such as Sora, Veo, and the aforementioned Nano Banana to generate primitives. Users can then combine them to create a cohesive output, including color grading, lighting adjustments, and masking.</p><p>This is the exact ingredient Figma needs to stay relevant against future AI advances, as it positions itself as an AI-agnostic layer. More importantly, by embedding AI-driven primitives directly into its collaborative ecosystem, Figma is raising its moat drawbridge.</p><h3><br/><strong>Figma’s Price Targets</strong></h3><p>Over the last 12 months, Figma generated $294.3 million in free cash flow (FCF). With a year-over-year revenue growth of 41%, reaching $249.6 million as of Q2, analysts expect an annual FCF target of $367.5 million by 2029.</p><p>At this stage of the business, Figma’s discounted cash flow (DCF) model is challenging to pin down. However, it is fair to say that the stock is overvalued, given its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 261.06 for the trailing twelve months (TTM). For comparison, Adobe’s P/E is 21.10 TTM.</p><p>Over the last three months, ADBE stock has been down 5.5%, while FIG shares have lost 54% of their value. Yet, according to the Wall Street Journal’s forecasting, most analysts remain largely optimistic, with zero sells, eight holds, and four buys.</p><p>This puts the average FIG price target at $67.57 per share. Even the bottom outlook is higher than the current price level, at $49, while the bullish ceiling stands at $85 per share.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/why-is-getty-images-stock-soaring-today-ai-deal-with-perplexity-boosts-shares?post=532328\">Why Is Getty Images Stock Soaring Today?

At the same time, TSM stock has already gained roughly 54% on a year-to-date basis, thus raising concerns about forward viability.</p><p>Within the financial publication industry, the two dominant methodologies are fundamental and technical analysis. While they can be instructive, the critical issue that must be recognized is that in either approach, both the premise and the conclusion stem from the author making the claim. In other words, they’re analyst-contingent methodologies.</p><p>For example, TSM stock currently carries a<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsm/forecast\"> Strong Buy</a> consensus rating. However, what’s fascinating is that the gap between the highest price target ($400) and the average price target ($340.75) clocks in at 17.39%. What’s more, the high-low gap is nearly 38%.</p><p>So, while the suits on the Street are all using fundamental analysis, some experts see robust growth while others see an erosion, This necessarily means that concepts such as intrinsic value are not universal truth claims but are dressed-up opinions masquerading as “analysis.”</p><p>In contrast, quantitative analysis aligns with the observations made by GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) studies, which describes the diffusional properties of volatility as clustered, non-linear phenomena. In other words, different market stimuli yield different market behaviors.</p><p>Now, under baseline conditions, the forward 10-week returns of TSM stock would be expected to form a distributional profile, with outcomes ranging from $290 to $338 (assuming an anchor price of $303.22, Thursday’s close). Further, price clustering would be expected to be predominant at about $310.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"288\" src=\"https://moneymorning.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2025/10/image1-29.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>However, TSM stock is not under baseline conditions but has instead printed a 6-4-U sequence: six up weeks, four down weeks, with an overall upward trajectory. Based on this specific stimulus, the risk-reward tail expands to $282 on the downside to $360 on the upside. Moreover, price clustering would be predominant at $331.</p><p>Right now, investors are enjoying a 6.77% positive delta in price density dynamics — which is very much a measurable statistic. It’s just that fundamental and technical analysts are blind to it because such variances are not visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Granted, the sentiment regime can shift and investors will need to be aware of exogenous influences. Presently, though, the empirical data supports the upside narrative.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/micron-technology-is-up-big-this-year-but-it-may-have-hit-a-temporary-stall-point?post=532299\">Micron Technology Is Up Big This Year But It May Have Hit A Temporary Stall Point </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/the-perfect-ai-stock-does-exist-its-microsoft?post=532017\">The Perfect AI Stock Does Exist.

Meta posted GAAP EPS of $1.05, an incredible 84% lower than Wall Street's $6.71 consensus. The shortfall is owed nearly exclusively to an almost $16 billion one-time tax charge caused by the Trump administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act that was passed earlier this year.</p><p>That allowed META <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/equities\">stock</a> to slide more than 11% on Thursday, and Friday has seen new lows.</p><h2><br/>Meta Platforms stock news</h2><p>Many retail investors know that buying Mag 7 stocks following large downward swings always seems to work out in the end. And in that sense, we agree. There are a number of reasons to believe strongly in Meta's return to new highs.</p><p>First, while causing an unexpected pullback in Meta's share price, the government tax bill will reduce taxes substantially over the long run. In fact, Meta's top brass think the lower tax <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/rates\">rates</a> will boost earnings as soon as Q4.</p><p>Then there's the adjusted earnings. If we discard the one-time tax charge, adjusted EPS arrived at $7.25, a full $0.58 ahead of the analyst consensus. This means that adjusted earnings, the figure that most investors focus on over the long term, rose 20% from a year earlier.</p><p>Ad impressions delivered across the Family of Apps segment increased by 14% on an annual basis in Q3, while average price per ad increased by 10% YoY. This tells us that pricing power and demand remain robust, while Zuckerberg said that Facebook Reels has reached a $50 billion per annum run rate. The company's prized possession doesn't appear to be slowing down.</p><p>If anything is bothering the market, it's likely the intense level of capex going into Meta's AI investments. The already heady $69 billion mid-level estimate for 2025 was pushed up during the earnings call by an extra $2 billion. Like the company's Reality Labs side hustle, which lost another $4 billion during Q3 as it had for the five previous quarters, the AI investments are likely years away from turning a profit if at all.</p><p>With the metaverse investments losing $73 billion cumulatively to date, investors can be forgiven for thinking the heavy investment in AI data centers is just another boondoggle requiring an eventual write-down. <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/news\">News</a> spread on Friday that Meta is looking to raise $30 billion in a bond sale to sustain the AI buildout, a sign that the price tag of this venture is steep.</p><h2><br/>Meta Platforms stock forecast</h2><p>The daily chart is fairly self-explanatory. While nubile traders might be enticed by the prospect of a quick return to the $700s, a more seasoned professional sees two notable gaps that need to be filled.</p><p>First comes the May 12 gap up that leaves a gap between $611 and $619. Markets love to close gaps, and to do so, META needs to trade about 6% lower to reach $611.</p><p>The second gap also hails from May, the first day of the month to be exact. That gap from $558.50 to $570.50 would require META to tag the lower figure by shedding another 14% from Friday's closing price of $649.50.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"META daily stock chart\" height=\"322\" src=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feditorial.fxsstatic.com%2Fmiscelaneous%2FMETA%252031-10-25-1761942155682-1761942155683.jpg&amp;w=1536&amp;q=95\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><small>META daily stock chart</small></p><p><br/>But not to be left out, bulls then have the higher gap to close as well. The gap created by Wednesday's earnings crash requires META to trade candle by candle from $680 to $742.50, which could take some time. It would be fun if META could close the two lower gaps before closing the upper gap. That would be a wild ride for sure.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/wti-rises-amid-modest-recovery-opec-output-increase-caps-gains?post=532326\">WTI Rises Amid Modest Recovery, OPEC+ Output Increase Caps Gains </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/eurusd-hovers-near-lows-with-eurozone-inflation-on-tap?post=532170\">EUR/USD Hovers Near Lows With Eurozone Inflation On Tap </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/gold-edges-higher-on-safe-haven-flows-remains-below-4050-amid-feds-hawkish-tilt?post=532053\">Gold Edges Higher On Safe-Haven Flows; Remains Below $4,050 Amid Fed's Hawkish Tilt </a><br/></div>",
