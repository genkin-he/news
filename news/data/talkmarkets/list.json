As of October 2025, copper prices have surged to approximately $11,000 per metric ton, nearing their all-time high of $11,104.50 set in May 2024.<br/> </p><h3><strong>What Affects Copper Price</strong></h3><p>Major copper-producing countries - Chile and Peru- have faced environmental regulations, labor shortages, and declining ore grades, leading to limited supply availability. Additionally, incidents like the Grasberg mine disruptions in Indonesia have further strained global copper supply.</p><p>The global push towards infrastructure development and renewable energy transition has significantly increased copper demand. Copper is essential in electrical wiring, power grids, and renewable energy technologies like solar panels and wind turbines. In 2024, global refined copper demand reached nearly 27 million tonnes, a 3.2% rise compared to 2023.</p><p>Geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China created issues in the copper market. Trade restrictions and political instability are increasing costs and causing delays in mining operations, especially in the copper sector.</p><p>Speculative trading has also influenced copper prices. Analysts have debated whether the current price surge is driven by genuine supply shortages or speculative activities. While some forecasts predict prices reaching $11,000–$14,000 per tonne in 2026–2027, others caution that these projections may be influenced by market speculation.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Bottom Line Is</strong></h3><p>Looking ahead, the copper market faces a potential supply shortfall. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts a 30% supply deficit by 2035, driven by increased demand from electrification and renewable energy sectors. This anticipated deficit underscores the importance of strategic investments in mining operations and exploration to meet future demand.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/soybeans-price-analysis-trends-and-drivers?post=530278\">Soybeans Price Analysis - Trends And Drivers</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/warren-buffett-adds-521-million-to-chevron?post=529984\">Warren Buffett Adds $521 Million To Chevron </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/coffee-price-analysis-arabica-2025?post=529522\">Coffee Price Analysis: Arabica, 2025 </a></p></div>",

(NYSE: <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/MRK\">MRK</a>) has <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251030997062/en/Merck-Co.-Inc.-Rahway-N.J.-USA-Announces-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> its financial results for the third quarter of 2025, showcasing a strong performance that exceeded expectations. The company also provided updated guidance for the full year, reflecting its strategic advancements and market positioning.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Strong Oncology Growth and $2.58 EPS Power Merck’s Q3 Results</strong></h3><p>In the third quarter of 2025, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. reported total worldwide sales of $17.3 billion, marking a 4% increase from the same period in 2024. This growth was primarily driven by strong demand for KEYTRUDA, which saw a 10% increase in sales to $8.1 billion. The pharmaceutical segment’s performance was bolstered by oncology, cardiovascular, and diabetes products, despite some declines in vaccines and virology. Notably, WINREVAIR sales surged by 141% to $360 million.</p><p>The company’s GAAP <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/investing/how-to-value-a-stock/\">earnings per share (EPS)</a> was $2.32, while non-GAAP EPS was $2.58, both surpassing the expected EPS of $2.35. This performance was supported by a net income increase of 83% to $5.8 billion, compared to $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in EPS was partly attributed to lower restructuring costs and favorable product mix. Merck’s sales also exceeded the anticipated revenue of $17.06 billion, reaching $17.3 billion.</p><p>Merck’s robust performance in Q3 2025 was highlighted by significant product approvals and strategic acquisitions. The FDA’s approval of KEYTRUDA QLEX for subcutaneous use across all solid tumor indications marked a major milestone. Additionally, the acquisition of Verona Pharma strengthened Merck’s pipeline, particularly in the cardiovascular and respiratory domains. These strategic moves underscore Merck’s commitment to delivering value through innovative medicines and vaccines.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Merck Reaffirms Long-Term Growth Plans with Higher 2025 Guidance</strong></h3><p>Looking ahead, Merck has updated its full-year 2025 financial outlook, projecting worldwide sales between $64.5 billion and $65.0 billion. This revised guidance reflects a slight increase from the previous range of $64.3 billion to $65.3 billion. The company has also raised its expected non-GAAP EPS range to $8.93 to $8.98, up from the prior range of $8.87 to $8.97.</p><p>The updated guidance accounts for several factors, including a favorable amendment to the collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca related to Koselugo and operational improvements. However, it also considers the potential negative impact of the Verona Pharma acquisition and foreign exchange fluctuations. Merck anticipates a non-GAAP effective tax rate between 14.0% and 15.0%, reflecting a more favorable tax environment than previously expected.</p><p>Merck’s strategic focus on expanding its manufacturing and R&amp;D capabilities is evident in its ongoing investments. The company is dedicating over $70 billion to enhance its domestic operations, excluding potential future business development. This commitment not only supports Merck’s growth trajectory but also solidifies its position as a leader in biopharmaceutical innovation. As Merck continues to advance its pipeline and secure regulatory approvals, the company remains well-positioned to drive long-term success and deliver value to patients and shareholders alike.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/alphabets-paradox-why-googles-decay-strengthens-its-dominance?post=531521\">Alphabet’s Paradox: Why Google’s Decay Strengthens Its Dominance</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/nvidia-stock-soars-on-historic-5-trillion-market-value?post=531433\">NVIDIA Stock Soars On Historic $5 Trillion Market Value</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/verizon-delivers-solid-q3-eps-beat-despite-revenue-miss-reaffirms-guidance?post=531384\">Verizon Delivers Solid Q3 EPS Beat Despite Revenue Miss, Reaffirms Guidance</a><br/></div>",

The Cable fell sharply on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve (Fed) decision to reduce interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 3.75%-4.00%.</li><li value=\"2\">This was the second straight interest rate cut by the Fed this year. The central bank was expected to announce a dovish interest rate decision, as recent US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release has signaled that the impact of tariffs on inflation is not persistent. Additionally, deteriorating labor market conditions and the ongoing federal shutdown remained key reasons behind the Fed’s rate cut announcement.</li><li value=\"3\">Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also stated that the cut was “risk management” as the job creation has remained “very low”.</li><li value=\"4\">Technically, lower interest rates by the Fed bode poorly for the US Dollar; however, the Greenback strengthened after Chair Powell argued against further monetary easing in the December policy meeting. “Another cut in December is far from assured, as inflation remains somewhat elevated relative to the goal,” he said.</li><li value=\"5\">Powell's comments signaling no support for an interest rate cut in December led investors to revise their dovish expectations. According to the CME FedWatch tool, traders see a 70% chance that the Fed will hold interest rates steady in the range of 3.75%-4.00% in December, significantly increased from 9.1% seen on Tuesday.</li><li value=\"6\">In the United Kingdom (UK), the major trigger for the British currency will be expectations regarding the upcoming Bank of England’s (BoE) monetary policy scheduled next week. Analysts at Goldman Sachs wait for the BoE to cut interest rates by 25 bps to 3.75% on November 6. The investment banking firm turns dovish for November’s monetary policy due to the softening labor market.</li><li value=\"7\">Contrary to Goldman Sachs, a recent Reuters poll showed that economists expect there will be no further interest rate cuts by the BoE this year, and the central bank will restart the monetary-easing campaign in the first quarter of 2026.<br/>\t </li></ul><h3><strong>Technical Analysis: Pound Sterling struggles to return above 1.3200</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"265\" src=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feditorial.fxsstatic.com%2Fmiscelaneous%2Fchart-screenshot%2520(93)-1761810090392-1761810090396.png&amp;w=1536&amp;q=95\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>The Pound Sterling ticks down to near 1.3185 against the US Dollar on Thursday.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p>The NZD/USD is trading near the 0.57725 ratio as of this writing with fast fluctuations being displayed as financial institutions deal with their perhaps overly ambitious perspectives seen the past couple of days.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"NZD/USD Analysis 30/10: Reversal From Depths (Chart)\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://www.dailyforex.com/files/nzdusd-oct3025-rob.webp\" title=\"NZD/USD Analysis 30/10: Reversal From Depths (Chart)\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>The NZD/USD has seen price velocity over the past handful of days, and lows produced late last week certainly saw a reversal higher this Monday. Whether the lows sparked buying early this week based on the notion the NZD/USD had finally hit blatantly oversold territory in the eyes of financial institutions, or if the buying of the NZD/USD was caused by a perspective the U.S Federal Reserve was going to cut interest rates can be debated.</p><p>However, as the NZD/USD currently trades near the 0.57725 ratio it certainly can be argued the results seen the past couple of days leading into this morning were influenced by both scenarios. The NZD/USD was touching 0.57380 vicinity late last week and then saw a flurry of action on Monday when the currency pair touched the 0.57800 region upon its opening. Current price activity it must be said is straddling values seen late in the day this past Monday.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Anticipated Move by Fed Turns Into Disappointment</strong></h3><p>Yesterday’s move higher in the NZD/USD to the 0.58025 area briefly then turned into strong selling as the U.S Federal Reserve cut its interest rate by 25 basis points. Yes, the rate hike should have helped the value of the NZD/USD actually move upwards, and this was clearly bet on before the Fed’s anticipated cut was announced. But that wasn’t what financial institutions were speculating on, they were expecting a more dovish sounding Federal Reserve – they did not get this. Instead the Fed said the outlook for a December rate cut is uncertain. The rate cut had already been traded into the NZD/USD before the Fed’s announcement yesterday.</p><p>The NZD/USD was not able to sustain higher ground and quickly sold off. The NZD/USD is correlating to the broad Forex market as other major currencies also are doing worse against the USD early today. While the Fed may actually cut interest rates in December, the U.S central bank certainly did not want to commit to that action yesterday. The U.S government shutdown is still if effect, this means economic data remains hard to investigate via official statistics.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"350\" id=\"tradingview_40ee2\" lang=\"en\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://s.tradingview.com/dailyforexcom/widgetembed/?hideideas=1&amp;overrides=%7B%7D&amp;enabled_features=%5B%5D&amp;disabled_features=%5B%5D&amp;locale=en#%7B%22symbol%22%3A%22FX_IDC%3ANZDUSD%22%2C%22frameElementId%22%3A%22tradingview_40ee2%22%2C%22interval%22%3A%2215%22%2C%22allow_symbol_change%22%3A%221%22%2C%22save_image%22%3A%221%22%2C%22studies%22%3A%22%5B%5D%22%2C%22theme%22%3A%22Light%22%2C%22style%22%3A%221%22%2C%22timezone%22%3A%22Etc%2FUTC%22%2C%22studies_overrides%22%3A%22%7B%7D%22%2C%22utm_source%22%3A%22www.dailyforex.com%22%2C%22utm_medium%22%3A%22widget_new%22%2C%22utm_campaign%22%3A%22chart%22%2C%22utm_term%22%3A%22FX_IDC%3ANZDUSD%22%2C%22page-uri%22%3A%22www.dailyforex.com%2Fforex-technical-analysis%2F2025%2F10%2Fnzdusd-analysis-30-october-2025%2F236248%22%7D\" title=\"advanced chart TradingView widget\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p><h3><br/><strong>Fed Uncertainly and Cautious Trading Conditions</strong></h3><p>The Fed preached uncertainty once again and this hurt the NZD/USD bulls who were hoping for more optimism.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p><strong>Pending signal:</strong></p><ul><li>I am selling right here, with a stop loss of 0.58 and a target of 0.5625</li></ul><p>I’m watching CAD/CHF after a brief rally on Wednesday, driven by a less dovish Bank of Canada. I still see this as a selling market, looking for exhaustion near resistance around 0.58 and targeting 0.56 below.</p><p>The Canadian dollar has rallied a bit during Wednesday’s session after the Bank of Canada sounded a little less likely to cut rates rapidly, which has traders looking for the Loonie to pick up strength. That being said, this is still a market where I’m looking for selling opportunities. I think the fact that we’re testing the 50-day EMA and a downtrend line creates a potential roof for price. If we can break above there, then the 0.58 level is another area I’d consider shorting.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Downtrend Remains Despite the Move</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"CAD/CHF Forex Signal 30/10: Launches Higher (graph)\" height=\"392\" src=\"https://www.dailyforex.com/files/cadchf-oct3025-chris.webp\" title=\"CAD/CHF Forex Signal 30/10: Launches Higher (graph)\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Ultimately, this remains a continued downtrend. Despite the short-term boost we’ve seen during the session, I believe it’s more likely to be a short-covering rally than the start of a trend reversal. If we can break above the 0.5850 level, then perhaps a full turnaround could develop, but for now, I’m targeting the 0.56 area, which was a recent swing low that attracted significant buying. A decisive break below that would be very negative for the Canadian dollar, and the Swiss franc would probably strengthen not only here but against other currencies as well.</p><p>I do think we’re seeing some attempts at Swiss franc weakness, but I’m not sure the Canadian dollar is the right currency to take advantage of that. With all that in mind, I’m watching for signs of exhaustion to sell into, as the downtrend remains strong and supported by longer-term fundamentals. There are still broad market questions about global risk appetite, and until we see a true shift toward risk-on sentiment, I think this pair continues to deteriorate. I’m waiting for the next opportunity to fade any rallies.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/usdjpy-forecast-drops-against-yen?post=531318\">USD/JPY Forecast: Drops Against Yen</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/gbpusd-forecast-slips-below-200-day-ema-as-fed-takes-the-spotlight?post=531421\">GBP/USD Forecast: Slips Below 200-Day EMA As Fed Takes The Spotlight </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/eurjpy-forecast-hits-new-highs-as-yen-weakness-deepens?post=531083\">EUR/JPY Forecast: Hits New Highs As Yen Weakness Deepens</a></p></div>",

On Thursday, President Trump and Xi’s meeting in South Korea boosted the market sentiment. However, less dovish Fed capped the gains, lending room to the Greenback.</p><p>Both leaders reached a middle ground of cooperation. President Xi remarked that the two nations should focus on working together and avoid getting into vicious cycles of revenge. Additionally, he suggested that both need efforts towards areas such as AI, telecom fraud, and money laundering prevention.</p><p>He was positive that China is not looking to challenge or replace any country. Meanwhile, President Trump contributed by reducing the tariff significantly, from 57% to 47%. He pledged to resolve the rare earth mineral dispute and Chinese soybean purchases.</p><p>These developments increased risk appetite in the market, further boosting the commodity-linked AUD. The strong Q3 Australian inflation data also lifted the AUD, reducing expectations of rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Former RBA Governor Philip Lowe opined that the policymakers could keep the cash rate unchanged to keep inflation persistence in check. </p><p>On the US side, the Fed reduced the interest rate by 25 bps in Wednesday’s Fed meeting. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested that a rate cut for December has not been confirmed yet, cautioning the markets. The Fed’s cautious stance about a December rate cut lent support to the dollar while weighing the AUD/USD pair on Thursday. <br/> </p><h3><strong>AUD/USD Daily Key Events</strong></h3><p>The major events in the day include</p><ul><li>FOMC Member Bowman speaks</li><li>FOMC Member Logan speaks</li></ul><p>On Thursday, traders await the FOMC members Bowman and Logan’s speeches for further Fed policy cues. </p><p> </p><h3><strong>AUD/USD Technical Outlook: Bulls Pause Below 0.6600</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"AUD/USD Technical Outlook\" height=\"273\" src=\"https://www.forexcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1-41.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">AUD/USD 4-hour chart<br/> </p><p>The AUD/USD 4-hour chart shows a slight pullback from 0.6590, as the pair trades near 0.6570.

            "title": "\r                    Liquidity Concerns Put An End To QT \r                ",
            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p>Two weeks ago, Jerome Powell stated, “<em>We may be approaching the end of our balance sheet contraction in the coming months</em>.” In simple terms, as we wrote <a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/is-qt-on-its-last-lap?post=528781\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>, he is prepping the market for a quicker end to QT than was previously expected. While Powell was cryptic about why, the answer is obvious: liquidity concerns. As we have noted in the past few weeks, tightness in the overnight funding markets is becoming more prevalent. Powell likely didn’t want to spook the markets by raising concerns about potential liquidity problems.</p><p>At yesterday’s FOMC meeting, the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points to a range of 3.75% to 4.00%, as was widely expected. As Powell warned a couple of weeks ago, liquidity concerns pushed the Fed to end QT on December 1. Per the FOMC statement:</p><blockquote><p><em>The Committee decided to conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings on December 1.</em></p></blockquote><p>Beyond QT and liquidity concerns, the Fed doesn’t seem overly worried about a slowdown of economic growth. They note that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Furthermore, the unemployment rate “<em>has edged up</em>” but “<em>remained low.</em>” They state that inflation has risen and remains “<em>somewhat elevated</em>.” There were two dissenting votes. Stephan Miran wanted a 50-bps rate cut, while Jeff Schmid wanted to hold rates steady.</p><p>Our initial takeaway is that, barring worsening employment data or lower-than-expected inflation, the Fed may talk the markets down from its 85% probability of a December rate cut. To wit, Powell ended his press conference speech as follows:</p><blockquote><p><em>An interest rate cut in December is not a foregone conclusion, far from it.</em></p></blockquote><p> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fed-probabilities.png\"><img alt=\"fed rate cut probabilities\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fed-probabilities-1024x545.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><h3><br/><strong>What To Watch Today</strong></h3><p><strong>Earnings</strong><br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-163.png\"><img alt=\"Earnings Calendar\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-163-1024x975.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p><br/><strong>Economy</strong><br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-164.png\"><img alt=\"Economic Calendar\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-164-1024x742.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><h3><br/><strong>Market Trading Update</strong></h3><p><strong><em><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/rebasing-the-dollar-another-look-at-the-debasing-narrative?post=531399\" target=\"_blank\">Yesterday</a></em></strong>, we touched on the market’s underlying breadth, which has recently worsened as the market has rallied. All of today’s commentary comes from <a href=\"https://simplevisor.com/home\"><strong><em>SimpleVisor.com</em></strong></a>, and we can start with the chart of the number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 trading above their respective 50, 75, and 150 DMAs. As noted yesterday, that deterioration is very notable given that the index is ringing all-time highs.</p><p> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-165.png\"><img alt=\"market breadth.\" height=\"367\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-165.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p><br/>Secondly, there has been a significant lag in performance between the Equal Weight and Market Cap-weighted index. Again, this is a breadth issue and confirms that a handful of stocks, the most heavily weighted, are driving the index higher. Over the last 6 months, there has been a 12% gap in performance between the two indices.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Market cap vs Equal Weight Performance\" height=\"514\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-166-1024x752.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>We see the same performance gap when examining the absolute and relative performance of the various market factors. <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/MGK\">MGK</a> (Mega-cap growth) is grossly overbought, while <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/SPLV\">SPLV</a> (Low-Beta, Low Volatility) stocks are grossly oversold. Such suggests that eventually the market is going to rotate, and given the current deviation in performance, that rotation could be quite volatile.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-162.png\"><img alt=\"Factor relative and absolute market performance.\" height=\"401\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-162-1024x586.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p><br/>We can culminate our analysis by examining the Risk Range Report, which reveals two crucial factors. The first is that every market and sector, except for Technology and Emerging Markets, underperformed the S&amp;P 500 during the last week. Secondly, Communications (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GOOG\">GOOG</a>/<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/META\">META</a>), Technology (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/MSFT\">MSFT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/NVDA\">NVDA</a>), and Discretionary (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AMZN\">AMZN</a>/<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/TSLA\">TSLA</a>) are carrying double-digit deviations from their long-term means, with technology the MOST deviated in the S&amp;P 500. Emerging markets (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/EEM\">EEM</a>), gold, and gold miners (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/IAU\">IAU</a>/<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GDX\">GDX</a>) are also grossly extended, although they recently corrected about 50% of their deviation.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-167.png\"><img alt=\"Risk range report\" height=\"508\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-167-1024x743.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p><br/>The bottom line is that market breadth remains extremely narrow and is getting worse. Such a situation is not usually a good sign for markets as a whole, but so far, this <em>“time has been different.”</em>  Retail buyers continue to chase a handful of names, and diversification has been a drag.</p><p>However, history suggests some caution. When markets are as complacent as they are now, volatility tends to show up sooner than most expect.</p><p>Trade accordingly.<br/> </p><h3><strong>NLY: Deciphering REIT Earnings</strong></h3><p>Last week’s <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__realinvestmentadvice.com_resources_blog_leveraged-2Detfs-2Dyet-2Danother-2Dsign-2Dof-2Drampant-2Dspeculation_&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=PJgpDD_X4kvibnixE-spwza342hldu9uV5MjnfW1V1k&amp;m=bWsov0VpcB0dk6FtTKLlFVDBKT1IeLl4QL4KR34Af69UHsMH-N0zm1baSEA1q_Mj&amp;s=F-39JKbuXyu5IhDS5rqSzS3Bu4zTar15dUQrb5pl1Ow&amp;e=\">Commentary</a> summarized how REIT investors view earnings reports differently from most other investors. With that knowledge, we review Wednesday’s earnings report from Annaly Capital Management (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/NLY\">NLY</a>).:</p><p>NLY reported strong performance driven by mortgage-backed securities (MBS) spread tightening (yields fell more for MBS than UST) and reduced market volatility. Highlights include: GAAP net income of $1.21 per share, earnings available for distribution (EAD) of $0.73 per share (beating consensus of $0.72), and net revenue of $885.6 million. The investment portfolio grew to $122.1 billion, with leverage remaining at 7.1x.</p><p>REIT investors look to different data to assess their investments. We share three of those below for NLY:</p><p><strong>Economic Return</strong> – NLY had an 8.1% economic return, bringing its year-to-date total to 11.5%. This is due to favorable interest rate spreads.</p><p><strong>Price to Book Value</strong>– Book value per common share rose to $19.25. With the stock trading around $21.06 as of October 28, the price-to-book ratio stands at 1.09, a slight premium to net asset value. MBS yields have fallen since then, so the book value is likely slightly higher than $19.25 today.</p><p><strong>Dividend Sustainability</strong>– The quarterly $0.70 dividend is well-covered, with earnings available for distribution of $0.73 per share, providing a payout ratio of about 96%. The annualized dividend yield is 13.3%. Per CFO Serena Wolfe:</p><blockquote><p><em>We are confident in maintaining earnings and dividend coverage, supported by stable swap portfolios and disciplined asset deployment.</em></p></blockquote><p>Given our outlook for lower yields and a steepening yield curve, we like NLY’s prospects. However, the premium to BV introduces dilution risk to shareholders. Additionally, MBS spreads could widen if QT ends. NLY shares have been stable over the last two years. Given the double-digit dividend yield, investors are not banking on stock gains to supplement total return.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nly-graph.png\"><img alt=\"nly earnings\" height=\"361\" src=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nly-graph-1024x528.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><h3><br/><strong>CAPE Valuations: Does Nvidia Overstate Its Ominous Warnings?</strong></h3><p>Nvidia has a current CAPE ratio of 293, but a more reasonable P/E ratio of 48.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"sunset\" height=\"342\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516199423456-1f1e91b06f25?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/GrmwVnVSSdU\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></em><br/> </p><p>One of the things we have in common with Warren Buffett is that we started our risk-taking career handicapping at racetracks. Buffett handicapped the horse races in Omaha, and I handicapped greyhound races near Portland at Multnomah Kennel Club in Gresham, Oregon. Buffett was too young to bet, so he created a tip sheet which he sold at the track. I was in college and most of the time was sending bets with my relatives while working swing shift at the Crown Zellerbach paper mill in Camas, Washington.</p><p>Many of you know that the beginning of our eight criteria for stock selection started with my five criteria for greyhound selection. My older cousins and I concluded at that time that five things really mattered in a greyhound race. First, each dog had a track record and you wanted to know who they had beaten before. The dog classes ran maiden races through class D-A. If you won a maiden race, you were promoted to the next level until you hit class A. Therefore, the first criteria for selection was class (who have you beaten before).</p><p>The second criteria was based on the shape of the racetrack and the speed which generates centrifugal force. The dogs could easily bang into each going around the first corner, ending their chances of success. The third was late speed. The dogs were bred to be quick and it was unusual for the quickest to have any late speed. The fourth criteria was post position, because the dogs had a tendency to prefer running close to the rail (very preferable) or around the outside of the track. An outside runner loved being in an outside box.</p><p>The fifth criteria was what I called the Janet Jackson rule (“What have you done for me lately?”). In other words, how the dog has been running in recent races. The fifth criteria brings us to the dog named Pastel Peepers and a summer of frustration in 1978. Pastel came to Portland, Oregon with a record of beating the best racers in Class A at a prestigious track in Palm Beach, Florida. We had studied the history of all the greyhounds entered and it was the class of the entire field.</p><p>However, some funny things can happen when you move a greyhound from a balmy, warm climate to the cool evenings in the Pacific Northwest. We began betting on Pastel Peepers in Class A and in those races, it failed miserably. Then it dropped to B class and failed to win there, and it finally dropped to C class. Unfortunately, I had to turn my attention back to heading for college. Therefore, in a season where my dad and I made very good net profits in handicapping, we lost more money on Pastel Peepers than any dog the whole season.</p><p>Once I got back to college, Pastel won a C class race, won a B race and got promoted to A. The dog won about 10 straight races and climbed back to its rightful position which we anticipated originally. All we did was lose more because we were too early.</p><p>This brings us to our oil and gas stocks. We were spot on in 2020 in the middle of the COVID-19 meltdown buying Conoco (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/COP\">COP</a>) shares at around $30 per share, Occidental Petroleum (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/OXY\">OXY</a>) at $23 and reading Greg Zuckerman’s book, The Frackers, about Harold Hamm and his company Continental Resources (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/CLR\">CLR</a>). We paid around $12 per share to buy in. In 2022, Hamm bought us out in a going-private transaction at $74.28 per share.</p><p>Our Pastel Peepers mistake came beginning in 2023 on the oil stocks. We felt that over the next ten years the Permian Basin would rollover in production and ESG initiatives would be disappointing, so we stayed with an over-weighted position in oil stocks for the last two years. These stocks have been the biggest drag on our results, just like the underperforming greyhound. When you combine this fact with not being in the futuristic/maniacal AI/Tech/Mag 7/Growth/Bitcoin securities, it is easy to see why we’ve underperformed our usual strong expectations.</p><p>There was a silver lining back in the late 1970s and we believe there will be one in our future as well. The five criteria for dog selection became the root cause of the development of our eight criteria for stock selection. In 1983, my firm brought a closed-end fund public called the Z-Seven Fund with financial backing from Sir John Templeton. It was called Z-Seven, because he had seven criteria for stock selection. Some of the criteria were qualitative and looked attractive, one looked like a bad idea. If the fund had a stock that hit 20 times earnings they would sell automatically.</p><p>When Z-Seven invested, it took a 6% position of the $100 million dollar fund in Nike at 10 times earnings. If he had held Nike to today, his fund would be worth $3.5 billion without any contribution from the other securities that fit the seven criteria. This would have been an 8.8% compounded return, even if the other $94 million dollars disappeared.</p><p>In conclusion, we went from the penthouse with our oil stocks in 2020 through 2022 and now have spent a couple of years in the doldrums. However, nothing has been done that is in conflict with the way we practice our discipline through the lens of our eight criteria. We believe that our portfolio will have the same kind of success relative to our benchmarks that we have had in the past, even though we have had numerous bumps in the road like Pastel Peepers.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/real-estate--reits/the-supermajor-era-in-homebuilders?post=527284\">The Supermajor Era In Homebuilders </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/back-to-basics?post=521973\">Back To Basics </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/sp-500-index-all-twisted-up-in-the-game?post=518517\">S&amp;P 500 Index: All Twisted Up In The Game </a><br/></div>",

In this eye-opening conversation, Scott Melker (The Wolf of All Streets) joins Chris Perkins, President of CoinFund to explain why the traditional four-year Bitcoin cycle is dead and how ETFs, stablecoins, and global stablecoing hyper-dollarization are reshaping the future of money. They discuss the Fed’s recent embrace of blockchain, the surge of major banks entering crypto, and how digital asset treasuries like MicroStrategy are redefining corporate balance sheets. Melker also lays out his long-term thesis: as the “debasement trade” goes mainstream, Bitcoin could ultimately reach $1 million, not from hype, but from structural demand.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Video Length: 00:48:26</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"350\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UGHEBySriJE?si=o5f-55n3IHOSwmmF\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/the-first-inning-of-a-rare-earth-revival?post=530459\">The First Inning Of A Rare Earth Revival </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/the-great-market-illusion--gold-soars-ai-booms-debt-mounts?post=530073\">The Great Market Illusion — Gold Soars, AI Booms, Debt Mounts</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/the-fiscal-flood-driving-global-reflation?post=529844\">The Fiscal Flood Driving Global Reflation</a><br/></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p>The NZD/USD is trading near the 0.57725 ratio as of this writing with fast fluctuations being displayed as financial institutions deal with their perhaps overly ambitious perspectives seen the past couple of days.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"NZD/USD Analysis 30/10: Reversal From Depths (Chart)\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://www.dailyforex.com/files/nzdusd-oct3025-rob.webp\" title=\"NZD/USD Analysis 30/10: Reversal From Depths (Chart)\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>The NZD/USD has seen price velocity over the past handful of days, and lows produced late last week certainly saw a reversal higher this Monday. Whether the lows sparked buying early this week based on the notion the NZD/USD had finally hit blatantly oversold territory in the eyes of financial institutions, or if the buying of the NZD/USD was caused by a perspective the U.S Federal Reserve was going to cut interest rates can be debated.</p><p>However, as the NZD/USD currently trades near the 0.57725 ratio it certainly can be argued the results seen the past couple of days leading into this morning were influenced by both scenarios. The NZD/USD was touching 0.57380 vicinity late last week and then saw a flurry of action on Monday when the currency pair touched the 0.57800 region upon its opening. Current price activity it must be said is straddling values seen late in the day this past Monday.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Anticipated Move by Fed Turns Into Disappointment</strong></h3><p>Yesterday’s move higher in the NZD/USD to the 0.58025 area briefly then turned into strong selling as the U.S Federal Reserve cut its interest rate by 25 basis points. Yes, the rate hike should have helped the value of the NZD/USD actually move upwards, and this was clearly bet on before the Fed’s anticipated cut was announced. But that wasn’t what financial institutions were speculating on, they were expecting a more dovish sounding Federal Reserve – they did not get this. Instead the Fed said the outlook for a December rate cut is uncertain. The rate cut had already been traded into the NZD/USD before the Fed’s announcement yesterday.</p><p>The NZD/USD was not able to sustain higher ground and quickly sold off. The NZD/USD is correlating to the broad Forex market as other major currencies also are doing worse against the USD early today. While the Fed may actually cut interest rates in December, the U.S central bank certainly did not want to commit to that action yesterday. The U.S government shutdown is still if effect, this means economic data remains hard to investigate via official statistics.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"350\" id=\"tradingview_40ee2\" lang=\"en\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://s.tradingview.com/dailyforexcom/widgetembed/?hideideas=1&amp;overrides=%7B%7D&amp;enabled_features=%5B%5D&amp;disabled_features=%5B%5D&amp;locale=en#%7B%22symbol%22%3A%22FX_IDC%3ANZDUSD%22%2C%22frameElementId%22%3A%22tradingview_40ee2%22%2C%22interval%22%3A%2215%22%2C%22allow_symbol_change%22%3A%221%22%2C%22save_image%22%3A%221%22%2C%22studies%22%3A%22%5B%5D%22%2C%22theme%22%3A%22Light%22%2C%22style%22%3A%221%22%2C%22timezone%22%3A%22Etc%2FUTC%22%2C%22studies_overrides%22%3A%22%7B%7D%22%2C%22utm_source%22%3A%22www.dailyforex.com%22%2C%22utm_medium%22%3A%22widget_new%22%2C%22utm_campaign%22%3A%22chart%22%2C%22utm_term%22%3A%22FX_IDC%3ANZDUSD%22%2C%22page-uri%22%3A%22www.dailyforex.com%2Fforex-technical-analysis%2F2025%2F10%2Fnzdusd-analysis-30-october-2025%2F236248%22%7D\" title=\"advanced chart TradingView widget\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p><h3><br/><strong>Fed Uncertainly and Cautious Trading Conditions</strong></h3><p>The Fed preached uncertainty once again and this hurt the NZD/USD bulls who were hoping for more optimism.

A case in point is the 16 sectors we divide the business world into, compared to the 11 sectors in the S&amp;P Global Industry Classification System. We have a standalone sector for the automobile space, unlike the Consumer Discretionary and Industrial sectors, where automakers and other value-chain operators are conventionally classified.</p><p>Other stand-alone Zacks sectors include Retail, Construction, Conglomerates, Aerospace/Defense, Transportation, and Business Services. We believe that the stand-alone Zacks sectors for these businesses allow for a granular understanding of the issues specific to each, enabling users of our data to identify trend shifts more easily.</p><p>Getting back to the Zacks Auto sector, where General Motors (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GM\">GM</a> - <a href=\"https://www.zacks.com/registration/premium/login/?ALERT=zrmodule&amp;mode=zramodule&amp;t=GM&amp;ADID=ZCOM_ARTICLEBODY_TCK_EARNINGSOUTLOOK_2780901_GM&amp;icid=COMMENTARY-Earnings_Outlook-2780901-free_report-commentary_body-text-GM\">Free Report</a>), Ford (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/F\">F</a> - <a href=\"https://www.zacks.com/registration/premium/login/?ALERT=zrmodule&amp;mode=zramodule&amp;t=F&amp;ADID=ZCOM_ARTICLEBODY_TCK_EARNINGSOUTLOOK_2780901_F&amp;icid=COMMENTARY-Earnings_Outlook-2780901-free_report-commentary_body-text-F\">Free Report</a>), Tesla (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/TSLA\">TSLA</a> - <a href=\"https://www.zacks.com/registration/premium/login/?ALERT=zrmodule&amp;mode=zramodule&amp;t=TSLA&amp;ADID=ZCOM_ARTICLEBODY_TCK_EARNINGSOUTLOOK_2780901_TSLA&amp;icid=COMMENTARY-Earnings_Outlook-2780901-free_report-commentary_body-text-TSLA\">Free Report</a>), and other operators in the space are placed. We know that the market reacted positively to Q3 results from these three companies, more so for Ford and GM than for Tesla, but the overall market reaction has been positive.</p><p>For the Zacks Auto sector, we now have Q3 results from 57.1% of the sector players in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total earnings for these auto sector players are down -23.9% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 50% beating EPS estimates and 100% beating revenue estimates.</p><p>The earnings declines are across the board, with Ford’s Q3 earnings down -7%, GM’s down -19.3% and Tesla’s down -39.5%. To give you a sense of the group’s margin trends, revenues were up +9.6% at Ford, flat at GM (actually down -0.3%), and up +11.6% at Tesla.</p><p>These numbers don’t appear to justify the market’s reaction to the Q3 results. But we have to be mindful that a stock’s reaction to quarterly results is primarily a function of what was feared and expected, rather than the absolute numbers.</p><p>It is no exaggeration to say that Tesla has unique, company-specific stock market drivers that aren’t applicable to others in the space. For Ford and GM, these results may not be pretty, but they were better than expected. Importantly, guidance for the current period was better than feared, with tariffs proving to be a smaller headwind than initially feared.</p><p>The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Ford, Tesla, and GM shares relative to the Zacks Auto sector and the S&amp;P 500 index.</p><p> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Zacks Investment Research\" src=\"https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/2a/129775.jpg?v=512628825\"/><br/>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</p><h3><br/><strong>The Earnings Big Picture</strong><br/> </h3><p>For 2025 Q3, the expectation is for earnings growth of +7.3% on +7.3% revenue gains.

The typical behavior at this stage would have been for Q4 estimates to decline, which is what we have observed in the post-COVID period. At this stage in the preceding quarter, however, estimates had already started to rise.</p><p>We will see what trend takes shape in the days ahead as we get more Q3 results, which will allow analysts to adjust their estimates for Q4 and beyond. All in all, we are in a good place with the picture emerging from the Q3 reporting cycle.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/previewing-mag-7-earnings-what-investors-should-know?post=530367\">Previewing Mag 7 Earnings: What Investors Should Know</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/finance-sector-provides-flying-start-to-q3-earnings-season?post=529914\">Finance Sector Provides Flying Start To Q3 Earnings Season</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/q3-earnings-season-starts-positively-a-closer-look?post=529169\">Q3 Earnings Season Starts Positively: A Closer Look</a></p></div>",

(<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/SNAP\">SNAP</a>) chief executive Evan Spiegel made waves during a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OhHwVNJmWus\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC interview</a> at the Future Investment Initiative conference this week, where he previewed the firm’s AR glasses set to launch in 2026.</p><p>Spiegel emphasized that Snap has been investing in wearable computing for over a decade, even before Snapchat had a chat feature – and that his company’s AR glasses will be “infinitely more capable than Meta’s (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/meta\">META</a>) smart glasses.”</p><p>The CEO’s remarks arrive at a time when SNAP stock is struggling to turn green for the year.</p><p>At less than $8.0, it’s currently down nearly 40% versus its year-to-date high in early January.</p><h3><br/><strong>How Snap’s AR glasses compare to Meta’s smart glasses</strong><br/> </h3><p>Spiegel didn’t mince words when contrasting Snap’s “Specs” with <a href=\"https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/18/meta-launches-799-ray-ban-smart-glasses-heres-a-peek-into-future-of-ai-wearables/\">Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses</a>. “They really aren’t capable of all that much. They’re AirPods and a camera,” he said.</p><p>In contrast, Snap’s upcoming AR glasses are designed to be a full-fledged wearable computer with a see-through form factor.</p><p>The goal here is to help users “look up and experience the world and technology at the same time,” rather than being tethered to screens.</p><p>Specs will offer real-time AR overlays, spatial awareness, and interactive computing – far beyond Meta’s audio-visual enhancements.</p><p>“They’ll be more expensive than Ray-Bans, certainly, but infinitely more capable,” Spiegel added, underscoring SNAP’s intent to redefine the category.</p><h3><br/><strong>What Specs may mean for SNAP shares</strong><br/> </h3><p>Snap’s AR glasses could be a game-changer if they deliver on the promised functionality and user experience.</p><p>The company sees a growing consumer fatigue with screen-based interaction, and specs aim to offer a more natural, immersive alternative.</p><p>Spiegel noted, “People are exhausted from looking down at screens all day long, and they’re looking for something new and different.”</p><p>If Snap can successfully position specs as the next evolution of mobile computing, it could unlock new revenue streams across hardware, software, and advertising – ultimately unlocking multi-year upside in <a href=\"https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/22/snap-stock-price-forecast-as-the-os-2-0-upgrade-rally-gains-steam/\">SNAP shares</a>.</p><p>However, execution will be key. Investors will be watching closely for product demos, developer ecosystem growth, and early adoption metrics in 2026.</p><h3><br/><strong>Is Snap stock worth owning heading into 2026?</strong><br/> </h3><p>While the AR glasses narrative is compelling, Snap stock remains a wait-and-see story at best.</p><p>The company continues to face headwinds in digital advertising, competition from TikTok and Instagram, and margin pressure.</p><p><a href=\"https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/08/snap-stock-price-forecast-is-it-safe-to-buy-the-dip-or-sell-the-rip/\">Its financials show inconsistent profitability</a>, and valuation remains elevated relative to earnings.</p><p>More importantly, hardware launches are notoriously difficult – Google Glass and Magic Leap offer cautionary tales.</p><p>Without clear visibility into Specs’ pricing, capabilities, or market readiness, the optimism may be premature.</p><p>Until Snap Inc proves it can scale AR hardware and monetize it effectively, investors may want to remain cautious.</p><p>The promise is real, but the path is still uncertain.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/apple-vs-microsoft-stock-as-both-hit-40-trillion-market-cap?post=531145\">Apple Vs Microsoft Stock As Both Hit $4.0 Trillion Market Cap </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/is-it-too-late-to-buy-avidity-stock-after-novartis-deal?post=530861\">Is It Too Late To Buy Avidity Stock After Novartis Deal? </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/lululemon-stock-could-the-nfl-deal-prove-its-much-needed-saviour?post=530789\">Lululemon Stock: Could The NFL Deal Prove Its Much-Needed Saviour? </a><br/></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"brass metal frame\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559058922-5d29e1f00075?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><small><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/8A8_fy7ZXHI\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></em></small><br/> </p><p>Gold (XAUUSD) is holding steady as markets digest the Federal Reserve’s latest policy shift and its implications for future rate moves. The Fed delivered a widely expected 25 basis point cut, but Chair Powell’s cautious tone tempered expectations for further easing. In response, the U.S. Dollar rebounded, pressuring gold’s initial gains. At the same time, investors are closely watching U.S.–China trade negotiations, which remain a key driver of market sentiment. This evolving mix of monetary signals and geopolitical developments continues to shape gold’s short-term outlook.</p><h3><br/><strong>Gold Stalls after Fed Cut as Powell Signals Data-Driven Approach</strong><br/> </h3><p>Gold remains supported by a combination of Fed-driven policy uncertainty and geopolitical risk. After the Fed’s 25 bps cut, <a href=\"https://goldpredictors.com/gold-related-markets-analysis/\">markets</a> initially leaned bullish, triggering a brief rally in gold. However, Jerome Powell’s remarks after the decision signaled a more cautious stance. He warned that the lack of timely data, caused by the U.S. government shutdown, could make future decisions more difficult. That tempered rate-cut expectations, especially for the December 10 meeting.</p><p>The CME FedWatch Tool shows a 67.8% probability of no rate change at the Fed’s December meeting. This represents a significant increase from the 9.1% probability seen before the announcement. As a result, the U.S. Dollar rebounded sharply, limiting gold’s earlier advance. The renewed Dollar strength and reduced policy easing expectations continue to cap gold’s short-term momentum.</p><p>Meanwhile, markets are now closely monitoring progress in U.S.–China trade negotiations. Both sides have reported incremental progress in recent discussions, including on fentanyl controls and export regulations. However, the lack of a formal agreement leaves markets vulnerable to sudden risk reversals. If talks stall, gold could regain its safe-haven appeal.  Conversely, meaningful progress could weaken gold interest as capital shifts toward equities. This ongoing uncertainty continues to anchor gold near critical levels.</p><h3><br/><strong>Gold Faces Key Technical Resistance after Multi-Decade Breakout</strong><br/> </h3><p>The gold chart below shows a historic breakout above a long-standing trendline that connects the 1980 and 2011 peaks. This green <a href=\"https://goldpredictors.com/what-are-support-and-resistance/\">resistance</a> line served as a major ceiling for more than four decades. Gold successfully breached the trendline, but momentum has faded as price consolidates just above former resistance.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"gold\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://talkmarkets.com/contributor/gold-predictors/user_content/ckimages/orig_xauusd_2025-10-30_09-01-03.webp\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, a second red resistance zone marks the 2011–2025 range, where gold repeatedly struggled to maintain upward momentum. Following a strong rally in 2024 and 2025, price has once again reached the upper boundary of this area. Notably, the orange circle on the chart highlights the ongoing struggle at this critical inflection point. Despite strong bullish momentum, a decisive close above this zone is still needed to confirm a sustained <a href=\"https://goldpredictors.com/gold-breaks-historic-resistance-real-and-nominal-breakouts-signal-long-term-strength/\">breakout</a>.</p><p>Additionally, the chart features a green trendline that spans multiple market cycles, reflecting long-term structural development. This former resistance line has now flipped into a durable support zone. Gold’s earlier test and rebound from this trendline strengthened confidence in the broader <a href=\"https://goldpredictors.com/gold-technical-analysis-structural-breakout-and-miner-outperformance-confirm-bull-run/\">bullish setup</a>. However, without a decisive breakout above the red resistance zone, the current rally remains exposed to potential pullbacks.</p><h3><br/><strong>Conclusion: Gold Remains at a Crossroads near Structural Resistance</strong><br/> </h3><p>Gold continues to trade near a critical resistance zone, where both macro forces and technical barriers converge. The Fed’s cautious stance and a stronger Dollar are limiting immediate upside, while ongoing U.S.–China trade talks add another layer of uncertainty. Until gold delivers a decisive breakout, price action will remain sensitive to policy shifts, geopolitical headlines, and broader market sentiment.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/gold-holds-gains-as-trumpxi-meeting-and-fed-outlook-shape-market-sentiment?post=531420\">Gold Holds Gains As Trump–Xi Meeting And Fed Outlook Shape Market Sentiment </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/gold-pulls-back-as-us-china-trade-optimism-and-softer-inflation-weigh-on-safe-haven-demand?post=530686\">Gold Pulls Back As US-China Trade Optimism And Softer Inflation Weigh On Safe-Haven Demand </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/gold-consolidates-near-highs-as-markets-brace-for-inflation-data-and-uschina-talks?post=530174\">Gold Consolidates Near Highs As Markets Brace For Inflation Data And U.S.–China Talks </a></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Person Holding Blue and Clear Ballpoint Pen\" height=\"331\" src=\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/590022/pexels-photo-590022.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/chart-close-up-data-desk-590022/\" target=\"_blank\">Pexels</a></em><br/> </p><p>After 2008, there was a small community who always predicted repeats of The Financial Crisis.<em> </em>The problem the doom-mongers faced was the back side of “The Minsky Cycle”: actors react to a crisis by reducing risk and taking steps to avoid repeating the exact same crisis. That was done throughout the financial system (including Canadian regulators who changed their housing market policies, which was my worry at the time). However, memories fade — and new ways to spawn a crisis pop up.</p><p>Financial crises of varying strength have popped up on a frequency of (roughly) once per decade in the United States since the 1960s (when the lingering fear of the Great Depression finally subsided). The COVID recession hit at about a decade after the Financial Crisis — and so we had another crisis that stood in for a financial crisis. The question one might ask is whether the clock is ticking. Although I am fairly permanently pessimistic, I still lean towards a financial crisis being delayed.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Fiscal-Induced Crisis</strong></h3><p>The big risk on the horizon is a fiscal “policy” induced recession/depression in the United States — although the issue here is literally a lack of a fiscal policy. Turning off SNAP payments, a large increase in medical insurance premiums, and the cutting of pay to many government workers could easily lead to a collapse in demand. There is a general sense of unreality in Washington D.C., and it is unclear to me when the government shutdown will end. That said, panic among politicians will probably set in once reality starts breaking into their information bubbles.</p><p>Since restoring order can be done rapidly, it is perhaps too early to panic. The problem is that economic data is also not being published, and so we are flying blind.<br/> </p><h3><strong>AI Bubble</strong></h3><p>I have written very little on the topic of so-called “artificial intelligence” (AI) on the basis that I thought it was a cute technology that would find some niche uses — but not lead to a revolution in economic activity from a macro perspective.</p><p>However, a macro issue is the investment spending on data centres. If optimism about the future of AI fades, that spending could crater. Although this would have an effect on the economic growth, there are important distinctions between it and homebuilding (which is usually at the centre of modern financial crises, although business investment is sometimes involved). AI capital-spending is not that a labour-intensive a process, nor does it involve a large number of shaky borrowers.</p><p>Financial crises usually involve lenders panicking and withdrawing funding. The tech bubble popped in the late 1990s when people no longer wanted to fund the 3G/optical fibre buildout, which was a global fixed investment wave. (The financial media focussed on the dot-com equities, which were a macro sideshow unlike the 3G/fibre buildout.) The news flow I see suggests that the AI buildout is being funded by incestuous vendor financing loops within the tech sector (which was a feature of the 1990s tech bubble). Although a failure of those projects might make investors in those companies sad, many of the firms involved are still cashflow positive from their other lines of business. As such, there is no reason for a hard landing resulting from AI concerns alone, rather a sectoral recession. More realistically, the main risk from AI spending is that it would be just another large casualty of a wider collapse in animal spirits for other reasons.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Crypto/Stable coins</strong></h3><p>I was always skeptical about the theory that crypto-currencies were going to revolutionise money, and I see no reason to believe that I was wrong. The crypto ecosystem created a new set of private “monies” that circulate as a betting scheme, and the system as a whole acts like a “currency” for a virtual economy that has almost no useful<em> legal</em> products and services associated with it. The ecosystem does not collapse because there are <em>illegal</em> products and services that crypto provides, and there are people pushing real money into the ecosystem. As long as those inflows continue, the show can go on.</p><p>Stablecoins are economically distinct from pure crypto currencies (like Bitcoin) — most appear just to be unregulated money market funds denominated in real currencies. Money market funds in principle are safe instruments — they are a pass-through that allows smaller investors to buy money market instruments. Problems with money market funds show up when unit holders rush to liquidate due to credit concerns. This pulls away funding from entities that funded themselves in the money markets, and thus there is a funding crisis.</p><p>The beauty of stablecoins is that they are so unregulated so that it unclear to me whether some of the assets that they allegedly own on the behalf of stablecoin owners even exist. To the extent that the funds were going to fraudsters, there’s not a whole of productive investment being funded by them. This means stablecoins are just a zero-sum transfer from buyers to sellers, and so the multiplier on losses is limited. Furthermore, the entities that put money into stablecoins are risk-seeking, and do not fit the behavioural profiles of traditional money market investors.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Inflation Book</strong></h3><p>I have been puttering away on my inflation book. I was unhappy with it, but upon rereading, I think my concerns were somewhat misplaced. I am now doing clean up that was necessitated by the passage of time, but things look good.</p><p>The problem of course is that it is unclear for how much longer the BLS will produce credible inflation data, which undermines a major premise of the book (that inflation data is credible, it just might not conform to what people expect).</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/economics--politics/tariffs-and-fiscal-policy?post=525978\">Tariffs And Fiscal Policy</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/chickening-out-over-the-jobs-report?post=515772\">Chickening Out Over The Jobs Report</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/primer-why-are-economic-data-revised?post=513443\">Primer: Why Are Economic Data Revised?</a><br/></div>",

The Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250917a.htm\">delivered as promised in September</a> and again at <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251029a.htm\">the October policy meeting</a> with 25 basis point cuts that now have the Fed funds rate ranging from 3.75% to 4.0%. However, in his <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20251029.pdf\">opening statement</a> explaining the latest rate cut, Powell balked (on behalf of the Fed). He cautioned that “a further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a forgone conclusion” and just in case anyone doubted the weight of his words, he added “far from it” for emphasis. Financial markets promptly responded negatively to this single sentence and the odds for a December rate cut declined accordingly.</p><p>Still, after the dust settles on this meeting, I fully expect the Fed to stay the course with a rate cut in December. Powell’s statements belie a Fed that is both gradually (some reluctantly?) accepting the case for looking through <a href=\"https://inflationwatch.drduru.com/october-beige-book-includes-signs-of-higher-price-pressures-in-2026/\">inflationary pressures</a> and getting incrementally more worried about the labor market.</p><h3><br/><strong>Division Translates Into Balking</strong><br/> </h3><p>Powell acknowledged strong disagreements among the Committee members. He teased a reveal in the upcoming minutes from the meeting, but the Fed vote says plenty. Recent appointee Stephen Miran unsurprisingly wanted a 50 basis point cut in a repeat of his dissent in the September meeting. Kansas City Fed governor Jeffrey R. Schmid delivered a dissent at the other end with a vote for leaving rates unchanged. Thus, it is easy to imagine the Fed currently holds a broad enough range of opinions on the direction for monetary policy to cause a pause in December.</p><p>In response to a reporter’s question about division in the Fed, Powell pointed out that Committee members have different forecasts and different levels of risk tolerances which come through in their speeches. Most importantly, Powell revealed that “there is a feeling in some we should wait.” Since there was just one vote for waiting during the latest meeting, I assume Powell referred to waiting instead of cutting in December – a not so subtle hint that the Fed as a group may already prefer not to cut in December.</p><h3><br/><strong>The Case for A December Cut Still Looms</strong><br/> </h3><p>However, the hesitancy to cut in December directly contradicts Powell’s assessment of the economic situation. Powell noted that the current rate is above the neutral rate (“wherever it is”). Thus, policy is technically restrictive. Importantly, Powell ascribed the cooling in the labor market and the economy to restrictive policy. So if the Fed has truly adopted the mission to focus on addressing the downside risks in the economy, the Fed must stay biased to cut rates. At this point, the Fed will have a very difficult time explaining how it can “stand by” and watch a weakening economy and labor market.</p><p>While there remains upside risk to the Fed’s inflation mandate, Powell makes a weaker and weaker case every meeting that the Fed is truly concerned about that risk. He said plenty to indicate that the prospects for inflation are contained and even tame. Here were his main points on inflation:</p><ul><li>Most measures of long-run inflation expectations remain consistent with the Fed’s 2% inflation target.</li><li>Services inflation is coming down</li><li>Higher tariffs are pushing up inflation as one-time increase in the price level (the base case)</li><li>The core PCE (personal consumption expenditures, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation) without tariffs would be 2.3% or 2.4% without tariffs, not far from the 2% target.</li><li>The tariff-driven increase in goods prices is happening within the longer-term context of goods deflation.</li></ul><p>Thus, once the base case of a one-time effect laps the inflation readings, the Fed should be comfortably close to its target.</p><p>While Powell reiterated that the Fed is determined to make sure that the inflationary impact of tariffs is indeed a one-time increase in the price level, the overall picture painted by Powell makes inflation look well-contained. The implied upside risk from the uncertainties in tariff policy hardly seem noteworthy in Powell’s updated narrative.</p><p>On the other hand, Powell claims there is “no significant deterioration” in the economic data. While Powell pointed out that the downside risks to employment have risen, he did not express any concern for the highly publicized mass layoffs from big companies like Amazon.com (AMZN) and United Parcel Services (UPS). In response to a question about these layoffs, Powell only said that the Fed is watching these developments, and the layoffs do not yet show up in the initial claims data (of course not – these layoffs are recent announcements).</p><p>Overall, Powell sums up the labor issue as low hiring and low firing in the context of immigration policies shrinking the labor supply and a cyclical drop in the participation rate in the workforce. When asked how then will rate cuts help the job market, Powell responded that cuts will make sure the “labor market doesn’t get worse.” Upon hearing that explanation, I felt tingles of recessionary risks.</p><h3><br/><strong>Inflation Warnings from Overseas?</strong><br/> </h3><p>While Americans are mostly focused on the inflation risks from tariffs, inflation is also proving stubbornly sticky in other major economies who are not at war with the global economy. For example, with inflation at 3.8% in the United Kingdom, the Bank of England is further away from its 2% inflation target than the Federal Reserve is from its target. In <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/letter/2025/september/cpi-inflation-september-2025\">its last letter explaining the on-going inability to hit the target</a>, the BoE reported:</p><blockquote><p>“The recent increase in CPI inflation has owed largely to food prices and administered prices, including water bills and Vehicle Excise Duty. A reduction in total labour cost growth also appears to have been delayed by the increase in employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and pay growth in sectors with a large share of employees at or close to the National Living Wage (NLW).”</p></blockquote><p>Yet, the BoE expects this year’s inflation increase to peak in September. The combination of a weakening labor market and restrictive policy is expected to help push inflation toward the 2% target next year. This is the UK version of hopeful monetary policy. The BoE just made its last rate cut in August, going from 4.25% to 4.0%. The policy rate was left unchanged in the last meeting.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/australia-inflation-tops-forecasts-highest-over-year-third-quarter-rba-cpi-michelle-bullock.html\">inflation in Australia hit its highest point in over a year</a>. With inflation now above the Reserve Bank of Australia’s target band of 2-3%, the RBA will likely need to put a pause on its easing cycle. <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/cpi-rises-13-september-2025-quarter\" target=\"_blank\">The Australian Bureau of Statistics</a> identified housing, recreation and culture, and transport as the main drivers of inflationary pressures. A likely pause in easing further strengthened <a href=\"https://inflationwatch.drduru.com/inflation-at-target-and-gdp-growth-recovery-a-comeback-case-for-the-australian-dollar/\">my case to stay long the Australian dollar (FXA)</a>.</p><p>I am now on heightened alert for sticky inflation becoming a global problem that justifies an extended run for the debasement trade.</p><h3><br/><strong>A Pause in the Debasement Trade</strong><br/> </h3><p>As the Fed expresses hesitancy about cutting rates again in December, the debasement trade took a major pause going into the Fed meeting, perhaps in anticipation of a less dovish Fed. Given I think the Fed will feel compelled to proceed with cuts in December, I consider the pause in the debasement trade to be even more temporary than the inflationary pressure from tariffs. I have treated this sharp pullback as the buying opportunity I have (mostly) patiently waited for. When parabolic rallies finally lose steam, the pullbacks are often swift and steep. I am looking for support to hold for the SPDR Gold Shares (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GLD\">GLD</a>) by the $350 level where the 50-day moving average (DMA) (the red line in the chart below) awaits testing.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/inflationwatch.drduru.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251029_GLD-SPDR-Gold-Trust.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"SPDR Gold Trust (GLD)\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/inflationwatch.drduru.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251029_GLD-SPDR-Gold-Trust.png?resize=640%2C368&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"640\"/></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">SPDR Gold Trust (GLD)</p><p>Bond yields understandably spiked higher in response to the Fed’s balk on rate cuts. However, I am no longer interested in trying to fade rallies in the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF as I now accept that the bond market’s overall trajectory is to worry much more about imminent economic weakness than lingering inflationary pressures.</p><p>The bond market is giving the Fed a green light for rate cuts. Thus, today’s balking should gradually transition to acceptance in the coming weeks.</p><p>Be careful out there!</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/bonds/october-beige-book-includes-signs-of-higher-price-pressures-in-2026?post=529378\">October Beige Book Includes Signs Of Higher Price Pressures In 2026 </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/a-market-melt-up-alongside-a-government-melt-down?post=526450\">A Market Melt-Up Alongside A Government Melt-Down</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/what-happened-in-the-housing-market--rate-cut-fail?post=525541\">What Happened In The Housing Market? – Rate Cut Fail </a></p></div>",

The subsequent fall favors bearish traders, though positive oscillators on the daily chart back the case for the emergence of dip-buyers near the 152.00 round figure. A convincing break below the said handle would expose the overnight swing low, around the 151.55-151.50 region, before spot prices extend the slide further towards the 151.10-151.00 pivotal support. Some follow-through selling would confirm a fresh breakdown and pave the way for deeper losses.</p><p>On the flip side, the 153.00 round figure now seems to act as an immediate hurdle ahead of the 153.25-153.30 region, above which the USD/JPY pair could aim to reclaim the 154.00 mark. The momentum could extend further towards the next relevant resistance near mid-154.00s en route to the 154.75-154.80 region and the 155.00 psychological mark.</p><h3><br/><strong>Japanese Yen Price Today</strong><br/> </h3><p>The table below shows the percentage change of Japanese Yen (JPY) against listed major currencies today.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) holds ground against the US Dollar (USD) following the highly anticipated meeting between US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping in South Korea. Any shift in China’s economic conditions could also affect the Australian dollar (AUD), given the close trade ties between China and Australia.</p><p>President Trump announced that tariffs on China will be reduced to 47% from the current 57%. Trump added that the rare earth dispute has been resolved, ensuring no further restrictions on China’s rare earth exports. Soybean purchases will begin immediately, and China has agreed to intensify efforts to curb the fentanyl problem. However, Trump noted that not all issues were discussed.</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping said following the meeting that “two sides should look at the long-term interests of cooperation.” Xi added that China has never tried to challenge, replace anyone. Both sides have good prospects for countering telecom fraud, money laundering, and AI cooperation, he added.</p><p>The AUD gained support after Australia’s hotter-than-expected Q3 inflation and August CPI data were released on Wednesday. The stronger readings reduced expectations for near-term rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). RBA Governor Bullock noted that the labor market remains somewhat tight, despite the unexpected rise in the unemployment rate.</p><h3><br/><strong>US Dollar declines over an uncertain Fed policy outlook</strong><br/> </h3><ul><li value=\"1\">The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US Dollar against six major currencies, is losing ground after registering gains in the previous session and trading around 98.90 at the time of writing.</li><li value=\"2\">The Federal Reserve (Fed) delivered a widely anticipated 25-basis-point interest rate cut on Wednesday. This marks the second straight interest rate cut from the Fed, albeit with some policymakers making a mental note of a general increase in some inflationary pressures through the second half of the year, but not enough to deter another leg down in interest rates.</li><li value=\"3\">The US Dollar gained ground after the Fed acknowledged it would continue to ease back on Quantitative Easing (QE) practices, with the process of drawing down the Fed's mortgage-backed asset balance sheet into long-term Treasuries by December 1.</li><li value=\"4\">Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated at the post-meeting press conference that the available data indicate little change in the outlook for employment and inflation since the September meeting. Powell noted that the government shutdown will weigh on economic activity while it continues, but should reverse once it ends. He added that another rate cut in December is far from certain, emphasizing that the path forward remains uncertain.</li><li value=\"5\">The RBA Trimmed Mean CPI for Q3 rose 1.0% and 3.0% on a quarterly and annual basis, respectively. Markets estimated an increase of 0.8% QoQ and 2.7% YoY in the quarter to September. The monthly Consumer Price Index jumped by 3.5% YoY in August, compared to the previous reading of a 3.0% increase. This figure came in hotter than the expectation of 3.1%.</li><li value=\"6\">The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported on Friday that the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.0% year-over-year (YoY) in September, following a 2.9% increase in the prior month. This reading came in below the market expectation of 3.1%. Meanwhile, the monthly CPI increased 0.3%, against the 0.4% rise seen in August. The core CPI increased 0.2% month-over-month, compared to the market consensus of 0.3%, while the yearly core CPI was up 3.0% in September.</li></ul><h3><br/><strong>Australian Dollar tests 0.6600 barrier due to possible bullish shift</strong><br/> </h3><p>The AUD/USD pair is trading around 0.6590 on Thursday. Technical analysis of a daily chart suggests a neutral bias as the pair moves within a rectangle pattern. The pair is trading above the nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating that both short-term price momentum is stronger.</p><p>On the upside, the immediate barrier lies at the psychological level of 0.6600, followed by the rectangle’s upper boundary around 0.6630. A break above the rectangle would cause the emergence of the bullish bias and support the AUD/USD pair to explore the region around the 12-month high of 0.6707, which was recorded on September 17.</p><p>The primary support lies at the nine-day EMA of 0.6549, aligned with the 50-day EMA at 0.6546. A break below these levels would weaken the short- and medium-term price momentum and prompt the AUD/USD pair to test the lower boundary of the rectangle around 0.6450, followed by the four-month low of 0.6414.</p><h3><br/><strong>AUD/USD: Daily Chart</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"275\" src=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feditorial.fxsstatic.com%2Fmiscelaneous%2Fimage-1761801322125-1761801322129.png&amp;w=1536&amp;q=95\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Australian Dollar Price Today</strong><br/> </h3><p>The table below shows the percentage change of Australian Dollar (AUD) against listed major currencies today.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><h3><strong>The Dow US 30 remains bullish</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://cdn.orbex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/30092347/US30-4.png\"><img alt=\"US 30 remains bullish\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://cdn.orbex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/30092347/US30-4.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p><br/>The Dow remains upbeat, with tech stocks and AI leading the way, as price action doesn’t look like slowing down. A move above 47800 validated another peak, prompting traders to wonder whether the bubble is about to burst. Any chance that a new round of selling could send the index below the weekend gap at 47200? The next bullish target of 48200 is the first obstacle to clear for a continuation.<br/> </p><h3><strong>USDCAD attempts to stabilise</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"USDCAD attempts to stabilise\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://cdn.orbex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/30092156/USDCAD-5.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>The greenback gave away some of its previous gains after halting the early October rally. The pullback saw heavy resistance at the mid-1.4100 area. A close back above 1.4100 would help bulls regain control and send the pair to the previous peak. In the meantime, short-term sentiment remains cautious after a loss of momentum, which could attract more sellers, especially if buyers throw in the towel. 1.3900 is a key support to prevent the pair from losing more ground.<br/> </p><h3><strong>EURGBP maintains the rally</strong><br/> </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://cdn.orbex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/30092315/EURGBP-4.png\"><img alt=\"EURGBP maintains the rally\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://cdn.orbex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/30092315/EURGBP-4.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p><br/>The euro capitalised on a weakening pound, with prices popping to another fresh high. On the chart, the euro’s break above 0.8800 indicates an extended bullish rally after the previous month-long correction. On the downside, 0.8740 is a fresh support level in case of a reversal on the fundamental news, as the RSI remains in the overbought area. If there are no surprises by the European Central Bank, then 0.8850 is the next target higher.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/can-the-ecb-rate-decision-move-the-eurusd?post=531402\">Can The ECB Rate Decision Move The EURUSD? </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/markets-braced-for-fed-decision?post=531356\">Markets Braced For Fed Decision </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/intraday-analysis-wednesday-oct-29?post=531293\">Intraday Analysis - Wednesday, Oct. 29</a><br/></div>",

Yet constructive numbers from the US Energy Information Administration ensured the market ended higher. LME copper prices also hit fresh record highs.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Energy – Bullish EIA inventory numbers</strong></h3><p>The oil market had a choppy session yesterday, still trying to digest the impact of Russian sanctions amid an increasingly comfortable balance as we head into 2026. However, a set of bullish numbers from the US Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) weekly inventory report ensured crude oil prices closed higher, with Brent settling 0.81% higher on the day.</p><p>The EIA reported that US crude oil inventories fell by 6.86m barrels over the last week. It was driven by the Gulf Coast, where crude inventories declined by just shy of 10m barrels. Lower imports were behind the inventory draw, with total crude imports falling 867k b/d week-on-week to the lowest level since February 2021, while Gulf Coast imports hit a record low. Refined product numbers were also bullish. Gasoline and distillate stocks fell by 5.94m barrels and 3.36m barrels, respectively. The decline in gasoline inventories occurred despite exports falling 363k b/d. Stronger domestic demand provided support, with implied gasoline demand increasing 470k b/d WoW, while refiners also reduced their utilisation rates by 2 percentage points to 86.6%.</p><p>Looking ahead, plenty of attention will be on today’s talks between President Trump and President Xi. The market will also be watching this weekend's OPEC+ meeting, where the group will likely announce another 137k b/d supply hike for December.</p><p>Away from oil, the latest positioning data shows that investment funds cut their net long in Title Transfer Facility (TTF) natural gas by 14.3TWh over the last reporting week to 46.2TWh – a move driven largely by fresh shorts entering the market. European natural gas prices continue to trade in a largely range-bound manner as we head further into the heating season, despite EU storage standing at just under 83% full. This is below the 5-year average of 92% and is slowly drawing. Meanwhile, investment funds marginally cut their net long in EU allowances by 821 contracts to 93,894, a marginal decline, but it’s the first week of fund selling this month.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Metals – Copper hits record high</strong></h3><p>Copper hit a record on the LME yesterday, topping its previous high of $11,104.50/t set in May 2024. A supportive macro backdrop, falling US dollar, rate cuts and low inventories have lifted industrial metals prices recently.</p><p>Copper is the standout performer in the base metals complex, with prices up more than 25% year-to-date, and on track for its best year since 2017. Copper is rallying due to mounting supply disruptions, most recently Freeport’s declaration of force majeure at its giant Grasberg mine in Indonesia, and the wider risk-on mood ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting. The outlook for copper is starting to look brighter with balances tightening for both 2025 and 2026 amid supply challenges and rising trade optimism.</p><p>However, the risk of demand destruction shouldn’t be ignored, as Chinese buyers show signs of price sensitivity, which could put a ceiling on copper's upside. The Yangshan premium, paid by traders for imported metal and a key indicator of physical demand in China, remains in focus. For now, it hovers around $35/t after slumping more than 20% since late September, down from year-to-date highs above $100/t in May.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Agriculture– Sugar under pressure with Indian export talk</strong></h3><p>Sugar prices have continued to come under pressure, with No.11 trading down to its lowest level since December 2020 at one stage yesterday. The Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) revised higher its estimates of gross sugar output (excluding sugar diverted for ethanol production) to around 31.5mt for the 2025/26 season compared to its previous forecast of 30mt. Favourable weather conditions in key growing regions boosted plant growth and were primarily responsible for the higher output estimates. Sugar allocation for ethanol production could fall to 3.4mt, compared with an earlier estimate of 5mt, as oil refiners scale back purchases of biofuel. The association requests that the government allow the export of 2mt of sugar for the 2025/26 season. In addition, the global market is expected to be in large surplus through the 2025/26 season. Clearly, prices need to remain under pressure to push mills in Brazil to allocate more cane to ethanol production to help resolve the large surplus expected for the 2026/27 CS Brazil crop.</p><p>Market reports indicate that China has purchased three US soybean cargoes this week, totaling approximately 180kt of soybeans to be delivered in December and January. China's return to the US soybean market ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting indicates positive market sentiment. Yet the scale of purchases remains relatively modest for now. This could keep traders cautious until the deal details are known. The market is also in the dark about official data. The usual weekly export sales data from the USDA has been delayed by the US government shutdown.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/rates-spark-fed-and-ecb-in-a-good-place?post=531554\">Rates Spark: Fed And ECB In A Good Place </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/bank-of-canada-cuts-rates-again-but-signals-the-end-is-approaching?post=531507\">Bank Of Canada Cuts Rates Again, But Signals The End Is Approaching </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/spanish-activity-slows-as-tariffs-start-to-bite?post=531394\">Spanish Activity Slows As Tariffs Start To Bite </a><br/></div>",
