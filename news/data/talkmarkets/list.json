The complexity of estimating Dutch pension reform flows doesn't help the case for a steeper 10s30s. In the US, Treasuries are trading heavily in post-FOMC, and look like they can attempt to continue to do so.</em></p><h3><br/><strong>Higher 10Y euro swap rates through steeper curves</strong><br/> </h3><p>With hard data confirming eurozone growth is on a recovery trajectory, we think 10-year euro swap rates should start considering a push higher. Additionally, inflation came in hotter, bringing the 10-year inflation swap a tick closer to the 2% target again. We acknowledge that the upside potential for euro rates remains limited this year, and we target a 10-year rate of some 10 basis points above the current 2.65%. With growth on track to improve further in 2026, that’s when we aim for the 10Y to look at 3% as the new equilibrium.</p><p>For the front end, the wiggle room is much more limited as the ECB’s mantra of being “in a good place” is set on repeat. That means that the 2Y swap rate is firmly anchored between 2.1% and 2.2%. The rise in longer-dated yields must therefore come from steeper curves. That steepening faces resistance from the US, however, where 10Y UST yields dove from 4.5% to 4.0% over the past months. As 10-year US rates stabilise, or even rise as we predict, the 2s10s of the euro curve should feel more comfortable steepening.</p><h3><br/><strong>Dutch pension reforms too complex to push for steeper 10s30s by itself</strong><br/> </h3><p>Besides US spillovers, we have flattening pressures from the very long-end to deal with, whereby the 10s30s steepener seems to have come to a halt. The 10s30s dynamics this year have been almost entirely dictated by the US, but Dutch pension reforms may also play a role. Whilst we still anticipate significant unwinds of 30Y becomes and bonds starting in January, we feel the trade may have become too crowded over the summer.</p><p>Estimating the timing and size of the flows stemming from the pension reforms is extremely complex, if not impossible, given the available data. Each fund of the 30 scheduled to transition on 1 January 2026 has a unique maturity profile and hedging strategy. Additionally, we remain concerned that IT problems could result in last-minute delays. And now that the US macro landscape is less supportive of 10s30s steepeners, we understand that the trade has become less attractive from a risk-reward perspective.</p><h3><br/><strong>US Treasuries continue to trade heavily post-FOMC</strong><br/> </h3><p>As the dust settles following Wednesday's Federal Open Market Committee outcome, the new levels for the 2-year and 10-year combo are 3.6% and 4.1%, respectively (both up 10 basis points). The net feeling centres on a Fed Chair that has no problem leaving the funds rate unchanged at the December meeting, if that is deemed the thing to do. It comes with residual comfort in the economy. The fact that a 4.3% unemployment rate was specifically referenced as \"low\" amplifies this point. Instead, there is a degree of discomfort with inflation running at 3%, and likely heading higher.</p><p>At the same time, there has not been a material change in the ultimate landing level for the funds rate. It's now slightly above 3%, but still within the 3% range. And the 5yr rate continues to trade below the straight line that can be drawn between the 2yr and 10yr rates in a steady fashion. This signals an unwavering expectation that the Fed is, in fact, far from done — it's just a matter of timing. The question now is how robust (or not) the economy manages to be in the next month or so<strong>. </strong>Yields may continue to push higher—particularly for longer maturities—despite the current pause. However, the lack of hard data remains a challenge due to the ongoing government shutdown. It is an opportunity for the 10yr yield to have a go at testing higher. It might not go too far, but there is a data vacuum that can be filled in, at least until we gain more clarity.</p><h3><br/><strong>Friday's events and market views</strong><br/> </h3><p>We start with eurozone inflation numbers. The headline French CPI number is expected to come in at just 0.9% year-on-year, a tick below the 1.1% from September. Italian inflation is also expected to nudge lower, from 1.8% YoY to 1.6%. This would then help the eurozone aggregate core CPI down from 2.4% YoY to 2.3%. Due to the US government shutdown, we only expect the Market News International (MNI) Chicago PMI to stand out as notable data.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/florence-press-conference-confirms-ecb-remains-comfortable-in-its-good-place?post=531988\">Florence Press Conference Confirms ECB Remains Comfortable In Its ‘Good Place’ </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/german-october-inflation-marks-start-of-more-disinflation-to-come?post=531970\">German October Inflation Marks Start Of More Disinflation To Come </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/eurozone-gdp-growth-slightly-better-than-expected?post=531891\">Eurozone GDP Growth Slightly Better Than Expected </a><br/></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Gold, Ingots, Treasure, Bullion, Gold Bars, Wealth\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/11/01/22/33/gold-513062_960_720.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><small><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/photos/gold-ingots-treasure-bullion-513062/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em></small><br/> </p><p>After the close of trading last Thursday, Newmont Mining (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/NEM\">NEM</a>), the first senior gold producer to report quarterly financial results, released its results for Q3-2025. As expected, given the high average gold price and gold/oil ratio during the quarter, the results were extremely good and included record-high quarterly cash-flow. The company earned US$1.71/share during the quarter, which is US$6.84/share annualised. This means that despite this year’s large gain in its share price, NEM is being valued by the stock market at only about 12-times trailing earnings. We expect that it will be a similar story for most senior and mid-tier gold producers.</p><p>Further to comments in our lithium discussion earlier in today’s report, the fact that earnings are high and P/E ratios are low in the gold mining sector does not preclude the possibility that a long-term price top is forming. On the contrary, in the commodity realm, financial results and valuations tend to be most inviting near the ends of bull markets. However, the signs that normally are seen near the end of a gold-mining bull market are not currently evident. Before we get to that, the long-term underperformance of gold mining stocks relative to gold bullion is worth a brief revisit.</p><p>The main reason that gold mining stocks, as a group, underperform gold bullion over the long-term is that just as monetary inflation and the associated interest-rate manipulation promote malinvestment in the broad economy, they do the same in the gold mining sector. The difference is that booms in the gold mining sector generally coincide with busts in the broad economy, and vice versa.</p><p>As an aside, don’t be misled by the performances of equity indices such as the SPX into thinking that the US economy is in the boom phase of the economic cycle. Due to the domination of passive investing, the performance of the stock market now has very little to do with the performance of the broad economy. In the US economy over the past few years there have been booms in a small number of sectors, chief among them being AI and the related infrastructure, but the economy as a whole has been in the bust phase. Busts usually, but not always, culminate in a recession, with a surge in monetary inflation associated with the official response to the recession sowing the seeds of the next boom.</p><p>In the gold mining sector, the malinvestment that eventually stems from a boom involves ill-conceived acquisitions and project developments, the costs of which get written-off years later during the bust phase. The result is wealth destruction over the long-term.</p><p>A point we want to make today is that at this stage of the gold sector’s boom there are no signs of widespread malinvestment. On the contrary, NEM and other large-scale gold producers still appear to be more focussed on cost reduction and cash-flow maximisation than on growth, especially ‘growth at any price’. This suggests to us that the end of the boom phase is not imminent.</p><p>The end of the boom is not imminent, but the intermediate-term upward trend that began late last year is almost certainly over.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/commodities-and-the-ai-bubble?post=529542\">Commodities And The AI Bubble </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-recession-not-yet-but-possibly-soon?post=526949\">US Recession: Not Yet, But Possibly Soon </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/the-us-dollars-long-term-cycle?post=522214\">The US Dollar’s Long-Term Cycle </a><br/></div>",

People are losing jobs.</p><p>And it’s not just in the USA, but it’s happening almost everywhere. For the first time in decades, the lines that usually move together have split apart. Sales and profits are booming. But the job market? It’s softening.</p><p>Over the past three years, global corporations have hit record highs in revenue and stock prices, even while cutting staff. Big firms are selling more, earning more, and hiring less. The same story plays out in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.</p><p>The reason isn’t a mystery. Technology now lets companies do more with fewer people. Automation, AI, smarter logistics, better software, it’s all reducing the need for human labor. And for the first time, it’s not just factories feeling it. White-collar work is on the line too.</p><p>Four in ten CEOs say they’ll replace workers with AI within the next two years. Seven in ten believe AI will reshape their business entirely. That’s why re-skilling programs are popping up everywhere, with people trying to learn how to work with AI before it replaces them.</p><p>But here’s the twist. Most companies using AI aren’t seeing a profit from it yet. One MIT study found that 95% of them still haven’t earned back what they invested. Small businesses that rushed to replace people with AI now say they regret it. Only the biggest firms, the ones with pricing power, data, and capital, are really benefitting.</p><p>Look at global stock markets. The big caps, Apple (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/aapl\">AAPL</a>), Microsoft (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/msft\">MSFT</a>), Nvidia (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/nvda\">NVDA</a>), Samsung, are flying. Smaller companies? Stuck. That’s not productivity. That’s concentration.</p><p>So yes, something big is shifting. But maybe not the way everyone thinks. This “AI boom” isn’t yet about efficiency. It’s about belief, belief that machines will save costs and boost profits, even if the numbers don’t show it yet.</p><p>AI isn’t replacing people yet. It’s replacing belief in people. And that might be the real risk.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/if-taiwan-falls-so-does-ai?post=531260\">If Taiwan Falls, So Does AI</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/from-free-to-play-to-pay-to-regulate-europes-next-tech-mistake?post=527807\">From Free-To-Play To Pay-To-Regulate: Europe’s Next Tech Mistake </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/from-80-games-to-5b-hits-inside-gamings-turbulent-transformation-in-may-2025?post=495756\">From $80 Games to $5B Hits: Inside Gaming’s Turbulent Transformation in May 2025</a></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Entrepreneur, Idea, Competence, Vision, Target\" height=\"354\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/04/20/08/21/entrepreneur-1340649_960_720.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/photos/entrepreneur-idea-competence-vision-1340649/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em></p><p><br/>The latest CPI report coupled with the stagnant jobs market essentially gave the FOMC license to continue its rate cutting cycle this week, and fed funds futures now give highest odds for three more 25-bp cuts over the next 12 months. Historically, rate cuts give an outsized boost to growth over value stocks. But this time might be a bit different given the lengthy stretch of outperformance of growth over value and large over small caps, driven by the Big Tech juggernauts, as investors have anticipated a more accommodative Fed for a long time. After several sporadic attempts, could the market finally be ready for sustained market rotation? Let’s explore.</p><p>Interest rate cuts provide a favorable backdrop for stocks in general, by stimulating business and consumer borrowing and encouraging investment in risk assets. While growth stocks are more advantaged by interest rate cuts through valuation (i.e., a falling discount rate on long-duration cash flows), value stocks are more advantaged through fundamentals (i.e., lower borrowing costs and rising consumer demand) because they are often capital intensive and/or cyclical.</p><p>To be sure, even with “higher for longer” interest rates, investors have been quite willing to pay up for all that Big Tech has to offer as they ride strong secular growth trends (i.e., little cyclicality) in disruptive innovation that create rising sales growth, margins, operating leverage, cash flow, ROIC, insider buying—at levels no other sector can match. With little to no concern about the level of interest rates, these cash-flush juggernauts have wasted no time in their race for supremacy in new technologies like AI, quantum computing, robotics, automation, cloud computing, cybersecurity, 3D printing, fintech, precision medicine, genomics, space exploration, and blockchain.</p><p>This has driven the major cap-weighted indexes to lofty heights, with 10 companies in the $1 trillion market cap club. And this week, Microsoft (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/MSFT\">MSFT</a>) and Apple (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AAPL\">AAPL</a>) joined NVIDIA (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/NVDA\">NVDA</a>) in the exclusive $4 trillion market cap club, while NVIDIA just surged past the $5 trillion mark!</p><p>From the April 7th lows, retail investors flipped from tariff panic to FOMO/YOLO/momentum, and the rest of the investor world jumped onboard. Besides Big Tech, speculative “meme” stocks also have been hot, and AQR’s Quality-minus-Junk factor (aka “quality margin”) has been shrinking. Moreover, small caps have been participating, as evidenced by the Russell 2000 Small-cap Index (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/IWM\">IWM</a>) and the Russell Microcap Index (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/IWC\">IWC</a>) both setting new all-time highs in October (for the first time since 2021), which is a historically bullish signal. Similarly, value stocks also have perked up, with the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Pure Value ETF (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/RPV\">RPV</a>) and S&amp;P 500 Value (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/SPYV\">SPYV</a>) also reaching new highs.</p><p>However, while retail investors have continued to invest aggressively, institutional investors and hedge funds (the so-called “smart money”) have grown more defensive. So, maintaining a disciplined approach—such as focusing on fundamental analysis, long-term trends, and clear investment goals—can protect against emotional kneejerk reactions during murky or turbulent periods.</p><p>Stock valuations are dependent upon expectations for economic growth, corporate earnings, and interest rates, tempered by the volatility/uncertainty of each—which manifests in the equity risk premium (ERP, i.e., earnings yield minus the risk-free rate) and the market P/E multiple. Some commentators suggest that every 25-bp reduction in interest rates allows for another 1-point increase in the P/E multiple of the S&amp;P 500. But regardless, the expected rate cuts over the next several months might already be baked into the current market multiple for the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 such that further gains for the broad indexes might be tied solely to earnings growth—driven by both revenue growth and margin expansion (from productivity and efficiency gains and cost cutting)—rather than multiple expansion.</p><p>As such, although near-term market action might remain risk-on into year end, led by growth stocks, the case for value stocks today might be framed as countercyclical, mean reversion, portfolio diversification, and market broadening/rotation into the neglected large, mid, and small caps, many of which display a solid earnings history and growth trajectory as well as low volatility and less downside risk. Value investors can avoid paying the Tech-growth premium. And given their more modest valuations, they also might have greater room for multiple expansion.</p><p>So, perhaps the time is ripe to add value stocks as a portfolio diversifier, such as the <strong>Sabrient Forward Looking Value Portfolio (FLV 13)</strong>, which is offered annually as a unit investment trust by First Trust Portfolios—<em>and remains in primary market only until November 14th</em>.</p><p>In addition, small caps tend to benefit most from lower rates and deregulation, and high-dividend payers become more appealing as bond alternatives as interest rates fall, so Sabrient’s quarterly <strong>Small Cap Growth </strong>and <strong>Dividend</strong> portfolios also might be timely as beneficiaries of a broadening market—in addition to our all-seasons <strong>Baker’s Dozen</strong> growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) portfolio, which always includes a diverse group of 13 high-potential stocks, including a number of under-the-radar names identified by our models.</p><p>Let me discuss three key drivers that might make the heretofore sporadic attempts at market rotation into value and smaller caps more sustainable:</p><p><br/><strong>1. Mean reversion on relative valuation:</strong></p><p>While major indexes like the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/SPY\">SPY</a>) and Nasdaq 100 (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/QQQ\">QQQ</a>) have soared on the backs of those mega-cap, Big-Tech, secular-growth juggernauts, the broader market is trading at far more reasonable valuations. Witness this YTD chart of the cap-weight SPY versus S&amp;P 500 Growth (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/SPYG\">SPYG</a>), Russell 2000 Small Cap (IWM), S&amp;P 500 Pure Value (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/RPV\">RPV</a>), and equal-weight S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/RSP\">RSP</a>). Despite some short spurts of convergence attempts (as circled), most recently the divergence has reached its widest of the year.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.sabrientsystems.com/sites/default/files/Value-Growth-and-Small-Large_perform-comparison-chart.jpg\"/></p><p><br/>In addition to the performance divergence, relative valuations (large vs. small, growth vs. value, and the Tech sector vs. all others) have become quite stretched, and there have been intermittent signs of a nascent broadening market and rotation from the mega-cap dominators into other large, mid, and small caps, value stocks, and lagging sectors. The table below compares forward P/E, expected next-12-months (NTM) earnings growth rate, and forward PEG (P/E divided by earnings growth rate) for various market-segment proxy ETFs, listed in descending order of P/E:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Valuation comparisons\" src=\"https://www.sabrientsystems.com/sites/default/files/Value-Growth-and-Small-Large_valuation-comparison-table.jpg\"/></p><p>According to DataTrek Research, <em>“S&amp;P 500 valuations have reached levels that cannot be justified solely by reasonable expected earnings growth in 2026/2027.Structural profitability must improve as well.Current Street estimates imply a 13.7% net profit margin in 2026, substantially better than Q2 2021’s peak of 13.0%.”</em></p><p>The “Buffett Indicator,” which measures the ratio of Total Market Capitalization to GDP, is rated “significantly overvalued” at an all-time high of 225%, having risen 60 pps since the April lows. The S&amp;P 500 trailing 12-month P/E is around 26x, and the Shiller cyclically adjusted P/E ratio (CAPE), based on trailing 10-year earnings, is now at 40x and officially back to dot-com era levels (which peaked at 44x). However, P/E and CAPE (cyclically adjusted P/E) can be misleading due to the differences in business models, capital intensity, growth rates, and sector concentrations within the S&amp;P 500 throughout the past decades. But price-to-sales (P/S) is less so—and the S&amp;P 500 is selling at nearly 3.5x P/S, which is double the median of the past 25 years of 1.7x.</p><p>Of course, other factors are at play for any valuation metric in determining a “fair” value, such as the level of interest rates that inform the appropriate discount rate on future sales, earnings, and cash flow—and interest rates are falling. And then of course, today’s Tech companies are more fundamentally sound, profitable, cash-flush, and sporting higher return ratios than during the dot-com era. And the index overall reflects more secular growth and less cyclicality—especially when compared to the industrial conglomerates and oil companies that previously held the largest market caps as recently as 2013, when Exxon Mobil was still competing with Apple for the top spot. As DataTrek Research has opined, the continued appeal of US large caps <em>“is grounded in the idea that current earnings power, interest rates, and long-term earnings growth are all highly predictable and will remain so for the foreseeable future.”</em></p><p>Nevertheless, the relative valuation divergences cannot be ignored. Many smaller value names have been neglected during this AI-driven growth boom, with the spread between top-decile growth and bottom-decile value stocks near an historic high, which historically has led to a mean-reversion <em>market rotation</em> and broadening into those lagging segments to narrow the valuation spread (with the broad market indexes continuing to climb higher), rather than a stock market crash from a <em>capital rotation</em> into bonds and cash.</p><p>Lastly, value has historically outperformed after previous periods of high concentration in a handful of stocks, as relative valuations normalize. For example, the Nifty Fifty in the early 1970s, the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, and the FAANG-driven rallies of 2018–2021 all saw a subsequent multi-year outperformance of value over growth.</p><p><br/><strong>2. Diversification of portfolios that have become heavily tilted to growth:</strong></p><p>Value stocks in this market provide a number of diversification benefits. Sectors like Consumer Staples, Energy, Financials, and Healthcare provide more defensive positioning for investors wary of market volatility and the lofty valuations of growth stocks. Value stocks are less exposed to earnings disappointments, particularly given the lofty expectations for earnings and margin growth already priced into most of the leading growth stocks—especially those with the AI tailwind, as the massive capital investments have a lot of future profits yet to prove out.</p><p>One goal of the Fed’s rate cuts is to stimulate borrowing, spending, and investment, leading to broader economic activity, which would tend to help cyclical and value sectors—such as Industrials, Materials, and Financials—which typically benefit when the economy picks up.</p><p>If we have a climate of moderate real GDP growth (say, 2-3%) and broader earnings improvement (beyond the mega-caps), value stocks and smaller caps should benefit from widening participation. Also, value companies typically generate strong current cash flow and pay dividends, making them more resilient if the Fed decides to hold rates steady and liquidity growth is constrained. They offer lower duration risk, less downside/drawdown if the market experiences multiple compression, and thus valuable diversification benefits.</p><p><br/><strong>3. Sticky inflation can benefit real assets and cyclical/value sectors:</strong></p><p>I believe inflation will moderate further due to the many global disinflationary secular trends like aging demographics, ongoing globalization (despite some strategic onshoring and supply chain diversification), deregulation, technological disruption, automation, and rising productivity. However, maintaining somewhat elevated inflation (closer to 3% than 2%) may well be a tactic to help reduce our massive federal debt—as part of a 3-prong approach along with strong economic growth and reduced (or at least stable) federal spending.</p><p>Elevated inflation and interest rates along with strong real GDP growth would likely conspire to boost real asset prices, which would benefit cyclical and value sectors, particularly Energy, Real Estate, and Materials. Energy and commodity producers also benefit from geopolitical tension, supply constraints, and decarbonization bottlenecks. In the Financials sector, banks and insurance companies can see margin expansion when yield curves steepen. And Industrials and Utilities benefit from infrastructure upgrades, factory onshoring, capex cycles, and construction of AI datacenters and new power plants (as power generation demand rises).</p><p>So, value investing aligns with reflation of <em>real</em> assets (as opposed to <em>financial</em> assets), which might persist throughout this decade. In any case, diversification across sectors, industries, market caps, and value versus growth can help manage risk while still capturing growth opportunities.</p><p><br/><strong>Summary:</strong></p><p>Today, we have a growing economy with modest inflation, robust corporate earnings and rising forward guidance, falling interest rates and substantial liquidity from an increasingly accommodative Federal Reserve, tight credit spreads, and low volatility in both stocks and bonds/interest rates—resulting in an ultra-low ERP and a historically high market P/E multiple. The case for value stocks rests on the historic valuation divergences (for growth vs. value, large vs. small caps, and Tech vs. all other sectors), as well as macro shifts, historical mean reversion, and diversification for heavily growth-tilted portfolios. While the headline valuation multiples of the broad cap-weight indexes look stretched—some might say “priced for perfection”—value is one of the segments in which forward returns still look attractive.</p><p>A disciplined value investing strategy might emphasize:</p><ul><li>Equal-weight or fundamental index funds rather than cap-weight benchmarks</li><li>Sector-specific tilts toward Energy, Financials, Industrials, Consumer Staples, and selected Materials</li><li>Quality/value screens to identify strong balance sheets, free cash flow, and dividends</li><li>Small- and mid-cap allocations, where the valuation divergence is widest </li></ul><p>Indeed, rather than the pricey cap-weighted indexes dominated by Big Tech, investors may be better served in today’s market by active stock selection that seeks under-the-radar and undervalued gems primed for explosive growth. This is what Sabrient aims to do in our various Growth, Value, Dividend, and Small Cap portfolios, all of which provide exposure to growth, value, quality, and size factors and to both secular and cyclical growth.</p><p>In selecting our <strong>Baker’s Dozen, Forward Looking Value, Dividend, and Small Cap Growth</strong> portfolios, Sabrient’s multifactor models and selection process prioritize fundamental quality, which is a timeless characteristic to which even the most speculative market always (eventually) reverts. In addition, our cash-flow and balance-sheet oriented Earnings Quality Rank (EQR) is a key factor used in all our internal models and is also licensed to the <strong>First Trust Long-Short ETF (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/FTLS\">FTLS</a>)</strong> as a quality prescreen.</p><p>As always, I welcome your thoughts on this article.

For example, the S&amp;P 500’s current yield is only ~1.2%.</p><p>High-yield stocks can be particularly beneficial in supplementing income after retirement. A $120,000 investment in stocks with an average dividend yield of 5% creates an average of <strong>$500 a month in dividends</strong>.</p><p>Next on our list of <a href=\"https://www.suredividend.com/high-dividend-stocks/\">high-dividend stocks</a> to review is PermRock Royalty Trust (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/PRT\">PRT</a>).</p><h3><br/><strong>Business Overview</strong></h3><p>PermRock Royalty Trust (PRT) is a trust established in November 2017 by Boaz Energy, a company specializing in the acquisition, development, and operation of oil and natural gas assets in the Permian Basin. The trust generates all its cash flow from the net profits of oil and gas sales from its properties and distributes dividends monthly. PRT trades with a market capitalization of $49 million and went public in May 2018.</p><p>The trust’s properties consist of long-life reserves in mature, conventional oil fields, featuring shallow, predictable decline rates. Production can be enhanced through water-flooding techniques, and new reserves may be identified in the future. The Permian Basin, spanning West Texas and southeastern New Mexico, is the most prolific oil-producing region in the U.S., historically yielding over 30 billion barrels of oil and more than 75 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"355\" src=\"https://www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PRT-Overview-e1621974526727.jpg\" width=\"600\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.permrock.com/\">Investor Relations</a></p><p><br/>On March 31, 2025, Boaz Energy sold the oil and gas properties underlying the trust to T2S Permian Acquisition II LLC. For the second quarter ending June 30, 2025, PRT reported net profits of $1.55 million, slightly below $1.66 million in the prior year period. The average realized oil price fell 16% year-over-year, while natural gas rose 8.7%. Distributable income totaled $1.20 million, down 11% from $1.35 million in the prior year, equating to $0.10 per unit versus $0.11 previously. Cash reserves remained at $1 million, unchanged from June 30, 2024, and year-to-date distributions totaled $0.3105 per unit.</p><h3><br/><strong>Growth Prospects</strong></h3><p>PermRock Royalty Trust has faced declining production volumes since 2019, despite higher average realized oil and gas prices in 2021 and 2022. Production declined again in 2023 and 2024, reflecting the mature nature of the trust’s assets. The new owner, T2S, plans to drill one injector and one producer well in Crane County, Texas, in 2025, which could help stabilize output.</p><p>Management believes production can also be modestly increased through expanded water-flooding operations and additional well drilling, though overall growth remains limited by the properties’ maturity.</p><p>Future earnings and distributable income are highly sensitive to oil and natural gas prices, making precise forecasts challenging. Commodity price swings have historically driven volatility, such as the 2020 oil collapse and the 2022 surge amid global supply disruptions.</p><p>Assuming stable market conditions, we estimate distributable income per unit could grow roughly 6% annually through 2030, primarily driven by higher oil prices rather than significant production gains. This underscores the trust’s ability to leverage commodity cycles rather than pursue operational expansion.</p><h3><br/><strong>Competitive Advantages &amp; Recession Performance</strong></h3><p>PermRock Royalty Trust benefits from its ownership of long-life reserves in the Permian Basin, one of the most prolific oil-producing regions in the U.S. Its assets have shallow, predictable decline rates, and production can be enhanced through water-flooding and selective drilling.</p><p>As a royalty trust, PermRock has minimal operating expenses and does not incur exploration or development costs, allowing it to pass most of its profits directly to shareholders as monthly dividends. This structure provides a streamlined, cash-focused way to gain exposure to oil and gas production.</p><p>However, the trust is highly sensitive to commodity price fluctuations, making it vulnerable during economic downturns. For example, the dividend was suspended for five months in 2020 amid the COVID-19-driven oil glut. Conversely, during periods of rising oil prices, PermRock can deliver outsized returns and high dividend yields, often outperforming integrated energy companies. Its performance is therefore closely tied to macroeconomic and geopolitical factors that affect the oil and gas markets.</p><h3><br/><strong>Dividend Analysis</strong></h3><p>PermRock Royalty Trust pays a variable monthly dividend based on its underlying net profits. The trust is expected to distribute $0.38 per share for 2025, yielding 9.7%. While this yield is attractive, dividends can fluctuate significantly with oil prices. During the oil market collapse of 2019–2020, PermRock suspended its dividend for five consecutive months.</p><p>The trust is highly sensitive to oil prices, offering greater upside than integrated oil companies when prices rise, as seen in the post-pandemic recovery that allowed dividend growth to resume. This makes PermRock suitable for investors confident in higher future oil prices who want exposure to the Permian Basin.</p><p>However, this leverage also carries risk: in a downturn, losses are amplified. Although PermRock’s assets are located in the prolific Permian Basin, an oil royalty trust may not be the most efficient way to benefit from production growth. Investors may achieve better risk-adjusted exposure through traditional oil and gas producers or midstream companies. The 2020 dividend suspension underscores the volatility inherent in oil and gas royalty trusts.</p><h3><br/><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p>PermRock Royalty Trust has faced several challenges in recent years, including weak oil prices and the demand collapse caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The trust operates in the U.S.’s most prolific oil-producing region and offers an exceptionally high dividend yield, supported by modest growth prospects.</p><p>While we do not anticipate a near-term downturn in the energy sector, the trust’s heavy reliance on oil prices and non-diversified business model makes it risky for concentrated investment. As a pure upstream player, it is inherently exposed to commodity price volatility, and its relatively short track record limits confidence in long-term dividend stability and consistency.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/high-dividend-50-golub-capital-bdc-inc?post=531808\">High Dividend 50: Golub Capital BDC, Inc.</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/10-of-the-right-retirement-stocks-for-income-investors?post=531175\">10 Of The Right Retirement Stocks For Income Investors</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/real-estate--reits/3-top-retirement-stocks-for-income?post=531102\">3 Top Retirement Stocks For Income </a><br/></div>",

I wrote a piece a few months ago about <a href=\"https://kyla.substack.com/p/gen-z-and-the-end-of-predictable\">“Gen Z and the End of Predictable Progress”</a> but it really should have been titled <em>“Why The Economic Ladder Has Completely Changed For Everyone Due to Policy Choices”.</em></p><p>One driver of our changing economy <em>is</em> demographics. We talk about it in generational terms because that makes it easier, but it’s impacting <em>everyone</em>. The population is aging, and policy increasingly favors some of the elderly (don’t forget 43% of boomers have no retirement savings) over the young.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.livenowfox.com/news/lawmakers-several-states-pursuing-property-tax-reform-measures\">Across the country</a>, states are slashing property taxes, which is the source of 70% of local revenue. Florida, which already has no income tax, wants to get rid of property taxes entirely. Illinois wants to exempt homeowners who’ve lived in their houses 30+ years. It’s unclear where replacement revenue to keep these economies going for our future would come from - or whether voters even care.</p><p>A lot of young people are very worried. The WSJ put it neatly: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/old-young-economic-divide-7a5203f0?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqffYfJvERtEjeGGxQOLzszd3d5kJPtPapG_JsrYhfNQcJV_X0nNFa_c8u67mo4%3D&amp;gaa_ts=690152aa&amp;gaa_sig=GyFyTbVcxAaxyeFzC4YuKCvjPqx8SL_XmolidSG-rsPTsq8_bvvQhvZsShdlXMkD0uELuL7v90nwpPGIRrBkrg%3D%3D\">The Economy That’s Great for Parents, Lousy for Their Grown-Up Kids</a>, highlighting how a generation that came of age during zero rates and rising asset prices is now facing a ladder that’s missing several rungs. Young people - and their parents - don’t believe that upward mobility will be there for them.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TALW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6fa4584-8cac-424d-8132-a082a3e0e55a_1088x668.png\" title=\"\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>According to the <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market#--:explore:unemployment\">New York Fed’s Labor Market for Recent College Graduates</a> tracker, unemployment for new college graduates up 30% since the pandemic versus 18% for all <a href=\"https://www.siliconcontinent.com/p/the-ai-becker-problem\">workers</a> - the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/us-economy-analysis-wealthy-low-income-8ba80ccc?mod=article_inline\">highest level in a decade</a>, outside of the pandemic unemployment spike.</p><p>And that’s part of the reason that people are turning to the stock market - <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/stock-market-working-class-investors-1f915b4b\">over half of Americans</a> who make below $80k a year have taxable investment accounts, with half of those investors entering the market within the last five years. People are trying to create their own financial foundation. Markets feel more stable than institutions.</p><p>And that ties into the financialization of everything. In <em>industrial</em> capitalism, firms existed to produce and expand. Carnegie and Ford (for all their flaws) understood the ecosystem: workers were also consumers, so paying them well was good business.</p><p>But now… we don’t seem to think of it that way.

Automation erases the “training ground” work that once created experts. When machines do the junior tasks, no one learns the senior ones. Apprenticeship collapses.

They cite “unemployment, increased student loan repayment, and slower real wage growth” as the primary headwinds. The whole call was essentially like “yeah, it’s not our burritos, it’s the economy”. Kraft Heinz <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/khc\">KHC</a> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-29/kraft-heinz-sees-weaker-us-sales-ahead-of-planned-split\">stated</a> in their earnings call that “we now have one of the worst consumer sentiments we have seen in decades” (which might reflect GLP1s more than anything).</p><p>But it isn’t the burritos. We do have a K-shaped economy<a href=\"https://kyla.substack.com/p/how-bible-sales-and-chipotle-explain#footnote-7-177527193\" target=\"_self\">7</a> - the top keeps rising as the bottom falls. That means that the really wealthy (<a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/story/2025/09/17/top-10-of-earners-make-up-half-of-us-retail-spending\">the top 10% driving 50% of spending</a>, for example) are doing quite well. Their <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/credit-card-consumers-charts-a4ce81e5?mod=e2tw\">credit-card</a> spending and travel budgets have surged alongside stock and home-equity gains (they are celebrating the new 100% tax write-off by <a href=\"https://x.com/FirstSquawk/status/1982980942928195665\">buying private jets</a>).</p><p>For everyone else, the economy has become something to believe in rather than participate in, a system that promises meaning through motion. That’s the real mood of the economy right now - <em>everything</em> is a trade. Money, work, meaning, even faith.</p><p>Bible sales are up roughly 40% since the pandemic, but c<a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/642548/church-attendance-declined-religious-groups.aspx\">hurch attendance is down to 30% from 42% two decades ago</a> and 38% ten years ago. It’s aesthetic in a way - aesthetic spirituality, aesthetic politics, Baudrillard and Debord would have a blast.</p><p>When belief itself becomes transactional, risk stops feeling like a financial concept and starts feeling like a moral one. People don’t just gamble with money anymore; they gamble with time, attention, identity - anything that might yield security or a sense of control. The markets are only the macro version of that instinct.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"328\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9rRW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F045d38ca-c9cf-4b39-99b4-7c96aee2a119_1611x881.jpeg\" width=\"600\"/></p><p><br/>That’s why the economy feels both booming and brittle at once: we have extraordinary wealth concentration coupled with mass participation in markets. Wealthy households and large firms transfer risk through diversification, hedging, political insulation (like <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/10/26/37-white-house-ballroom-donors-funding-300-million-build-tech-ceos-trump/\">donating to a ballroom</a> maybe). Everyone else absorbs risk through gig work, debt, market exposure, and health costs. It is the logical outcome of labor precarity + 401(k)ification + income volatility. Risk always rolls downhill, but lately it looks like belief too.</p><p>The fixes for some of this aren’t complicated (it’s ideas that many have been talking about for a long time). Create portable benefit pools that follow workers between gigs. Build a public infrastructure corps that provides an employment floor. We have examples as to what works, like Singapore’s sovereign wealth model, Germany’s apprenticeship programs, and Denmark’s flexicurity system.</p><p>The goal is probably to not ban the casino but rather to build something slower beside it. Every speculative boom eventually exhausts its own attention span. Markets will always trade. The invisible hand will keep dealing.

Wynne and Lillian Derr, both work in the Fed’s Research Department. And although the report explicitly notes: “The views expressed are those of the authors and should not be attributed to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas or the Federal Reserve System,” the chart they provide is telling.</p><p>I’ll let the authors set it up for you:</p><p><em>Artificial intelligence (AI), like many technologies before it, offers the potential to improve people’s living standards. Such advances can be approximated by changes in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita over time—the rate of change in the amount of output per person.</em></p><p><em>Chart 1 shows GDP per capita from 1870 to 2024 along with scenarios, some of them extreme, depicting what could happen to living standards between now and 2050.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Turn Your Images On\" src=\"https://banyanhill.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Daily_Disruptor/images/2025/10/103025_DD_SS1.png\"/></p><p>In layman’s terms, this chart shows what the authors call a “singularity-level” productivity path. It’s an exponential curve where output per worker accelerates far beyond the historic norm.</p><p>And it’s proof that even the most cautious economists are beginning to imagine a future where growth accelerates beyond anything we’ve ever seen before.</p><h2><br/>FROM 1.9% TO INFINITY</h2><p>Since 1950, U.S. labor productivity has grown at roughly 1.9% per year.</p><p>At that pace, living standards double about every 36 years.</p><p>The Fed’s “normal AI” scenario assumes a modest improvement similar to the bump we saw after personal computers took off in the 1990s.</p><p>But its extreme scenario tells another story.</p><p>In that model, AI triggers what the authors call a “technological singularity.”</p><p><em>Technological singularity refers to a scenario in which AI eventually surpasses human intelligence, leading to rapid and unpredictable changes to the economy and society. Under a benign version of this scenario, machines get smarter at a rapidly increasing rate, eventually gaining the ability to produce everything, leading to a world in which the fundamental economic problem, scarcity, is solved. Under this scenario, the future could look something like the (hypothetical) red line in Chart 1.</em></p><p>As you can see on the chart, in this scenario growth isn’t gradual. It’s exponential.</p><p>This is the first time I’ve seen a Federal Reserve publication openly modeling a world that looks anything like the Coasean Singularity we talked about yesterday…</p><p>The idea that transaction costs, the invisible frictions that make companies necessary, could eventually fall toward zero.</p><p>And it shows you how mainstream the idea of a technological singularity has become.</p><p>But what’s with that line falling off the graph when the singularity happens?</p><p><em>Under a less benign version of this scenario, machine intelligence overtakes human intelligence at some finite point in the near future, the machines become malevolent, and this eventually leads to human extinction. This is a recurring theme in science fiction, but scientists working in the field take it seriously enough to call for guidelines for AI development. Under this scenario, the future could look something like the (hypothetical) purple line in Chart 1.</em></p><p>In other words, that’s the <em>Terminator</em> scenario.</p><p>And even though that scenario is highly unlikely to happen, the Fed isn’t dismissing the possibility that AI could reshape the economy in ways we can’t yet measure.</p><h2><br/>HERE’S MY TAKE</h2><p>The Dallas Fed is simply acknowledging what we’ve been talking about for over a year.</p><p>AI is no longer a sideshow in the economy. It’s the main event.</p><p>The authors note that neither of these singularity paths is likely to happen in the next 25 years:</p><blockquote><p><em>Today there is little empirical evidence that would prompt us to put much weight on either of these extreme scenarios (although economists have explored the implications of each). A more reasonable scenario might be one in which AI boosts annual productivity growth by 0.3 percentage points for the next decade. This is at the low end of a range of estimates produced by economists at Goldman Sachs. Under this scenario, we are looking at a difference in GDP per capita in 2050 of only a few thousand dollars, which is not trivial but not earth shattering either.

The <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/equities\">stock</a> is approaching a technical inflection point that swing traders have been circling on their calendars. After a brutal descent from $45 earlier this year, the stock is now knocking on the door of a support zone that's held significance across multiple market cycles.</p><p>Let's unpack what makes this company worth analyzing. The weekly chart reveals a stark reality: CMCSA has surrendered nearly 40% of its value in a matter of months, carving out a downtrend that's been relentless in its trajectory. But then you notice something that changes the conversation entirely—that horizontal line at $26.54.</p><p>This isn't just another arbitrary price point. The $26.54 level has acted as both ceiling and floor during previous periods of market stress, most notably during the consolidation phases of 2022 and early 2023. Think of it as a battlefield where bulls and bears have repeatedly tested each other's resolve. When price approaches this zone, institutional memory kicks in, and order flow tends to shift.</p><p>What catches my attention is the measured approach to position sizing embedded in this setup. Rather than betting the farm at a single level, the structure here suggests a two-tiered entry strategy. The initial swing trade level at $26.54 represents your first line of defense—a zone where price has historically found buyers willing to step in. If that support crumbles and we see follow-through selling, the $23.87 level becomes your add zone, offering a more defensive entry with improved risk-reward dynamics.</p><p>But here's where discipline becomes non-negotiable. If CMCSA slices through $23.87 on substantial volume, the thesis breaks down. That would signal not just technical weakness, but potentially a fundamental re-rating of the company's prospects in an evolving media landscape. The bearish scenario would then target lower historical support zones, and you'd need to respect that price action rather than fight it.</p><p>The bullish case hinges on whether bargain hunters and dividend-focused investors view these levels as too attractive to ignore. A successful defense of $26.54 could trigger a relief rally back toward the $30-32 resistance zone, where overhead supply from trapped longs would likely materialize. That's roughly a 15% move from current levels—not earth-shattering, but respectable for a large-cap value play.</p><p>Volume will be your tell. Watch for climactic selling that exhausts itself at these support levels, followed by narrowing price ranges and stabilization. That's often how bottoms are built—not with dramatic V-shaped reversals, but through a grinding process where sellers simply run out of ammunition.</p><p>For those considering this setup, think in terms of tranches. Scale in at $26.54 with perhaps half your intended position, then reassess. If we get that second trip to $23.87, you've got dry powder to average down with conviction. In terms of a stop-loss level, a weekly close beneath $23.50 would be the line in the sand, signaling that deeper support zones need to be tested before any sustainable bounce materializes.</p><p>The risk-reward profile here favors the patient trader willing to endure some volatility. CMCSA isn't going to zero—it's a cash-generating machine with entrenched infrastructure assets. But Comcast is also not the growth darling it once was, which means any recovery will likely be measured rather than explosive. Set realistic expectations, respect the levels, and let the market show its hand before committing significant capital.</p><p>What unfolds at these technical junctures often teaches us more about market psychology than any indicator ever could. Will buyers emerge with conviction, or does this stock have further to fall before finding its footing? The next few weeks will answer that question definitively.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feditorial.fxsstatic.com%2Fmiscelaneous%2Fimage-638974545958965917.png&amp;w=1536&amp;q=95\" width=\"700\"/></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/wti-steadies-near-60-as-markets-digest-us-china-truce-rosneft-sanctions?post=531999\">WTI Steadies Near $60 As Markets Digest U.S.-China Truce, Rosneft Sanctions </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/gold-steadies-as-fed-caution-tempers-rate-cut-hopes-trump-xi-truce-lifts-sentiment?post=531896\">Gold Steadies As Fed Caution Tempers Rate-Cut Hopes, Trump-Xi Truce Lifts Sentiment </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/japanese-yen-remains-on-the-back-foot-as-traders-await-boj-governor-uedas-comments?post=531676\">Japanese Yen Remains On The Back Foot As Traders Await BoJ Governor Ueda's Comments </a><br/></div>",

In September, we were thrilled to launch our best iPhone lineup ever, including iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, and iPhone Air. In addition, we launched the fantastic AirPods Pro 3 and the all-new Apple Watch lineup. When combined with the recently announced MacBook Pro and iPad Pro with the powerhouse M5 chip, we are excited to be sharing our most extraordinary lineup of products as we head into the holiday season.\"</p><p>Elsewhere, Apple’s board announced a small dividend update which rose to $0.26 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on November 13, 2025, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 10, 2025.</p><p>More notably, the company said that it saw $1.1 billion in tariff related costs in Q4, which may explain why the market reversed the after hours selloff, giving AAPL credit for the rather mediocre earnings, which it would blame on Trump. </p><p>Seeking to reverse the early selloff, Apple leaked a little guidance, saying it sees a rev. increase of 10% to 12% in the holiday quarter, Cook saying he expects Q1 2026 revenue to be the best ever for the company and iPhone. And if that's not the case, the company can just blame tariffs.</p><p>To be sure, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, the comments from Apple’s CFO about a 10-12% increase in iPhone sales in fiscal 1Q26 vs. consensus of 6% growth, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, overshadows dismal 4Q Greater China sales:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Remarks about a supply shortage could soothe concerns around market-share loss to local brands in the region. Services-segment growth of 15%, or 230 bps above consensus, was a positive, suggesting App Store fee changes might not be affecting consumer behavior as much as feared.”</em></p></blockquote><p><br/>And just to make sure the early selloff does not drag the stock lower, Tim Cook was quick to throw out all the key buzzwords, saying Apple is \"expanding its investments in AI\", reiterating comments he’s made the last several quarters. Cook also said Apple was making more progress on the new Siri and reiterates it’s coming next year. </p><p>For now, the plan is working and AAPL stock managed to sharply reverse its early drop, surging about 3% after hours.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"505\" src=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/aapl%20stock%202025-10-30_13-54-18.png?itok=XcIUSJ89\" width=\"700\"/></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/amazon-soars-to-record-high-on-solid-guidance-improving-aws-results?post=532018\">Amazon Soars To Record High On Solid Guidance, Improving AWS Results</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/ebay-shares-plunge-most-since-2005-as-soft-outlook-overshadows-solid-earnings?post=532002\">EBay Shares Plunge Most Since 2005 As Soft Outlook Overshadows Solid Earnings</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/ecb-keeps-rate-unchanged-as-expected?post=531974\">ECB Keeps Rate Unchanged As Expected</a><br/></div>",

The pair trades at 1.1565, down 0.30%.</p><h2><br/>ECB’s Lagarde says policy is “in a good place” as risks ease</h2><p>The ECB kept its three interest rates unchanged, with the Deposit Facility, Main Refinancing and Marginal Lending Rates holding steady at 2.00%, 2.15%, and 2.40%, respectively. ECB’s President <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/ecb\">Christine Lagarde</a> noted that monetary policy is in a “good place” as economic risks diminish and the economy in the <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar/country/c9822cb1-6cee-45f4-a9a2-89d136990308\">Eurozone</a> (EZ) shows signs of resilience.</p><p>Lagarde added that the Europe-US trade, the Middle East war de-escalation and the trade truce between China and the US had mitigated downside risks to growth.</p><p>The ECB is expected to publish its economic projections through 2028 at the December meeting, and if some policymakers expect inflation to undershoot the bank’s target, it will justify the debate for further easing at the next meeting.</p><p>In the US, the Federal Reserve cut <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/rates\">rates</a> by 25 basis points and hinted at a possible pause in its easing cycle, citing a division in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Also, Fed Chair Jerome Powell revealed the central bank collected state data related to unemployment claims, and noted that the jobs market has not deteriorated as expected.</p><h2><br/>Daily market movers: Broad US Dollar strength, weighs on the Euro</h2><ul><li value=\"1\">The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the performance of the buck versus six currencies, climbs 0.37% to 99.50.</li><li value=\"2\">ECB’s President Lagarde said that she would not complain about the economy expanding by 0.2% in Q3 in the EZ.</li><li value=\"3\">The ECB’s monetary policy statement revealed that inflation is close to 2% and added that it’s not pre-committed to a particular rate path. The ECB noted, “The economy has continued to grow despite the challenging global environment.\"</li><li value=\"4\">The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.75%–4% in a 10–2 vote. The decision was not unanimous, with Fed Governor Stephen Miran favoring a larger 50-bps cut and Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voting to hold rates steady.</li><li value=\"5\">At the press conference, the Fed Chair Jerome Powell surprised the markets, saying “a further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion — far from it.”</li><li value=\"6\">Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank’s primary focus remains on the labor market, noting that while official data is limited, state-level unemployment claims suggest the jobs market is not deteriorating sharply.</li><li value=\"7\">Powell also mentioned that several FOMC members view interest rates as either at or near a neutral stance, indicating that monetary policy may be appropriately balanced given current economic conditions.</li><li value=\"8\">Trade news between the US and China boosted the Greenback after President Trump met with his counterpart X Jinping. Trump said the meeting was \"amazing,\" and that China agreed to resume soybean purchases. Consequently, Washington reduced fentanyl tariffs to 10% and cut tariffs on China’s goods from 57% to 47%. Trump added that rare earths issues were resolved and opened the door to discuss chips with China.</li></ul><h2><br/>Technical outlook: EUR/USD turned bearish, sellers eye 1.1500</h2><p>EUR/USD continues to trend downward after falling below 1.1600, with sellers eyeing further downside.

witnessed a flurry of political, economic, and corporate developments on Thursday.</p><p>The Trump administration announced a controversial refugee cap prioritizing white South Africans, OpenAI unveiled a new AI-powered cybersecurity tool, China agreed to major agricultural purchases from the US, and Big Tech stocks, led by Meta, weighed down Wall Street.</p><h2><br/>Trump Administration caps refugee admissions, prioritizes white South Africans</h2><p>The administration of US President Donald Trump announced plans to cap refugee admissions at 7,500 for fiscal year 2026, marking one of the lowest limits in modern history.</p><p>According to a notice published in the Federal Registry, the administration said admissions “shall primarily be allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa pursuant to Executive Order 14204, and other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.”</p><p>Officials justified the move on humanitarian and national interest grounds, stating the measure aimed to assist those “subjected to discrimination” abroad.</p><p>The decision has drawn scrutiny for explicitly prioritizing white South Africans, a demographic emphasis not seen in prior refugee policy frameworks.</p><p>The latest move reflects the administration’s continued effort to tighten immigration controls while emphasizing what it characterizes as “merit-based humanitarian admissions.”</p><h2><br/>OpenAI launches Aardvark, an autonomous AI security researcher</h2><p>In the tech sector, OpenAI introduced Aardvark, a new autonomous security researcher powered by GPT-5, designed to detect and patch software vulnerabilities.</p><p>The company described the system as a “breakthrough in AI and security research,” emphasizing its potential to help developers and cybersecurity teams identify flaws across enterprise and open-source codebases.</p><p>According to OpenAI’s announcement, Aardvark aims to “tip the balance in favor of defenders” amid the growing sophistication of cyberattacks.</p><p>The system is currently available in private beta to validate and refine its real-world capabilities before broader deployment.</p><p>Industry experts view the rollout as a significant step in merging artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, a trend increasingly central to enterprise technology strategy.</p><h2><br/>China to purchase US soybeans following Trump-Xi meeting</h2><p>In a major development for American agriculture, US Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins confirmed that following President Trump’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Beijing will purchase 12 million metric tons of US soybeans in 2025.</p><p>The agreement includes commitments for China to buy 25 million metric tons annually from 2026 through 2028, alongside sorghum and hardwood imports.</p><p>Rollins hailed the deal as “HUGE after China played hardball for the last four years under [former President] Joe Biden, adding that the move would channel money “straight to American farms, American workers, and American families.”</p><p>The announcement comes as farmers and agricultural exporters seek recovery from years of trade volatility between the two nations.</p><h2><br/>Meta shares plunge 10% amid weak earnings and AI spending concerns</h2><p>Shares of Meta Platforms Inc. fell over 11% on Thursday, marking the lowest level in four months, after the company reported a sharp drop in quarterly earnings.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/Meta\">META</a>’s diluted earnings per share fell 83% year-over-year to $1.05, missing analyst expectations and alarming investors concerned about the firm’s rising artificial intelligence spending.</p><p>Broader markets followed suit, with the S&amp;P 500 slipping nearly 1%, the Nasdaq Composite down 1.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average off 0.2%.</p><p>While Alphabet shares gained 3% on strong results, declines in Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia led to a broader rotation out of technology stocks.</p><p>In contrast, bank and healthcare stocks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Eli Lilly, advanced, supported by robust earnings and favorable outlooks.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/is-gm-stock-a-buy-at-its-ath-after-pivoting-away-from-evs?post=532009\">Is GM Stock A

This compares to earnings of $1.64 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.</p><p>This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of +6.94%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.42 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.57, delivering a surprise of +10.56%.</p><p>Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.</p><p>Apple, which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $102.47 billion for the quarter ended September 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.25%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $94.93 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.</p><p>The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.</p><p>Apple shares have added about 7.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 17.2%.</p><h2><br/>What's Next for Apple?</h2><p>While Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?</p><p>There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.</p><p>Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.</p><p>Ahead of this <a href=\"https://www.zacks.com/stock/research/AAPL/earnings-calendar\">earnings release</a>, the estimate revisions trend for Apple was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.44 on $130.27 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.87 on $436.7 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.</p><p>Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the top 18% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/does-unitedhealth-stock-have-more-upside-after-q3-earnings?post=531641\">Does UnitedHealth Stock Have More Upside After Q3 Earnings?</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/2-intriguing-stocks-to-watch-after-exceeding-quarterly-expectations-agys-w?post=531301\">2 Intriguing Stocks To Watch After Exceeding Quarterly Expectations: AGYS, W</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/buy-the-mag-7-laggards-as-earnings-approach-amzn-aapl?post=531182\">Buy The Mag 7 Laggards As Earnings Approach?: AMZN, AAPL</a><br/></div>",

Not groceries. Not utilities. The discretionary spending that evaporates instantly.</p><p>DoorDash <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/dash\">DASH</a>, Affirm <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/afrm\">AFRM</a>, and Draft Kings <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/dkng\">DKNG</a> are all flashing the same warning signals Blake watches for economic weakness. These aren't random picks. These are companies with fundamental cracks that widen the moment consumer spending slows.</p><p>Here's what makes these setups compelling:</p><ul><li><strong>DoorDash:</strong> Negative 40 fixed charge coverage ratio. That means they're losing money and carrying 40 times their earnings in debt. Revenue and net income both sliding. When consumers tighten belts, paying $10-15 delivery fees for McDonald's disappears first.</li><li><strong>Affirm:</strong> The buy-now-pay-later model works until defaults hit. They're already losing money on lending before any serious economic stress. Fixed charge coverage at negative 12. Their three-year and five-year averages on net income? All negative.</li><li><strong>Draft Kings:</strong> Just hit 52-week lows on closing prices. Negative fixed charge coverage. Downtrending revenues. Blake's targeting a 20% drop from current levels. Sports betting is pure discretionary spending that vanishes when budgets tighten.</li></ul><p>Blake's not just shorting weakness. He's structuring diagonal spreads that turn positive on time decay from day one. The setup lets you collect premium monthly while positioning for significant downside moves.</p><p>The beauty of his approach is the reward-risk ratios. On DraftKings alone, Blake's diagonal could deliver an 8-to-1 reward-risk by March if the stock simply stays flat. If it drops to his targets, the returns multiply.</p><p>These are the sectors that break first when economic pressure builds. Blake's getting positioned now before the obvious signals appear in headline data.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><br/><em>Video Length: 00:13:29</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mm9iP8ALNNw?si=GaaV-Ct_9IS5IRCw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-fed-cut-rates-bonds-collapsed-instead?post=531537\">The Fed Cut Rates.

It was once normal for major indices to take occasional days-long breathers even during the most powerful bull runs. Recent events indicate that the relentless urge to buy every dip, no matter how fleeting, has shrunk the length of those respites to mere minutes. The activity of the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/SPX\">SPX</a>) in yesterday afternoon’s and this morning’s sessions offer excellent evidence to bolster that assertion.</p><p>The first example occurred after Chair Powell dropped the following bombshell during the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20251029.pdf\">start of his press conference</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a forgone [sic] conclusion—far from it.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>Clearly this was not welcome news for those traders who had been expecting a third cut before the end of the year. <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\">CME futures</a> were pricing in at least a 92% chance of a December cut to follow the near 100% probability of yesterday’s cut. Those slipped to below 70% after Powell’s comment. The pricing on <a href=\"https://forecasttrader.interactivebrokers.com/eventtrader/#/market-details?id=658663572%7C20251210%7C3.625%7CDecember%2010,%202025&amp;detail=contract_details\">IBKR ForecastTrader</a> was not quite as extreme, pricing in no less than a 15% chance of a December rate target above 3.625%, but the views now roughly match those shown by the CME.</p><h3><br/><strong>Will the US Fed Funds Target Rate be set above 3.625% at the FOMC meeting ending December 10, 2025?</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/image-81-1100x542.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: IBKR ForecastTrader</em></p><p><br/>The reaction in stocks and bonds was swift and sudden. Rates across the Treasury yield curve rose by about 10 basis points and SPX fell by nearly 1% almost immediately. The difference is that bond prices held their losses while stocks quickly recovered from theirs after churning at the lows for just a few minutes. By the end of the day, SPX was almost exactly unchanged.</p><h3><br/><strong>SPX 2-Days, 2-Minute Candles</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/image-82-1100x681.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: Interactive Brokers</em></p><p><br/>This was a near exact repeat of the activity at during the September FOMC press conference.We noted that day’s 1% drop and bounce back to near-unchanged levels. The plunge occurred later in that press conference, but the rebound was even more swift.</p><p>To be fair, it is not unreasonable to expect air pockets during events like discussions from the Fed Chair. Any comments from a key central banker have the potential to move markets, and thus traders know to be a bit wary while they are occurring. Market makers become more defensive, widening bid/ask spreads and reducing the size of their quotes. That in turn means that a wave of buying or selling has the potential to move markets more than they otherwise might. Hence the big drops and rebounds that occur.</p><p>But we also saw something similar just after this morning’s open even as no fresh news was breaking.Investors had no shortage of meaningful data to digest since yesterday’s close.Alphabet’s (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GOOG\">GOOG</a>, <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GOOGL\">GOOGL</a>) well-received earnings, Microsoft’s (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/MSFT\">MSFT</a>) modest disappointment, and the shock of Meta Platforms’ (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/META\">META</a>) outsize tax bill were being discussed since yesterday afternoon, and overnight we learned that President Trump and Premier Xi reached a deal framework that more or less returned us to the status quo that prevailed before the last escalation of trade and tariff threats.On balance, it was understandable why we might have seen some early profit-taking.But once again, the buyers stepped in quickly and we traded at only modestly lower levels throughout the morning.</p><p>This takes us to an extreme question: might we reach a point where the desire to buy every dip erases dips altogether? That sounds ridiculous, but if the half-life of dips continues to shrink, might it reach such a short time interval that any dips are too short to capture? Or alternatively, if dip buying is so foolproof, might some traders and investors take the mindset that why bother selling if you’re going to be proven wrong almost immediately? That sounds downright scary. If everyone is fully invested, who would be left to buy if some investors indeed decided to change course? We’re not at that point – at least not yet – and perish the thought that we actually get there!</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/relative-complacency-rules?post=531152\">Relative Complacency Rules</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/big-week-and-full-steam-ahead?post=530797\">Big Week (And Full Steam) Ahead</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/all-clear-from-cpi?post=530353\">All Clear From CPI</a><br/></div>",

Here is what the world's largest retailer just reported:</p><ul><li>EPS $1.95 vs. $1.68 q/q, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate $1.58</li><li>Net sales $180.17 billion, +13% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate $177.82 billion \t<ul><li>Online stores net sales $67.41 billion, +9.8% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate $66.93 billion</li><li>Physical Stores net sales $5.58 billion, +6.7% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate $5.56 billion</li><li>Third-Party Seller Services net sales $42.49 billion, +12% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate $42.05 billion</li><li>Subscription Services net sales $12.57 billion, +11% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate $12.49 billion</li></ul></li><li>Third-party seller services net sales excluding F/X +11% vs. +10% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate +10.8%</li><li>Subscription services net sales excluding F/X +10% vs. +11% y/y, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate +10.7%</li></ul><p>Geographically the results were strong all around: </p><ul><li>North America net sales $106.27 billion, +11% y/y, <em><strong>beating</strong></em> estimate $104.96 billion</li><li>International net sales $40.90 billion, +14% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate $40.77 billion</li></ul><p>So far so good, with every line time beating. But what the market was especially focused on was the high margin AWS data, and here numbers also beat solidly: </p><ul><li>AWS net sales $33.01 billion, +20% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate $32.39 billion</li><li>Amazon Web Services net sales excluding F/X +20% vs. +19% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate +17.9%</li></ul><p>Turning to operating profits, here the results were rather mixed: </p><ul><li>Operating income $17.42 billion vs. $17.41 billion y/y, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate $19.72 billion\t<ul><li>Operating margin 9.7% vs. 11% y/y, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate 11.1%</li><li>North America operating margin +4.5% vs. +5.9% y/y, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate +6.98%</li><li>International operating margin 2.9% vs. 3.6% y/y, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate 4.02%</li></ul></li></ul><p>As for fulfillment expenses, these came in slightly above estimates, as did the seller unit mix. These may deteriorate iftariffs rise: </p><ul><li>Fulfillment expense $27.68 billion, +12% y/y, estimate $27.49 billion</li><li>Seller unit mix 62% vs. 60% y/y, estimate 60.7%</li></ul><p>Of the above, the most notable highlight was AWS which grew revenue by 19.7% (stronger than the 19% year ago) to $33.0BN, above the sellside estimate of $32.39BN. That said, despite the latest quarterly beat, the growth rate is clearly slowing but not enough for the market to care right now:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"395\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/bfm360D.jpg?itok=6z2wrpMO\" width=\"600\"/></p><p><br/>While AWS sales growth was solid, just as impressive was the the <strong>margin for the segment also increased from 32.9% in Q2 to 34.6%, beating the median Wall Street estimate of 33.95%, </strong>if below the recent average from the past two years.

Its first fiscal quarter earnings report began with a deluge of news that shareholders had to digest. The most important one was that the company was forfeiting a small chunk of its original 32.5% stake in OpenAI. It settled on 27%. In exchange, OpenAI has agreed to buy an incremental $250 billion of Azure services.</p><p>I see this as a positive. Microsoft’s entire stake in OpenAI is worth $130 billion. Plus, the company is boosting its AI capacity by 80% this year, promising to double its total data center footprint in the next two years.</p><h2><br/><strong>Why I’d buy MSFT stock hand over fist today</strong></h2><p>Microsoft now plans to spend even more on AI infrastructure. Capacity will still remain short of demand, and this build-out could potentially lead to Azure overtaking AWS. The cloud business grew 40%.</p><p>When you combine that with the OpenAI stake, its own in-house AI development, and the extremely profitable Office software stack, MSFT stock becomes very attractive. It even has an active quantum computing program. Its Majorana 1 quantum chip “...can be easily deployed inside Azure datacenters.” It’s too early, and likely too expensive to do that just yet. But that’s another feather that a competitor like Meta lacks in its hat. Furthermore, cash from software remains far more reliable than cash from ads.</p><p>MSFT stock is currently trading just below its 20-day moving average, near $520. I’d expect the stock to snap back to new highs as the market digests these earnings. The breakneck growth of Azure can take it above $600 by mid-2026.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"310\" src=\"https://moneymorning.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2025/10/MSFT-3.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/broadcom-both-benefits-and-suffers-from-the-ai-surge?post=531984\">Broadcom Both Benefits And Suffers From The AI Surge</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/why-investors-are-turning-bearish-on-meta?post=531943\">Why Investors Are Turning Bearish On META</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/what-can-investors-expect-from-archer-aviation-earnings-next-week?post=531528\">What Can Investors Expect From Archer Aviation Earnings Next Week? </a></p></div>",

And Beijing promised to buy “tremendous amounts” of American soybeans, said Trump.</p><p>While the detente provides relief to both sides, it does little to address the fundamental divergence between two superpowers whose economies are decoupling in many sectors and who are racing for supremacy in areas such as artificial intelligence.  </p><p>In comments to reporters on his way back to the U.S. from South Korea, Trump was effusive about the meeting.</p><p>“Overall, I guess on the scale of from zero to 10, with 10 being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12,” he said.</p><p>The actual numbers the two agreed on were more modest. </p><p>The U.S. also agreed to put on hold for one year a September move to apply export restrictions to certain subsidiaries of already blacklisted entities, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said. And both sides placed a one-year pause on reciprocal port fees on each other’s vessels, which comes on the heels of South Korea agreeing to invest $150 billion in American shipbuilding.</p><p>Speaking on Air Force One, Trump said he thinks the U.S. and China will be able to sign a trade deal “pretty soon,” and that they didn’t have too many stumbling blocks left.</p><p>Some trade analysts were skeptical. Describing Thursday’s agreements as marginal, William Bratton, an analyst at BNP Paribas Securities, wrote that they don’t “represent a ‘grand bargain’ or a large-scale reset of the relationship.”</p><p>Xi appeared to come out of the meeting with a strong hand, analysts said, particularly on rare earths.  </p><p>China began implementing strict export controls on rare earths in April. In October, Beijing angered the Trump administration by further enhancing restrictions on the export of the minerals, including increasing the number of controlled rare-earth elements.</p><p>While the newer rare-earth export rules are likely to be delayed, many industry watchers noted that China appears set to maintain the export-control procedures it introduced in the spring.</p><p>That would preserve Beijing’s ability to punish the U.S. economy by denying export licenses to a swath of American companies that rely on rare earths. </p><p>On fentanyl, much will depend on the actions China takes next. The U.S. has pressed China for years to do more to control the export of chemicals used to make the drug, a synthetic opioid blamed for hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths in the U.S.</p><p>More-stringent regulation of the chemicals likely won’t be enough to solve the crisis because Chinese producers are adept at slightly altering the chemistry of precursors to get around the rules.</p><p>Trump and Xi last met in person in 2019, when they held an 80-minute lunch on the sidelines of a Group of 20 meeting in Osaka, Japan, and agreed to a cease-fire in trade hostilities. </p><p>A “Phase One” trade deal signed in early 2020 addressed neither of those points, instead obligating China to buy more soybeans from American farmers—something Beijing largely failed to fulfill. A Phase Two never materialized.</p></blockquote><p><br/><strong>Precisely as Expected</strong></p><p>On October 28, I made what I consider to be the easiest call of the month: <strong><a href=\"https://mishtalk.com/economics/trumps-big-china-deal-looks-more-like-an-uneasy-truce/\" target=\"_blank\">Trump’s Big China Deal Looks More Like an Uneasy Truce</a></strong></p><blockquote><p>Both sides will announce a win. But no key issues will be resolved.</p><p><strong>Now What?</strong></p><p>Hooray, China will buy more soybeans, loosen export restrictions on rare earths, and pledge to do more about fentanyl.</p><p>In return, Trump will not do 100 Percent tariffs and will roll back some of the so-called fentanyl tariffs.</p><p>Since April, there have been about seven major tit-for-tat Trump escalations with China, soon followed by Trump Tacos when China retaliated.</p><p>If the above outline holds, congratulations! Things will be back to where they roughly were in March.</p><p>Q: Since both Trump and Xi are liars, what do we really have?<br/>A: The answer is an uneasy truce.</p><p>There may be other agreements but will Xi honor them? Trump?</p><p>No key items will be addressed but China will buy more soybeans, at least for a while, so Trump will brag. He will fail to recall that it was his actions that caused China to stop buying soybeans.</p><p>This is a win-win from where we were a week ago, but a big pile of nothing compared to where we were earlier this year.</p></blockquote><p><br/>This is indeed a win-win. I am always happy to see tariffs reduced.</p><p>But what did Trump really get out of all of this besides nothing?</p><p>Every time Trump escalated tariffs, China retaliated with force. Now we are back to roughly where things were in March (except US farmers lost about 6 months of Soybean exports).</p><p>12 out of 10? Please be serious.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/investing-ideas--strategies/8-more-economic-report-delays-this-week-including-gdp-today?post=531980\">8 More Economic Report Delays This Week, Including GDP Today </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/huge-recent-layoffs-amazon-30000-gm-3300-target-1800-ups-48000?post=531548\">Huge Recent Layoffs: Amazon 30,000 GM 3,300 Target 1,800 UPS 48,000</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/fed-cuts-key-interest-rate-by-a-quarter-point-shutdown-obscures-data?post=531519\">Fed Cuts Key Interest Rate by a Quarter Point, Shutdown Obscures Data</a><br/></div>",

The Nationwide Housing Prices are next on tap across the Channel.</p><p>USD/JPY surpassed the 154.00 barrier for the first time since February following the lack of a clear message on rates after the BoJ’s steady hand at its meeting.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"macro photography of black circuit board\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518770660439-4636190af475?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/FO7JIlwjOtU\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></em></p><p><br/>Quantum computing represents one of the most significant long-term threats to modern cryptography. While classical computers operate on \"bits\" (a 1 or a 0), quantum computers use \"qubits,\" which can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously. This allows them to perform complex calculations exponentially faster than any classical machine. This paradigm shift holds immense promise for science but also poses an existential risk to the security infrastructure underpinning global finance, communication, and the entire blockchain ecosystem. The race is on to develop quantum-resistant technologies before a sufficiently powerful \"cryptographically relevant quantum computer\" (CRQC), capable of breaking today's encryption, becomes a reality.</p><p>The timeline for such a machine remains a subject of intense debate, but most experts place its arrival anywhere from five to fifteen years away. These computers do not use traditional silicon chips; instead, their processors are built from highly specialized qubits. The leading designs include superconducting qubits, favored by Google and IBM, and trapped-ion qubits. Both of these designs are incredibly delicate and must operate in heavily shielded, near-absolute-zero environments to maintain their quantum state. The primary threat to cryptocurrency comes from <strong>Shor's algorithm</strong>, a quantum algorithm that can efficiently find the prime factors of large numbers. Current blockchain encryption, such as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) used by Bitcoin and Ethereum, relies on the fact that this factoring problem is practically impossible for classical computers to solve. A CRQC running Shor's algorithm could take a public key (which becomes visible on the network after a transaction) and use it to derive the user's private key in minutes, giving the attacker full control of the wallet.</p><p>If a quantum computer were to \"solve\" a blockchain, the scenario would be catastrophic. An attacker could monitor the network and, the moment a public key is revealed, calculate the corresponding private key and sign a new transaction to drain the wallet before the user's legitimate transaction even confirms. This vulnerability would shatter the public's trust, causing a total and likely irreversible collapse of the market. The majority of cryptocurrencies currently lie on the <strong>vulnerable</strong> end of the spectrum, as their core cryptographic signatures are not quantum-resistant. This threat is not just theoretical; major nation-states and the world's largest tech corporations are the primary leaders in the race to build a CRQC, whether for scientific discovery or national security.</p><p>In the face of this future threat and today's pressing privacy-shortfalls, new cryptographic methods are emerging as the future of on-chain security. <strong>Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs</strong> are at the forefront of this shift. As noted by industry leaders like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, ZK-proofs are a fundamental breakthrough in computer science that allows for verification without revelation. This technology enables a party to prove that a statement is true (e.g., \"I have sufficient funds for this transaction\") without revealing any of the underlying data (e.g., \"my total balance is X\"). This provides a powerful solution for on-chain privacy. While Armstrong and others primarily champion ZK-proofs today for their scaling benefits (in the form of ZK-rollups), their ability to ensure privacy is their other killer feature, paving the way for a more secure, private, and scalable blockchain future.</p><p>This privacy model also offers a powerful defense against quantum attacks. The primary quantum vulnerability for blockchains like Bitcoin is that a user's <strong>public key is exposed</strong> on-chain when they make a transaction, giving Shor's algorithm the target it needs to derive the private key. ZK-proofs can be used to create <strong>\"shielded wallets\"</strong> or \"shielded transactions,\" a system where transactions are validated on the network without ever revealing the sender's address, the receiver's address, or the amount. By hiding this key identifying information, the public key is never broadcast, effectively starving a quantum attacker of the one piece of data it needs to initiate the attack. This is a move toward a \"never trust, never reveal\" architecture. This strategy appears to be central to Brian Armstrong's vision; recent reports confirm Coinbase acquired the ZK-privacy team from Iron Fish to build private transactions directly into its Layer-2 network, Base. This move strongly suggests a strategic direction that leverages ZK-privacy not only for user confidentiality but as a foundational layer for a more resilient and quantum-resistant blockchain ecosystem.</p><p>A second, more immediate threat is mass surveillance by AI, which is why \"auditable privacy\" has become a crucial missing piece for crypto's adoption. This is a system that keeps transactions private from the public by default, but gives users the choice to share their financial history with trusted parties (like an auditor) using a special \"view key.\" This concept explains <em>why</em> the ZK-proof solution is the only viable path forward and clarifies the precise strategy Brian Armstrong and Coinbase are pursuing. <strong>The Problem </strong>is that transparent blockchains are a goldmine for AI. As Iron Fish states, \"Every on-chain action, who you pay, when, and how often, creates patterns AI can analyze.\" This allows centralized entities with massive compute power to \"reconstruct your financial identity and behavior,\" reducing users to \"exploitable data points.\" Both the quantum threat and the AI threat are enabled by the same core weakness: <strong>a public, transparent ledger</strong>.</p><p>For a <strong>quantum attack </strong>it needs the <em>public key</em> (revealed during a transaction) to derive the private key. For an <strong>AI Attack </strong>it Needs the <em>public transaction graph</em> (the full history of \"who, what, when\") to build surveillance models. Pure, absolute anonymity (like Monero or the original vision for ZCash) is a non-starter for the mainstream financial world due to strict regulations (Know Your Customer, Anti-Money Laundering). This is the central conflict in crypto: how to get the benefits of privacy without enabling illicit activity?</p><p>Sandy Peng, Co-Founder of Scroll, directly tackles this in her report, 'The Privacy Layer,' arguing that auditable privacy is especially crucial for stablecoins. She reasons that stablecoins are rapidly becoming the foundation for onchain finance and digital money, but their current public nature prevents widespread adoption by institutions and mainstream users who require confidentiality <em>and</em> regulatory compliance. Peng posits that integrating auditable privacy into stablecoins is the key to unlocking their potential as the next generation of trusted digital money. This concept then unifies all the topics: the quantum threat, the AI threat, her core thesis, and Brian Armstrong's strategy.</p><p>In short, you are witnessing the convergence of a single strategy: The ZK-proofs that protect from future quantum computers are the <em>same</em> ZK-proofs that protect from today's AI surveillance, and the 'auditable privacy' layer built on top is what makes it possible for regulated companies like Coinbase to deploy solutions like private, compliant stablecoins at scale.</p><hr/><p><strong>Sources</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://x.com/brian_armstrong/status/1952427668135178664\" target=\"_blank\">https://x.com/brian_armstrong/status/1952427668135178664</a></li><li><a href=\"https://usethebitcoin.com/news/base-network-to-get-private-stablecoin-transactions/\" target=\"_blank\">https://usethebitcoin.com/news/base-network-to-get-private-stablecoin-tr...</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/10/23/the-future-of-crypto-depends-on-auditable-privacy/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/10/23/the-future-of-cry...</a></li></ul><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/time-to-get-tactically-defensive?post=530554\">Time To Get Tactically Defensive </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/america-at-a-crossroads-build-like-china-or-fall-behind?post=530453\">America At A Crossroads: Build Like China Or Fall Behind </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/this-week-in-markets-earnings-inflation-and-geopolitical-shifts?post=530362\">This Week In Markets: Earnings, Inflation, And Geopolitical Shifts </a></p></div>",

At writing, Comcast stock is up nearly 200% versus its April low.</p><h2><br/>What Trump might have against a Comcast-WBD deal</h2><p>Experts aren’t entirely convinced that a potential Comcast-WBD merger will succeed in securing regulatory approval under the Trump administration.</p><p>Why? Because the President’s disdain for the company and its co-chief executive, Brian Roberts, is well-documented.</p><p>In April, <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/trump-slams-msnbc-comcast-ceo-155801595.html\" target=\"_blank\">Trump called Roberts a “lowlife”</a> and denounced Comcast as “ a disgrace to the integrity of Broadcasting” on Truth Social – animosity that analysts suspect could translate into regulatory resistance.  </p><p>Blair Levin of New Street Research, for example, told clients in his latest research note that “it is almost certain that the Trump DOJ would not allow CMCSA to buy WBD and the result would be decided in court.”</p><p>Trump’s criticism appears rooted in his perception that Comcast’s media properties – particularly MSNBC and CNN – are left-leaning or hostile to his administration.</p><h2><br/>Does it mean CMCSA wouldn’t bid for WBD?</h2><p>Not necessarily. Comcast executives reportedly believe the aforementioned regulatory risks are actually overstated or premature.</p><p>In fact, according to anonymous sources, the company is weighing its options. One potential workaround could involve excluding CNN from the deal or divesting it post-acquisition.</p><p>Comcast’s donation to Trump’s $300 million White House ballroom initiative via the Trust for the National Mall may also be a strategic gesture to build goodwill.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Nasdaq-listed firm is already spinning off MSNBC into Versant – a move that may further help mitigate concerns.</p><p>Given the strategic value of WBD assets, Comcast’s leadership may also bet that President Trump’s reputation as a dealmaker will ultimately override his public grievances.</p><h2><br/>Is Comcast stock worth buying without WBD?</h2><p>Investors should note, however, that Comcast shares remain worth owning heading into 2026 – even without WBD – given the company’s fundamentals remain compelling.</p><p>On Thursday, the mass media and entertainment conglomerate reported market-beating financials for its third quarter, with a 45% year-on-year increase in free cash flow to $4.9 billion.</p><p>CMCSA stock is currently going for a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of less than 7 which makes it all the more attractive for long-term investors.</p><p>A lucrative <a href=\"https://invezz.com/stocks/best/top-dividend-stocks/\">dividend</a> yield of 4.87% makes up for another great reason to invest in Comcast today.</p><p>Wall Street also currently has a consensus “overweight” rating on CMCSA with a mean target of about $39, indicating potential upside of nearly 50% from here.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/msft-meta-stock-sink-on-ai-spending-plans-analyst-view-only-one-as-buy?post=531979\">MSFT, META Stock Sink On AI Spending Plans: Analyst View Only One As Buy </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/snap-ceo-downplays-metas-smart-glasses-our-ar-glasses-will-be-infinitely-more-capable?post=531650\">Snap CEO Downplays Meta’s Smart Glasses: ‘Our AR Glasses Will Be Infinitely More Capable’ </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/apple-vs-microsoft-stock-as-both-hit-40-trillion-market-cap?post=531145\">Apple Vs Microsoft Stock As Both Hit $4.0 Trillion Market Cap </a></p></div>",

The year-over-year growth rate in the CPI has now increased for six months in a row.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.mises.org/inline-images/cpi%20sept%2025.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>This suggests there is significant upward pressure on prices. </p><p>This is echoed by the so-called “core” CPI which excludes volatile food and energy prices. Core CPI was up in September, month over month, by 0.22 percent. Core CPI growth has not gone down, month over month, in 64 months.</p><p>Measured year-over year, September’s core CPI was up by 3.0 percent, and has been above three percent for three months. Indeed, core CPI year-over-year inflation has only dipped below 2 percent during three months of the past 53 months. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"441\" src=\"https://cdn.mises.org/inline-images/cpi%20core%20sept.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Although the Federal Reserve claims to have a target CPI inflation rate of 2 percent, one could be forgiven for thinking that the Fed isn’t actually trying very hard to hit the target rate. </p><p>After all, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditure measure, also shows that price inflation hasn’t fallen to two percent or below two percent since February of 2021.  The August PCE measure (the most recent available number) was up 2.7 percent, year over year, while the core PCE increase for August was 2.9 percent. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://cdn.mises.org/inline-images/PCE.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>The Fed, of course, has had to provide excuses for why it is so bad at getting price inflation back down to its target. After all, aren’t we told that the Fed is filled with the world’s best analysts and economists? The explanation given nowadays is that tariffs are pushing prices up, and so it’s really the fault of the administration. This may be a savvy move politically, but it’s bad economics. Price inflation is caused by monetary inflation, and not by tariffs, “Putin’s price hike,” or by logistical problems. The Fed likes to blame price inflation on everything but the real cause, which is monetary inflation—an increasing money supply. Only an increasing money supply can create <em>general </em>price increases in the economy in which prices for rents, food, energy, services, etc rise in aggregate. It is only when the money supply rises that prices generally rise across the whole economy. </p><p>Yet, even by the federal government’s own CPI measure—which tends to downplay the real impact of price inflation—we see overall price increases. Yes, some prices fall here and there in the CPI report, as we now see in used cars and energy. But the index is up overall. This is possible because monetary inflation means that when prices rise in some areas, there is still extra money sloshing around that is available to keep bidding up prices across the board. </p><p>Without a rising money supply, on the other hand, prices could not rise across the economy <em>in general</em> because rising prices in some areas would reduce the money available for spending in other areas. That is, price deflation in some areas would fully offset price inflation in other areas, and we would not see any significant general price inflation.</p><p>If price increases were merely the result of tariffs, we would indeed see price increased in goods that rely on imported parts, or which are imported as finished goods. However, if the money supply were stable, increased spending on imports would lead to<em> less</em> spending—and falling prices— in other areas. </p><p>That’s not happening. Rather, we continue to see significant increases in prices across the economy, in general, so we can’t blame this on tariffs, or oil prices, or any foreign war. </p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-national-debt-soars-past-38-trillion?post=531166\">The National Debt Soars Past $38 Trillion</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/economics--politics/no-tariffs-did-not-cause-septembers-budget-surplus?post=530804\">No, Tariffs Did Not Cause September’s Budget Surplus</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-federal-reserve-cut-rates-so-the-rich-get-richer?post=523742\">The Federal Reserve Cut Rates So The Rich Get Richer </a></p></div>",

General Motors rose to a high of $70.2, up by 70% from its lowest level in April when Donald Trump launched his trade war. This recovery has brought its market capitalization to over $64 billion.</p><h2><br/>Stable revenue growth and pivot from the EV business </h2><p>General Motors stock price has done well after publishing its financial results last week.</p><p>The company, which is the parent company of brands like Chevrolet, GMC, Buick, and Cadillac, is doing well in a difficult market environment.</p><p>Its revenue came in at $48.5 billion in the last quarter, largely flat from what it made in the same period last year. This happened as the company achieved the highest third-quarter market share in the US and returned its Chinese business to profitability.</p><p>Its profitability was affected by the ongoing external issues such as tariffs that Donald Trump implemented on imports. As a result, its net income margin plunged to 2.7% from the previous 6.3%, while the automotive operating cash flow fell to $6 billion.</p><p>The main reason why the GM stock surged is that the company admitted that it will not be the next Tesla. It now expects to fully focus on the ICE business, which is doing well and which it has a leading market share in the US. The CEO <a href=\"https://investor.gm.com/static-files/51db67b7-798b-4ae3-9486-1a2228bdfc66\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“It’s clear that ICE volumes will remain higher for longer. We lead the industry today, and we are increasingly well-positioned to meet strong, sustained demand.”</p></blockquote><p><br/>GM, like other traditional companies, were quick to pivot to the electric vehicle industry after witnessing Tesla’s robust growth. It launched EVZ brands of its top vehicles, including the Hammer, Bolt, Buick, and Cadillac. It is <a href=\"https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/29/gm-to-lay-off-over-5500-workers-amid-slowing-ev-demand-and-tax-credits-end/\">now cutting over 5,500 jobs</a> in its EV division.</p><p>While sales were strong initially, the trend faded as concerns about these vehicles remained. Only Cadillac EVs are doing relatively well, but it is unclear whether the growth will continue.</p><p>Play Video -</p><p>GM stock price has jumped because of the latest talks between the US and China, which have yielded some major breakthroughs. For example, the company can now operate without worrying substantially about rare earth materials and magnets.</p><p>Also, the company may benefit from an improved US-China relationship as it still has a large presence there.</p><p>Analysts expect the GM’s revenue will stagnate in the next few years. The average estimate for this year’s revenue is $185.83 billion, down by 0.86% from last year. </p><p>Analysts expect that its revenue will remain at $185.82 billion next year. Its profitability will start improving as it focuses on its most profitable ICE business.</p><h2><br/>GM stock price technical analysis</h2><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"GM stock price\" height=\"399\" src=\"https://invezz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GM-stock-1024x584.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-GM/\" target=\"_blank\">GM</a> stock chart | Source: TradingView</p><p>The weekly timeframe chart shows that the GM stock price has done well in the past few months.

It also moved above the key resistance level at $60.45, invalidating the forming double-top pattern. </p><p>The stock has remained above the 50-week and 100-week Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has continued pointing upwards. </p><p>Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the GM stock price retreats and retests the support at $64.8.

In addition, the remaining performance obligation (RPO), or work under contract in the pipeline, increased 51% to $392 billion.</p><p>Within the overall cloud business, Intelligent Cloud, which is its AI cloud computing business, saw revenue increase by 28%. <strong>Azure, which is its major AI cloud computing platform, saw revenue climb 40% in the quarter</strong>.</p><p>Part of that pipeline is <strong>filled by OpenAI</strong>, which just signed a new contract with Microsoft to <strong>acquire $250 billion in Azure cloud </strong>computing services.</p><p>The concerns over AI spending stemmed from a <strong>record $34.9 billion in capital expenditures last quarter</strong>, which was higher than expected.</p><p>CFO Amy Hood said it was to meet growing demand, and it will be even higher this fiscal year than it was last fiscal year.</p><blockquote><p>With accelerating demand and a growing RPO balance, we’re increasing our spend on GPUs and CPUs. Therefore, total spend will increase sequentially, and we now expect the FY26 growth rate to be higher than FY25,” Hood said.</p></blockquote><p><br/>Investors should tune out the short-term noise, as AI spending by one of the leading cloud computing companies with booming growth should not be a long-term concern. In fact, it is just the opposite.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/one-of-the-best-ai-stocks-just-got-better-after-blowout-earnings?post=531538\">One Of The Best AI Stocks Just Got Better After Blowout Earnings</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/ai-bubble-ark-invests-cathie-wood-weighs-in?post=531157\">AI Bubble?
