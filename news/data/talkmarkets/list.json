Money managers rotated out during quarter-end window dressing. Retail traders avoided it because the chart looked like death.</p><p>I stepped in and bought 50 shares at $165.</p><p>Not because I love yoga pants. Not because I'm bullish on retail. Because the math stopped making sense at these levels.</p><p>The stock traded at 11x earnings with 16% net margins and 22% return on assets. At that valuation, this isn't a trade. It's theft.</p><p>Charts show you what happened. Numbers show you what something's worth. When those two disconnect completely, that's your opportunity.</p><p>Every major reversal starts with stocks trading at absurd disconnects from their actual value. </p><p>The math says buy, but everyone stays away because the chart looks broken. Then algorithms finally recognize the setup, and the stock doubles in months.</p><p>Spotting one of these disconnects is straightforward when you dig into the numbers.</p><p>Finding all of them before algorithms confirm the reversal is impossible manually.</p><p>Today I'm showing you the five-minute framework that found this opportunity.</p><p><br/><strong>The Breakdown Nobody Believes</strong></p><p>Pull up Lululemon's two-year chart. What do you see?</p><p>Straight down. Relentless selling. No support. No bounce. Just algorithmic destruction walking the stock lower in a perfect downward channel.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://theotrade.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-31-at-1.44.48-PM.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"489\" src=\"https://theotrade.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-31-at-1.44.48-PM.png\" width=\"750\"/></a></p><p><br/>Most traders stop looking right there. The chart says sell. Momentum says avoid. Everyone who bought higher is underwater. Stay away.</p><p>That's exactly when I start digging into numbers.</p><p>The chart doesn't show fundamentals improving while the stock collapsed. It doesn't show valuation compressing to levels that make no mathematical sense. It especially doesn't show the algorithmic channel that just broke.</p><p><br/><strong>The Numbers Wall Street Ignores</strong></p><p>I ran a five-minute fundamental analysis. Not complex. Not academic. Just the metrics that actually matter.</p><ul><li><strong>Return on assets:</strong> 22%. For a retail company, that's exceptional. Compare that to Nike at 15% or any department store at 8%. Lululemon generates $22 in profit for every $100 in assets.</li><li><strong>Net margins:</strong> 16%. Nike delivers 10%. Under Armour barely scrapes 4%. Lululemon earns 16 cents on every dollar of sales while competitors struggle to maintain single digits.</li><li><strong>PE ratio:</strong> 11 times earnings. Nike trades at 33 times. The five-year average for Lululemon itself was 35 times. This stock compressed from bubble valuation to deep value territory in 24 months.</li><li><strong>Debt-to-equity:</strong> 23%. They're barely leveraged. Current ratio of 3.0 means massive cash reserves. They could acquire a competitor tomorrow without blinking.</li></ul><p>I ran this same analysis against every retail peer I could find. Lululemon beats them all on margins. Beats them all on asset efficiency. Trades at a fraction of their multiples.</p><p>The disconnect became impossible to ignore. Strong fundamentals, absurd valuation, pure chart-based selling with zero analysis behind it.</p><p><br/><strong>The Technical Signal That Triggered My Buy</strong></p><p>The stock broke outside the two-year downward channel at $165.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://theotrade.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-31-at-1.44.51-PM.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://theotrade.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-31-at-1.44.51-PM.png\" width=\"750\"/></a></p><p><br/>This matters for one specific reason. Algorithms that systematically sold every bounce for 24 months just detected a pattern change. The machines aren't defending the downward slope anymore.</p><p>The weekly MACD sits deep underwater at negative 40. But watch that indicator. If it pivots upward toward the signal line, this becomes the comeback trade of the year. That's the momentum shift that separates temporary bounces from sustained reversals.</p><p>Money flow tells the rest of the story. Nobody owns this stock anymore. All the overhead supply got flushed out during the two-year collapse. Everyone who bought at $300, $400, $500 has already capitulated. There's nothing left blocking a move higher.</p><p><br/><strong>The Risk-Reward Math</strong></p><p>I bought 50 shares at $165. My risk? Maybe $20 downside to book value support. That's $1,000 total exposure.</p><p>My reward? If this stock gets above $200 and algorithms confirm the reversal, it's going to $450. That's not hopium. That's the math of what happens when deep value meets technical breakout.</p><p>Once algos recognize a reversal setup, the move accelerates systematically. Buying pressure replaces selling pressure. Short covering adds fuel. Institutions rotate into beaten-down names with improving fundamentals. Retail finally notices after the move is already 30% complete.</p><p>I've watched this pattern repeat. FedEx collapsed to absurd levels, then doubled. Meta got destroyed, then ran 200%. Target broke down hard, then rallied 40% in weeks. Good companies get beaten to irrational prices. Charts look terrible. Everyone stays away. Then algorithms flip, and the stock explodes.</p><p><br/><strong>My Exit Strategy</strong></p><p>I'll sell 25 shares if it hits $185. Lock in some profit. Hold the rest through December 11th earnings.</p><p>If the weekly MACD turns positive and the stock breaks $200, I'll hold for $250. If I'm wrong and it drops to $145, I'll add more. Because at that valuation, this becomes a floor trade where fundamentals simply won't let it go much lower.</p><p>Michael Burry bought a block for around $180 for the same reasons I did. The fundamental disconnect was too obvious. When someone who predicted the housing crisis steps into a hated retail stock, that confirms the value proposition exists. I'm not following him. We're both following the math.</p><p><br/><strong>The Framework That Finds These Setups</strong></p><p>Wall Street trades momentum. They buy what's going up and sell what's going down. That works until it doesn't.</p><p>The opportunity exists in the gap between chart-based selling and fundamental reality. When those two things disconnect completely, you get setups like Lululemon.</p><p>The algorithms will eventually figure this out. They always do. The question is whether you're positioned when they flip from systematic selling to systematic buying.</p><p>Run your own five-minute analysis on beaten-down stocks. Check the margins against competitors. Compare the valuation to historical norms and peer groups. Look for the technical confirmation when downward channels break. Then size appropriately with defined risk.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/most-market-sectors-are-getting-smoked?post=532408\">Most Market Sectors Are Getting Smoked</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/three-consumer-names-about-to-get-crushed?post=532021\">Three Consumer Names About To Get Crushed </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-fed-cut-rates-bonds-collapsed-instead?post=531537\">The Fed Cut Rates.

Guidance for the December quarter shows further growth deceleration, even though the period will have a relatively easier year-earlier comparison.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Free stock photo of appartment, at home, beautiful home\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/4009402/pexels-photo-4009402.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/couple-love-date-sitting-4009402/\" target=\"_blank\">Pexels</a></em></p><p><br/>Netflix (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/nflx\">NFLX</a>) is one of the most recognizable companies in the world. It has a massive audience, strong brand awareness, and a long history of reshaping how we watch TV. Recently, Netflix announced a 10:1 stock split. A split does not change the value of the company, but it lowers the price per share and often makes the stock feel more accessible to everyday investors.</p><p>Financial media loves these moments because they tend to create attention, curiosity, and sometimes fear of missing out.</p><p>But here is the part many people are overlooking. The split announcement came right after an earnings call that did not land smoothly. The quarter included a large one-time tax expense from Brazil that affected the reported results and caught investors off guard. The reaction in the market was lukewarm. So now we have two stories happening at once: an exciting stock split that gets headlines and an earnings situation that introduces uncertainty.</p><p>This is why we are taking a deeper look. Instead of reacting to hype or fear, we want to understand what is actually happening underneath. What is strong. What is changing. And what matters for long-term investors. This blog will help you see beyond the headlines.</p><p>The IDDA Analysis framework is used to analyze companies and determine which are right for you. There are five steps to the process:</p><ol><li><strong>Capital Analysis</strong><br/>\tYour personal risk tolerance.</li><li><strong>Intentional Analysis</strong><br/>\tYour unique financial goals and timelines based on your age, health, and lifestyle.</li><li><strong>Fundamental Analysis</strong><br/>\tThe viability of the asset based on company performance, financial health, and market position.</li><li><strong>Sentimental Analysis</strong><br/>\tThe current emotions of Wall Street and other market participants.</li><li><strong>Technical Analysis</strong><br/>\tHistorical price action to identify key psychological levels and market patterns.</li></ol><p>Let’s dive into the IDDA analysis to assess <strong>Netflix’s</strong> fundamental, sentimental, and technical outlook.</p><p>IDDA Point 1&amp;2: Capital &amp; Intentional</p><p>The capital and intentional analysis need to be conducted by you.</p><p>Select your assets in alignment with your financial goals. Listen to your intuition about each asset, but remember to invest based on your own values, not just because of recommendations from others.</p><p>IDDA Point 3: Fundamental</p><p><strong>Revenue Growth and Business Model Strength</strong></p><p>Netflix continues to generate strong and steady revenue from monthly subscriptions. Their business model is simple. People pay every month to watch shows and movies. This gives Netflix predictable cash flow and the ability to invest in more content. Even with competition in streaming, Netflix remains one of the biggest platforms in the world.</p><p><strong>10:1 Stock Split Announced</strong></p><p>Netflix announced a 10:1 stock split. A split does not change the true value of the company, but it lowers the price per share and can make the stock feel more affordable to new investors. This often increases market attention and trading activity. It does not improve business fundamentals directly but can support sentiment and liquidity.</p><p><strong>Growing Advertising Business</strong></p><p>Netflix has started offering a lower priced plan with ads. This is bringing in new users who want something cheaper, and it also gives Netflix a new way to earn money from advertisers. As more big brands move their marketing budgets into streaming, Netflix benefits. This can be an important long term growth engine.</p><p><strong>Live Sports and Events Strategy</strong></p><p>Netflix is adding live events like WWE and NFL holiday games. Live content helps keep people subscribed because it creates habits and routine viewing. This is different from binge watching, which can lead to quick cancellations. Live programming can help Netflix keep users longer and attract new ones.</p><p><strong>Global Reach and Local Content</strong></p><p>Netflix creates shows in many languages for many regions. This helps the company connect with global audiences and reduces the risk of relying only on the United States market. Popular shows from Korea, India, Spain, and the Middle East help Netflix grow worldwide.</p><p><strong>Earnings Call Impact and One Time Tax Expense</strong></p><p>Recent earnings were affected by a large tax bill in Brazil, which reduced reported profit and surprised investors. This does not mean the business is weak, but it did create mixed reactions in the market. Investors may wait to see the next quarter before making big moves.</p><p><strong>High Content Costs</strong></p><p>Creating and buying shows is very expensive. Netflix must continue to invest to stay competitive. If content spending rises faster than revenue, profit margins can get squeezed. This is something long term investors should monitor.</p><p><strong>Strong Competition in Streaming</strong></p><p>Netflix competes with Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, and others. Viewers have many options. If other platforms offer more attractive content or better pricing, Netflix can lose audience attention. Competition pressure is still real.</p><p><strong>Fundamental Risk Level: Medium</strong><br/><br/>The business is strong and global with steady revenue. However, competition remains high and content costs must be managed carefully over time.</p><p>IDDA Point 4: Sentimental</p><p>Overall sentiment is <strong>cautiously bullish</strong> for Netflix. Investors are interested because the company continues to grow revenue and expand into new areas like advertising and live events. However, the recent earnings softness and the timing of the stock split have created mixed emotions. Some investors are excited. Some are waiting for more clarity.</p><p><strong>Strengths</strong></p><p><strong>Positive reaction to the 10:1 stock split</strong></p><p>Stock splits do not change the value of the company, but they can increase investor interest because the price per share becomes more accessible. This often brings new retail investors and can create fresh momentum.</p><p><strong>Growing confidence in the advertising strategy</strong></p><p>Analysts and advertisers see strong potential in Netflix’s ad tier. As more brands look for alternatives to traditional TV, Netflix is positioned to benefit from shifting advertising budgets.</p><p><strong>Live events are gaining attention</strong></p><p>Deals with WWE and NFL holiday games have attracted interest because live content helps improve subscriber retention. Investors see this as a strategic play to strengthen engagement and reduce churn.</p><p><strong>Strong brand loyalty and cultural relevance</strong></p><p>Netflix remains a household name with global reach. Even with competition, the brand is still one of the strongest in entertainment. This supports long term confidence.</p><p><strong>Risks</strong></p><p><strong>Earnings reaction created hesitation</strong></p><p>The recent quarter included a surprise tax expense from Brazil, which made results look weaker. Some investors prefer to wait for the next earnings call to see if it was truly a one time issue.</p><p><strong>Competition remains intense in streaming</strong></p><p>Disney, Amazon, YouTube, and others are fighting for viewer attention. If these platforms produce stronger content or pricing models, Netflix could face subscriber pressure.</p><p><strong>Content costs are still high</strong></p><p>To stay competitive, Netflix must spend heavily on producing shows and acquiring rights. If spending grows faster than revenue, profit margins may come under pressure, which can worry investors.</p><p><strong>Market sensitivity to headlines</strong></p><p>Streaming stocks tend to move based on emotion, trending stories, and subscriber expectations. This can create short term volatility even when long term fundamentals remain stable.</p><p><strong>Sentimental Risk Level:</strong> <strong>Medium</strong></p><p>There is optimism around the split and new business opportunities, but investors are watching competition and profitability carefully.</p><p><strong>Weekly Chart</strong></p><p><strong>Long-Term Uptrend</strong></p><p>On the weekly chart, Netflix has been in a clear upward trend since mid 2022. Even when the price has taken pauses or pullbacks, the broader direction remains upward. This shows that buyers have controlled the market over the longer term.</p><p><strong>Recent Pullback Inside the Uptrend</strong></p><p>There has been a downward move recently after reaching a local high. This type of pullback is common during long uptrends as the market rebalances and traders take profit. The key question is whether price holds above important support zones.</p><p><strong>Price Above the Ichimoku Cloud</strong></p><p>The price remains above the Ichimoku Cloud on the weekly timeframe. This is a standard signal that the long-term trend is still bullish. When price stays above the cloud, it suggests that buyers remain in control overall.</p><p><strong>Cloud Thickness Suggests Stable Trend Structure</strong></p><p>The cloud below the price appears wide rather than thin. A wide cloud indicates stronger trend support and can help the price avoid sharp reversals.</p><p><strong>RSI Shows Normal Trend Behavior</strong></p><p>On the weekly chart, the RSI is not in an extreme overbought or oversold zone. This suggests the market is not stretched and has room to move in either direction depending on momentum and news.</p><p><strong>50% Fibonacci Retracement Levels Matter Now</strong></p><p>The most important factor in the short term will be whether price holds above the 50% of the Fibonacci retracement level which is currently sitting in right now. A bounce from this level at $1,089 could continue the long-term uptrend. A breakdown below this level would suggest a deeper correction.</p><p><strong>Technical Summary</strong><br/>The long-term technical outlook remains bullish based on price staying above the Ichimoku Cloud and maintaining its higher-trend structure since 2022. The recent pullback does not break the overall uptrend, but investors may want to watch how price behaves near the level $1,089 to understand whether momentum is shifting or continuing upward.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"598\" src=\"https://investdiva.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-25-1024x598.png\" width=\"1024\"/></p><p><strong>Buy Limit (BL) levels:</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"> $1,085.72 – High Fill Probability</p><p> $1,021.91.XX – Moderate Fill Probability</p><p> $937.79 – Low Fill Probability</p><p>Profit Taking Ideas:</p><p>1,339.00 – High Fill Probability</p><p>1,451.55 – Moderate Fill Probability</p><p>1,537.93 – Low Fill Probability</p><p>Here are the Invest Diva ‘Confidence Compass’ questions to ask yourself before buying at each level:</p><ol><li>If I buy at this price and the price drops by another 50%, how would I feel? Would I panic, or would I buy more to dollar-cost average at lower prices? (hint: this question also reveals your CONFIDENCE in the asset you’re planning to invest in).</li><li>If I don’t buy at this price and the stock suddenly turns around and starts going up again, will I beat myself up for not having bought at this level?</li></ol><p><em>Remember: Investing is personal, and what is right for me might not be right for you. Always do your own due diligence. You should ONLY invest based on your own risk tolerance and your timeframe for reaching your portfolio goals</em></p><p><strong>Technical Risk Level:</strong> <strong>Medium</strong></p><p>The long-term trend remains upward and the price is still positioned above the Ichimoku cloud, which supports a bullish structure. However, the recent pullback means short-term movement could continue to fluctuate before direction becomes clear. If price holds key support levels, the uptrend can continue. If support breaks, the correction may deepen.</p><p>Summary: Final Thoughts</p><p>Netflix remains a strong global brand with a subscription model that generates steady revenue and supports long term growth. The company is expanding its business with an ad-supported plan and live event programming, which can improve engagement and create new revenue streams over time. The recent 10:1 stock split brings more attention to the stock, but it does not change the actual value of the company. It simply makes the shares appear more accessible and may increase trading activity among retail investors.</p><p>At the same time, Netflix faces meaningful challenges. The recent earnings reaction reminded investors that unexpected costs or financial adjustments can influence short term sentiment. The streaming industry also remains crowded, which forces Netflix to continue spending on new content to stay competitive. High content investment helps keep subscribers, but it can pressure profit margins if not managed carefully.</p><p>From a technical perspective, the long term trend is still upward, with price positioned above the Ichimoku cloud on the weekly chart. The recent pullback suggests caution in the short term, and price behavior around support levels will help indicate what comes next.</p><p>Overall, Netflix appears fundamentally stable with room for strategic growth, but it operates in a competitive environment that requires ongoing reinvestment. Patience and clarity are useful here. This is not a company that needs to be rushed into. It is one to watch with a long term mindset.</p><p><strong>Overall Risk Level:</strong> <strong>Medium</strong></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/beyond-meat-stock-900-million-debt-deal-news-lifeline-or-last-gasp-before-collapse?post=530559\">Beyond Meat Stock $900 Million Debt Deal News: Lifeline Or Last Gasp Before Collapse? </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/ferrari-stock-plunged-hard-is-it-a-short-term-drop-or-a-long-term-decline?post=529332\">Ferrari Stock Plunged Hard.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Gold, Bars, Wealth, Finance, Gold Bars, Deposit\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2013/07/18/10/56/gold-163519_960_720.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/photos/gold-bars-wealth-finance-gold-bars-163519/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em></p><p><br/>Investors chasing gold’s upside momentum was a major driver of its recent surge. Their relentless capital inflows helped catapult gold up to extraordinarily-overbought levels, really ramping risks for a reversal. As that indeed sure looks underway now, investors’ chasing has also turned on a dime to fleeing. While their capital outflows haven’t grown large yet, that selling could easily snowball deepening gold’s drawdown.</p><p>Gold investment demand is challenging to measure. The best-available data is only published once per quarter in the World Gold Council’s fantastic Gold Demand Trends, well-written must-read reports for all gold and gold-stock investors. Overnight into Thursday, the new Q3’25 version was just released. Like usual, it analyzes gold’s global supply-and-demand dynamics that fueled its enormous 16.5% rally last quarter.</p><p>Gold’s investment demand proved its biggest category in Q3, just under 3/7ths of overall total demand. The WGC has long subdivided that into bar-and-coin demand and gold-ETF demand. Physically-backed gold exchange-traded funds buy, hold, and sell actual gold bullion. So tracking their holdings reveals investment-capital flows into and out of gold. Gold-ETF buying was gold’s fastest-growing demand category in Q3.</p><p>Bar-and-coin demand last quarter grew 16.8% YoY to 315.5 metric tons. But <em>gold-ETF bullion demand skyrocketed 134.2% YoY</em> to 221.7t! The WGC also tracks the world’s biggest physically-backed gold ETFs quarterly. The largest has always been the American <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GLD\">GLD</a> SPDR Gold Shares, which has maintained an unassailable first-mover advantage since effectively birthing gold ETFs in mid-November 2004.</p><p>The second-biggest has always been the American <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/IAU\">IAU</a> iShares Gold Trust launched not much later in mid-January 2005. IAU has one key advantage over GLD that has left it more favored among many fund investors. IAU charges annual management fees of 0.25% of net assets, well under GLD’s 0.40%. In the super-competitive fund space, every basis point of returns matters. GLD and IAU have always dominated.</p><p>Exiting Q3, these two behemoths alone <em>commanded 38.9% of all the gold</em> held by all the world’s gold ETFs! Two UK gold ETFs were third and fourth with 6.3% and 5.7%, and a German one was fifth running 4.6%. But sixth place is really interesting, another way-newer American one called <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GLDM\">GLDM</a> SPDR Gold MiniShares. Born far later in late June 2018, it was designed to make gold ownership more accessible.</p><p>Its big-brother GLD under the same management is based on each share being worth 1/10th of an ounce of gold after cumulative annual management fees. GLDM tracks a smaller 1/50th of an ounce, making for a proportionally-lower share price for investors. But GLDM’s knockout advantage is its annual management fees <em>are only 0.1% of net assets</em>, merely 1/4th of GLD’s!So GLDM has to be cannibalizing GLD demand.</p><p>In Q3 GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings surged 7.8% or 120.7t. GLD grew 6.3% or 60.3t, IAU 8.9% or 39.2t, and GLDM enjoyed the strongest growth at 14.3% or 21.2t. They were much better than all the rest of the world’s physically-backed gold ETFs combined, as their collective holdings only climbed 4.9% or 101.0t last quarter. GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings are a great proxy for <em>American stock investors’ gold capital flows</em>.</p><p>While gold clocked in with that fantastic Q3 up 16.5%, it wasn’t particularly overheated yet. Most of the frenzied buying arose in the first several weeks of October, which the WGC’s Q3 report doesn’t cover. In that short span, <em>gold blasted another 12.9% higher</em> stretching an extraordinarily-extreme 33.0% above its baseline 200-day moving average!I had warned about <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/goldprst.htm\"><u>gold’s mounting overboughtness</u></a> and downside risk.</p><p>That also ballooned gold’s mighty cyclical bull since early October 2023 into its largest on record going way back to January 1971!In a mid-October essay on <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/goldbgbl.htm\"><u>gold’s biggest bull ever</u></a> right before it peaked, I warned that “History argues a 20%ish drawdown is probable, which gold stocks will leverage 2x to 3x like usual.”The next-ten-biggest gold bulls averaged subsequent big-and-fast gold selloffs of <em>20.8% over just 2.1 months!</em></p><p>One of the main reasons gold’s massive breakout accelerated so dramatically in October’s first few weeks was American stock investors increasingly chasing gold’s powerful upside momentum. In that short span this month when gold blasted up another 12.9%, GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings surged fully 3.8% or 62.9t!Again that compares to 7.8% and 120.7t for all of Q3, which was fully 3.6x longer in terms of total trading days.</p><p>Because American stock investors’ capital flows have been <em>one of gold’s major price drivers</em> for well over a decade now, I’ve done a lot of past research work on them. In mid-February 2025 before investors started chasing with GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings at just 1,372.2t compared to 1,696.7t midweek, I wrote an essay <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/amrchgld.htm\"><u>Americans to Chase Gold</u></a>. In mid-July with holdings at 1,538.6t, I wrote another one <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/gldchsmt.htm\"><u>Gold Chasing Mounts</u></a>.</p><p>One key thing past gold-ETF-holdings research revealed was their <em>major reversals tended to lag gold’s own</em>. In past major gold toppings, GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings would usually continue building for several weeks or more after gold crested. That implied American stock investors weren’t convinced those gold runs were over, so their differential gold-ETF-share buying persisted until it was clearer gold was rolling over.</p><p>But rather provocatively this time around, these dominant gold ETFs’ holdings look to have <em>peaked right with gold</em>. This chart superimposes GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings over gold prices during these last few years or so. While this is all still young, it sure looks like American stock investors’ gold chasing has already reversed with gold!This is certainly bearish, as gold-ETF selling pressure could easily cascade.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://talkmarkets.com/contributor/mirjana-mishevska/user_content/ckimages/orig_zeal103125a.webp\" width=\"700\"/></p><p>Gold’s latest record high was $4,350 on October 20th, capping that amazing 12.9% month-to-date surge. GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings technically crested the next day, but with a mere 0.1% build. Their daily builds in the prior three trading days including gold’s apparent topping were far-larger running 0.9%, 0.6%, and 0.7%!So for all intents and purposes, these gold-ETF bullion holdings <em>peaked simultaneously with gold</em>.</p><p>Had the usual post-gold-topping lag happened where differential gold-ETF-share buying continued for a few weeks or longer, that would’ve moderated gold’s nascent selloff. I suspect that didn’t happen because gold’s initial daily drop proved so darned violent. On the 21st right off that latest high, gold plummeted 5.3% which <em>ranked in its top-0.3%-biggest down days</em> since January 1971!I analyzed that in <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/gdskslam.htm\"><u>last week’s essay</u></a>.</p><p>The faster any plunge, the more they shock traders and forcibly change their herd sentiment. As gold was soaring into its latest peak, gold bullishness was universal. Major financial-media outlets were falling all over themselves running endless stories about gold’s strong gains and why they were likely to continue. CNBC, Bloomberg, and the Wall Street Journal were starting to feel like they were all-gold-all-the-time.</p><p>Not only was the frequency of gold reporting increasing, but its <em>near-term bullishness</em>. In early October a parade of billionaire hedge-fund managers and widely-respected investors were interviewed predicting much-higher gold prices still within the coming half-year. All that hype was getting frenzied, threatening to morph into a secular-bull-slaying popular speculative mania. Gold greed and euphoria were rapidly mounting.</p><p>With a psychological backdrop like that, there was little contrarian commentary about the risks of gold’s extraordinarily-extreme overboughtness. Despite intensely studying gold, actively trading gold stocks, and writing about all of it continuously for over a quarter-century now, I got plenty of flak from daring to point out how stretched gold just looked historically. Caught up in the hype, few wanted to view gold soberly.</p><p>So gold’s 39th-largest down day in 54.8 years hit gold-bewitched investors like a sledgehammer to the skull!Gold suddenly being clubbed like a baby seal out of the blue on no news catalyst <em>had to be deeply unsettling</em> for investors recently buying in high to chase. That was certainly a brutal wake-up call that gold has always been volatile and risky, and can’t power higher linearly indefinitely. Periodic selloffs are inevitable.</p><p>For grizzled battle-scarred veterans, gold plunging out of some of its most-extreme overbought conditions ever was no surprise. I started warning about that increasing likelihood in mid-September when gold was <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/goldprst.htm\"><u>already pretty stretched</u></a>. We had stopped adding new gold-stock trades in our popular weekly newsletter in mid-August, then tightened up their trailing stop losses in late September. The writing was on the wall then.</p><p>In mid-October when the gold-to-the-moon hype was deafening and overboughtness soaring, we added put options in GLD and a major gold-stock ETF. The entire modern history of gold argued that it couldn’t sustain such incredibly-overbought levels for long. But the great majority of investors not considering any studied contrarian perspectives likely had no idea what was coming. They figured gold would keep surging.</p><p>While momentum-chasing buying is powerful while underway as gold demonstrated in October’s first few weeks, it is brittle. When that fast-rallying price action wobbles then reverses, hot-money demand quickly vanishes. That leaves sellers in control, and the faster they force prices lower the more pressure exerted on recent investors to flee. In turn the more they sell, the more prices drop fueling snowballing capital outflows.</p><p>As of Wednesday’s data cutoff for this essay, gold had already plunged 9.5% in just seven trading days!That already proved the biggest drawdown of gold’s mighty 139.1% cyclical bull over 24.5 months since early October 2023. And gold was challenging a 10%+ correction, which would technically kill this epic gold bull. After cresting a single day past gold, GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings have <em>fallen six trading days in a row</em>.</p><p>That’s the longest streak of daily draws since mid-November 2024, during this gold bull’s previous largest selloff of 8.0%. The total GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings drop recently is 1.7% or 29.8t. Gold’s other primary driver in recent decades has been American speculators’ leveraged gold-futures trading. Normally with no government shutdown, their collective positioning is published weekly in Commitments of Traders reports.</p><p>Those are current to Tuesday closes, so CoT weeks end every Tuesday. During this latest one wrapping up this Tuesday, GLD+IAU+GLDM suffered a big 1.5% or 26.6t holdings draw. Rather forebodingly, that proved <em>the biggest single-CoT-week draw</em> in gold’s entire record cyclical bull!This recent differential gold-ETF-share selling not only didn’t lag gold, but it has already been the most intense this bull has yet witnessed.</p><p>American stock investors’ potential gold exodus cascading is a serious downside risk for gold already in a big-and-fast drawdown. The mission of physically-backed gold ETFs is to track the gold price. But the supply and demand of their shares are independent from gold’s own. So when gold-ETF shares are dumped faster than gold itself, their share prices threaten to decouple from their metal to the downside.</p><p>The only way gold-ETF managers can avert such failures is to buy back enough of their shares to absorb any excess supply. They raise the funds to finance these purchases by <em>selling some of their gold bullion</em>. So draws in GLD, IAU, or GLDM holdings reveal American stock-market capital flowing out of gold. And as this chart shows, investors still have lots of room to sell after those holdings paced gold’s massive breakout.</p><p>From mid-April to late August, gold was mired in a high consolidation after its previous episode of extreme overboughtness. And mid-April’s was considerably less extreme than mid-October’s. Gold’s upper resistance this past summer ran near $3,425. Gold didn’t break out above that until August’s final trading day, which <em>kicked off recent months’ chasing</em>. The day before that breakout, GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings ran 1,576.8t.</p><p>They surged 9.5% or 149.6t into mid-October as gold-ETF shares were bought much faster than gold. In that scenario of excess gold-ETF-share demand, their prices risk decoupling from gold to the upside. So gold-ETF managers issue new shares to offset that excess demand. They then plow the proceeds from those share sales into buying more physical gold bullion. These numbers can be rounded to 1,575t and 150t.</p><p>As gold plunged 9.5% since mid-October, American stock investors sold enough gold-ETF shares to force a 29.8t holdings draw. That’s close to 30t, <em>or just 1/5th of</em> the frenzied GLD+IAU+GLDM holdings build in September and the majority of October!What happens to gold prices if investors force another 45t draw unwinding half their recent frenzied build?What if they roundtrip the whole thing to 150t with 120t more selling?</p><p>Any more significant differential gold-ETF-share dumping will almost certainly <em>exacerbate gold’s drawdown</em>. Again previous massive gold bulls averaged big-and-fast subsequent selloffs around 20% over a couple months or so. Another one this time around implies $3,480 gold before the dust settles, which is hardly apocalyptic. Gold only first bested that level just two months ago on September’s opening trading day.</p><p>But the pain of a 20% drawdown would still be serious, <em>especially in gold stocks</em>. Historically the leading <a href=\"https://www.zealllc.com/2025/gmq225fn.htm\"><u>GDX gold-stock ETF</u></a> has tended to amplify material gold moves by 2x to 3x. So if American stock investors’ gold chasing is indeed reversing as apparent so far, both the metal and its miners’ stocks still have long ways to fall before this drawdown runs its course. Both extreme sentiment and technicals need to be rebalanced.</p><p>The bottom line is American stock investors’ gold chasing via gold ETFs is reversing. Since gold peaked, major-gold-ETF bullion holdings have relentlessly fallen. This is unusual, as they’ve normally lagged major gold reversals historically. Gold plummeting out of its latest record close contributed to the urgency to exit, seriously damaging bullish psychology. This young exodus from gold ETFs could easily snowball.</p><p>So far investors have merely unwound about 1/5th of the holdings build from their frenzied differential gold-ETF-share buying in September and the first few weeks of October. If they keep selling, that will force the gold ETFs to dump more physical bullion intensifying gold’s necessary drawdown. That in turn will ramp pressure on investors to flee gold ETFs, which could spawn a vicious cycle of selling pounding gold much lower.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/gold-stocks-slammed?post=530356\">Gold Stocks Slammed</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/golds-biggest-bull-ever?post=529164\">Gold’s Biggest Bull Ever </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/more-gold-miner-records?post=527671\">More Gold Miner Records</a></p></div>",

For example, the S&amp;P 500’s current yield is only ~1.2%.</p><p>High-yield stocks can be particularly beneficial in supplementing retirement income. A $120,000 investment in stocks with an average dividend yield of 5% creates an average of <strong>$500 a month in dividends</strong>.</p><p>Next on our list of <a href=\"https://www.suredividend.com/high-dividend-stocks/\">high-dividend stocks</a> to review is Hooker Furnishings Corp. (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/HOFT\">HOFT</a>).</p><h3><br/><strong>Business Overview</strong></h3><p>Hooker Furnishings is a designer, marketer, and importer of furniture—including casegoods, leather, and fabric-upholstered pieces—along with lighting, accessories, and home décor for residential, hospitality, and contract markets. The company also produces premium custom leather and fabric furniture domestically. As the largest supplier of case goods and upholstery in the U.S., Hooker reaches over 75% of retail furniture distribution. Founded in 1924 and headquartered in Martinsville, Virginia, the company currently has a market capitalization of $93 million.</p><p>On September 11, 2025, Hooker Furnishings reported Q2 fiscal 2026 results (fiscal year ends January 2026), showing a 14% decline in net sales compared to last year, driven by weak demand and pre-pandemic home sales levels. High interest rates and elevated home prices have pressured the home furnishings sector over the past two years. Despite cost-cutting measures, loss per share widened from $0.11 to $0.31, missing analysts’ estimates by $0.19. This marked the seventh consecutive quarter of earnings misses. Consequently, our EPS forecast for fiscal 2026 has been reduced from $0.50 to $0.25.</p><p>Management cited weak new home sales and persistent inflation as key challenges. The company has reported weak sales and earnings for nine straight quarters. Assuming no significant tariffs are imposed on key trading partners, Hooker Furnishings could improve performance next year. The stock has fallen 22% this year due to these weak results.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-27-at-8.44.27-PM-768x250.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: <a href=\"https://investors.hookerfurnishings.com/\">Investor Relations</a></p><h3><br/><strong>Growth Prospects</strong></h3><p>Hooker Furnishings has experienced a highly volatile business performance, failing to grow its earnings over the past decade. The company posted steady earnings growth until 2020 but was severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Following a partial recovery, it faced another setback from surging inflation, which prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to a 23-year high. Combined with elevated home prices, these factors have constrained demand for new homes, creating a significant headwind for Hooker’s business.</p><p>Looking ahead, the outlook for Hooker Furnishings appears more favorable. Inflation is expected to moderate, and the Fed is likely to lower interest rates in the coming years. If these trends materialize, demand for new homes should strengthen, supporting a recovery in both sales and earnings for the company.</p><p>Given the business’s historical volatility, a conservative approach to growth expectations is warranted. Nevertheless, with this year’s exceptionally low comparison base, we project an average annual EPS growth of 32% over the next five years.</p><h3><br/><strong>Competitive Advantages &amp; Recession Performance</strong></h3><p>Hooker Furnishings’ competitive advantage lies in its scale, brand recognition, and extensive distribution network. As the largest supplier of case goods and upholstery in the U.S., the company reaches over 75% of retail furniture channels. Its combination of imported and domestically manufactured furniture, including premium custom leather and fabric pieces, allows Hooker to serve a wide range of residential, hospitality, and contract markets.</p><p>This diversification, along with decades of design expertise, positions the company to maintain a strong market presence despite sector volatility.</p><p>In terms of recession performance, Hooker Furnishings has historically faced challenges during economic downturns due to its reliance on new-home sales and discretionary spending. While the company experienced consistent growth before 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent inflationary pressures highlighted its vulnerability to macroeconomic shocks.</p><p>Nevertheless, Hooker’s established brand, broad distribution, and cost management initiatives provide some resilience, allowing it to navigate recessions better than smaller, less diversified competitors.</p><h3><br/><strong>Dividend Analysis</strong></h3><p>Hooker Furnishings offers a relatively attractive dividend yield of 10.4%, reflecting its commitment to returning capital to shareholders despite recent earnings volatility.</p><p>While the company has faced multiple quarters of weak performance, its ability to sustain dividends is supported by cost management measures and a diversified product portfolio. Investors should view the dividend as a strong income component, though potential fluctuations in earnings may affect its long-term stability.</p><p>However, the dividend is at risk of a cut this year, as the company has an over-100 % payout ratio. The company is expected to earn $0.25 per share this year while paying a dividend of $0.92 per share.</p><h3><br/><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p>Hooker Furnishings has declined by over 36% this year due to the effects of high interest rates and inflation. While a recovery is likely over the coming years, investors should expect a gradual turnaround. However, the dividend is at risk of a cut this year because of the high payout.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/high-dividend-50-permrock-royalty-trust?post=532038\">High Dividend 50: PermRock Royalty Trust</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/high-dividend-50-golub-capital-bdc-inc?post=531808\">High Dividend 50: Golub Capital BDC, Inc.</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/10-of-the-right-retirement-stocks-for-income-investors?post=531175\">10 Of The Right Retirement Stocks For Income Investors</a><br/></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Figma Down 54%: Can AI Save the Story?\" height=\"279\" src=\"https://tokenist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/169894953_m-1-646x360.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://123rf.com/\">123rf.com</a></em></p><p><br/>It has been three months since the design software company Figma began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/FIG\">FIG</a>. To put it mildly, shareholders are somewhat anxious about FIG’s future stock performance.<br/><br/>At the time, on July 31st, Figma’s IPO achieved a massive valuation of $19.3 billion, with initial FIG pricing at $33 per share. However, shortly after its NYSE debut, FIG shares surged to $142.92, a 4x increase that pushed its valuation close to $68 billion. This reflected prior Bloomberg reporting that the Figma IPO had been oversubscribed 40x.<br/><br/>That was not entirely surprising. Initial public offerings (IPOs) launch without the company’s trading history, making it difficult to anchor expectations. Moreover, leveraging the initial hype and a limited float, insider investors tend to lock up profits, resulting in a rapid selloff cascade. With three months of trading now behind it, FIG stock is down 54%, currently priced at $48.73 per share. Let’s examine the company’s prospects and potential valuation moving forward.</p><h3><br/><strong>Was It Wise to Invest in Adobe’s Competitor?</strong></h3><p>Both Adobe (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/ADBE\">ADBE</a>) and Figma (FIG) occupy the niche of interactive product design, offering Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions. Most customers for both companies come from marketing, social media, branding, graphic design, and the education sector. As the dominant player in this market, Adobe offered $20 billion to acquire Figma in 2022, nearly matching the company’s IPO valuation. However, the deal was canceled in late 2023 due to regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>From that cancellation, Figma greatly benefited as Adobe had to pay a $1 billion reverse termination fee. Investors have been particularly excited about Figma’s IPO due to its collaborative approach to product development. Namely, multiple users can work simultaneously on the same project, making changes visible as if they were working on a Google document.</p><p>Figma further integrated tools like Slack, Jira, and Adobe XD to enhance the workflow pipeline. Additionally, Figma operates a freemium model to attract users and expand its customer base. All of these ingredients would suggest that Figma could become as widespread as Google Workspace.</p><p>However, both Adobe and Figma face peril from that very same direction. Specifically, Google’s Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image), launched in late August, enables users to prompt AI to edit images as easily as they can generate them. This is a significant milestone, as generating content over and over again to luck out on the desired effect is not very conducive for professional use.</p><p>In fact, in June’s <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/adobe-inc-should-you-buy-the-dip/\">coverage of Adobe,</a> we posited that granular control of content editing would remain superior to AI-powered generation, especially since Adobe has its own competent Firefly model. Yet, if the trend of text-to-edit continues, both companies’ long-term valuations could hinge less on their design pedigree and more on how swiftly they pivot to AI-native workflows.</p><p>At a bare minimum, if Google integrates more of such features, considering the company’s <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/alphabets-paradox-why-googles-decay-strengthens-its-dominance/\">overwhelming reach</a>, the incentive to adopt Figma products for basic use cases would diminish.</p><h3><br/><strong>Figma’s AI Positioning Strengthens</strong></h3><p>Now that we understand why AI is such a big deal for both Adobe and Figma, it makes sense that the latter just recently, on Thursday, announced the acquisition of Weavy. The Israeli AI startup, launched a year ago, was acquired by Figma for $200 million.</p><p>Weavy weaves existing AI models such as Sora, Veo, and the aforementioned Nano Banana to generate primitives. Users can then combine them to create a cohesive output, including color grading, lighting adjustments, and masking.</p><p>This is the exact ingredient Figma needs to stay relevant against future AI advances, as it positions itself as an AI-agnostic layer. More importantly, by embedding AI-driven primitives directly into its collaborative ecosystem, Figma is raising its moat drawbridge.</p><h3><br/><strong>Figma’s Price Targets</strong></h3><p>Over the last 12 months, Figma generated $294.3 million in free cash flow (FCF). With a year-over-year revenue growth of 41%, reaching $249.6 million as of Q2, analysts expect an annual FCF target of $367.5 million by 2029.</p><p>At this stage of the business, Figma’s discounted cash flow (DCF) model is challenging to pin down. However, it is fair to say that the stock is overvalued, given its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 261.06 for the trailing twelve months (TTM). For comparison, Adobe’s P/E is 21.10 TTM.</p><p>Over the last three months, ADBE stock has been down 5.5%, while FIG shares have lost 54% of their value. Yet, according to the Wall Street Journal’s forecasting, most analysts remain largely optimistic, with zero sells, eight holds, and four buys.</p><p>This puts the average FIG price target at $67.57 per share. Even the bottom outlook is higher than the current price level, at $49, while the bullish ceiling stands at $85 per share.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/why-is-getty-images-stock-soaring-today-ai-deal-with-perplexity-boosts-shares?post=532328\">Why Is Getty Images Stock Soaring Today?

At the same time, TSM stock has already gained roughly 54% on a year-to-date basis, thus raising concerns about forward viability.</p><p>Within the financial publication industry, the two dominant methodologies are fundamental and technical analysis. While they can be instructive, the critical issue that must be recognized is that in either approach, both the premise and the conclusion stem from the author making the claim. In other words, they’re analyst-contingent methodologies.</p><p>For example, TSM stock currently carries a<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsm/forecast\"> Strong Buy</a> consensus rating. However, what’s fascinating is that the gap between the highest price target ($400) and the average price target ($340.75) clocks in at 17.39%. What’s more, the high-low gap is nearly 38%.</p><p>So, while the suits on the Street are all using fundamental analysis, some experts see robust growth while others see an erosion, This necessarily means that concepts such as intrinsic value are not universal truth claims but are dressed-up opinions masquerading as “analysis.”</p><p>In contrast, quantitative analysis aligns with the observations made by GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) studies, which describes the diffusional properties of volatility as clustered, non-linear phenomena. In other words, different market stimuli yield different market behaviors.</p><p>Now, under baseline conditions, the forward 10-week returns of TSM stock would be expected to form a distributional profile, with outcomes ranging from $290 to $338 (assuming an anchor price of $303.22, Thursday’s close). Further, price clustering would be expected to be predominant at about $310.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"288\" src=\"https://moneymorning.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2025/10/image1-29.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>However, TSM stock is not under baseline conditions but has instead printed a 6-4-U sequence: six up weeks, four down weeks, with an overall upward trajectory. Based on this specific stimulus, the risk-reward tail expands to $282 on the downside to $360 on the upside. Moreover, price clustering would be predominant at $331.</p><p>Right now, investors are enjoying a 6.77% positive delta in price density dynamics — which is very much a measurable statistic. It’s just that fundamental and technical analysts are blind to it because such variances are not visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Granted, the sentiment regime can shift and investors will need to be aware of exogenous influences. Presently, though, the empirical data supports the upside narrative.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/micron-technology-is-up-big-this-year-but-it-may-have-hit-a-temporary-stall-point?post=532299\">Micron Technology Is Up Big This Year But It May Have Hit A Temporary Stall Point </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/the-perfect-ai-stock-does-exist-its-microsoft?post=532017\">The Perfect AI Stock Does Exist.

Meta posted GAAP EPS of $1.05, an incredible 84% lower than Wall Street's $6.71 consensus. The shortfall is owed nearly exclusively to an almost $16 billion one-time tax charge caused by the Trump administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act that was passed earlier this year.</p><p>That allowed META <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/equities\">stock</a> to slide more than 11% on Thursday, and Friday has seen new lows.</p><h2><br/>Meta Platforms stock news</h2><p>Many retail investors know that buying Mag 7 stocks following large downward swings always seems to work out in the end. And in that sense, we agree. There are a number of reasons to believe strongly in Meta's return to new highs.</p><p>First, while causing an unexpected pullback in Meta's share price, the government tax bill will reduce taxes substantially over the long run. In fact, Meta's top brass think the lower tax <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/rates\">rates</a> will boost earnings as soon as Q4.</p><p>Then there's the adjusted earnings. If we discard the one-time tax charge, adjusted EPS arrived at $7.25, a full $0.58 ahead of the analyst consensus. This means that adjusted earnings, the figure that most investors focus on over the long term, rose 20% from a year earlier.</p><p>Ad impressions delivered across the Family of Apps segment increased by 14% on an annual basis in Q3, while average price per ad increased by 10% YoY. This tells us that pricing power and demand remain robust, while Zuckerberg said that Facebook Reels has reached a $50 billion per annum run rate. The company's prized possession doesn't appear to be slowing down.</p><p>If anything is bothering the market, it's likely the intense level of capex going into Meta's AI investments. The already heady $69 billion mid-level estimate for 2025 was pushed up during the earnings call by an extra $2 billion. Like the company's Reality Labs side hustle, which lost another $4 billion during Q3 as it had for the five previous quarters, the AI investments are likely years away from turning a profit if at all.</p><p>With the metaverse investments losing $73 billion cumulatively to date, investors can be forgiven for thinking the heavy investment in AI data centers is just another boondoggle requiring an eventual write-down. <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/news\">News</a> spread on Friday that Meta is looking to raise $30 billion in a bond sale to sustain the AI buildout, a sign that the price tag of this venture is steep.</p><h2><br/>Meta Platforms stock forecast</h2><p>The daily chart is fairly self-explanatory. While nubile traders might be enticed by the prospect of a quick return to the $700s, a more seasoned professional sees two notable gaps that need to be filled.</p><p>First comes the May 12 gap up that leaves a gap between $611 and $619. Markets love to close gaps, and to do so, META needs to trade about 6% lower to reach $611.</p><p>The second gap also hails from May, the first day of the month to be exact. That gap from $558.50 to $570.50 would require META to tag the lower figure by shedding another 14% from Friday's closing price of $649.50.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"META daily stock chart\" height=\"322\" src=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feditorial.fxsstatic.com%2Fmiscelaneous%2FMETA%252031-10-25-1761942155682-1761942155683.jpg&amp;w=1536&amp;q=95\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><small>META daily stock chart</small></p><p><br/>But not to be left out, bulls then have the higher gap to close as well. The gap created by Wednesday's earnings crash requires META to trade candle by candle from $680 to $742.50, which could take some time. It would be fun if META could close the two lower gaps before closing the upper gap. That would be a wild ride for sure.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/wti-rises-amid-modest-recovery-opec-output-increase-caps-gains?post=532326\">WTI Rises Amid Modest Recovery, OPEC+ Output Increase Caps Gains </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/eurusd-hovers-near-lows-with-eurozone-inflation-on-tap?post=532170\">EUR/USD Hovers Near Lows With Eurozone Inflation On Tap </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/gold-edges-higher-on-safe-haven-flows-remains-below-4050-amid-feds-hawkish-tilt?post=532053\">Gold Edges Higher On Safe-Haven Flows; Remains Below $4,050 Amid Fed's Hawkish Tilt </a><br/></div>",

The market continues to face downward pressure as both assets break key psychological levels. The <a href=\"https://coincentral.com/bitcoin-price-plunges-to-108k-after-unexpected-tariff-changes/\">Bitcoin price </a>now trades below $110,000, while Ethereum has dropped beneath $4,000.</p><h2><br/>Bitcoin ETFs Record Heavy Outflows</h2><p>Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows reach $488 million on October 30. Nearly every listed issuer experienced withdrawals, with only a handful remaining flat. <a href=\"https://coincentral.com/blackrocks-ibit-tops-bitcoin-etf-inflows-with-2-63b-in-record-week/\">BlackRock’s</a> <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/IBIT\">IBIT</a> led the losses with outflows exceeding $290 million.</p><p>Ark &amp; 21Shares’ <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/ARKB\">ARKB</a> followed with redemptions surpassing $65 million, according to <a href=\"https://sosovalue.com/assets/etf/us-btc-spot\">SoSoValue data</a>. The widespread selling affected almost all Bitcoin ETF products in the market. Total weekly flows for Bitcoin ETFs turned negative, erasing gains from earlier in the week.</p><h2><br/>Ethereum ETFs Mirror Downward Trend</h2><p>Ethereum ETFs recorded $184 million in net outflows during the same trading session. Every issuer, except Grayscale’s <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/ETHE\">ETHE</a>, posted redemptions. BlackRock’s <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/ETHA\">ETHA</a> experienced the largest withdrawal, at $118 million.</p><p>Bitwise’s <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/ETHW\">ETHW</a> saw $31 million exit the fund on October 30. Ethereum ETFs have now matched Bitcoin’s pattern of persistent selling. Weekly momentum for Ethereum ETFs shifted to negative territory after consecutive days of outflows.</p><p>The broader market’s struggle to maintain key support levels contributed to the redemptions. Ethereum ETFs faced pressure as the cryptocurrency dipped below the $4,000 threshold. Both primary cryptocurrency ETF categories lost their positive momentum for the week.</p><h2><br/>New Altcoin ETFs Show Strength</h2><p>Solana, HBAR, and Litecoin ETFs bucked the broader trend with steady inflows this week. Bitwise launched its Solana ETF (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/BSOL\">BSOL</a>) on the NYSE earlier this week. The debut marked the first spot Solana ETF available in the United States.</p><p>BSOL pulled in over $36 million in daily net inflows since launch. The fund’s cumulative net inflow reached $155 million within just three trading days. Strong investor interest distinguished the Solana ETF from established Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.</p><p>Canary Capital’s <a href=\"https://coincentral.com/canary-capital-nears-launch-of-litecoin-and-hbar-etfs-as-sec-faces-shutdown-delay/\">HBAR ETF</a> went live on Nasdaq around the same time. The fund reported nearly $30 million in fresh inflows during its opening sessions. <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/HBR\">HBR</a> built momentum despite broader market corrections affecting major cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Litecoin completed its ETF debut on Nasdaq this week as well. The <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/LTCC\">LTCC</a> product remains in a net positive territory despite modest aggregate flows. The new altcoin ETFs attracted capital while Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs faced redemptions.</p><p>These three products demonstrated resilience during volatile market conditions. Investors sought diversification beyond the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"311\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/mishtalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BYD-RACCO.png?resize=1024%2C530&amp;quality=80&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"600\"/></p><p><br/><strong>Downwards with No Speed Limit</strong></p><p>Eurointelligence has an interesting article on the state of Germany’s auto industry. The warning applies to the US as well.</p><p>Please consider <a href=\"https://www.eurointelligence.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Downwards with No Speed Limit</a></p><blockquote><p>The German car industry had a really bad year. The chip shortage problem is the latest crisis, and the industry is absolutely dependent on this issue being resolved. At least, there is now a mechanism in place that could resolve the issue as we write in our lead story.</p><p>But the bigger long-term problem are not related to this. VW downgraded its forecasts three times this year. We have seen problems popping in all areas of the Germany car industry – at Mercedes and Porsche in particular. BMW is the best of the bunch.</p><p>The Nexperia chip shortages give the industry an excuse for finger-pointing, but this does not deflect from the underlying trend – that they are all struggling with electro-mobility. They were late in the game – and massively underestimated the transition. The watering-down of the 2035 deadline for the fuel-driven car will provide some relief, but no solution. This would be like producing typewriters in the 21st century.</p><p>We hear a lot of comments lately that it is regulation that killed the car industry. We disagree. It is mostly poor decisions by companies. In Europe, the car industry has been a virtual co-regulator. The industry supported the 2035 target. The long-term success of the German car industry depended critically on its ability to set regulatory standards for the entire industry, globally through the EU. This is also what gave the EU the confidence to do the same in the area of tech regulation. They found, very much to their surprise, that this success did not translate to new sectors, and especially not to sectors where the EU is not a leading producer. <em>The big problem for the German car industry is that they cannot set the standards for the next generation of cars. They are in the business of trying to catch up. They are in the process of losing their regulatory monopol</em>y.</p><p>There is already pressure coming from the US to accept mutual recognition of standards for vehicles. Ursula von der Leyen agreed to this in her trade deal with Trump. We will see similar issues coming up in the EU’s trade relations with China.</p><p>We still see some hope for the Germans in the luxury end of the market. But a mid-range self-driving car is ultimately more luxurious than a high-end German limousine, unless you have a chauffeur. <em>The business model of the German car industry is that it innovates at the top end of the range, letting the technological benefits trickle down the ranges over time, eventually reaching the smallest cars. This is not how it works in China.</em></p><p>The car industry will not die. But we are struggling to see a healthy ecosystem for mass-market cars in the future.</p></blockquote><p><br/><strong>Germany’s Lack of Innovation</strong></p><p>Volkswagen lags in more ways than one. For decades it do little innovation on anything but diesel.</p><p>Then when diesel could make no more advances, VW rigged diesel tests to show emissions were lower.</p><p><br/><strong>US Innovation</strong></p><p>Elon Musk’s Tesla was a master class in innovation, for a while. But Musk has been very distracted by other things like robots and Mars.</p><p>The Cybertruck was a huge flop.</p><p>Tesla makes a lot of money on tax credits which it should not receive at all. But Trump finally ended most of them.</p><p>Now, Trump is doing everything he can to roll back the clock to preserve big gas-guzzling trucks.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong. I am no big fan of electric, for me. It just is not Mish ready, and I am not ready for it. I do go offroad, and I have to worry about gas. But I don’t have to worry about finding a charger.</p><p>And I understand the issues with metals availability and allegedly clean energy that really isn’t.</p><p>But like it or not, EVs have fewer moving parts, can be built faster, and require less maintenance. For those who do nearly all their driving in cities, EVs would work, if the cost comes down.</p><p>Small EVs should be inexpensive but they aren’t. Trump has walled off the US with tariffs.</p><p>GM and Ford union costs are massive. Both Ford and GM lost huge amounts of money on EVs.</p><p>First, Biden tried to force then issue. Now, Trump wants to roll back time.</p><p>Neither approach will work. The result is the high-priced cars and no incentive to innovate with unions fighting innovation every step of the way.</p><p><br/><strong>BYD Overtakes Tesla in Europe for the First Time, Sales Jump 169 Percent</strong></p><p>On May 24, 2025, I noted <strong><a href=\"https://mishtalk.com/economics/byd-overtakes-tesla-in-europe-for-the-first-time-sales-jump-169-percent/\" target=\"_blank\">BYD Overtakes Tesla in Europe for the First Time, Sales Jump 169 Percent</a></strong></p><blockquote><p>BYD sold 7,231 battery electric vehicles in April versus 7,165 by Tesla, according to data from Jato Dynamics.</p></blockquote><p><br/><strong>Trump’s Tariffs</strong></p><p>Trump’s high tariffs and regulation restrictions are so high there is no US BYD market.</p><p>Tariffs protect the weak and the inefficient.</p><p>Also America has a love affair with big cars.</p><p>Is that a Boomer thing?</p><p>I suspect but cannot prove Zoomers would love a $15,000 middle of the road BYD but Trump says no.</p><p>I love my Toyota 4-Runner and would not consider an EV. But for tens of millions of city drivers who seldom escape the city, a cheap BYD with safer battery technology would be the ticket.</p><p><br/><strong>Ford CEO: China’s EV Costs, Tech, and Quality “Far Superior” to the West</strong></p><p>On June 30, 2025 <strong><a href=\"https://mishtalk.com/economics/ford-ceo-chinas-ev-costs-tech-and-quality-far-superior-to-the-west/\" target=\"_blank\">Ford’s CEO said China’s EV Costs, Tech, and Quality “Far Superior” to the West</a></strong></p><blockquote><p>“<em>Drivers get in the car and their phone pairs automatically, and an AI companion equivalent to ChatGPT handles everything from navigation to entertainment. The vehicles also have facial recognition that knows which seat someone is in and adjusts media preferences.</em>“</p><p>The Western manufacturers do not have that at any price.</p><p>In China, BYD offers a range of electric vehicles (EVs) at various price points, with some models starting under $10,000. For example, the BYD Seagull EV has a starting price of 69,800 yuan (approximately $9,555) and can be found with discounts down to 55,800 yuan (about $7,780). The company also offers more <em>premium models like the Han EV, which starts at around $32,800</em>.</p></blockquote><p>Five months ago Elon Musk said <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9BxiVI4r58\" target=\"_blank\">I don’t follow BYD or think about competitors, I focus on making perfect products.</a></p><p>That’s more than a bit foolish and arrogant both. The irony is Musk has promised Full Self Driving for decades without coming close to perfection.</p><p>I doubt it Tesla FSD will ever work as good as Waymo unless Musk relents and adds Lidar. For discussion, please see <strong><a href=\"https://mishtalk.com/economics/waymo-surges-to-10-million-paid-rides-tesla-has-zero/\" target=\"_blank\">Waymo Surges to 10 Million Paid Rides, Tesla Has Zero</a></strong></p><blockquote><p>Hello Elon Musk, you are now 10 million rides behind Waymo.</p></blockquote><p>Without Lidar, Musk can build a car cheaper but not safer than Waymo. Meanwhile the cost of Lidar is coming down.</p><p>Musk’s FSD will not work as well as Waymo in adverse conditions. It’s ridiculous to believe otherwise.</p><p><br/><strong>BYD Reveal Cheap Kei Car – The Brands Cheapest EV EVER</strong></p><p>Two days ago the Electric Viking reported “BYD has unveiled its most affordable electric vehicle yet — a compact Kei car designed for urban driving and priced to undercut all previous models. This tiny EV marks BYD’s bold entry into the ultra-low-cost segment, targeting Japan and other city-focused markets.”</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kHp8B_-caVo?si=bSy0rIeP4dzILTJl\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p><p>BYDs would sell in the US too were it not for 100 percent tariffs.</p><p><br/><strong>Pay More – Get Less</strong></p><p>That is Trump’s unofficial motto as well as the UAW and Teamsters.</p><p>These BYD models would be hot seller in the US at $15,000 or even $20,000.</p><p>Trump finds it easy to get the economically clueless on his side with chants of “They are stealing out jobs; they are ripping us off; and it’s unfair trade”.</p><p>Trump never asks, would you like a $15,000 EV Toyota.</p><p>Finally, Musk seems to have lost his desire to compete on either price or technology. He is more interested in robots and trips to mars and the fool’s mission of perfecting FSD without Lidar.</p><p><br/><strong>Would You Pay $15,000 for this Nice-Looking EV Toyota?</strong></p><p>On May 4, 2025, I asked <strong><a href=\"https://mishtalk.com/economics/would-you-pay-15000-for-this-nice-looking-ev-toyota-zoomers/\" target=\"_blank\">Would You Pay $15,000 for this Nice-Looking EV Toyota? Zoomers?</a></strong></p><blockquote><p>I am sure many would say yes, but there’s a catch.</p><p>But the Toyota bZ3X is real, and it is actually on sale starting at that price. <em>There is a catch: To buy one, you have to be in China.</em></p></blockquote><p>Now there is a second very inexpensive BYD model. It will have safety features suitable for Japan. You will not have to be in China to buy it.</p><p>Hello GM and Ford, I have a question. How do you ever expect to compete on price? And if you can’t, who will buy your cars outside the US?</p><p>Trump’s only answer is more tariffs to force those in the US to buy overpriced cars.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Money, Money Laundering, Seem, Euro Bills, Currency\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/05/31/20/13/money-5244058_960_720.jpg\" width=\"450\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/photos/money-money-laundering-seem-5244058/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em></p><p><br/>Thanks to easing energy base effects – what a snooze, I know – headline inflation in the eurozone has ticked back down from 2.2 to 2.1% again. The European Central Bank calls this ‘the good place’ that it's currently in, illustrating that boring times are the best times for central bankers. It made yesterday’s decision to hold rates quite straightforward, and today’s numbers emphasise that this was probably the right call. Eurozone inflation has moved within 0.2ppt of the 2% target since March, and we don’t expect it to deviate much for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Still, at the ECB press conference yesterday, President Christine Lagarde emphasised the concern around services inflation being persistently too high to balance out downside risks to inflation. Today’s data actually showed a further acceleration in services inflation, from 3.2 to 3.4%. The focus has been a bit more on downside risks to the inflation outlook in recent weeks, which could well push the inflation outlook lower. Today’s data stresses that the risks to the outlook do remain quite balanced, though, and resulted in a still-elevated core inflation rate at 2.4%.</p><p>Inflation is measured on a year-on-year basis, but the shorter-term developments do show a slight pickup of momentum in core inflation on the back of services prices. The three-month rate of core inflation is currently increasing to an annualised 2.7% rate. Then again, selling price expectations for services have eased further, which is a decent predictor of future price developments. For the months ahead, we do expect a further easing of the inflation rate, but not much below the 2% mark. The 'good place’ seems to be with us for some time to come.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/asia-week-ahead-rba-rate-decision-and-key-data-on-china-japan-korea-taiwan-and-philippines?post=532193\">Asia Week Ahead: RBA Rate Decision And Key Data On China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, And Philippines </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/fx-daily-dollar-squeezing-every-bit-of-powells-hawkishness?post=532173\">FX Daily: Dollar Squeezing Every Bit Of Powell’s Hawkishness </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/strong-japanese-industrial-output-and-accelerating-inflation-raise-chances-of-december-rate-hike?post=532152\">Strong Japanese Industrial Output And Accelerating Inflation Raise Chances Of December Rate Hike </a><br/></div>",

The trends are still mixed.  The US government remains shut down.  The weather is considered good for production here and in Brazil and Mexico.  Development conditions are good in Florida and in Brazil now with occasional showers in Florida and dry weather in Brazil.  The poor production potential for the crops comes from early dry weather but also the greening disease that has caused many Florida to lose trees.  Brazil production potential got hurt by cold and dry weather seen earlier in the year and dry weather now.</p><p>Chart Trends: Trends in FCOJ are down.  Support is at 170.00, 164.00, and 158.00 November, with resistance at 224.00, 237.00, and 247.00 November.</p><p><br/><strong>COFFEE</strong></p><p>General Comments: New York and London were higher yesterday on reports of some showers this week and as Lula said a deal with the Us on tariffs could be reached very quickly.  There are still reduced deliverable supplies for both exchanges, and the lack of deliverable stocks in both markets has supported the futures market.  Vietnam has seen too much rain.  Activity remained quiet in Vietnam on limited supplies as offers of fresh beans from the current harvest have yet to pick up.  U.S. and Brazilian officials held trade talks on Thursday that the two sides called positive and agreed to work to schedule a meeting between President Donald Trump and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva soon.  A revision of the 50% U.S. tariff on Brazilian imports, including coffee, could push arabica prices lower.  A bill has been introduced in the Senate to cut Brazil tariffs but is apposed by the administration.</p><p>Overnight News: The ICO average price is 321.95 ct/lb.</p><p>Chart Trends: Trends in New York are mixed.  Support is at 371.00, 360.00, and 350.00 December, and resistance is at 418.00, 424.00 and 430.00 December.  Trends in London are mixed to up.  Support is at 4240, 4150, and 4040 November, with resistance at 4670, 4870, and 4900 November.</p><p><br/><strong>SUGAR</strong></p><p>General Comments: New York and London were a little lower yesterday.  Trends are still down in both markets.  Ideas of good supplies for the market from good growing conditions for cane and beets around the world continue.  Production in Center-South Brazil has also been strong.  The outlook for cane crops in India and Thailand are in good condition with reports of good rains this year, while Brazilian cane continue to favor producing sugar over ethanol.  The prospect of a global surplus in the 2025/26 season was keeping the market on the defensive with a rise in production in India and Thailand set to increased supplies while global consumption is expected to remain steady.  India has just raised prices that mills must pay producers for Sugar, and Brazil prices are now below those for ethanol.  In Europe, MARS increased its sugar beet yield outlook to 76.3 t/ha for the current season, from 74.8 t/ha projected last month.</p><p>Chart Trends: Trends in New York are down.  Support is at 1400, 1370, and 1340 March and resistance is at 1520, 1540, and 1610 March.  Trends in London are mixed to down.  Support is at 409.00, 403.00, and 397.00 December, with resistance at 435.00, 441.00, and 449.00 December.</p><p><br/><strong>COCOA</strong></p><p>General Comments: New York and London closed mostly higher yesterday and trends are mixed to up.  Demand concerns in West Africa continue.  Bigger supplies are expected at West Africa ports soon as Ivory Coast has raised the farmgate price paid to farmers and they are expected to sell.  Ghana has also raised farmgate prices.  There are still reports of increased production potential in other countries outside of West Africa, including Asia and Central America.  The market feels that there is less demand and the lack of demand is expected to continue.  Cocoa arrivals were down 24.9% from last year this week.  Malaysia and the US have apparently agreed to allow Malaysian Cocoa into the US with 0 tariffs.</p><p>Chart Trends:  Trends in New York are up.  Support is at 5690, 5600, and 5540 December, with resistance at 6480, 6680, and 6870 December.  Trends in London are mixed.  Support is at 4200, 4010, and 3920 December, with resistance at 4700, 4870, and 4970 December.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/grains-report-thursday-oct-30?post=532003\">Grains Report - Thursday, Oct. 30</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/softs-report-wednesday-oct-29?post=531435\">Softs Report - Wednesday, Oct. 29</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/grains-report-tuesday-oct-28?post=531127\">Grains Report - Tuesday, Oct. 28</a></p></div>",

The much ballyhooed US-China Trade Deal that has been bantered about for some time looks to become reality tonight – despite weeks of doubt &amp; negative rhetoric! Already, China has bought some small shipments of beans – the first of the season! But the amount China buys from the US is in question – as the mkt has rallied substantially in the past weeks when news of the deal first leaked out! Plus US beans are over South American beans currently! But a deal is certainly really good news for a mkt starved for a continuation of Chinese buying! With harvest well past the half-way point &amp; technical confirmation clearly s<strong>hown</strong> on the above charts, harvest lows are in at the current low historical levels – plus non-China demand for our beans has been strong!</p><p><br/><strong>DEC CORN</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"408\" src=\"https://blog.pricegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_6904d51988bfe.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Despite the fact that the US-China trade deal mostly involves beans, Dec corn was the beneficiary of spillover support – rallying to 4 month highs today! Support also surfaced from a reported grain deal with South Korea! Corn exports are already running 50% over last year -as well, ethanol demand is rising due to rallying energy prices – finally the Fed should be lowering interest rates today – the 2<sup>nd</sup> drop this year – which will apply downward pressure on the US Dollar! Corn is historically cheap – still the lowest on the global mkt!</p><p><br/><strong>DEC WHT</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"408\" src=\"https://blog.pricegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_6904d55a4dc55.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Dec Wht was also the welcome beneficiary of spillover support from the US-China trade deal – plus it’s cheap enough on the world mkt to attract demand! As a result, it has an impressive technical formation – gaping higher this week &amp; closing above congestion today at a one-month high!</p><p><br/><strong>MAR FDR</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"408\" src=\"https://blog.pricegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_6904d58023b2c.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>In mid-Oct, President Trump announced he had “plan” to lower the record-high beef prices – and indeed, the mkt took him to heart as Mar Fdrs have plummeted an amazing $60 since then! It turns out his “plan” mostly involves increasing imports from Arg &amp; Brazil by lowering tariffs &amp; opening the US-Mexican border – previously closed due to screw-worm! But now, the mkt has over done it – becoming extremely oversold &amp; today has rallied sharply! Trump’s plan effectively put a top in the Cat Mkt – but the break in prices should attract some solid demand!</p><p><br/><strong>DEC HOGS</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"408\" src=\"https://blog.pricegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_6904d5b96daaa.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Dec Hogs have steadily ground lower during Oct – due to down seasonals &amp; lackluster demand – but have remained relatively steady lately while cat prices plummeted! This bullish divergence seems to indicate that they will retake over the upside leadership of the meats – they of course already have an big economic advantage in the supermarket for the cash-strapped consumer!</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/agmaster-report-thursday-oct-16?post=528904\">AgMaster Report - Thursday, Oct. 16</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/agmaster-report-friday-oct-3?post=526292\">AgMaster Report - Friday, Oct. 3</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/agmaster-report-wednesday-sep-24?post=524608\">AgMaster Report - Wednesday, Sep. 24</a></p></div>",

Despite the <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed\">Federal Reserve</a> (Fed) delivering a widely anticipated interest rate cut <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar\">this week</a> and the Dow posting a new all-time high just north of 48,000, equity markets remain overall unimpressed. Bullish momentum has been thin throughout the week, with disappointment at the Fed’s cautious rate-cutting tone offset by hopes that the latest reignition in trade tensions between the US and China will be tamped down by the Trump administration’s general unwillingness to follow through on its own threats.</p><p>AI spend continues to be both the golden goose and Achilles' heel of the ongoing tech rally. Key tech giants posted strong earnings on the back of eternally growing demand for hardware architecture to meet the bottomless demand for hardware and storage solutions for learning models. However, a notable lack of profit generation at the actual point of contact between AI solution providers and the general market remains worryingly unmovable.</p><h2><br/>AI costs continue to rise, good news for the sellers of shovels</h2><p>Amazon (AMZN) saw a strong Friday rally that single-handedly lifted key indexes into the green for the day, rising after noting a 20% increase in its cloud computing unit’s revenue during the third quarter. On the other side of the same coin, Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) saw some declines through Friday’s American market session after softly revealing that its expenses in the LLM space have ballooned to tens of billions of dollars, with functionally no revenue to show for its continued investment in playing catchup to other, more established competitors who remain as equally unprofitable net of spiraling investment costs.</p><p>The recent flare-up of trade tensions between the US and China appears to have abated for the time being. While nothing is official and no paperwork currently exists, a common trade strategy for the Trump administration, talks between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping appear to have been at least hypothetically successful, with both sides agreeing to cool down recent protectionist threats for a one-year grace period. China has yet to actually remove any of the trade restrictions it recently imposed or make purchases of US agricultural products at the scale it promised to. In exchange, Donald Trump has promised not to impose new tariffs and trade restrictions that have not yet taken effect. How the trade truce will unfold remains to be seen.</p><h2><br/>Dow Jones daily chart</h2><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"392\" src=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feditorial.fxsstatic.com%2Fmiscelaneous%2Fimage-1761936225121-1761936225122.png&amp;w=1536&amp;q=95\" width=\"700\"/></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/gbpusd-tests-six-months-lows-as-pound-sterling-continues-to-sink?post=532044\">GBP/USD Tests Six Months Lows As Pound Sterling Continues To Sink </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/gbpusd-resumes-bearish-ways-as-fed-rate-cut-bolsters-greenback?post=531550\">GBP/USD Resumes Bearish Ways As Fed Rate Cut Bolsters Greenback </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/dow-jones-industrial-average-retreats-after-feds-powell-reconsiders-third-rate-cut?post=531531\">Dow Jones Industrial Average Retreats After Fed’s Powell Reconsiders Third Rate Cut </a></p></div>",

The expected move for next week is still 105 points.</p><p>That combination should terrify you.</p><p>I recorded this breakdown Friday afternoon because the volatility stayed elevated with markets up. That rarely happens. When it does, experienced traders get uncomfortable heading into the weekend.</p><p>Here's what most people missed while celebrating tech earnings:</p><p>The materials sector (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/XLB\">XLB</a>) moved nearly three standard deviations to the downside. That's between 2.5 and 2.8 standard deviations outside its expected move. </p><p>The Russell 2000 hit the lower edge of its expected move. Utilities broke below theirs. Healthcare touched the bottom. Financials did the same.</p><p>Only two sectors held the entire market together. Semiconductors (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/SMH\">SMH</a>) and technology (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/XLK\">XLK</a>) both broke above their upper expected moves. But strip those out and you're looking at Nvidia, Google, Amazon, and Tesla carrying everything. </p><p>Amazon hit a two standard deviation move on earnings. Its expected move was $15. It hit $30 this morning before pulling back.</p><p>The concentration is extreme. Four names are masking broad market weakness.</p><p>Now here's where it gets dangerous. The market rallied this week. The Fed already cut rates. </p><p>We're past the biggest earnings week. Next week has no Fed announcement. No Amazon, Google, Microsoft, or Apple earnings to anticipate.</p><p>The expected move should be contracting. Instead it's sitting at 105 to 107 points. Volatility refuses to crush back down even though the obvious catalysts are gone.</p><p>The market sees something coming.</p><p>I closed three trades this week while this played out:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/XLU\">XLU</a> position closed for 55% profit</li><li><a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/SPY\">SPY</a> in-out spread closed in two days for 30%</li><li>Microsoft earnings flip closed for 297%</li><li>Google earnings flip closed for 203%</li></ul><p>I executed the Microsoft and Google trades live on Wednesday. Anyone could watch. Two out of three hit. The third went worthless but only cost 63 cents.</p><p>But those winning trades don't change what's happening underneath this market. The S&amp;P is up. Most sectors got destroyed. Volatility stayed high. That's a recipe for serious trouble.</p><p>The 30,000-foot view matters more than celebrating today's 40-handle rally. Markets don't crash from all-time highs. But you need to pay attention to what's moving beneath the surface right now.</p><p>Define your risk. Keep it under control.

In short, <strong>my</strong> <a href=\"https://www.goldpriceforecast.com/gold-price-analysis/gold-price-forecast-for-november-2025/\"><strong>gold price forecast for November 2025</strong></a> <strong>remains up-to-date.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Gold Price’s Powerful Monthly Reversal - Image 1\" src=\"https://articlemedia.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2025/10/31/4243/gold-prices-powerful-gold-price-1.webp\"/></p><p><br/>Gold, silver, and miners moved lower today, and miners are leading the way. Taking a closer look at the most recent upswing reveals that miners were the first to move higher, and silver caught up. This is typical for movement in the precious metals sector, and since <a href=\"https://www.goldpriceforecast.com/gold-trading-tips\">silver has already caught up</a>, it seems that the declines can now continue.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Gold Price’s Powerful Monthly Reversal - Image 2\" src=\"https://articlemedia.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2025/10/31/4243/gold-prices-powerful-gold-price-2.webp\"/></p><p><br/>The USD Index is moving higher slowly but surely. It started to move higher after the Fed cut rates – just like it did in September. Back then, it rallied for a few weeks, so it looks like this short-term upswing has only begun.</p><p>But… That’s not even the point. The point is that the USD Index declined severely since April while it should have moved higher given the tariff announcements and then their implementation. Instead, the sentiment kept worsening until it moved to the extreme. Remember my Peak Chaos theory? That the markets already discounted the max amount of chaos and that now they are going to reverse? I wrote about that too early with regard to the precious metals market, but it worked like a charm for the USD Index.</p><p>Anyway, just like I wrote yesterday – when the rally in the USD Index finally becomes obvious to everyone, the PMs can truly slide.

What indicators do we have for the state of the macroeconomy? Here’s one: delinquincies on auto loans (for pools of asset backed securities).</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://econbrowser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fitch_autodelinq_abs_sep25a.png\" width=\"663\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/structured-finance/abs/auto-indices#u.s.-auto-indices\">Fitch</a>, accessed 10/31/2025.</em></p><p><br/>Auto loan delinquencies (60+ days) on pools of loans in subprime ABS have surged to 6.5% in September. Since there appears to be seasonality, it’s useful to compare against September 2024: 6.12%. (Delinquency rates for the prime ABS pool is relatively unchanged over the year, at 0.37%).</p><p>The ABS deliquency rate is much higher than at any period of the 2007-09 recession, and higher than on the eve of the Covid recession, arguably when the economy was slowing drastically.</p><p>The annualized net loss (ANL) index is slightly down, 9.41 vs. 9.79 in September of 2024. This index is partly supported by the increase in used car prices, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/rising-auto-loan-delinquencies-and-high-monthly-payments-20240926.html?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">Manheim Index</a>, which has risen from 202.96 to 207.03, or 2%, over the corresponding period.</p><p>Is the delinquency rate of use in predicting an incipient recession? If the characteristics of the loans were constant, perhaps so. However, as <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/rising-auto-loan-delinquencies-and-high-monthly-payments-20240926.html?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">Adams et al. (2024)</a> point out, the post-Covid loans were of larger size than for previous origination years, and this factor appears to be an important factor in delinquencies. Hence, I would be wary of extrapolating from previous episodes the predictive power of the delinquency rate, at least in levels.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/aca-premiums-without-extension-of-expanded-tax-credit?post=532033\">ACA Premiums Without Extension Of Expanded Tax Credit </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/trump-china-to-buy-a-tremendous-amount-of-soybeans?post=531998\">Trump: China To Buy A “Tremendous” Amount Of Soybeans </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/everyday-prices-up-22-since-jan-2025?post=531492\">Everyday Prices Up 2.2% Since Jan. 2025 </a></p></div>",

Record-high cocoa prices are squeezing margins and threatening to push candy prices higher, even as companies like Mondelez and Hershey navigate shifting consumer behavior and input cost volatility. While some players are signaling resilience through revenue growth and strong StarMine model scores, analysts remain cautious on earnings surprises.</p><p>At the same time, retailers are leaning on aggressive discounting strategies to spur demand for costumes and décor. The discount penetration for costumes and accessories has surged to 83%, with average discounts at 36%, the highest since pre-pandemic levels, suggesting aggressive promotional strategies to drive demand.</p><h3><br/><strong>Trick or treat</strong></h3><p>Consumers may be spooked by higher chocolate prices this Halloween as record cocoa costs continue to pressure margins. Rising input costs are likely to translate into higher prices for smaller-sized Halloween candy bars.</p><p>Mondelez International, with brands such as Sour Patch Kids and Cadbury, just beat third-quarter earnings and revenue estimates despite the impact of cocoa cost inflation. CEO Dirk Van de Put noted: “Although we anticipate challenging conditions to continue in some markets, we are encouraged by recent moderation in cocoa prices, as well as promising signs for a strong cocoa crop this fall.” (Source: Mondelez International Q3 2025 Earnings Release)</p><p>The company is on track to deliver 13.4% earnings growth and 8.2% revenue growth in Q4 2025, which includes the Halloween season (Exhibit 1).</p><p><strong>Exhibit 1: Mondelez Revenue and Earnings Results/Estimates: 2019 – 2025</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"82\" src=\"https://lipperalpha.refinitiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture1-2.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: LSEG I/B/E/S data</em></p><p><br/>However, analysts surveyed by LSEG remain cautious.

CEO Kirk Tanner also cautioned that the Halloween shopping season has started slower than expected, citing unseasonably warm weather and delayed purchases as the holiday falls on a Friday.</p><p>Despite these headwinds, Hershey remains on track to deliver its third consecutive quarter of positive revenue growth, including Halloween-related sales in Q4 2025 (Exhibit 3). However, elevated input costs, softness in Mexico and weaker Halloween performance are expected to weigh on profitability, with earnings projected to decline 41.4% for the quarter.</p><p><br/><strong>Exhibit 3: Hershey Revenue and Earnings Results/Estimates: 2019 – 2025</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"83\" src=\"https://lipperalpha.refinitiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture3-1.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: LSEG I/B/E/S data</em></p><p>Hershey ranks in the top quartile across several StarMine models, including Earnings Quality, Smart Holdings, and Analyst Revisions.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"316\" src=\"https://talkmarkets.com/user_content/ckimages/orig_33756576485_224a26afe9_c.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source:</em> <a href=\"https://www.gotcredit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.gotcredit.com</a><em> via <a href=\"https://flickr.com/photos/gotcredit/33756576485\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr</a></em></p><p><br/>In an industry where IPOs are typically driven by funding gaps, investor pressure, or fast-moving acquisitions, Nexus International is scripting a different story. The company’s plan to go public in March 2027 doesn’t hinge on raising capital; it’s about upgrading infrastructure. </p><p>With $847.9 million in revenue already booked by Q3 2025 and on track for $1 billion by year’s end, Nexus is proving that scale and sustainability can be achieved long before listing.</p><h2><br/>Nexus International’s revenue benchmarks and IPO plans</h2><p>Nexus’s Founder and CEO Gurhan Kiziloz has confirmed that the IPO will move forward only once the company hits $5 billion in annual revenue. But that threshold is more than just a number; it’s a filtering mechanism. It signals to markets that Nexus will enter the public sphere from a position of operational maturity and financial strength, not speculation or future projections.</p><p>Nexus International’s growth has unfolded without external capital, without venture dilution, and without noise. Its expansion has been fueled by reinvested earnings across three distinct brands, Spartans.com, Megaposta, and Lanistar, each tailored to specific market needs and compliance regimes. The result is a gaming operator already among the Top 100 worldwide, built entirely from within.</p><p>For Kiziloz, that independence is strategic. “We’re not listing to raise money. We’re listing because we’ve outgrown the advantages of being private,” he has explained in internal communications. That means the IPO is not an endpoint; it’s an evolution of Nexus’s operating structure to better support its expanding partnerships, global regulatory compliance, and long-term accountability.</p><h2><br/>Public listing for evolution, not expansion</h2><p>Going public will not mark the start of Nexus’s global push; it will simply make its infrastructure more transparent, auditable, and partnership-ready. In markets such as Latin America, Southeast Asia, and parts of Europe, being a publicly listed company can fast-track licensing, enable deeper payment integrations, and enhance brand credibility with institutions and regulators.</p><p>Rather than change the way Nexus operates, the IPO is expected to formalize it. The company already tracks metrics, growth, and treasury management with the discipline of a listed entity. The transition to public markets will simply add layers of governance without stripping away control. Gurhan Kiziloz will remain at the helm, preserving the founder-led agility that has made Nexus one of the gaming sector’s breakout performers.</p><p>Setting the $5B bar serves multiple purposes. First, it creates a timing filter that prevents Nexus from rushing into the public spotlight under pressure. Second, it protects the company’s valuation story; markets will be reacting to performance, not promises. Finally, it places Nexus among the upper tier of gaming companies by the time of listing, ensuring that its IPO is not just viable, but competitive with major names in the space.</p><p>Reaching $5 billion also means Nexus will likely enter the public markets with positive cash flow, diversified brand exposure, proven international presence, and a licensing footprint that spans traditional and crypto-friendly jurisdictions.</p><p>Few gaming companies today can claim this trajectory: bootstrapped origins, multi-brand global presence, near-billion-dollar earnings, and a path to IPO with the founder still fully in control. In a space dominated by acquisitions, VC backing, and rapid consolidation, Nexus stands out for its execution-first discipline.</p><p>Kiziloz has opted for a long-game strategy, prioritizing structure over speed and substance over headlines. It’s a bet that’s already paying off, and if the $5B IPO plan holds, Nexus International will be one of the few operators to go public without ever needing to go external.</p><h2><br/>The 2027 IPO as a statement of maturity</h2><p>The planned March 2027 IPO isn’t just a milestone for Nexus, it’s a statement. It signals that scale, credibility, and institutional readiness don’t have to come at the cost of independence. </p><p>With $847.9 million in revenue already earned this year and brand momentum across Spartans.com and Megaposta accelerating, the company isn’t preparing to go public to find its future. It’s doing it because its future has already been built, and the infrastructure just needs to catch up.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/microsoft-stock-sinks-on-ai-spending?post=532007\">Microsoft Stock Sinks On AI Spending? </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/one-of-the-best-ai-stocks-just-got-better-after-blowout-earnings?post=531538\">One Of The Best AI Stocks Just Got Better After Blowout Earnings</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/ai-bubble-ark-invests-cathie-wood-weighs-in?post=531157\">AI Bubble?

After a remarkable nine-day winning streak, the index is set to end the day on a disappointing note. With no fresh economic data or earnings reports to energise the market, investors are adopting a cautious stance. Many are trimming their positions, wary of potential pitfalls ahead. The atmosphere is tense, as traders reassess their strategies amidst growing uncertainty. Market sentiment is decidedly jittery, and all eyes are on upcoming developments that could shift the tides. Will new economic indicators or corporate earnings reports provide the spark needed to revive confidence? Only time will tell, but for now, the FTSE 100 is feeling the pressure.</p><p>The Bank of England's November rate decision could be compelling for markets, as it may end the trend of quarterly cuts, but the outcome appears finely balanced. Gilt yields and the value of sterling have decreased following indications that UK inflation may have peaked. Additionally, speculation around the budget is intensifying, with rumours of more significant downgrades from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) regarding productivity. Meanwhile, delays in US data have shifted attention to the upcoming ADP and ISM releases for insights into the labour market.</p><p>Data from the Nationwide Building Society revealed that UK house prices rose at a slower rate in October as buyers became more cautious ahead of the budget announcement. The monthly increase in house prices was 0.3% in October, down from a 0.5% rise the previous month, according to the report. However, this figure exceeded the expectation of no growth. Year-over-year, house price growth unexpectedly quickened to 2.4%, up from 2.2% in September, surpassing economists' predictions of a 2.3% annual increase.</p><p>In the latest updates from UK businesses, TT Electronics Plc has turned down three unsolicited takeover bids from private equity firm DBAY Advisors in the past three months. The most recent offer from DBAY valued the company at 130 pence per share. However, on Friday, the British company announced its preference for a higher bid of 155 pence per share from Swiss-based Cicor Technologies, which was revealed just a day earlier. Cicor's proposal comes with a 19% premium over DBAY’s latest offer, making it the more attractive option.</p><p>Meanwhile, Moonpig Group has named Catherine Faiers as its new Chief Executive Officer. Faiers, currently serving as Chief Operating Officer at Auto Trader, will take the reins of the online greeting card and gift retailer after Nickyl Raithatha steps down from the role. Moonpig had previously announced in June that Raithatha would be departing as CEO, paving the way for Faiers to lead the company’s next chapter.</p><p><br/><strong>Technical &amp; Trade View</strong></p><p>FTSE Bias: Bullish Above Bearish below 9704</p><ul><li>Primary support 9500</li><li>Below 9600 opens 9500</li><li>Primary objective 9873</li><li>Daily VWAP Bullish</li><li>Weekly VWAP Bullish</li></ul><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"> </p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/daily-market-outlook-friday-oct-31?post=532174\">Daily Market Outlook - Friday, Oct. 31</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/the-ftse-finish-line-thursday-oct-30?post=532004\">The FTSE Finish Line - Thursday, Oct. 30</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/daily-market-outlook-thursday-oct-30?post=531756\">Daily Market Outlook - Thursday, Oct. 30</a><br/></div>",

Jessica Chan, Head of Content and Publisher Partnerships at Perplexity, emphasized that attribution and accuracy are fundamental to how people should understand information in the age of AI. The partnership will implement enhanced image display features, including image credits with links to sources, to better educate users on legal imagery usage. This approach addresses growing concerns about AI platforms using copyrighted content without proper compensation or attribution to original creators.</p><p>The strategic significance extends beyond immediate revenue, positioning Getty Images as a leader in establishing ethical AI content partnerships. With Perplexity answering over 150 million questions globally each week, the exposure for Getty’s content and contributors could be substantial. The agreement demonstrates how traditional content companies can successfully monetize their assets in the AI era while maintaining creator rights and attribution standards.</p><h3><br/><strong>Shares Spike on Heavy Volume as Investors React to AI Collaboration</strong></h3><p>As of 11:30 AM EDT on October 31, 2025, Getty Images stock was trading at $2.2799, up $0.2699 or 13.43% from the previous close of $2.01. The stock opened at $3.06 and experienced significant volatility throughout the day, with a trading range between $2.20 and $3.21. Trading volume exploded to 104.8 million shares, dramatically exceeding the average volume of 667,871 shares. The market capitalization stood at approximately $950.4 million following the announcement.</p><p>Despite today’s surge, Getty Images has faced challenges over longer time periods. The stock has declined 44.79% over the past year and 76.69% over five years, significantly underperforming the <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/investing/spx-vs-spy/\">S&amp;P 500’s</a> gains of 20.38% and 110.04% respectively. The company currently trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 0.91 and maintains a 52-week range between $1.25 and $4.485. Analysts maintain an average price target of $4.43, suggesting potential upside from current levels.</p><p>The company’s financial fundamentals reflect ongoing challenges, with a negative profit margin of 12.19% and diluted <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/investing/how-to-value-a-stock/\">earnings per share</a> of -$0.27. However, Getty Images generated $946.83 million in revenue over the trailing twelve months and posted positive levered free cash flow of $96.59 million. The upcoming Q3 2025 earnings report scheduled for November 10, 2025, will provide further insight into the company’s financial trajectory and the potential impact of strategic partnerships like the Perplexity deal.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/chevron-reports-mixed-q3-2025-results-earnings-beat-but-revenue-misses?post=532290\">Chevron Reports Mixed Q3 2025 Results, Earnings Beat But Revenue Misses</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/exxonmobil-delivers-solid-q3-2025-results?post=532229\">ExxonMobil Delivers Solid Q3 2025 Results</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/the-ai-arms-dealer-nvidias-path-to-5-trillion-and-beyond?post=531990\">The AI Arms Dealer: Nvidia’s Path To $5 Trillion And Beyond</a><br/></div>",

The company returned to profitability and the strong results helped drive the stock 6% up in the after-hours trading session.</p><h3><br/><strong>Intel’s Financials</strong></h3><p>For the quarter, revenues grew 3% over the year to $13.65 billion, ahead of the market’s estimates of $13.14 billion. It ended the quarter with an adjusted EPS of $0.23. Intel recorded a per-share loss of 37 cents in the quarter to account for shares in escrow that will be released to the U.S. government as part of its investment.</p><p>By segment, Intel’s Client Computing Group, which is primarily comprised of sales of central processors for PCs, saw revenues grow 3% to $8.5 billion. Revenue in the Data Center Group, which includes some AI chips, fell 1% to $4.1 billion. Foundry revenues were down 2% to $4.2 billion. Other revenues grew 3% to $1.0 billion.</p><p>For the current quarter, Intel expects revenues of $12.8-$13.8 billion, with the mid-point ahead of the market estimates of $13.37 billion. It expects to earn $0.08 per share for the quarter in line with the market estimates.</p><h3><br/><strong>Intel’s AI Focus</strong></h3><p>These have been interesting few months for Intel. Besides the U.S. government announcing its $8.9 billion investment and the $5 billion that it received from Nvidia, Softbank invested $2 billion and it sold its stake in chipmaker Altera for $5.2 billion.</p><p>Intel is focused on leveraging its latest tie-up with Nvidia to accelerate its AI push. Its core x86 franchise is playing a critical role in its AI strategy. x86 is well-positioned to power the hybrid compute environment that AI workloads demand. The collaboration with Nvidia is helping Intel create a new class of products spanning multiple generations that accelerate the adoption of AI for the hyperscale, enterprise, and consumer markets. By integrating architectures through Nvidia NVLink, Intel will combine Intel CPU and x86 leadership with Nvidia’s AI and computing strengths to offer solutions that can deliver better customer experiences.</p><p>Intel realizes the need for a focused effort on the initiative, and recently created a central engineering group that will unify its horizontal engineering functions to drive leverage across foundational IP development, test chip design, EDA tools, and design platforms. The group will also lead the build-out of a new ASIC and design service business to deliver purpose-built silicon for external customers. This will extend the reach of core x86 IP but also leverage design strengths to deliver solutions from general-purpose to fixed-function computing.</p><p>Earlier this month, Intel announced that its fabrication plant in Chandler, Arizona, known as Fab 52, is now operational. Codenamed Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest, these SKUs will begin shipping late this year. If successful, these new CPUs will put Intel’s chipmaking capabilities in direct competition with TSMC. Intel is yet to disclose the expected yields from Fab 52. Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest are expected to also help Intel solidify its position in the notebook segment across both consumer and enterprise. Intel will still need to secure a large customer for its foundry chips to accelerate margins.</p><p>For its AI accelerator strategy, Intel is focused on developing compute platforms for emerging inference workloads driven by agentic AI and physical AI. In the shorter term, it will deliver AI capabilities through Xeon, AI PCs, ARC GPUs, and its open software stack. In the longer run, it plans to launch generations of inference-optimized GPUs on an annual cadence that will offer enhanced memory and bandwidth to meet enterprise needs.</p><p>Intel’s stock has climbed over 90% since the Trump government announced its plans earlier this summer. Its stock is trading at $40.16 with a market cap of $191.40 billion. It hit a 52-week high of $42.47 earlier this week. The stock has climbed from the 52-week low of $17.67 that it was trading at in April this year.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/cloud-stocks-microsoft-and-openai-resolve-partnership-woes-agi-timeline-3-8-years?post=531997\">Cloud Stocks: Microsoft And OpenAI Resolve Partnership Woes; AGI Timeline 3-8 Years</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/cloud-socks-analysis-of-ibms-cognitus-acquisition?post=530304\">Cloud Socks: Analysis Of IBM’s Cognitus Acquisition</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/netflix-continues-to-monetize-beyond-streaming?post=529815\">Netflix Continues To Monetize Beyond Streaming </a><br/></div>",

Despite the modest recovery, Crude Oil prices remain on track for their third consecutive monthly decline as persistent oversupply concerns limit upside potential ahead of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) meeting on Sunday.</p><p>According to recent reports relayed by Reuters, eight OPEC+ members are preparing to increase output by a combined 137,000 barrels per day (bpd) in December as part of their effort to regain lost market share. In addition, Saudi Arabia’s exports reached a six-month high of 6.41 million barrels per day in August, while the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that the United States (US) Crude output climbed to a record 13.6 million barrels per day last week.</p><p>These developments have largely offset the potential bullish impact of Washington’s new sanctions on major Russian Oil producers. Traders report that Indian Oil Corp recently purchased five cargoes of Russian Oil for December delivery from non-sanctioned suppliers, signaling continued resilience in Russian exports despite Western pressure.</p><p>On the geopolitical front, the announcement by US President Donald Trump that China agreed to purchase American energy, including future Oil and Gas shipments from Alaska, has lent limited support to sentiment.

Analysts had been expecting around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN/earnings\" target=\"_blank\">$177.76 billion</a> in quarterly sales, according to Seeking Alpha, but it came in at $180.17 billion, up 13% YoY.</p><p>Moreover, its trailing 12-month (TTM) operating cash flow (OCF) remained strong, with 16% Y/Y growth, and its TTM OCF margin on revenue was 19%. That implies its future value could be higher.

That means that, based on the TTM revenue of<a href=\"https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/amzn/financials/?p=trailing\" target=\"_blank\"> $691.33 billion</a>, from Stock Analysis data, its FCF margin was 2.139%.</p><p>This is because Amazon is continuing to spend heavily on capex related to AI-driven projects, such as data centers.</p><p>For example, in the capex has risen from $102.953 billion last quarter (over the trailing 12-month period) to $115.9 billion in Q3 (again on a TTM basis). That's a huge +12.6% gain in spending in one quarter (over the last 12 months).</p><p>Amazon believes this spending of its operating cash flow will eventually pay off. Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/31/amazon-amzn-stock-earnings-revenue-ai-cloud.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC reported </a>that some analysts are bullish on Amazon's AWS (data centers) segment.</p><p>This is driven by Amazon's higher revenue and operating margins. For example, its Q3 TTM OCF of $130.691 billion, representing 18.9% of TTM sales, was higher than Q2's 18.1% TTM margin. This higher margin growth can be seen in the table from <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf#page=10\" target=\"_blank\">page 10 of Amazon's Q3 release</a> below (and my analysis of the OCF and FCF margins):</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://barchart-news-media-prod.aws.barchart.com/EXCLSV/803b75e5897586f4c189f8ef6eee7a5d/ktqw1ty12l7i3fux.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf#page=10\" target=\"_blank\">AMZN Q3 earninjgs release - page 10 - and Hake margin analysis - Oct. 30, 2025</a></p><p><br/>It shows that even though the operating cash flow margins have been rising each quarter, the FCF margins are lower consecutively as a result of accelerating capex spending. In fact, the company said it expects 2025 capex will rise even further to $125 billion, up from $116 billion on a TTM basis in Q3.</p><p>The reason is Amazon told investors, according <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/amazon-amzn-q3-earnings-report-2025-553e6d16#phrase-company\" target=\"_blank\">to the WSJ</a>, that demand for its cloud and AI products has “outpaced its ability to bring new data centers online.” Until that demand cools off, it's likely to continue to amp up its capital spending. That will depress its FCF margins in the near term.</p><p>But as long as its OCF margins stay strong - and they should as the capex spending pays off over time - the stock could continue to improve.</p><h2><br/><strong>Forecasting Operating Cash Flow and a Price Target</strong></h2><p>For example, let's use analysts' forecasts of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN/earnings\" target=\"_blank\">$785.38 billion</a> in revenue next year, and assume Amazon's OCF margin rises from 18.9% to <strong>20.79%</strong> FCF margin (i.e., up 10%):</p><p> $785.38 x 0.2079 = <strong>$163.28 billion</strong> operating cash flow</p><p>That would be $47.4 billion higher than its Q3 TTM cash flow of $115.9 billion, or an increase of +40.9%.</p><p>Moreover, assuming that Amazon spends $130 billion on capex next year, its FCF could rise to over $33 billion:</p><p>$163.28 - $130 b capex = <strong>$33.28 billion</strong> FCF</p><p>Assuming that the market gives AMZN stock a 1.0% FCF yield, even though its TTM FCF yield is about half that at 0.56% (i.e., $14.788b/$2,631 billion):</p><p>$33.28 billion / 0.01 = <strong>$3,328 billion</strong> market value</p><p>That is 26.5% higher than today's market value of $2,631 billion.</p><p>In other words, AMZN stock could be worth 26.5% higher than today's price of $246.24, or <strong>$311.50</strong> per share.</p><h2><br/><strong>Analysts See Higher Price Targets for AMZN</strong></h2><p>Some analysts have begun raising their price targets for AMZN stock. For example, the average of 67 analysts' price targets surveyed by Yahoo! Finance is now <strong>$280.77</strong> per share.</p><p>Moreover, Barchart's survey shows a mean price of <a href=\"https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AMZN/analyst-ratings\" target=\"_blank\">$268.84,</a> and AnaChart's survey of 41 analysts is <a href=\"https://anachart.com/ticker/amzn/\" target=\"_blank\">$260.94</a>.</p><p>The bottom line is that even after today's jump in AMZN stock, its value could be higher over the coming year. This could be due to higher demand for its cloud and AI products.</p><p>One way to play this for value investors is to set a lower buy-in price by selling short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options.</p><h2><br/><strong>Shorting OTM Puts for a Lower Potential Buy-In</strong></h2><p>For example, the <a href=\"https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AMZN/options?expiration=2025-11-28-w\" target=\"_blank\">Nov. 28 expiry</a> period shows that the $235.00 put option contract has a midpoint premium of $3.20.</p><p>That works out to an immediate short-selling put yield of <strong>1.36%</strong> (i.e., $3.20/$135.00). This is for an exercise price that is $10 lower, or -4.43% below the trading price.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"378\" src=\"https://barchart-news-media-prod.aws.barchart.com/EXCLSV/803b75e5897586f4c189f8ef6eee7a5d/t6wnbw0ubiiqpfjb.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AMZN/options?expiration=2025-11-28-w\" target=\"_blank\">AMZN puts expiring 11/28/25 - as of Oct. 31, 2025</a></p><p><br/>Moreover, it provides a potentially lower all-in buying point, after including the income received:</p><p>$235.00 - $3.20 = $231.80 breakeven point</p><p>That is 5.73% below today's price. The point is that a patient investor can collect the 1.36% yield while waiting for AMZN to fall 4.4% to set a 5.73% lower buy-in point.</p><p>That also could potentially provide better upside:</p><p>$311.50 / $231.80 breakeven -1 = 0.3438 = +34.38% upside</p><p>The bottom line is that AMZN stock still looks cheap, and shorting OTM puts is an attractive way to play it.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/options/huge-unusual-options-activity-in-nokia-after-nvidia-takes-1-billion-stake?post=531530\">Huge, Unusual Options Activity In Nokia After Nvidia Takes $1 Billion Stake</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/options/ibm-raises-its-fcf-outlook-for-2025-ibm-stock-could-be-undervalued?post=531133\">IBM Raises Its FCF Outlook For 2025 - IBM Stock Could Be Undervalued</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/options/lam-research-corps-strong-fcf-margins-from-ai-related-chip-equipment-sales-shows-lrcx-stock-is-cheap?post=530811\">Lam Research Corp's Strong FCF Margins From AI-Related Chip Equipment Sales Shows LRCX Stock Is Cheap</a><br/></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p>We kicked off the day with Employment Costs – Benefits QoQ, Employment Costa – Wages QoQ, Employment Costs Index QoQ, PCE Price Index MoM &amp; YoY, Core PCE Price Index MoM &amp; YoY,Personal Income MoM, and Personal Spending MoM at 7:30 A.M., Fed Logan Speech at 8:30 A.M., Chicago PMI at 8:45 A.M., Fed Bostic &amp; Fed Hammack Speech at 11:00 A.M., and Baker Hughes Oil &amp; Total Rigs Count at 12:00 P.M.</p><p>The report from the EIA released on Thursday showed that in 2024, US biofuels production capacity growth slowed sharply during 2024, rising only 3% from early 2024 to Jan 2025. The main drag was in renewable diesel and other biofuels – such as SAF and renewable propane – where capacity increased by just 391 million gallons per year, a fraction of the gains in prior years. Most growth came from two California projects: Phillips 66’s Rodeo refinery conversion (now 767 Mil Gal/year) and a new 138 Mil Gal/Year Bakersfield plant by Renewable Fuels LLC. Several facility closures partly offset those gains. The slowdown reflects weak biofuel margins and a lack of forward EPA policy visibility. RVO and SRE decisions by the EPA could be put off until 2026. Ethanol production capacity, however, expanded modestly – mainly in the Midwest – reaching 18.5 Bil Gal annually and now comprising about 73% of total US biofuel capacity. With domestic demand stabilizing, most of the additional ethanol output will be directed towards exports.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"green grass\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1565522734001-f00e62ec8424?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" width=\"450\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><small><em>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@waldemarbrandt67w?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\">Waldemar</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/nCQXxsSg3oo?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></em></small></p><p><br/><strong>US Weather Pattern Update</strong></p><p>Extreme Drought Present in IL, IN &amp; OH; Soil Moisture Improved Elsewhere:</p><p>On balance, the coverage of Central US drought continues to erode. Recent soaking rainfall has nearly eliminated drought from the Delta region, TN, and southern MI. Extreme/exceptional drought remains in place across pockets of E Midwest, but moisture improvement is expected in OH/PA over the next 48 hours. The change in drought coverage/intensity over the last 12 months is striking, particularly with respect to moisture available to winter wheat. ARC notes drought in late October 2024 covered 72-85% of Southern Plains, but today only covers 4-12% of TX, OK, and KS. The primary concern heading into late autumn/winter are negative soil moisture anomalies across the PNW.  Similar to Argentina &amp; Southern Brazil, a weal La Nina has not negatively impacted precipitation patterns across TX and the Sothern US. La Nina ends before December.</p><p><br/><strong>Corn Comments &amp; Analysis</strong></p><p>Corn Drops as it was Excluded from US/China Trade Deal:</p><p>CBOT corn futures ended lower with South American fob markets heavy and lack of new bullish input. There’s no sign of Chinese demand for US corn, nor a sign China needs feed grains this crop year. China has been loath to secure Brazilian or Argentine corn for import amid its own domestic oversupply. Spot Dalian corn settled at $2.96/MT, down from $298 last week and $3.10 in late October 2024. Corn import margins into China are nonexistent. Recall China bought no corn from any origin in the 24/25 crop year, is a repeat ahead? Dec CBOT’s failure to breach its 200-day moving average sets up a test of $4.10-$4.16 in November – a seasonally bearish month for corn. ARC maintains that the weather in Argentina &amp; Southern Brazil into January will dominate corn price discovery. 30% of Argentina’s corn will be near pollination without water issues – and there’s no sign of lasting dryness into mid-November. CBOT corn rallies will struggle with 1<sup>st</sup> Notice Day against December. ARC argues that large nearby US corn exports reflect frontloaded demand from traditional buyers. Catch-up sales/hedges on any modest rally with resistance above $4.50 March.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/china-to-resume-soybean--other-ag-purchases-the-corn--ethanol-report?post=531983\">China To Resume Soybean &amp; Other Ag Purchases - The Corn &amp; Ethanol Report</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/keep-the-trade-deal-momentum-going-the-corn--ethanol-report?post=531431\">Keep The Trade Deal Momentum Going - The Corn &amp; Ethanol Report</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/corn-fundamentals-remain-a-major-obstacle-for-bulls-the-corn--ethanol-report?post=531123\">Corn Fundamentals Remain A Major Obstacle For Bulls.

See below:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://43s.159.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GPC102925-1-1024x605.jpeg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/><br/>Bear in mind, we’re just talking about the U.S. revaluing its gold holdings to the market rate. Based on historical precedent, the U.S. could choose to revalue gold to a MUCH higher price than that: $10,000 per ounce or even $20,000 per ounce.</p><p>This is right along the lines of what Franklin Delano Roosevelt did with the Gold Reserve Act of 1934. At that time, FDR revalued gold from $20.67 to $35 per oz, which represents a revaluation 69% higher. Of course, the U.S.’s debt situation was nowhere its current levels (the Debt to GDP ratio was a mere 40% compared to 120% today).</p><p>This is why I believe if the U.S. were to revalue gold in 2026, it would do so to a MUCH higher price. As I noted in my last article, a revaluation of gold to $20,000 per ounce would immediately give the U.S. an additional $5 TRILLION in capital.</p><p>At that price, the U.S. could retire ~18% of its debt outstanding, which in turn would reduce its interest payments and improve its fiscal position.</p><p>It would also provide an implicit link between the $USD and gold, which would cement the $USD as the world’s reserve currency… defeating China’s current strategic goal of establishing a gold-backed Yuan to replace the $USD.</p><p>Conspiracy theory? The language is already laid out in the $BTC Act. And Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has made multiple statements about “monetizing the asset side” of the U.S.’s balance sheet.</p><p>I realize this sounds crazy… but if you had told someone a year ago that the U.S. would…</p><ol><li>Create a sovereign wealth fund.</li><li>Create a Strategic $BTC Reserve</li><li>Start buying stakes in publicly traded companies (MP, INTC, etc.).</li></ol><p>…those policies would have sounded crazy then too. And that’s precisely what has happened!</p><p>Finally, we have to consider that this kind of strategy is something the President himself has done throughout his career in commercial real estate. Do you really think the self-proclaimed “King of Cheap” debt… the man who has a history of revaluing the assets he owns to restructure/ procure lower debt rates, hasn’t thought of this?</p><p>Those investors who are correctly positioned for this could generate life-changing returns. Imagine what would happen to precious metals miners or other gold plays if gold was revalued from $4,000 per ounce to $10,000 or even $20,000 per ounce and you’ll see what I mean.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/investor-alert-the-trump-administration-is-going-to-revalue-gold-in-2026?post=531459\">Investor Alert: The Trump Administration Is Going To Revalue Gold In 2026</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-single-best-indicator-of-future-inflation-is-ripping-higher?post=531125\">The Single Best Indicator Of Future Inflation Is Ripping Higher </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/the-biggest-opportunities-today-are-not-in-stocks?post=530779\">The Biggest Opportunities Today Are Not In Stocks </a><br/></div>",

Assets could freeze , as losses looks him right between the Eyes, he’s Paralyzed.<br/>Cause this is thriller, sanction’s night And no one’s gonna save you, Trumps sanctions are about to strike and without Luk Oil and Rosneftit will really start to bite. You’re fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller, ow,Trump’sgonna thrill you tonight.<br/>Dark falls in the Russian land the sanctions is close at hand. Creatures crawl in search of blood to terrorize y’all’s neighborhood (I’m gonna thrill you tonight) You’re fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller, ow<br/>In Venezuela the US might just hit its mark. Taking out military situations that have helped drugs move across our parks. Madura might leave as wasnever really was elected. It might seem that we could change the regime right before our eyes ,Creepin’ Up Behind<br/>You’re Out Of Time!!!!!!!Markets riseacross the Land, The trading Hour Is Close At Hand.Creatures Crawl in Search Of stops To Terrorize your equity.<br/>And Whosoever Shall Be Found Without the Soul For Betting Down<br/>Must Stand and Face The Hounds Of Sell, And Rot Inside A traders hell.<br/>The Foulest Stench Is in The Air, The Funk of those Maduro Putin Years.</p><p>Recent late-breaking reports suggest the US may strike Venezuela’s military sites, potentially paving the way for Venezuela’s elected government to return to power. This raises significant risks for oil markets, particularly diesel, as supplies are already low and Venezuelan heavy oil is an important source. The situation could overshadow concerns about new sanctions on Russia’s Rosneft and Lukoil, with the latter selling assets in response. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s use of new missiles is intensifying pressure on Russia, which is facing growing economic and geopolitical challenges—potentially its toughest period since the war began.<br/>So, natural gas prices just made a big jump, pretty much as we expected. Fox Weather is out with reports that it’s going to be chillier than we first thought as October wraps up and November gets going. That colder outlook has buyers snapping up gas in the Midwest and Northeast, and cash prices are hitting seasonal highs. There was a moment when the models showed a return of mild weather, which cooled off the rally a bit, but now that forecasts are back to calling for below-normal temps, the bulls are running again.<br/>This isn’t just a U.S. thing, either. It’s cold in Europe and Asia, too, and that’s tightening up their inventories—European stocks are actually down 11% since early October. All of this is keeping up the pressure on benchmark prices like Henry Hub.<br/>Meanwhile, U.S. LNG exports are really taking off. New facilities like Plaquemines LNG (Phases 1 and 2) and Corpus Christi Stage 3 are coming online and could add more than 5 Bcf/d between 2025 and 2026. Feedgas demand for these plants is expected to hit 17 Bcf/d by the end of the year, up from 13 Bcf/d earlier, which means less gas is sticking around for the domestic market—a recipe for higher prices.<br/>On the global stage, LNG demand is growing by about 2.5% in 2025. Europe is especially busy restocking ahead of winter, partly because of ongoing geopolitical worries like the Russia/Ukraine situation, so they’re competing hard for U.S. volumes.<br/>Back home, U.S. producers are being a lot more careful this year. After a stretch of oversupply, they’re drilling less and focusing on doing it more efficiently. That’s helped keep us from drowning in excess gas, even though storage levels are high (we’re about 4% above the five-year average, projected at roughly 3,917 Bcf for October 31).<br/>Still, the market doesn’t seem too worried about those big inventories. Everyone’s looking ahead to winter withdrawals and new sources of demand—especially from data centers and AI infrastructure, which could add another 1–2 Bcf/d to power needs.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/arms-race-the-energy-report?post=531985\">Arms Race - The Energy Report</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/trying-to-get-that-feeling-again-the-energy-report?post=530032\">Trying To Get That Feeling Again - The Energy Report </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/hey-dude-wheres-my-surplus-the-energy-report?post=529808\">Hey Dude Where’s, My Surplus?
