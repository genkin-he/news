            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Lacie, Bitget Wallet Researcher</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">I. Introduction: The \"Payment Gap\" Between Web2 and Web3</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The current digital ecosystem is being torn apart by the inherent conflict between Web2 and Web3. On the one hand, Web2's convenient payments (such as Apple Pay and WeChat Pay) are firmly locked within a \"walled garden\" by centralized platforms and geographical boundaries; on the other hand, while Web3 promises a globally open, permissionless financial future, it has become a \"technological island\" that deters mainstream users due to its drastic price fluctuations and complex user experience.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The gap between \"convenience\" and \"openness\" has long burdened Web3 with the labels of \"difficult to implement\" and \"speculative hype.\" Against this backdrop, an open protocol called x402 has come into view.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Its proposed solution is quite innovative: instead of starting from scratch, it attempts to revitalize a dormant internet underlying standard—HTTP 402 (Payment Required)—that has been dormant for 26 years. [Image: x402 official website homepage introduction image] [Source: x402 official website (https://www.x402.org/)] Can this \"reactivation\" of the internet's underlying protocol standard be the key to bridging the aforementioned gap? Does it foreshadow the birth of a native, open Web payment layer, fundamentally reshaping the way value flows on the internet? Bitget Wallet will provide an in-depth analysis of this topic in this article. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">II. A Belated Breakout: What is x402, and why is it only now gaining popularity?</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">x402 is an open protocol developed and open-sourced by Coinbase in May 2025. Its core goal is to activate the long-unused HTTP 402 status code, transforming it into an internet-native, permissionless payment mechanism, ultimately establishing a channel between Web2 applications and Web3 value networks.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, an interesting phenomenon is that although the x402 protocol was launched as early as May, it only suddenly became popular after five months of silence. In fact, the 402 status code itself is not a \"new invention\" in the crypto world, but rather a reserved code in the HTTP protocol from the 1990s.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> So why has an \"old standard\" and a \"not-so-new\" protocol only recently sparked heated discussions in the market? The table below outlines the key timelines from the birth of x402 to its explosive popularity, which helps us understand the facts behind this \"delayed explosion\". </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/842-1761898283158.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Table: Timeline of the Birth and Application of x402 (as of October 28, 2025)</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Data Source: Bitget Wallet, compiled from publicly available data (transaction data from x402scan)</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As shown in the timeline above, the evolution of x402 reveals the following key facts:</p><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">First, x402 is based on the HTTP 402 of 1999.</p></li><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/842-1761898313521.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Table: Summary Table of HTTP Status Codes</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Data Source: Compiled by Bitget Wallet</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In this vast codebase, the 402 (Payment Required) status code stands out. From its inception, it envisioned a protocol-native micropayment method, aiming for instant payments that were \"seamlessly integrated, like loading an image\"—without intermediaries or delays. However, as the internet economy shifted towards advertising, platforms, and complex credit card forms, the concept of the 402 status code was shelved, and the standard has never been widely adopted.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/842-1761898376215.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Figure: Comparison of existing intelligent agent payment process and x402 per-use charging</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Data source: x402 White Paper</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The deeper significance lies in the fact that x402 allows a single HTTP request to simultaneously possess the dual attributes of \"data transmission\" and \"value transmission.\" This truly integrates the dimension of \"value\" into the information protocol at the very beginning of the Internet, and at the application level, it has the potential to truly revolutionize the traditional WEB system that has been used for more than 20 years.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/842-1761898376215.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> At the same time, this may answer a long-standing pain point for Web3: how can the crypto world empower entities and change the world? For a long time, the crypto world has been criticized for lacking truly mainstream applications, and x402 may become such a singularity—it's not starting from scratch, but rather attempting to \"inject\" Web3's value settlement capabilities into the vast Web2 ecosystem, becoming a true bridge connecting the two worlds—this is the underlying logic behind the protocol's widespread popularity and discussion. However, behind this optimistic vision, the challenges facing x402 cannot be ignored. First, there are concerns from within the HTTP protocol itself. HTTP 402 is still a \"non-standardized\" reserved code. As shown in MDN Web Docs (the developer documentation repository), it is defined as \"reserved but undefined.\" This means it has not been fully accepted by mainstream Web standards and has compatibility issues with underlying protocols. Therefore, the current implementation of x402 largely relies on \"custom HTTP headers\" like X-PAYMENT, rather than the true standard 402 status code, casting a shadow over its long-term standardization. [Image: HTTP 402 status code has been pointed out for compatibility issues by the developer documentation library] Secondly, the subsequent attitudes of many traditional internet giants remain to be seen. Despite giants like Google announcing their adoption of the protocol within the AI ​​framework, x402's advocacy of \"bypassing platforms and peer-to-peer payments\" essentially stands in opposition to the internet giants who currently profit from \"walled gardens\" and payment commission models. The combination of x402 and AI Agents is more like a \"declaration of war\" on the traditional internet ecosystem—whether the giants genuinely accept it or merely use it temporarily remains to be seen. Finally, and most alarmingly, is the potential backlash from the speculative bubble. Since the x402 protocol itself hasn't issued any tokens, all tokens currently associated with it (such as PING) are experimental projects called memes. While the meme craze has objectively boosted x402's popularity, it also raises serious questions: will this movement fall into a false prosperity of \"speculative narratives,\" ultimately undermining genuine technological ideals when the bubble bursts? This is a persistent dilemma the crypto world struggles to escape. (The image below shows the x402 ecosystem map)</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/842-1761898413569.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Figure: x402 Ecosystem Overview</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Source: X @henloitsjoyce</em></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">VI. Conclusion: Beyond the Noise, What is the Value?</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">x402 provides an extremely pragmatic solution for AI Agent payments—it doesn't require users to abandon their existing internet, but rather attempts to complete the key upgrade of \"payment\" at the most basic protocol level.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">x402 provides an extremely pragmatic solution for AI Agent payments—it doesn't require users to abandon their existing internet, but rather attempts to complete the key upgrade of \"payment\" at the most basic protocol level.</p></ul></div></div>",

It's worth noting that the last two times the MACD issued such a bearish signal, it occurred at the peak of the 2017 and 2021 bull market cycles, both indicating a peak in Bitcoin's price. A bearish engulfing pattern also appeared on the same three-week chart, similar to patterns observed at the peaks of the 2017 and 2021 bull markets. Jesse Olson stated in another blog post on Thursday that these signals, along with \"several other warning signs,\" suggest a top has been reached. Other signals include declining network activity, indicating reduced on-chain demand. Nansen data shows that the number of daily active addresses on the Bitcoin network dropped from 632,915 to 447,225 in October, a decrease of 30%. A decrease in daily active addresses indicates reduced network participation and weakened user demand, which is often a precursor to price corrections or prolonged consolidation. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Bitcoin Cycle Top Approaching</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Anonymous trader and investor Mister Crypto supports the \"cycle top theory,\" arguing that based on Bitcoin's quadrennial halving cycle, it is currently at a \"historically typical peak point.\"</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Looking back at the Bitcoin halving cycles of 2012 and 2016, a similar trend exists: prices gradually accumulate momentum, typically peaking within 518 to 580 days after the halving event (as shown in the chart below).</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">558 days have passed since the 2024 Bitcoin halving, meaning the current Bitcoin market is within ±40 days of the historical peak window (518-580 days).</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Mister Crypto posted on the X platform, stating, \"We are currently near a period when Bitcoin typically peaks,\" and then asked rhetorically, \"Will this time be an exception?\" Analyst CryptoBird also stated that, following historical patterns of halving cycles, the current Bitcoin price surge may only last a few days. In his latest Bitcoin analysis, CryptoBird pointed out that Bitcoin is \"consolidating before a breakout, and the top window has opened.\" As Cointelegraph previously reported, analysts such as former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes believe that the four-year Bitcoin cycle has become ineffective, and the current price is driven more by monetary policy and liquidity than by the halving event. Another view holds that the impact of the halving event is gradually weakening. They suggest that the current period is one of rising interest rates, with institutions gradually entering the market through ETFs and Bitcoin treasury companies, and Bitcoin's maturity as a mainstream asset is constantly increasing. These factors may drive Bitcoin to see more upside potential in 2026. Has Bitcoin's upside potential truly run out? Besides the view that the four-year Bitcoin cycle no longer determines the duration of a bull market, some analysts believe, based on technical indicators, that Bitcoin still has room to rise. Analyst Jelle, referring to Bitcoin's daily price chart, stated that Bitcoin \"has formed higher lows and the trading range remains intact,\" and that \"if it recovers the $116,000 level, the upward trend will resume.\" Analyst Mags pointed out that Bitcoin is currently in a \"bullish megaphone pattern,\" which historically often leads to a breakout, suggesting \"a significant breakout is imminent.\" As Cointelegraph reports, Bitcoin's Meyer multiples indicate that the current price level remains near \"oversold\" territory, meaning the $180,000 target price is still achievable.</p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Eleanor Terrett Translator: Shan Ouba, Jinse Finance</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Following the submission of a revised S-1 filing last Friday, Canary Capital's XRP spot ETF is poised to become the next cryptocurrency fund to list on Wall Street.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On October 24, the filing was quietly amended, removing the delay clause that granted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the power to determine the effective date of registration. If Nasdaq approves the crucial Form 8-A to allow its listing, this would clear the way for the ETF's potential November 13 launch.</p> This operation follows the legal mechanism used by Bitwise and Canary this week when they launched the Solana, Hedera, and Litecoin ETFs—relying on the 20-day statutory waiting period stipulated in Section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933: unless the SEC declares the registration effective in advance, the registration statement will automatically become effective 20 days after submission. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has expressed support for this approach, praising a company called MapLight, which went public during the government shutdown using the automatic effective mechanism. Tuesday's ETF launch broke with the tradition of all cryptocurrency ETFs starting trading on the same day, regardless of the submission date, during the Gensler era. Subsequently, with the government shutdown and the SEC operating at a limited pace, other issuers rushed to update their S-1 filings to bring their products to market. Fidelity, VanEck, and Canary all updated their Solana ETF registration documents this week, removing the delay amendment clauses and planning to launch in mid-November after obtaining exchange approval. If Canary's XRP ETF launches as scheduled on November 13th, the company will once again gain a first-mover advantage in the XRP ETF market—currently, other issuers that have also submitted XRP ETF applications, such as Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and Grayscale, have not yet updated their documents. It is worth noting that the resumption of government operations may affect Canary's target launch date. ETF experts say that if the SEC resumes operations early and the documents meet all requirements, the launch date may be earlier; however, if staff return to work before the 13th and provide additional feedback, the launch may be delayed. <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Market Structure Bill Progressing</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As the saying goes, teamwork makes dreams come true, and this is exactly what's happening on Capitol Hill in the US—pro-crypto Republicans and Democrats are more determined than ever to complete the review process for the cryptocurrency market structure bill before Thanksgiving.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Last week, industry figures and lawmakers held multiple roundtables to mend the differences caused by the leak of decentralized finance (DeFi) regulatory proposals and get back on track with the legislation. Furthermore, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) and David Sacks, Trump's appointee as head of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, both expressed their encouragement, and these efforts appear to be yielding results.</p> Staff-level negotiations on the Senate Banking Committee are accelerating; meanwhile, on the Senate Agriculture Committee, the text of a bipartisan bill jointly drafted by Senators John Boozman (Republican, Arkansas) and Cory Booker (Democrat, New Jersey) is reportedly nearing completion and could be released as early as today, although final negotiations may delay the release until next week. Multiple sources within Capitol Hill and industry insiders told Crypto In America that both parties are currently highly focused on getting the bipartisan bill through both house committees before Thanksgiving and then to the full Senate for a vote.</div></div>",

narrative amplification and harvesting effect?</span> ... Essentially, the significant volatility of these cryptocurrencies after their listing stems from two main factors: firstly, direct manipulation by market makers and project teams; and secondly, the Alpha platform narrative accelerating retail investor entry, providing market makers with a broader \"hunting ground,\" evolving into a standardized script that allows for faster replication and more ruthless exits. This may also reveal one of Binance's design intentions for Alpha: to attract speculators with its low circulating supply and high volatility. After all, someone is always willing to pay for volatility—some come for the profit, some stay for short-term gains, and ultimately, some pay the price for the volatility. Besides highly controlled cryptocurrencies like MYX, AIA, and COAI, the platform has also seen numerous irregularities: some projects went to zero or crashed immediately after launch, while others were involved in false narratives or code plagiarism. Overall, the platform's motivation to attract speculative funds far outweighs its motivation to incubate projects. To put it another way, the emergence of Alpha was not inherently sinful; it was merely a highly volatile experimental field focusing on early new products. However, when narrative, structure, and human nature are superimposed, volatility becomes a harvesting machine. According to CoinMarketCap data, Binance Alpha's 24-hour trading volume exceeds $8 billion, far surpassing many small and medium-sized cryptocurrency exchanges, illustrating this \"wild growth.\" This is not accidental, but rather a product of the combined effects of capital and traffic. In conclusion, on one hand, market manipulators and project teams are using the high volatility of Alpha platforms to create a safe exit channel; on the other hand, retail investors remain obsessed with the fantasy of the next \"100x coin.\" Greed and fear intertwine—such is human nature. Instead of blindly chasing the next COAI, it's better to consider where you stand in this game.</strong></p></div></div>",

In a new document dated Sept. 30, 2025, the disgraced founder insists that his now-defunct crypto exchange was “never insolvent” — only the victim of a liquidity crunch and a crisis of confidence.</p><p></p><p>According to Bankman-Fried, the $8 billion owed to FTX customers at the time of its November 2022 bankruptcy “never left.” In his view, the company always had enough assets to repay users “in full, in kind,” using the current payback efforts as a evidence of his claims. </p><blockquote>“There have always been enough assets to repay all customers—in full, in kind—both in November 2022, and today.”</blockquote><p></p><p>In his new account, Bankman-Fried paints FTX’s implosion as a classic bank run rather than a case of missing funds. As panic withdrawals surged into the billions, he claims FTX was in the process of selling assets, securing financing, and even preparing to resume withdrawals before the plug was pulled.</p><p></p><div class=\"media-wrap embed-wrap\"><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">[SBF says:]<br/><br/>This is where the money went. <a href=\"https://t.co/HVRwEw5Z1k\">https://t.co/HVRwEw5Z1k</a><a href=\"https://t.co/5DrA13L5YE\">https://t.co/5DrA13L5YE</a><a href=\"https://t.co/O6q77DvmTn\">pic.twitter.com/O6q77DvmTn</a></p>— SBF (@SBF_FTX) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1984091090795032939?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 31, 2025</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></div></div><p></p><p>He argues that both FTX and its sister company Alameda Research had assets exceeding liabilities through most of 2022 — and even at the point of bankruptcy, internal records allegedly showed a balance sheet that was roughly neutral or positive.</p><p></p><p>But SBF’s defense goes further: he blames the bankruptcy process itself for destroying value. According to him, decisions made by the appointed administrators—including “poorly timed” asset sales—cost creditors billions in potential recovery.</p><p></p><h1>The Missed Windfall Argument</h1><p>SBF and his team highlight what they see as the ultimate proof of their claim: the soaring value of several key assets FTX once held. Tokens like Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI), along with a private stake in Anthropic, have all skyrocketed since being liquidated by the estate.</p><p></p><div class=\"media-wrap embed-wrap\"><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Drop your <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Solana?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Solana</a> address 👇<br/><br/>I will send you $9999 in 24h❤<br/>(Yes for real )<br/><br/>RT and Follow🔥 <a href=\"https://t.co/WmZFOohSij\">pic.twitter.com/WmZFOohSij</a></p>— Crypto Emperor (@Cryptoemperor06) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cryptoemperor06/status/1984196954591842426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 31, 2025</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></div></div><p></p><p>In his telling, if FTX’s management had been left in place and allowed to wait out the market downturn, customers could have been repaid directly in crypto — and would now be sitting on enormous gains. Instead, because repayments are being made in U.S. dollar equivalents based on 2022 prices, SBF argues customers were denied the upside of the recent crypto bull run.</p><p></p><p>It’s a bold argument — one that positions him not as a fraudster, but as a misunderstood founder caught in a panic spiral.</p><p></p><h1>A Story That’s Hard to Believe</h1><p>Still, SBF’s narrative has glaring holes. The same bankruptcy investigation he criticizes uncovered massive intercompany loans, commingled funds, and billions in customer deposits diverted to Alameda — facts that severely undermine his “bank run” framing.</p><p></p><div class=\"media-wrap embed-wrap\"><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">In a stetement released through his X account, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SBF_FTX</a> released a report claiming that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FTX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FTX</a> was never insolvent.<br/><br/>The report claims that 98% of creditors have been paid 120% repayments already.<br/><br/>Could we also see SBF pardoned? 🤔 <a href=\"https://t.co/5Ttte6WlN3\">pic.twitter.com/5Ttte6WlN3</a></p>— Rand (@cryptorand) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cryptorand/status/1984197403394633974?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 31, 2025</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></div></div><p></p><p>While it’s true that creditors are now on track to receive near-total repayment, that’s largely thanks to the bankruptcy team’s asset recovery and litigation wins, not SBF’s foresight. The “liquidity crunch” he describes was, in reality, a symptom of FTX’s structural misuse of funds.</p><p></p><p>Even if the numbers technically balanced at moments in time, the way they were managed — and who had access to them — remains the core issue.</p><p></p><h1>A Redemption Attempt or Reputation Play?</h1><p>Bankman-Fried, now serving a 25-year prison sentence for fraud and money laundering, is clearly attempting to reshape his legacy. His latest claims seem designed to position him as a fallen visionary rather than a criminal mastermind.</p><p></p><p>But while his arguments make for an intriguing thought experiment — what if FTX had simply been given more time? — the broader crypto community remains skeptical. After all, solvency isn’t just about assets exceeding liabilities on paper; it’s about trust, transparency, and responsible control of customer funds — all things FTX catastrophically lacked.</p><p></p><p>There’s no denying the irony here: FTX’s creditors are getting back more than they lost, a rarity in crypto collapses. But to frame that outcome as proof that the company was “never insolvent” misses the point. The returns stem from a booming market and diligent recovery efforts — not from the integrity of FTX’s internal systems.</p><p></p><p>If anything, this saga proves that crypto institutions must be built on transparency, not charisma or complexity. Bankman-Fried may be trying to reclaim the narrative, but numbers alone can’t rewrite history.</p></div></div>",

            "title": "Let's talk about MSTR's Q3 2025 financial report.",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Phyrex Source: X, @Phyrex_Ni</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Foreword: MSTR released its earnings report after the US stock market closed on Thursday. Earnings per share were $8.42, exceeding market expectations of $7.90. Third-quarter revenue was $128.7 million, exceeding market expectations of $118.3 million. MSTR's third-quarter earnings exceeded market expectations, and its after-hours price rose by more than 5%.</p> As of October 26, 2025, MSTR held a total of 640,808 $BTC, with a total cost of $47.44 billion, equivalent to a cost of $74,032 per Bitcoin. With the current BTC price at $107,300, this represents a paper profit of $21.333 billion. The net profit (paper profit) for the third quarter was $2.8 billion. What does this mean? American Express, ranked 67th globally by assets in the S&amp;P 500, reported a profit of $2.9 billion in the third quarter of 2025. Another well-known tech company, Oracle, also reported a GAAP net profit of $2.9 billion in the third quarter. This doesn't mean MSTR is particularly impressive. MSTR received a B- junk stock rating in the latest S&amp;P ratings, primarily due to the extreme volatility of Bitcoin's price. Therefore, I believe S&amp;P's rating of MSTR is essentially the same as its rating of BTC, just slightly higher due to the lack of leverage. Thus, MSTR's net profit (on paper) basically meets the standards of a top 100 global company, largely due to the influence of BTC's price. Crisis? As of September 30, 2025, MSTR held $54.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Does this mean it can only buy $54.3 million worth of Bitcoin? No, MSTR doesn't buy BTC with cash; it buys BTC through its capital structure. It converts fiat currency into BTC by issuing stocks, bonds, and structured credit. <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/4-1761881292210.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, the financial report for the third quarter of 2025 shows that as of October 26, 2025, MSTR's remaining issuance quota through multiple ATM programs totaled approximately $42.1 billion. In simpler terms, MSTR could buy up to $42.1 billion worth of Bitcoin.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">So why did MSTR slow down its BTC purchases in the third quarter?<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"> MSTR divides its Common Stock ATM Program (with approximately $15.9 billion remaining) into three tiers, determining the issuance intensity and purpose based on mNAV levels: A. mNAV Threshold &lt; 2.5x Tactically-Based Issuance: Paying Debt Interest, Funding Preferred Stock Dividends, and Other Corporate Favorable Circumstances (e.g., Small Cash Supplements). Limited Issuance Size to Avoid Excessive Dilutation at Low Premiums. B. mNAV Threshold 2.5x - 4.0x Opportunistically issued, primarily for purchasing Bitcoin. Balances funding with BTC yield, depending on market opportunities.\nC. mNAV Threshold &gt; 4.0x Actively issued, used extensively for purchasing Bitcoin. Accelerates during periods of high premium to maximize leverage. </h2></h2><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/4-1761881344336.jpg?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Currently, mNAV is 1.27x (below 2.5x), so MSTR may only be used for debt/dividend payments rather than large-scale BTC purchases. This explains the slowdown in purchases in the third quarter (only $2.2 billion).</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>What is the formula for calculating mNAV?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">MSTR's mNAV is a multiple of Enterprise Value (EV) divided by the net asset value of its Bitcoin holdings (Bitcoin NAV).</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Enterprise Value (EV): Total company value, including market capitalization + debt + nominal value of preferred stock - cash. Bitcoin NAV: Market capitalization of the company's Bitcoin holdings (currently approximately 640,000 BTC, worth over $70 billion). Will MSTR collapse? Short-term (2026) probability: Low: Unless BTC crashes by more than 50%, the company has $42.1 billion in ATM credit available for rapid financing, and its operating cash flow is stable. Long-term (2028) probability: Moderate: If BTC remains sluggish for an extended period, the pressure of debt maturities will be significant (the first large tranche is in 2028). Statistics show that unless $BTC falls below $16,500, the risk of bankruptcy is highest. Actually, the price of BTC is not the main reason why MSTR might go bankrupt. If MSTR really does go bankrupt, the core reason should be that MSTR can no longer print shares to exchange for BTC. As long as the market still accepts MSTR's approach and provides MSTR with financing channels, then the probability of MSTR going bankrupt will be very low.

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><h1>Nordea Makes a Cautious Yet Bold Comeback With New Bitcoin ETP</h1><p>Nordea, Scandinavia’s largest bank, is making a surprising U-turn—moving from banning Bitcoin to embracing it. Starting this December, the bank will offer customers access to a Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded product (ETP), marking a major policy reversal for an institution that once called crypto too risky to touch.</p><p></p><p>Back in 2018, Nordea famously banned its employees from holding Bitcoin, citing concerns over regulation and volatility. Now, just seven years later, the same bank is cautiously stepping into the crypto arena.</p><p></p><div class=\"media-wrap embed-wrap\"><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">JUST IN: 🇸🇪 Nordic bank Nordea to offer Bitcoin ETFs to customers starting December <br/><br/>Nordea previously banned all employees from owning Bitcoin in June 🤔 <a href=\"https://t.co/m729V9hoAq\">pic.twitter.com/m729V9hoAq</a></p>— Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1983887475148800363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 30, 2025</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></div></div><p></p><p>The new product, developed in partnership with CoinShares, will be backed by real Bitcoin and launched under an “execution-only” clause — meaning Nordea won’t advise you to buy it, but it won’t stop you from diving in either. </p><p></p><p>Nordea’s change in stance mirrors the rapid evolution of the Nordic crypto landscape, where regulation and institutional interest have begun reshaping the market. The bank cited the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) as a key factor behind its decision.</p><p></p><p>MiCA, which tightens investor protections and licensing standards, has given banks the regulatory confidence they once lacked. </p><blockquote>“Nordea has closely monitored trends in cryptocurrencies but maintained a cautious approach due to the unregulated nature of crypto-assets and the lack of investor protection that characterized their early years.” </blockquote><p></p><div class=\"media-wrap embed-wrap\"><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-media-max-width=\"560\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The EU’s new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MiCA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MiCA</a> regulation is changing the crypto landscape.<br/>⚠️ But risks remain, and consumer protection may be limited – so make sure you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/stayInformed?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#stayInformed</a>.<br/>📄 Check out the ESAs' handy factsheet which explains what MiCA means for YOU as a consumer: <a href=\"https://t.co/pqXvzcgA5S\">https://t.co/pqXvzcgA5S</a><a href=\"https://t.co/cra2aKzSsy\">pic.twitter.com/cra2aKzSsy</a></p>— EU Banking Authority - EBA 🇪🇺 (@EBA_News) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EBA_News/status/1975131888122761379?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></div></div><p></p><p>Now, with greater oversight in place, Nordea says it’s open to offering crypto-related products “that meet customer needs in a maturing environment.”</p><p></p><p>For the uninitiated: A Bitcoin ETP lets investors gain exposure to Bitcoin through traditional financial markets — no wallets, no private keys, just regulated access. Each ETP share represents a portion of Bitcoin held by the issuer, making it a safer bridge between crypto and conventional investing.</p><p></p><h1>Crypto Fever Rising Across the Nordics</h1><p>Crypto adoption is heating up fast across Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. A recent study by digital asset research firm K33 found that 2.1 million people in the region now own crypto — up from 1.5 million last year. That’s about 7.5% of the total population.</p><p></p><div class=\"media-wrap image-wrap\"><img src=\"https://image.coinlive.com/cryptotwits-static/f1e18667e312a2e7c6810752f21376fe.png\"/></div><p></p><p>Even more striking, the report predicts crypto ownership could hit 6.4 million by 2035, as nearly one in three Nordic investors say they plan to buy crypto in the next decade.</p><p></p><p>Nordea’s pivot echoes a broader European trend: major banks are now offering crypto-linked exchange-traded products (ETPs) to meet investor demand while staying compliant with evolving regulations. Analysts say these ETPs act as a “gateway”  to mainstream finance — legitimizing a market once seen as volatile, opaque, and untouchable.</p><p></p><h1>A Strategic but Careful Step Forward</h1><p>Nordea’s move signals growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin, yet its execution-only model shows the bank still wants to keep one foot on solid ground. By offering access without direct advisory involvement, Nordea is giving customers the freedom to explore crypto — without fully endorsing it.</p><p></p><p>At Coinlive, we see Nordea’s move as a smart and necessary evolution rather than a full-fledged crypto endorsement. The bank isn’t telling you to buy Bitcoin — it’s simply acknowledging a financial revolution that can no longer be ignored.</p><p></p><p>As regulation strengthens and demand continues to rise, it’s becoming clear that traditional banks have two choices: adapt or be left behind. Nordea has chosen to adapt — carefully, but decisively. </p></div></div>",
