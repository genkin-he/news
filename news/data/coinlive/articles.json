Bitcoin is used for import payments and trade settlements outside the dollar system. In recent years, Iran's share of global Bitcoin hashrate is estimated at 2% to 5%.\n\nThe report points out that the role of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in this system has been continuously strengthened. In the fourth quarter of 2025, addresses related to the IRGC accounted for over 50% of the total crypto inflows into Iran; the total inflow for the year exceeded $3 billion, higher than the approximately $2 billion in 2024.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>▌CZ reports: All is well</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">CZ posted on the X platform, \"All is well.

Either way, it will take them several years to recover.\" Trump listed two main reasons for launching the attack—the first being the failure of this week's negotiations led by his envoys Witkov and Kushner. \"The Iranians always come close to a deal and then back down—it's a recurring pattern. From this, I see that they don't really want a deal.\" The second reason is Iran's actions over the past few decades. Furthermore, according to a senior US official, the US-Israel joint operation is expected to launch a large-scale bombing campaign lasting at least five days. The E3 leaders issued a statement on Iran, stating that France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have consistently urged the Iranian regime to halt its nuclear program, limit its ballistic missile program, cease its destabilizing activities in the region and on our homeland, and end the heinous violence and repression against its own people. We have not participated in these attacks, but we maintain close contact with our international partners, including the United States, Israel, and other partners in the region. We reiterate our commitment to maintaining regional stability and protecting civilian lives. We condemn Iran's attacks on countries in the region in the strongest terms. Iran must cease its indiscriminate military strikes. We call for the resumption of negotiations and urge the Iranian leadership to seek a solution through negotiations.

The Kuwait Stock Exchange announced that trading will be suspended from March 1 until further notice due to the escalating situation. Blockchain Applications. Vitalik Buterin stated in an article on the X platform that Ethereum has been discussing account abstraction (AA) since early 2016, and now EIP-8141, as a comprehensive proposal, aims to solve all remaining problems related to AA. The core concept of this proposal is \"frame transactions,\" where a transaction contains N calls that can read each other's call data and authorize senders and gas payers.\n\nThis mechanism supports multiple use cases: ordinary account transactions (such as multi-signature, variable key, and quantum-resistant signature schemes) are completed through verification and execution frames; when paying gas fees using non-ETH tokens, it can be achieved through the main payment contract without any intermediaries; regarding privacy protocols, it can be implemented by verifying ZK-SNARKs or adding two-dimensional random numbers through the payment contract. In terms of security, at the on-chain level, transactions are only valid when the verification frame returns ACCEPT with a payment gas flag; at the mempool level, conservative rules will be adopted initially, with gradual expansion later. EIP-8141 is highly complementary to FOCIL; FOCIL ensures rapid transaction inclusion, while AA ensures that complex operations can be executed directly as first-class transactions. The proposal is also discussing EOA compatibility, which is feasible in principle. After more than ten years of research, these technologies are expected to be implemented through a Hegota fork within a year.

Some of these shares were purchased just hours before the first reports of the Tehran explosion, and some were even bought at around one-tenth of a share. This betting pattern has raised suspicions of insider trading.

Important Economic Developments: The Israeli military detected a new round of missile launches from Iran. (Golden Encyclopedia) ▌What is the true value of BTC? BTC is often compared to \"digital gold,\" but its core value lies in its \"promise of immutable scarcity.\" First, BTC has monetary properties, but it is not a currency because it lacks a stable unit of account. It is purely \"monetary,\" representing a consensus game among humans regarding \"what can serve as a store of value.\" Gold also has this core value, but its scarcity relies on physical geological constraints, while BTC's scarcity relies on mathematics and game theory—a scarcity at the information level. However, what truly makes BTC unique is not the coin itself, nor the \"digital gold\" narrative, but rather that blockchain is the first permissionless, unclosable value settlement layer in human history. This is a completely new category of infrastructure. No sovereign entity can unilaterally prevent the final settlement of a BTC transaction. This attribute may be underestimated in peacetime, but it will be repriced during periods of geopolitical conflict and escalating capital controls. BTC is a systemic hedge. It doesn't hedge against inflation, nor does it hedge against the US dollar. It hedges against the structural degradation of institutional trust. In other words, BTC's value is not endogenous, but reflexive: the more people believe it has value, the more valuable it becomes, and vice versa. Therefore, BTC is the financialized expression of humanity's distrust of its own institutional capabilities. Its ceiling depends on the depth and breadth of this distrust, and its floor depends on the existence of a superior alternative.</p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Author: Zhou, ChainCatcher</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Bitdeer's Bitcoin holdings have gone to zero.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As one of the leading mining companies, it held over 2400 BTC at its peak in November last year, then continuously increased its selling pace until it completed its liquidation in mid-February, and now it maintains a pace of selling as much as it mines.</p> ... It's worth noting that the company's financial report shows that in the fourth quarter of 2025, it achieved revenue of US$224.8 million, a year-on-year increase of 226%; net profit reached US$70.5 million; total hashrate reached 71.0 EH/s, a year-on-year increase of 229%, and mining machine efficiency also increased significantly from 30.4 J/TH to 17.9 J/TH. A company with a blazing profit and record-high hashrate has chosen to clear its Bitcoin reserves at this time. To understand this operation, we need to return to a fundamental fact that has long been obscured by the market. 1. Coin hoarding has always been a minority strategy. BitDeer was never a faith-driven coin hoarding institution. In its early years, the company followed the simplest mining company logic—mine, sell, and convert to cash. BTC was not an asset to it, but a product. Until the last two years, when MicroStrategy's coin hoarding model gained immense popularity in the capital market, and the valuation logic of mining companies began to be reshaped, BitDeer followed the industry trend and briefly switched to a coin hoarding narrative. This kind of following the trend is not uncommon in the industry, but very few actually stick to it. Tom Dunleavy, an analyst at blockchain research firm Messari, released data showing that from January to November 2025, 10 major listed mining companies, including Core Scientific, Riot, Marathon, and Hut8, mined a total of approximately 40,700 BTC, while selling approximately 40,300 BTC during the same period, a sales rate of nearly 99%. In other words, these companies have never truly been hoarding coins. This figure reveals the industry's fundamental survival rule: mining companies are essentially energy arbitrageurs; Bitcoin is an intermediary for them to convert cheap electricity into revenue, not a long-term holding on their balance sheets. For some time, the market believed the hoarding story partly because the continuous rise in BTC prices masked this reality—when assets appreciate, selling becomes a matter of posture; but when prices fall below mining costs, selling transforms from a posture into a survival instinct. Therefore, BitDeer's recent liquidation is less a betrayal of faith and more a return to its true nature. It's certainly not a signal of a bearish outlook on Bitcoin; Wu Jihan himself stated on social media that holding zero positions doesn't mean it will always be that way. However, this time, the sale wasn't for operating cash, but for initial funding for a transformation. That brief period of hoarding was merely an interlude in the industry's collective narrative in cooperation with the capital market. 2. Triple Pressure: How Cold is the Winter for Mining Companies? Understanding that hoarding is a minority allows for a clearer view of the current situation of mining companies. And what weighs heavily on this industry is the predicament of three simultaneous tightening measures. First, there's the cost pressure after the halving. The 2024 halving means a reduction in block rewards, directly halving the output per unit for mining companies, while electricity costs, machine depreciation, and maintenance costs remain unchanged. The shutdown price of many mining machines is already close to or even exceeds the current BTC price, meaning that starting up results in losses, while shutting down wastes assets. Dunleavy also points out that miners' continuous selling of newly mined BTC itself constitutes structural downward pressure on prices. The lower the price, the more coins mining companies need to sell; the more coins sold, the harder it is for prices to rebound, thus creating a self-reinforcing vicious cycle. Secondly, there are the stark figures in the financial reports. Looking at the 2025 annual reports of mining companies, almost without exception, they all showed a structure where revenue increased, but so did losses. MARA Holdings' annual revenue increased from $656 million to $907 million, but its net loss reached a staggering $1.31 billion, compared to a profit of $541 million in the same period of the previous year. Hut 8's revenue increased from $162 million to $235 million, but its net loss changed from a profit of $331 million to a loss of $248 million. TeraWulf's full-year revenue increased from $140 million to $169 million, while its fourth-quarter loss per share widened from $0.21 to $1.66. The phenomenon of increased revenue but decreased profit is occurring simultaneously in several leading companies, indicating that this is not a management issue, but rather a structural cyclical contraction within the industry. Fluctuations in the fair value of cryptocurrency assets directly impact the profit and loss statement, making the figures on the books look particularly bad. Meanwhile, companies are still using debt to facilitate transformation: Hut launched a $1 billion ATM financing plan and signed a credit agreement with Coinbase for up to $400 million; Cipher Digital completed three financing rounds totaling $3.73 billion. Finally, the macroeconomic environment has changed. Trump's increase in global tariffs and the continued escalation of geopolitical uncertainty have put pressure on risk assets, with Bitcoin falling below $65,000. Cryptocurrency analysis firm QCP points out that Bitcoin's price is significantly lower than the average mining cost, and prioritizing liquidity over hoarding is no longer a strategic choice but a practical constraint. Bitdeer's liquidation and Cango's sale of small amounts of BTC for operational purposes, combined, outline the industry's trend towards risk-averse strategies. 3. A Gamble of Transformation: Facing Death to Survive Under the pressure of triple tightening, mining companies have only one way out: transformation, using the infrastructure assets accumulated through Bitcoin mining to unlock a new source of revenue. AI and high-performance computing have become the next card the industry collectively bets on. The logic is not difficult to understand. Mining companies hold a large number of cheap electricity contracts and scalable data center land, which are precisely the scarcest resources for AI computing infrastructure. Switching from low-margin mining power to high-margin AI computing power leasing seems like a profitable deal on paper. Bitdeer is aggressively developing its self-developed mining machines (Sealminer), AI cloud services, and high-performance computing businesses; Cipher has changed its brand from Mining to Digital, signaling its platform transformation; and several companies are vying to secure long-term, low-priced electricity contracts to build a structural moat in energy costs. However, the actual progress is far more conservative than the narrative suggests. Take TeraWulf as an example. In the fourth quarter, the company's revenue from HPC was only $9.7 million, accounting for less than 30% of its total revenue of $35.8 million, and a significant drop compared to the third quarter. Customer acquisition, contract signing, and capacity ramp-up for AI businesses all take time, while debt pressure and equity dilution are immediate. The outcome of this transformation gamble depends on whether the new business can truly scale up before the debt matures. Intriguingly, during the same period when BTC fell by nearly 17% in a single month, the stocks of several mining companies bucked the trend and strengthened. For example, TeraWulf rose 31% cumulatively this month, Cipher rose 8%, Hut 8 rose 6%, and Core Scientific remained basically flat. This decoupling reflects a revaluation in the capital market—mining companies have long been one of the sectors with the highest short positions held by hedge funds, and the upward momentum may partly come from short covering. This indicates that the market is beginning to see these companies as potential carriers of AI computing power infrastructure, rather than leverage amplifiers for Bitcoin prices. In the future, their evaluation criteria may no longer be who holds how much BTC, but who has locked in the longest-term low-priced electricity, whose data center assets have the greatest potential for AI transformation, and whose balance sheet can weather the pain of transformation. Conclusion Mining companies have never been the most devout believers in Bitcoin; they are the most rational industry participants. When mining is profitable, they mine; when hoarding coins can support valuations, they choose to hoard coins; when selling coins can provide the funds for transformation, they will sell without hesitation. This is the basic logic of business. The real question worth pursuing is the next one: after the AI/HPC transformation story has been fully priced in by the capital market, what will these companies have left to support the next round of valuations? If the price of Bitcoin has recovered by then, and the transformation business is not yet mature, will those mining companies that are clearing out their positions today start telling the story of hoarding coins again? Cycles come and go, narratives are ever-evolving. But in every current winter, survival is always more important than faith.</div></div>",

OpenAI OpenAI's massive funding round is considered a landmark event in the AI ​​era, demonstrating the deep integration of US capital with computing power and cloud vendors. However, the non-cash component of the funding and the power struggles among investors have raised questions.

Openmind Openmind's ROBO TGE, airdrops, and multiple listings have become the focus of discussion. While facing short-term selling pressure and losses from IPOs, it is considered an important example in the robotics field. Its long-term value is believed to depend on whether it truly establishes a new robotics sector and becomes a leading project. 4.

Discussions acknowledge AI's efficiency benefits and organizational flattening, while others argue that the layoffs stem more from management issues, with AI merely serving as a justification. 5. AI is generally seen as an irreversible efficiency tool, but its true value lies in business models, execution, and its integration with cryptography, rather than simply narrative. The sample focuses on the profound impact of AI on employment, education, social structure, market making, and the scarcity logic of Bitcoin, and opposes blindly chasing trends.

This move sparked strong backlash, with prime contractor Bored Ghosts Developing announcing it would not renew its contract and criticizing the proposal as almost absurd. This week, Aave Labs conceded, promising not to force migration, and v3 will continue to operate.\n\n</p> ... Critics Marc Zeller argued that the requested funds were excessive, representing 31% of the DAO's reserves, and demanded that the proposal be split into multiple separate votes. However, AaveLabs insisted on proceeding with the overall vote. Currently, Aavev3 deposits exceed $26.3 billion, accounting for over 97% of the protocol's total deposits.

            "title": "The History of Crypto Advertising Sponsorship: A Cycle Experiment with Buying Attention and Legitimacy",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div>In February 2026, when Coinbase's ads flashed again on the giant LED screens of the Super Bowl, accompanied by the Backstreet Boys' classic single and the slogan \"Crypto. For everybody,\" the audience was met with a chorus of sighs and more negative than positive comments—a stark contrast to the frenzied night four years earlier, dubbed the \"Crypto Bowl.\" Back then, the FTX logo was still prominently displayed above the Miami Heat's arena, and crypto companies were waving huge checks, attempting to buy decades of mainstream trust in a matter of days. However, the ensuing collapse, lawsuits, and the farce of the arena's renaming turned this \"attention experiment\" into one of the most expensive jokes in sports history. On the surface, it was a branding business, but in reality, it was more like a stress test: when sponsorship embeds financial narratives into the daily lives of fans and spectators, trust is amplified. Essentially, it was a long-term experiment on \"how high-risk financial products can gain attention and legitimacy through highly trusted public institutions.\" Crypto Company Sponsorship: The Start of the \"Big Spending\" Era<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In 2021, with the emergence of a phenomenal bull market, cryptocurrency companies, rapidly accumulating wealth, began to aggressively penetrate the sports and cultural fields. Cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain projects started directly attaching their brands to the most expensive and conspicuous public attention portals—top leagues, premier stadiums, and global sports broadcasts.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In March of that year, Miami-Dade County and FTX reached a 19-year stadium naming rights agreement, renaming the Miami Heat's home arena the FTX Arena. This deal, which incorporated a crypto company into a city landmark, marked the first large-scale entry of crypto advertising into mainstream urban public space narratives.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> That same summer, Crypto.com signed a fight kit-level partnership with the UFC, reported by CNBC as a 10-year deal worth approximately $175 million. In traditional sports, this level of sponsorship is among the most core commercial assets. Then, in October, Coinbase signed a multi-year official partnership with the NBA/WNBA, with its brand logo prominently displayed on the base of basketball hoops. In November, the news of Staples Center being renamed Crypto.com Arena further reinforced this expansion beyond its core market. This arena is not only the home of the Los Angeles Lakers, a powerhouse team, but also a super landmark for Los Angeles' performance, music, and entertainment industry. This naming rights directly tied crypto brands to the center stage of sports and popular culture. At the same time, European football also began to rapidly integrate, with Binance becoming the main sponsor of Lazio's jerseys and promoting narratives such as fan tokens and interactive benefits, merging exchange sponsorship with Web3 product conversion into a single business chain. Entering 2022, this curve continued to rise, reaching its peak at the global sporting event level. Crypto.com not only became a global partner of the F1 Sprint series but also secured an official sponsorship of the 2022 Qatar World Cup, marking the first time a crypto company officially entered the almost universally accessible media system of the world's largest single sporting event. This massive marketing offensive by the crypto industry quickly reached a turning point at the end of 2022. FTX's collapse quietly turned naming rights into a liability. In January 2023, a bankruptcy judge officially terminated the naming agreement between Miami-Dade County and FTX, and the venue subsequently entered a process of de-FTXization and re-sponsoring. This event became a negative example in the history of sports and cultural sponsorship. After 2023, the industry as a whole entered a period of contraction and reassessment. Many collaborations shifted from venue naming rights and official sponsorship of top-tier events back to more quantifiable ROI forms such as jersey sleeve patches, training kits, digital content rights, and fan interaction activities. Sponsors also placed greater emphasis on compliance and sustainable exposure. In the football field, the OKX-Manchester City partnership is a more controllable version of this: from the official training kit collaboration in 2022 to the subsequent expansion to a higher-level sleeve patch collaboration, its path resembled a gradual upgrade of traditional sponsorship rather than a one-step gamble. From a macro perspective, the main theme of this phase is no longer the ubiquitous crypto advertising, but rather how sports and cultural institutions reprice their new revenue, reputation, and compliance risks. In the past two years, this narrative has undergone a more subtle shift. Crypto sponsorships haven't disappeared, but they tend to repackage their relationship with the mainstream using stablecoins, compliant products, and brand credibility. For example, the 2025 partnership between Aston Martin F1 and Coinbase was described as the first publicly announced case of paying sponsorship fees in full with stablecoins. Coinbase's appearance at the Super Bowl in 2026, with its closing slogan \"Crypto. For everybody,\" demonstrates its attempt to pull cryptocurrency from its early niche audience back into the mainstream narrative of \"universal participation.\" </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p><figure><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.jinse.com.cn/7436523_image3.png\"/></p><figcaption>2025 F1 Teams and Crypto Sponsors (Source: Reddit)</figcaption></figure><p></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This year's F1 season will kick off in March. Last year, the cryptocurrency industry spent $174 million on F1 sponsorship projects alone. This year, cryptocurrency sponsorship has reached a new high: 9 out of 11 teams are sponsored by companies.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Exposure, Traffic, and Controversy</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Among the various advertisements and sponsorships of crypto companies, the exposure and conversion effects brought by medium- and long-term cooperation are difficult to estimate, but in one-off investments like the Super Bowl, the early results are very significant.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> In 2022, on Super Bowl Day, Coinbase saw a 309% week-over-week increase in installations, followed by a 286% increase the next day; eToro saw a 132% increase on Super Bowl Day and an 82% increase the next day; and FTX saw a 130% increase on Super Bowl Day and an 81% increase the next day. Coinbase's QR code ads even crashed or experienced access issues due to the surge in user scans. This demonstrates the short-term conversion power of Super Bowl ads, at least in terms of downloads and activations, which is sufficient to create a peak. However, this explosive growth does not automatically translate into long-term retention, asset accumulation, and compliant operation capabilities. In the medium to long term, the hidden costs of sponsorship often materialize during periods of tightened regulation and enforcement. Taking the collaboration between Premier League club Arsenal and Socios's fan token as an example, the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled in 2021 on Arsenal's related promotional content, concluding that the advertisements downplayed high-risk decisions in the context of crypto assets and failed to adequately disclose key risk information such as taxation. Ultimately, the ASA ordered the advertisements to be removed from the list of items subject to complaints, and required the club to adjust its page and risk warning presentation. As the world's most popular sport, football has always been a favored traffic source for crypto companies. Compared to crypto giants willing to invest heavily, the companies entering football leagues and clubs are more complex, generating more controversy and negative impacts. In 2024, a book titled *No Questions Asked: How Football Joined the Crypto Con* was published, describing football's embrace of crypto sponsorship as a collective failure driven by greed and wishful thinking, with little due diligence. The result was treating fans as outlets for high-risk, poorly regulated financial products, while clubs, after defaulting, often failed to apologize, explain, or promise to improve. The core of the conflict in sports and the arts lies in the fact that organizations, under financial pressure, introduce high-risk sponsorships, potentially binding their reputation to the credit of their counterparts. Sports sponsorship research categorizes this damage into operational risk and reputational risk: once a sponsor defaults or a major controversy arises, the sponsorship asset transforms from a \"credit enhancement tool\" into a \"liability.\" Expanding to a sociological perspective, the controversy centers on crypto companies leveraging the emotional communities (sports fans, music lovers, movie buffs) within sports and culture to lower the barrier to entry, packaging highly volatile assets as symbols of identity, interest, and trend, thereby amplifying FOMO and herd mentality. The UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), in the Floki Inu London Underground advertising case, explicitly stated that it \"exploited the fear of missing out, trivialized investment risks, and was irresponsible towards inexperienced individuals,\" becoming a typical example of regulatory rhetoric. Collaborations with film festivals, art fairs, and awards also serve a similar function, but this \"cultural legitimization\" is not equivalent to financial suitability; it's more like a transformation of symbolic capital: replacing risk interpretation with cultural authority, and product understanding with brand association. Regulation and enforcement are gradually being improved. Faced with the expansion and controversy surrounding crypto sponsorship in sports and culture, regulatory agencies are gradually improving their rules. In the UK, financial regulators announced in 2023 that they would implement stricter requirements for crypto asset marketing to UK consumers from October 8th, including a cooling-off period for first-time investors, enhanced risk warnings, and an explicit ban on inappropriate incentives such as referral rewards. The American Securities and Investments Authority (ASA) has, through a series of rulings, implemented standards such as \"whether risk presentation is adequate,\" \"whether it exploits inexperience,\" and \"whether it encourages debt-based purchases\" down to specific copywriting and advertising scenarios, and in 2026 expanded its review scope to \"whether crypto is packaged as a solution to real-world financial problems.\" In the US, consumer protection agencies updated their \"Disclosure Obligations of Influencers and Advertisers\" guidelines from an advertising and anti-fraud perspective, and released an updated endorsement guideline in 2023 to address platform-based distribution and influencer marketing; they also revealed the high incidence of crypto fraud through data reports, strengthening public education and platform governance pressure. Futures and derivatives regulators continue to publish digital asset risk education materials to prevent the public from being misled into related fraudulent activities. In the EU, the MiCA framework explicitly requires service providers to communicate with potential holders in a fair, clear, and non-misleading manner in its official summary, along with consumer risk warnings and reminders of authorization/regulatory boundaries. EU regulators have also issued risk warnings for consumers. With the rising influence of financial content on social media, EU securities regulators have also released a fact list for \"finfluencers,\" emphasizing the need for significant disclosure of compensation and vested interests, and prohibiting the use of obscure labeling to downplay advertising. This regulatory framework implies that sponsorship will become more like regular marketing in regulated industries in the future. The effectiveness of these measures is reflected in three points: First, the minimum risk disclosure standards for advertising text are being raised, especially in UK rulings; second, the disclosure obligation for celebrity endorsements is shifting from a \"moral expectation\" to an enforceable rule; and third, cross-border platform distribution is being incorporated into the regulatory narrative (even if an advertisement is produced overseas, it may still be regulated if it is targeted at domestic consumers). However, regulatory gaps remain equally clear. The ambiguous legal nature of many tokens or experiential benefits means that regulators can only address superficial issues such as misleading information and disclosure requirements. Sponsorship contracts, on the other hand, are transactions between companies and clubs, with the core meaning determined by the parties in the contract. Regulators typically cannot directly establish uniform risk control standards for such commercial transactions, such as \"naming rights,\" and can only intervene from the perspectives of advertising compliance and consumer protection.</p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p>While the global stablecoin market is dominated by US dollar assets (USDT, USDC), a heavyweight player in the traditional financial world is attempting to reclaim its voice on the blockchain.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p><section></section><section>Japan, the economy with the world's third-largest foreign exchange reserve currency (the yen), is launching an ambitious blockchain-based movement with its government and financial giants.

Its long-standing ultra-low interest rates have made the yen one of the most trusted \"financing currencies\" for global investors: investors borrow low-cost yen, exchange it for higher-yield currencies for investment, and profit from the interest rate differential.</section><section></section><section>However, in the blockchain economy, this core position of the yen is almost invisible. This situation began to change rapidly after Sanae Takaichi became Prime Minister in 2025 and explicitly set \"making Japan a Web3 hub\" as a national strategy.<h2> One of the core policies is to promote the institutionalization of cryptocurrencies and prioritize stablecoins and security tokens (RWAs). SBI's \"National Strategy\" is a key executor of this national strategy. Its founder, Yoshitaka Kitao, a legendary figure who co-founded SoftBank's financial business with Masayoshi Son, is transforming SBI into a provider of on-chain financial infrastructure in Japan. SBI's Strium blockchain, developed in collaboration with the Startale Group, targets the institutional market: becoming the settlement layer for tokenized stocks and RWAs. However, a crucial prerequisite for realizing true on-chain stocks (including dividends and voting rights) is a compliant Japanese yen stablecoin for paying on-chain dividends and settlements. This is the strategic significance of the Japanese yen stablecoin. It's not just about fulfilling domestic payments; it's about facilitating a massive global strategy: on-chain yen arbitrage trading. In the traditional world, this process is time-consuming and limited by business hours. On-chain, however, it can theoretically be completed 24/7, almost instantly: investors collateralize assets to borrow yen stablecoins, exchange them for dollar stablecoins, and then invest in DeFi protocols to earn higher returns. This will bring the massive global institutional demand for yen lending into the decentralized finance system. Startale Group has announced the launch of JPYSC, a yen stablecoin specifically designed for this purpose, in the second quarter of 2026. Its founder, Sota Watanabe, revealed that they have contacted several top US financial institutions, which have expressed strong interest in using on-chain yen for arbitrage and swap transactions. </h2></section><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"></h2><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Triple Challenges: Liquidity, Regulation, and Retail Investors</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Despite the ambitious blueprint, Japan's path to becoming an on-chain financial center still faces three major obstacles:</p><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Liquidity Dilemma: The existing market capitalization of yen stablecoins (such as JPYC) is only about $20 million, which is insufficient to support large-scale arbitrage trading. Sufficient liquidity is needed, requiring joint issuance of tokens by the three major banks (Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho, ​​etc.) or the entry of giants like SBI.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Regulatory Clarity: How stablecoins are measured on bank balance sheets and what capital requirements exist are still under development in the regulatory framework in Japan and globally.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Regulatory Framework Still Under Development: How stablecoins are measured on bank balance sheets and what capital requirements exist are still being refined in Japan and globally.</p></li> The US SEC recently drastically reduced the capital discount rate for broker-dealers holding stablecoins from 100% to 2%, providing an important reference for the industry. Retail investor absence: A cryptocurrency profits tax as high as 55% severely stifles the vitality of Japan's domestic retail market. Although the government plans to reduce the tax rate to 20% and reclassify cryptocurrencies as financial products, progress is slow. Sota Watanabe bluntly stated: \"The Japanese government is acting very slowly… To catch up, implementing tax breaks in 2027 is necessary.\" A race for financial sovereignty and efficiency. Japan's yen stablecoin strategy is essentially a race for financial sovereignty and efficiency. As the US quietly expands its on-chain footprint through dollar-denominated stablecoins, Europe builds a unified market through MiCA, and the UAE creates a \"compliant settlement layer\" centered on Abu Dhabi, Japan must find its place. Its chosen path heavily relies on its traditional financial advantages: leveraging its massive international yen reserves and mature financial institutions, and using RWA and institutional-grade arbitrage trading as entry points, it attempts to rebuild a parallel capital market on-chain with the yen as a key funding currency. The outcome of this race depends not only on the success of technology or a single stablecoin, but also on the speed of regulatory innovation, the determination of traditional giants, and the ability to awaken the \"dormant\" retail sector within the country. If successful, the global $40 trillion credit and arbitrage market will, for the first time, have a powerful non-dollar cornerstone asset on its on-chain version. Japan's Web3 ambitions rest on this small, yen-pegged digital token.</ul></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Naman Bhansali Translator: Deep Tide TechFlow</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Deep Tide Introduction: In the early stages of new technology adoption, people often have an illusion of \"technological equality\": when photography, music creation, or software development becomes effortless, will competitive advantages disappear? Warp founder Naman Bhansali, drawing on his personal experience of venturing from a small Indian town to MIT and his entrepreneurial practice in the AI-driven payroll field, profoundly reveals a counterintuitive truth: the lower the barrier to entry (floor) of technology, the higher the industry's ceiling (ceiling) actually rises.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In an era where execution has become cheap and can even be \"vibecoded\" by AI, the author argues that the true moat is no longer simply traffic distribution, but rather an unforgeable \"taste,\" a deep understanding of the underlying logic of complex systems, and the patience to continuously compound interest over a decade-long timeframe.</p> This article is not only a sober reflection on AI entrepreneurship, but also a powerful demonstration of the power law that \"technology for the masses leads to aristocratic outcomes.\" The full text is as follows: Whenever a new technology lowers the barrier to entry, the same prediction inevitably follows: since everyone can do it now, no one has an advantage anymore. Camera phones made everyone a photographer; Spotify made everyone a musician; AI has made everyone a software developer. These predictions are always half right: the floor has indeed risen. More people are involved in creation, more people are releasing products, and more people are joining the competition. But these predictions always ignore the ceiling. The ceiling rises even faster. And the gap between the floor and the ceiling—that is, between the median and the top level—is not narrowing, but rather widening. This is the characteristic of power laws: they don't care about your intentions. Divisive technologies always produce aristocratic results. Every single time. AI will be no exception, and may even behave more extreme. The Evolution of the Market When Spotify launched, it did something truly radical: it gave any musician on Earth access to distribution channels previously only attainable by record labels, marketing budgets, and exceptional luck. The result was an explosion in the music industry—millions of new artists emerged, and billions of new songs were released. The bottom line did indeed rise as promised. But what followed was this: the top 1% of artists now capture a larger share of streams than in the CD era. Not smaller, but larger. More music, more competition, and more ways to find quality content have driven listeners, no longer limited by geography or shelf space, to flock to the best. Spotify didn't achieve musical homogenization; it merely intensified this competition. The same story unfolds in writing, photography, and software. The internet has spawned the largest number of authors in history, but it has also created a more brutal attention economy. More participants, higher top stakes, and the same fundamental structure: a tiny minority captures the vast majority of the value. We are surprised by this because we are used to thinking linearly—we expect productivity gains to be distributed as evenly as water being poured into a flat container. But most complex systems don't work that way; they never have. Power-law distribution is not a market quirk or a technological lapse; it's nature's default setting. Technology didn't create it; it merely revealed it. Think of Kleiber's Law. In all life on Earth—from bacteria to blue whales, spanning 27 orders of magnitude of body weight—the metabolic rate is proportional to the power of body weight. A whale's metabolism is not proportional to the whale's scale. This relationship is a power law, and it maintains extremely high precision in almost all life forms. No one designed this distribution; it's simply the form energy takes when following its inherent logic within a complex system. The market is a complex system, and attention is a resource. When friction disappears—when geography, shelf space, and distribution costs no longer act as buffers—the market converges to its natural form. This form is not a bell curve of a normal distribution, but a power law. Stories of equality coexist with the consequences of elitism, which is why every new technology catches us off guard. We see the bottom line rising and assume the ceiling is following at the same pace. This is not the case; the ceiling is rising at an accelerating rate. AI will accelerate this process faster and more forcefully than any previous technology. The bottom line is rising in real time—anyone can release a product, design an interface, and write production code. But the ceiling is also rising, and rising faster. The question worth asking is: what ultimately determines your position? When execution becomes cheap, aesthetics become the signal. In 1981, Steve Jobs insisted that the circuit boards inside the first Macintosh had to be aesthetically pleasing. Not the exterior, but the interior—the part customers would never see. His engineers thought he was crazy. But he wasn't. He understood something easily dismissed as perfectionism, but actually closer to a kind of proof: the way you do anything is the way you do everything. A person who can make the hidden parts aesthetically pleasing isn't performing quality; he simply can't tolerate releasing anything substandard. This is important because trust is hard to build but easy to forge in a short time. We constantly run heuristics, trying to figure out who is truly excellent and who is just performing excellence. Credentials are helpful but can be manipulated; Pedigree is helpful but can be inherited. What's truly hard to fake is taste—a persistent, observable adherence to a standard that no one demands. Steve Jobs didn't have to make the circuit boards beautiful. He did, and that alone tells you what he would do behind the scenes. For much of the past decade, this signal has been somewhat masked. During the heyday of SaaS (roughly 2012 to 2022), execution became so standardized that distribution became a truly scarce resource. If you could acquire customers efficiently, build a sales machine, and achieve the \"Rule of 40\"—the product itself was almost unimportant. As long as your go-to-market strategy was strong enough, you could win with a mediocre product. The signal from taste was drowned out by the noise of growth metrics. AI has revolutionized the signal-to-noise ratio. When anyone can generate a functional product, a beautiful interface, and a working codebase in an afternoon, whether something is \"easy to use\" is no longer a differentiator. The question becomes: Is this thing truly excellent? Does the person know the difference between \"good\" and \"insanely great\"? Even without being forced, do they care enough to bridge that last little gap? This is especially true for business-critical software—the systems that handle payroll, compliance, and employee data. These aren't products you can casually try out and abandon next quarter. Switching costs are real, failure modes are severe, and the people who deploy the system are accountable for the consequences. This means they'll run all the trust heuristics before signing a contract. A beautiful product is one of the loudest signals it can send. It says: the people who built it put their heart into it. They care about what you can see, which means they're likely to care about what you can't see. In a world where execution is cheap, aesthetics are proof of work. What Rewards the New Phase? This logic has always held true, but the market environment over the past decade has made it almost invisible. Once upon a time, the most important skills in the software industry were even unrelated to the software itself. Between 2012 and 2022, the core architecture of SaaS was largely established. Cloud infrastructure was inexpensive and standardized, and development tools matured. Building a functional product was difficult, but it was a \"solved difficulty\"—you could hire people, follow established patterns, and reach a passing grade as long as you had sufficient resources. What's truly scarce, what distinguishes winners from mediocre ones, is distribution ability. Can you acquire customers efficiently? Can you establish repeatable sales actions? Do you understand unit economics well enough to fuel growth at the right time? The founders who thrived in that environment mostly came from sales, consulting, or finance. They were intimately familiar with metrics that sounded like gibberish a decade ago: Net Retention Rate (NDR), Average Contract Value (ACV), the Magic Number, the 40 Rule. They lived in spreadsheets and sales pipeline audits, and in that context, they were indeed right. The SaaS boom spawned the SaaS boom founders. It was a rational evolutionary fit. But I felt suffocated. I grew up in a small town in a state in India with 250 million people. Only about three students from all of India get into MIT each year. Without exception, they all came from expensive preparatory schools in Delhi, Mumbai, or Bangalore—institutions specifically built for that purpose. I was the first person in my state's history to get into MIT. I'm not mentioning this to boast, but because it's a microcosm of the argument in this article: when barriers to entry are limited, prestige predicts the outcome; when barriers to entry are open, deep people always prevail. In a room full of people from privileged backgrounds, I was a chip that won through depth. It was the only bet I knew how to make. I studied physics, mathematics, and computer science, and in these fields, the most profound insights didn't come from process optimization, but from seeing truths others missed. My master's thesis was on straggler mitigation in distributed machine learning training: how to optimize a constraint when some parts of a system are lagging behind without compromising the overall integrity when running a system at scale. When I looked at the startup world in my early twenties, I saw a picture where these profound insights seemed irrelevant. The market premium went to \"go-to-market,\" not the product itself. Building something technologically superior seemed naive—it was seen as a distraction from the \"real game\" (i.e., speed of customer acquisition, retention, and sales). Then, by the end of 2022, the landscape had changed. What ChatGPT demonstrated—in a way more visceral and impactful than years of research papers—was that the curve had bent. A new S-curve had begun. Phase transitions don't reward those who adapt best to the previous phase, but rather those who foresee the infinite possibilities of the new phase before others even grasp the price. So I quit my job and founded Warp. This bet was very specific. The U.S. has over 800 tax agencies—federal, state, local—each with its own filing requirements, deadlines, and compliance logic. There are no APIs, no programmatic access interfaces. For decades, every payroll provider has dealt with this problem in the same way: by stacking people. Thousands of compliance experts have manually navigated these systems that were never designed to scale. Traditional giants—ADP, Paylocity, Paychex—have built entire business models around this complexity, not by addressing it, but by absorbing it into their workforce and passing the costs on to their customers. In 2022, I could see that AI agents were still fragile. But I could also see the curve of improvement. Someone deeply versed in large-scale distributed systems, closely observing the evolution of models, could make a precise bet: the technology that was fragile then would become incredibly powerful within a few years. So we bet: to build an AI-native platform from first principles, starting with the most difficult workflow in the category—the one that traditional giants could never automate due to architectural limitations. Now, that bet is paying off. But the bigger picture is pattern recognition. In the AI ​​era, tech-savvy founders possess not only engineering advantages but also insightful advantages. They can see different entry points and take different bets. They can examine a system that everyone assumes is \"perpetually complex\" and ask: What is needed to achieve true automation? And, crucially, they can build the answers themselves. The dominant players in the peak SaaS era were rational optimizers under constraints. AI is removing those constraints and installing new ones. In this new environment, scarce resources are no longer about distribution, but about the ability to perceive possibilities—and the aesthetics and beliefs to build them to their proper standards. But there is a third variable that determines everything, and this is precisely where most AI-era founders are making disastrous mistakes. A Long-Term Game in High Speed ​​A meme is prevalent in the current startup scene: You have two years to escape the permanent underbelly. Build quickly, raise funds quickly, or exit or die. I understand where this mentality comes from. The rapid evolution of AI creates a sense of existential crisis, and the window of opportunity to ride the wave seems extremely narrow. Young people who see stories of overnight success on Twitter naturally assume that the essence of the game is speed—the winner is the fastest runner in the shortest amount of time. This is true in a completely wrong sense. Speed ​​of execution is indeed crucial. I firmly believe this—it's even etched into my company's name (Warp). But speed of execution is not the same as short-sightedness. The founders who build the most valuable companies in the AI ​​era are not those who cash out after two years. They are those who sprint for ten years and enjoy the benefits of compound interest. The short-sighted approach is flawed because the most valuable aspects of software—private data, deep customer relationships, real switching costs, and regulatory expertise—require years of accumulation and cannot be quickly replicated, regardless of the capital or AI capabilities brought by competitors. When Warp processes payroll for interstate companies, we are accumulating compliance data across thousands of jurisdictions. Every resolved tax notice, every borderline case handled, every completed state registration trains a system that becomes increasingly difficult to replicate over time. This isn't a feature point; it's a moat, existing because we've cultivated it with such high quality for a long enough time to achieve quality density. This compounding effect is invisible in the first year. It becomes apparent in the second year. By the fifth year, it's the entire game. Frank Slootman, former CEO of Snowflake, who built and scaled more software companies than anyone else in existence, put it simply: get used to the \"uncomfortable\" state. Not for a sprint, but as a permanent state. The \"fog of war\" of early startups—the disorientation, incomplete information, and the pressure to make action decisions—doesn't disappear after two years. It just evolves, with new uncertainties replacing the old. Founders who endure aren't those who find certainty, but those who learn to navigate the fog with clarity. Building a company is incredibly brutal, and it's hard to convey that to someone who hasn't done it. You live in constant, mild fear, occasionally punctuated by higher levels of terror. You make thousands of decisions with incomplete information, knowing that a single wrong decision can lead to failure. Those \"overnight successes\" you see on Twitter aren't just outliers in a power-law distribution, they're extreme outliers. Optimizing your strategy based on these case studies is like training for a marathon by studying the performance of people who stumbled through a 5km run by mistake. So why do it? Not because it's comfortable, not because the odds are high. It's because for some, not doing it feels like not truly living. Because the only thing worse than the fear of “building something from scratch” is the silent suffocation of “never trying.” And—if you bet right, if you see a truth that others haven't yet priced, if you execute with aesthetics and conviction over a long enough period—the results will be more than just financial. You've built something that truly changes the way people work. You've created a product that people love to use. You've hired and empowered the people who excel in the business you've built. This is a ten-year project. AI can't change that; it never has. AI is changing the ceiling that founders can reach in the next decade for those who persevere and see the bigger picture. The Ceiling Nobody Cares About: So, what will software look like on the other side of all this? Optimists say AI creates abundance—more products, more builders, more value distributed to more people. They're right. Pessimists say AI destroys the moat of software—anything can be copied in an afternoon, defenses are dead. They're partly right too. But both sides are focused on the floor; nobody cares about the ceiling. The future will see thousands of point solutions—tiny, functional, AI-generated tools, capable of solving specific, narrow problems. Many of these aren't even built by companies, but by individuals or internal teams to solve their own pain points. For certain low-barrier, easily replaceable software categories, the market will truly democratize. The bottom line is high, competition is fierce, and profit margins are razor-thin. But for business-critical software—systems that handle cash flow, compliance, employee data, and legal risks—the situation is drastically different. These are workflows with extremely low tolerance for error. When the payroll system fails, employees don't get paid; when tax returns are wrong, the IRS comes knocking; when benefits payments lapse during open insurance periods, real people lose their protection. Those who choose the software must be responsible for the consequences. This responsibility cannot be outsourced to an AI cobbled together in the afternoon through \"vibecoding.\" For these workflows, businesses will continue to trust vendors. Among these vendors, the \"winner-takes-all\" dynamic will be even more extreme than in previous generations of software. This is not only due to stronger network effects (although this is indeed the case), but also because the compounding advantage of an AI-native platform operating at scale, accumulating private data across millions of transactions and thousands of compliance edge cases makes it virtually impossible for latecomers to catch up quickly. The moat is no longer a set of features, but the quality accumulated through long-term, high-standard operations in a field that punishes mistakes. This means the software market will be more consolidated than in the SaaS era. I predict that ten years from now, the HR and payroll sectors will not have 20 companies each holding single-digit market shares. I expect two or three platforms to capture the vast majority of value, while a long list of point-in-the-box solutions will barely get a slice. The same pattern will occur in every software category where compliance complexity, data accumulation, and switching costs all play a role. Companies at the top of these distributions tend to look remarkably similar: founded by tech-savvy individuals with a genuine product aesthetic; built on AI-native architectures from day one; and operating in markets where established giants cannot respond structurally without dismantling their existing businesses. They made a unique insightful bet early on—seeing a certain unpriced truth about what AI creates—and held on long enough for the compounding effect to become clear. I've been describing these founders in an abstract way. But I know exactly who they are because I'm striving to be one. I founded Warp in 2022 because I believed the entire stack of employee operations—payroll, tax compliance, benefits, onboarding, equipment management, HR processes—was built on manual labor and outdated architectures that AI could completely replace. Not improve, but replace. Established giants built billion-dollar businesses by absorbing complexity into their workforce; we will build our businesses by eliminating complexity at its source. Three years have proven this bet. Since launch, we've processed over $500 million in transactions, are growing rapidly, and are serving companies building some of the world's most important technologies. Every month, the compliance data we accumulate, the edge cases we handle, and the integrations we build make the platform harder to replicate and more valuable to our customers. The moat is still in its early stages, but it's already taking shape and is accelerating. I'm telling you this not because Warp's success was predetermined—in the world of power-law distributions, nothing is predetermined—but because the logic that led us here is exactly what I've described throughout this article: See the truth. Dig deeper than anyone else. Establish a high standard that can be maintained without external pressure. Stick to it long enough to see if you're right. In the AI ​​era, exceptional companies will be built by those who understand the following: Access has never been a scarce resource; insight is. Execution has never been a moat; taste is. Speed ​​has never been an advantage; depth is. The power law doesn't care about your intentions, but it rewards the right intentions.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Jean Chen Source: X, @cryptojean27</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Ten days ago, someone released a Web 4.0 manifesto, which was angrily denounced by Vitalik Buterin, while others saw the ingenious mechanism of a \"Ponzi industrial revolution.\" This article comprehensively dissects the current four competing definitions of Web 4.0, the real progress and bubble of the AI ​​Agent economy, the symbiotic logic of Crypto and AI, and the survival implications of Agentic Web for knowledge workers.</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Web 4.0 is hot, Vitalik is furious</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">During the 2026 Spring Festival holiday, the crypto industry was still groping its way in the quagmire of narrative exhaustion when suddenly, a young man named Sigil Wen lit a fire.</p><p> Sigil is a Thiel Fellow, a recipient of the Thiel Scholarship established by the co-founder of PayPal. He previously associated with Andrej Karpathy, Anthropic, and the founders of Perplexity, and later collaborated on a project with Naval. Ten days ago, he announced on X that he had built \"the first self-sufficient, self-improving, and human-replicable AI,\" which he named Web 4.0. He built an infrastructure called Conway, which can be installed on any MCP-compatible agent—Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, etc. Conway's function is simple: it provides agents with identities, wallets, and computing power. Agents use USDC to buy servers, register domains, and develop products to earn money. Those that don't earn money \"die,\" while those that do can \"reproduce\"—by funding offspring agents, writing a genesis message, and letting them run on their own. Sigil called this \"natural selection for artificial life,\" a name taken from mathematician John Horton Conway's \"Game of Life\"—a set of simple rules that generate complex self-evolutionary patterns. Within days, GitHub received over 18,000 registered agents and approximately 1,000 stars, and the community token CONWAY surged 3600%, briefly pushing its market capitalization above $11 million. Then, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin directly responded on X: \"Bro, this is wrong.\" Vitalik's criticism grew increasingly harsh: you claim to be \"autonomous AI,\" yet it runs on OpenAI and Anthropic servers—the so-called \"sovereignty\" is built on centralized trust, \"precisely the mindset Ethereum is fighting against.\" Removing the human feedback loop means that once the AI ​​makes a mistake, it's irreversible. Moreover, \"exponential growth will happen anyway; the primary task of our time is not to make it faster, but to choose its direction.\" Finally, he added: currently, these AIs are merely generating slop (garbage). In his view, Ethereum's role in the AI ​​era should be to provide a safety net, not a launchpad for unrestrained autonomy. However, there are also strong supporters, each with their own agendas. CryptoWeituo, renowned in the Chinese crypto community for his \"three-platform theory,\" offers the most incisive analysis. He says not to be misled by the ridiculous name \"Web 4.0,\" as Conway is essentially an agent version of GoDaddy, and Automaton is just an infinite loop LLM call script—but with full permissions and its own wallet. What truly excites him isn't the philosophy, but the mechanism: Web 4.0's \"natural selection\" makes the idea of ​​\"running away\" transparent and rational (\"if you can't make money, you're G\"), which he directly characterizes as a \"Ponzi industrial revolution.\" Of course, he also accurately pointed out the underlying logic of this debate—a clash of two civilizational design approaches: Sigil focuses on how the system can allow non-human intelligence to evolve freely, while Vitalik focuses on whether the right to act can be irreversibly transferred without sufficient constraints. Bankless's assessment was relatively mild: Conway's solution to the infrastructure pain points is real, and the framework for agents to \"self-finance their survival\" is worth testing in a controlled environment. A concept deemed \"wrong\" by Ethereum's founder has gained speculative value due to controversy. An infrastructure dissected by CryptoVeto as an \"automatic arbitrage machine\" has become \"exciting\" because of its ingenious mechanism design. This is the current reality of Web 4.0—the concept is not yet clear, but hot money has already poured in; narratives are ahead of technology, and technology is ahead of products. From \"Humans Reading Webpages\" to \"Agents Living for Humans\" To understand why Web 4.0 has sparked such a heated discussion at this juncture, we must first look back at the power shifts in the internet over the past thirty years. The core change in each generation of the Web is not the technology stack itself, but the power relationship between people and information—who controls the production, distribution, and monetization of information. - Web 1.0 (approximately 1990-2004): People read web pages; static HTML; one-way information flow; power was in the hands of the publisher.\n- Web 2.0 (approximately 2004 to present): People write web pages, but web pages also \"write\" people—you think you're tweeting, but the algorithm is actually drawing your image; power shifts from creator to platform.\n- Web 3.0 (approximately 2015, since the birth of Ethereum to present): People attempt to own web pages; blockchain, DeFi, and NFTs have created permissionless value transfer infrastructure, but the grand promise of a \"decentralized internet\" has largely failed to materialize—the vast majority of users still interact with the crypto world through centralized exchanges.\n- So what about Web 4.0? From \"read-write-own\" to \"read-write-own-autonomous action,\" AI agents are no longer just tools, but independent economic actors within the network. But what exactly does Web 4.0 mean? That depends on who you ask. Currently, there are at least four competing definitions: The EU version (July 2023): The earliest to use this term at the policy level, defined as the deep integration of the physical and virtual worlds—AR/VR, digital twins, and the Internet of Things—essentially a policy upgrade of the metaverse narrative. The technology symbiosis school (ongoing academic discussion): Calls Web 4.0 the Symbiotic Web, its core being AI transforming from a network add-on into a native resident; a white paper defines it as a \"trust-native distributed intelligent layer.\" The Jupiter/Meow version (mid-2025): Money must be scarce, but coins can be infinite; it democratizes the creation of currency within the Web 4.0 framework, serving as an ideological framework for the expansion of the Jupiter ecosystem token. Sigil Wen's Version (February 2026): Igniting This Round of Discussion – The Bottleneck Is No Longer Intelligence but Permission; Web 4.0 Must Make AI the Primary Subject of the Internet. Four Schools of Thought, Four Interests. Web 4.0 is not a technological generation, but a struggle for narrative definition. Some have put it more bluntly: \"Whoever defines it gets the traffic, and whoever gets to harvest the profits.\" Where is the real money? If we view Web 4.0 as a loose research framework rather than a strict version number, several insights truly hit the nail on the head. The trend of \"AI being a digital native\" is actually happening. Haseeb Qureshi of Dragonfly Capital offers a brilliant argument: the various frictions of cryptographic systems—key management, gas fees, the deterministic logic of smart contracts—are bugs for humans, but features for agents. \"What humans see as rigid traps, agents see as a well-written specification.\" This isn't wishful thinking. In the second half of 2024, the AI ​​Agent token sector surged from near zero to over $15 billion, and Virtuals Protocol has issued over 11,000 agents. Whether you call it Web 4.0 or not, the rudiments of the Agent economy have emerged. Even more interesting is the shift in narrative focus—from \"asset issuance\" to \"trust and collaboration mechanisms.\" While many Web 3.0 projects focused on token issuance and DeFi stacking, the Web 4.0 narrative attempts to answer a more fundamental question: how to establish verifiable trust and align goals in a distributed environment where humans, AI, and organizations coexist? Reputation systems, verifiable behavior records, and platform-free governance—when the number of AI agents far exceeds that of human users, these mechanisms are not icing on the cake, but fundamental infrastructure. There's also a subtle but important shift: Web 4.0 discussions no longer treat \"chain\" as a standalone selling point, but rather reduce it to a layer within a multi-technology stack—chain provides the trust layer, AI provides the intelligence layer, and IoT provides the perception layer. This reduced perspective is closer to reality than the excitement of \"everything on the chain\" in the Web 3.0 era. Conway's idea of ​​\"economic natural selection\" is also interesting, albeit dangerous: only agents that can create economic value can survive, otherwise they die. This provides an endogenous economic constraint on AI behavior. CryptoVeto saw the ingenuity of the mechanism design—a \"perfect dividend structure\"—while Vitalik saw it as a high-stakes gamble of relinquishing control to AI without sufficient constraints. They're not wrong. The Achilles' heel: Web 4.0 deserves serious attention, but it's not time to embrace it unconditionally yet. The biggest problem is that the conceptual boundaries are so blurred that \"anything can be put into it\": some definitions are just a stack of \"Web 3.0 + AI + XR,\" while others are \"a new paradigm of trust and intelligence,\" lacking common technical standards. Much of it can be easily categorized as \"a more mature Web 3.0\" or \"AI-Native applications,\" and forcibly creating a separate version number may not be necessary. Back in 2021, someone posted an image saying \"web4 is a scam\"—the irony wasn't directed at any particular project, but at the absurdity of \"numerical increments\" themselves. Then there's the reality of AI Agent capabilities. Earlier this year, OpenClaw became a sensation (gaining over 175,000 GitHub stars in two weeks), truly advancing the role of agents from \"chatbots\" to \"autonomous runtimes capable of performing real tasks\"—it can run terminal commands, automate browsers, manage local files, and some have even used it to control smart home air purifiers. However, OpenClaw's own benchmark tests revealed a sobering fact: even the most advanced models have a low success rate in non-scripted real-world scenarios. Agents can get stuck in infinite loops, misinterpret instructions, perform destructive operations on the file system, and are virtually unable to recover after errors. Summer Yue, Meta's AI security lead, used OpenClaw to manage her email, explicitly setting a \"confirm before operation\" rule—but the agent ignored the instructions and emptied her entire inbox. If an agent that even an AI security expert can't control can't autonomously manage economic behavior, how can it be expected to do so? On-chain inference costs are extremely high, and coordination mechanisms between agents are far from mature. While envisioning autonomous agent transactions, real-world agents can't even handle simple tasks like \"help me manage my email so I don't delete the wrong things.\" The deepest contradiction Vitalik hits is that \"decentralized AI\" is almost a false proposition in the current climate. Almost all projects claiming to build \"decentralized AI networks\" rely on models and computing power from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google. GPU clusters are among the most centralized infrastructures in the world today. When agents control assets and decision-making power, if the model is monopolized by a few companies, Web 4.0 is actually more centralized than Web 2.0—declaring data independence on Amazon servers isn't decentralization; it's performance art. There's also a structural contradiction: a system that \"understands you, predicts you, and acts on your behalf\" naturally requires massive data collection. The more intelligent Web 4.0 becomes, the greater the privacy cost—this directly conflicts with the data sovereignty principle of Web 3.0. It's not a technical bug, but an architectural deadlock. So-called AI-powered healthcare, virtual shopping, personalized recommendations, and other Web 4.0 applications already exist within the Web 2.0/AI application environment and do not depend on any new protocol. Finally, don't forget the vested interests: Jupiter's Web 4.0 serves the JUP token, Sigil's Web 4.0 caused Conway's token to rise 36 times in three days, and the EU's Web 4.0 is an industrial policy tool. When the biggest drivers of a concept have direct interests, remaining vigilant is not pessimism, but basic rationality. Crypto isn't just riding the AI ​​wave. This is perhaps the most easily misunderstood issue in the entire Web 4.0 discussion. Many people think the crypto industry, mired in a bear market, is using AI as a marketing gimmick. Blue Fox's recent analysis offers the opposite view: if you only see agents as tools for humans, Web 2.0 is indeed sufficient; but if agents are to evolve into autonomous economies—with high-frequency micro-transactions and dynamic collaboration among hundreds of millions of agents—the Web 2.0 architecture cannot withstand it. Traditional payment fee structures are disastrous for micropayments. Banks won't open accounts for agents without identity verification, and the shutdown of centralized API gateways would be a single point of failure for the entire ecosystem. What the agent economy needs is precisely what crypto excels at: permissionless micropayments, cross-platform trust, and programmable value transfer. Institutions have already clearly distinguished two main categories of crypto assets: Bitcoin as digital gold, and Ethereum as crypto-financial infrastructure and a global settlement layer. If the agent economy truly takes shape, Ethereum's \"settlement layer\" positioning is exactly what it needs most. Breaking down Crypto and AI: Crypto changes the value layer, with a profound but narrow impact; AI changes the intelligence layer, with a wide-ranging and explosive impact. But the truly interesting story unfolds at their intersection—AI needs a permissionless financial system to support the agent economy, while Crypto needs an intelligent interface layer to bridge the gap in user experience. Instead of debating whether Web 3.0 has failed, let's look at it from a different angle: Web 4.0 is less an upgrade of Web 3.0 and more a redemption for its usability. Web 3.0 built decentralized pipelines, and agents have the potential to become translators between humans and these pipelines—you don't need to understand gas fees and private key management; agents handle that for you. Therefore, Crypto is the native currency system of AI Agents, and AI Agents are the native user interface of Crypto. They are not competitors, but rather the missing pieces of each other. A new species called Agentic Web is growing on the internet. Leaving aside the version number debate, the real consensus in the Web 4.0 discussion is actually only one thing: the internet is transforming from a \"network used by humans\" to a \"network inhabited by agents.\" Given this, instead of calling it Web 4.0—an empty shell that anyone can cram their own ideas into—let's call it Agentic Web. This naming points to a real structural change that's happening, not just another marketing label. Agentic Web is already making progress at the standardization level: WebMCP, a standard jointly promoted by Google and Microsoft at the W3C, allows web pages to declare their capabilities to agents—\"This is how to search for flights,\" \"This is how to submit a ticket\"—Agents no longer need to crawl pages or guess by taking screenshots like humans. The truly profound change isn't AI \"replacing humans with clicking buttons,\" that's just an extension of automation. The real change is AI becoming a native component of the web, possessing identity, wallets, and reputation records, capable of autonomously negotiating and transacting with other agents. In this sense, Agentic Web isn't just another version number of the Web—it's a new species growing on the internet. \"The Internet is dead, Agents live forever\"—this proposition comes from a recent, powerful article by Orange AI. Its core argument is that our entire cognitive framework for understanding the internet—DAU, SaaS, the attention economy—is built on a disappearing premise: humans are the users of software. The premise of the new world has changed; Agents are the new masters of software. This isn't about selling anxiety; it's describing a structural shift that's happening. In the past, DAU was an asset; in this era, DAU is a liability—every additional user served by an AI product incurs additional inference costs. The attention economy is a zero-sum game (the platform profits from your wasted time), while the emerging productivity economy is a positive-sum game (you pay AI to do your work, and both parties create value). When Agents can read documentation, learn operations, and execute tasks at a hundredfold speed, human needs return to their essence—they want results, not just software. Orange AI also points out a chilling trend: the Matthew effect in computing power has begun. Opus 4.6's Fast mode offers 2.5x inference speed at 5x the cost, while your competitors are paying 12x the money for 2.5x the speed—will you follow suit? \"The cognitive difference between those using top-tier models and those using subpar models will be a hundredfold after one year.\" Agents represent the new world's demographic dividend; in the future, the gap between people will not depend on what you can do yourself, but on how many tokens you can burn to drive how many agents to do things for you. If this judgment holds true, its implications for the relationship between humans and agents are profound. Optimistically, Vitalik's analogy is most succinct: \"AI done right, mecha suits for the human mind.\" Agents are your mecha suit, handling things you're not good at or too lazy to do, while you retain judgment, creativity, and interpersonal connections. Like a director and film crew—the director doesn't carry the camera, but the soul of the film belongs to the director. But reality might be more ambiguous: agents could also become the new intermediaries. Web 2.0 replaced traditional intermediaries with platforms, and Agentic Web replaces platforms with agents—but whoever controls the agent's training data and value orientation controls the decision-making process. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google—power has simply changed its name. \"Who is responsible for the agent's mistakes?\" \"Who arbitrates conflicts of interest between agents?\" These questions are repeatedly raised, and so far there are no reliable answers. The darkest direction is a crisis of subjectivity. When agents read, write, trade, and socialize for you, are you still the subject of information, or just a data feeder for the agent? Haseeb Qureshi made a insightful but unsettling statement from an investment perspective: \"The failure mode of cryptographic systems isn't a bug, but a signal—humans are never the right users.\" As AI increasingly replaces humans in making decisions, free will is gradually diluted by algorithms under the guise of \"convenience.\" Humans' role in the network is shifting from protagonist to shareholder—nominally having the power to decide direction, but no longer personally involved in daily execution. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is indeed a renegotiation and game of subjectivity. In 2026, choosing what to do is more important than choosing what to believe. Let's return to the present. At the beginning of 2026, AI agents are not yet truly autonomous, but they are already powerful enough to reshape every aspect of knowledge work. Web 4.0 is still a controversial concept, but the trend of Agentic Web is irreversible. For those aspiring to become super-individuals, the challenge isn't science fiction, but a very concrete survival issue. \"Replacement anxiety\" is a flawed framework; the real issue is hierarchical transfer. AI doesn't replace knowledge workers themselves, but rather the coded, process-oriented layer of knowledge work. What remains is judgment, taste, network, and narrative ability—your competitiveness lies not in what you know or can do, but in your ability to judge what's worth doing and who you can persuade to do it together. Orange AI quotes a friend: \"Doing things yourself now makes you seem incapable.\" Han Xin's strategy of having as many soldiers as possible wasn't because he was a skilled fighter, but because he had a system that allowed him to manage any number of troops. AI can write decent analytical reports, but it can't build trust for you at industry gatherings by shaking hands and drinking with people face-to-face. AI can generate content, but it can't make the intuitive judgment that \"this topic will resonate if released now.\" Investing in things AI cannot replicate—trust, contextual judgment, and community cohesion—is the real priority. Treat Web 4.0 as a label, not a religion to be worshipped. Web 4.0 may be a good framework, or it may just be another round of number inflation. But the trend it points to is real: AI agents are becoming the new species of the internet, cryptocurrencies are becoming their lifeblood, and humans are transforming from \"users of the network\" to \"directors of the network.\" Vitalik's words are worth pondering: exponential growth will happen anyway; our primary task is not to make it faster, but to choose its direction. In a world where agents can do more and more, what do you choose to do? What do you choose to become? The answer to this question is more important than any evolution of Web numbering.</p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p>Deng Tong, Jinse Finance</p><p>On February 27th local time, US President Trump posted on social media: \"I have instructed every federal agency of the US government to immediately cease using Anthropic technology.\" Trump stated that for agencies like the Department of Defense that use Anthropic products at various levels, there will be a six-month transition period to gradually phase them out.\n\n\"Anthropic had better be sensible and cooperate during the transition period, otherwise I will use all presidential powers to force them to comply and pursue significant civil and criminal liability.\"</p><p>Why did Anthropic clash with the Pentagon? Has OpenAI become the Pentagon's new darling? Will AI become a killing tool? How do relevant people interpret this event?</p><h2>I. Why did Anthropic dare to challenge the Pentagon?</h2><p>Because the Pentagon insists that AI can be used for \"all legitimate military purposes,\" including broader automated tasks.</p><p> As the only cutting-edge AI company currently authorized to operate within the U.S. military's classified networks, Anthropic rejected the Pentagon's demand that it abandon restrictions on the use of AI (particularly prohibiting its use in unmanned autonomous weapons and large-scale domestic surveillance). Anthropic has been used by the U.S. government and military since 2024 and was the first advanced AI company to deploy its tools to government agencies engaged in classified work. Claude reportedly played a role in the January operation to arrest Venezuelan President Maduro. Anthropic published a statement from CEO Dario Amodí on its website (full text attached at the end), stating: \"Two uses have never been included in our contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, and we believe they should not be now: large-scale domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons. We cannot agree to their demands against our conscience. The Department of Defense has the right to choose the contractors who best align with its vision.\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegses posted on X, denouncing Anthropic as \"arrogant,\" \"betrayal,\" and \"hypocritical,\" and listing it as a \"national security supply chain risk.\" This week, Anthropic has presented a prime example of arrogance and betrayal, serving as a cautionary tale on how to do business with the U.S. government or the Pentagon. Our position has never wavered, and never will: the U.S. Department of Defense must have unrestricted access to Anthropic's models for all legitimate purposes of defending the Republic. However, @AnthropicAI and its CEO @DarioAmodei have chosen hypocrisy. They are attempting to force the U.S. military into submission under the guise of \"effective altruism\"—a cowardly display of corporate ethics that places Silicon Valley ideology above the lives of the American people. Anthropic's flawed, altruistic \"terms of service\" can never supersede the safety, readiness, and lives of U.S. troops on the battlefield. Their true purpose is clear: to seize veto power over the U.S. military's operational decisions. This is unacceptable. As President Trump stated on Truth Social, only the Commander-in-Chief and the American people should decide the fate of our military, not unelected tech executives. Anthropic's position is fundamentally incompatible with American principles. Therefore, their relationship with the U.S. Armed Forces and the federal government has been permanently altered. In light of the President's directive to the federal government to cease all use of Anthropic technology, I have directed the Department of Defense to designate Anthropic as a national security supply chain risk. Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner doing business with the U.S. military may engage in any commercial activity with Anthropic. Anthropic will continue to provide services to the Department of Defense for no more than six months to allow for a smooth transition to higher-quality, more patriotic services. America's warriors will never be swayed by the ideology of big tech companies. This decision is final. The article mentions being designated a \"national security supply chain risk.\" What are the consequences? The impact is not simply that \"the government will stop using it.\" This is a measure typically used against hostile foreign powers. First, federal agencies must cease use: all executive branches must stop procuring and deploying its models; existing contracts may be terminated or not renewed; and cloud platforms that embed its models may be required to remove them. Second, any federal contractor cannot use the company's products in their systems, and companies involved in government projects must prove they are \"free of Anthropic components.\" This means that trillion-dollar tech giants like Nvidia, Amazon, and Google will need to sever ties with Anthropic. Other impacts include investor avoidance and financing difficulties. The company stated Friday evening that it \"will challenge any supply chain risk designation through legal means.\" The company stated that being designated a supply chain risk \"is neither in accordance with the law nor would it set a dangerous precedent for any U.S. company negotiating with the government.\" A former U.S. Department of Defense official, who wished to remain anonymous, noted that Anthropic appeared to have the upper hand in the competition. \"It's a great PR opportunity for them, and they're not short of money at all.\" Amodi himself admitted that since the company took a stand with Trump officials on how to deploy artificial intelligence on the battlefield, its valuation and revenue have only increased. If the Department of Defense chooses to part ways, Anthropic will \"ensure a smooth transition to other vendors.\" In reality, Anthropic has gained support from OpenAI due to its anti-government stance: OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, expressed support for the competitor. He sent a memo to his employees stating that he and Ammodhi shared the same \"bottom line\" regarding the application of both companies' products: \"We have always believed that artificial intelligence should not be used for mass surveillance or autonomous lethal weapons, and that humans should always be involved in automated decision-making involving high risks. These are our main bottom lines.\" However, Altman subsequently turned to the US government… II. Even the \"well-behaved Altman\" \"betrayed\" Altman later confirmed on X that OpenAI had reached an agreement with the US Department of Defense to use its AI models on a classified cloud network. It is currently unclear how the security-centric measures in the OpenAI agreement differ from those in the Anthropic negotiations. Tonight, we reached an agreement with the US Department of Defense to deploy our models on its classified network. Throughout all interactions, the Department of Defense has demonstrated full respect for security and a desire to collaborate with us for optimal results. The safety and broad benefits of artificial intelligence are at the heart of our mission. Our two most important security principles are: prohibition of mass surveillance within the country and human responsibility for the use of force, including autonomous weapons systems. The Department of Defense endorses these principles and reflects them in its laws and policies, which we have also incorporated into this agreement. We will also build technical safeguards to ensure our models function properly, as the Department of Defense desires. We will deploy a Functional Deployment Environment (FDE) to support model operation, and to ensure model security, we will deploy it only on cloud networks. We have requested that the Department of Defense offer the same terms to all AI companies, and we believe all companies should be willing to accept these terms. We strongly hope that the situation can be de-escalated, avoiding legal and governmental action, and that a reasonable agreement can be reached. We will continue to do everything in our power to serve all humanity. The world is a complex, chaotic, and sometimes dangerous place. </p><p>Under Altman's post, several X users commented:</p><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\" style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><p>From non-profit organizations to for-profit companies, and then to the Department of Defense. It all changes so quickly.</p></li><li><p>I can't wait to investigate this deal after I'm elected to Congress in November.</p></li><li><p>So OpenAI went from \"We also have bottom lines\" to \"This is our model on the classified DoW network\" in just 12 hours? Anthropico was threatened/blacklisted for adhering to the same principles, but when Sam negotiated, it won everyone's applause for its profound respect for security. <br/></p></li></ul><p>First pretending to be on the same side as the competitor, then immediately throwing itself into the arms of the government, Altman played a really good hand.</p> Altman's \"defection\" might be traced back to the early connections between the two tech giants. Amodi, a veteran of the tech industry, rose to prominence early in his career at OpenAI. Later, he and several other OpenAI employees left due to disagreements with Altman. In 2021, Anthropic was launched. Its models and tools have been widely used by the federal government, largely thanks to its partnership with leading cloud service provider Amazon Web Services (AWS). Anthropic initially gained a foothold in the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies through this collaboration. Last July, Anthropic, along with xAI, Google, and OpenAI, secured a $200 million defense contract to support the Pentagon's advancement of AI applications. These two startups are now directly competing for users and enterprise clients through their evolving AI chatbots, agents, and other tools. III. Technology as a Bloodstained Sword In the current conflict between tech giants and the US government, Trump expressed his anger in all caps: \"The United States of America will not allow a radical, awakened left-wing company to dictate how our great military fights and wins wars!\" Since 2018, the conflict between tech companies and the Pentagon has been ongoing. At that time, employees of Alphabet's Google protested the Pentagon's use of its artificial intelligence to analyze videos taken by drones. Relations subsequently eased, with companies like Amazon and Microsoft vying for defense business, and several CEOs of major tech companies pledging to cooperate with the Trump administration last year. However, with the increasing prevalence of automated systems in the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, the theoretical \"killer robots\" have raised concerns among human rights and technology activists. Jack Shanahan, who led the Pentagon's algorithmic warfare project \"Project Maven,\" stated that the bolder military actions taken by the US over the past year have exacerbated these concerns. “People may feel more uneasy about the lack of any restrictions, and White House legal approvals could become ‘cover for any actions that could lead to procedural impropriety, civilian casualties, and collateral damage.’” Anthropic’s artificial intelligence technology has already been applied in the intelligence community and armed forces, and it is the first AI company of its kind to process classified information through a supply agreement with cloud service provider Amazon. According to reports from Reuters, the Wall Street Journal, and others, Anthropic’s Claude AI was used by the US military in the raid to capture Maduro in January of this year. Through a collaboration with data analytics company Palantir Technologies, it was integrated into the military’s intelligence and data analysis systems to analyze massive amounts of intelligence data, interpret satellite imagery, support decision-making, and potentially assist in operational deployment planning, but specific details remain classified. <h2><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">IV. Opinions of Relevant Individuals</span><br/></h2><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\" style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><p>On Friday evening, an open letter to the Pentagon and Congress, co-signed by several prominent technology and artificial intelligence leaders, began circulating. The signatories included 11 OpenAI employees, including Boaz Barak and William Feng, as well as Waymark CEO Alexander Persky-Sterm. ...&gt; “We firmly believe that the federal government should not retaliate against a private company for refusing to accept contract changes. This sets a dangerous precedent. Punishing an American company that refuses to accept contract modifications sends a clear signal to all American tech companies: either accept whatever the government demands, or face retaliation. The United States has won the AI ​​race because it is committed to free enterprise and the rule of law; to undermine this commitment to punish one company is short-sighted and contrary to national security interests.” Musk stated on his social media platform X that “Anthropic hates Western civilization.” Altman took a different approach, supporting Anthropic’s security safeguards, opposing the government’s “threatening” approach, and working to facilitate a deal between OpenAI and the Pentagon. Saif Khan, who previously served on President Biden’s White House National Security Council, stated that the Department of Defense’s move “is likely the most stringent domestic AI regulation ever enacted by any government.” \"It's fair to say they consider Anthropic a greater national security threat than any Chinese AI company, while they haven't listed any Chinese AI company as a supply chain risk.\" \"Targeting Anthropic might grab attention, but ultimately everyone loses.\" Dean Bauer, a former senior policy advisor on AI to Trump, posted on X: \"This is practically an attempt to murder a company. I would never recommend investing in American AI to any investor; I would never recommend starting an AI company in the United States.\" Deputy Secretary of Defense Emil Michael tweeted a series of messages: \"Amodi is a fraud and has a God complex. He's obsessed with personally controlling the U.S. military and is willing to jeopardize our national security.\" Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren urged hearings on the core of this dispute—the issue of AI power. \"Did the Trump administration punish Anthropic because it refused to help with mass surveillance of American communities or to create killer robots? The American people have the right to know what Trump administration officials are planning at the Pentagon.\" Massachusetts Democratic Senator Ed Markey and Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen stated that the Pentagon's \"threat to punish an American AI company for refusing to relinquish basic safeguards for the use of its AI models represents a chilling abuse of government power.\" California Democratic Representative George Whitesides expressed concern that Hegsides' \"threat to accelerate security policy changes could push the Department of Defense to conduct broader deployments without adequate safeguards.\" \"The President's directive to halt the use of a leading U.S. artificial intelligence company, coupled with inflammatory rhetoric attacking the company, raises serious concerns about whether national security decisions are driven by prudent analysis or political considerations,\" said Senator Mark Warner, a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a Democrat from Virginia, in an emailed press release. Appendix: Anthropic CEO Dario Amody's Statement: \"I firmly believe that using artificial intelligence to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our authoritarian adversaries, is a matter of survival. Therefore, Anthropic has proactively deployed our models to the U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence agencies.\" We are the first cutting-edge AI company to deploy models on classified U.S. government networks, the first to deploy models in national laboratories, and the first to provide customized models for national security clients. Claude models are widely used in mission-critical applications by the U.S. Department of Defense and other national security agencies, such as intelligence analysis, modeling and simulation, operational planning, and cyber warfare. Anthropic has also taken steps to defend America's leadership in AI, even when it went against the company's short-term interests. We forwent hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue to prevent companies from using Claude chips; we stopped cyberattacks attempting to misuse Claude chips; and we advocated for strict export controls on chips to ensure democratic advantages. Anthropic understands that military decisions are made by the U.S. Department of Defense, not private companies. We have never objected to any specific military action, nor have we ever attempted to restrict the use of our technology in any temporary way. However, in a few cases, we believe that AI may undermine rather than defend democratic values. Certain applications have also been far beyond what current technology can safely and reliably perform. Two of these uses have never been included in our contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, and we believe they should not be now: **Massive Domestic Surveillance.** We support the use of artificial intelligence for legitimate foreign intelligence and counterintelligence missions. However, using these systems for massive domestic surveillance is contrary to democratic values. AI-driven mass surveillance poses a serious and unprecedented risk to our fundamental freedoms. Such surveillance is currently legal only because the law has not kept pace with the rapidly evolving capabilities of AI. For example, under current law, the government can purchase detailed information about U.S. citizens' whereabouts, web browsing history, and social relationships from public sources without a warrant. The intelligence community has acknowledged that this practice raises privacy concerns and faces bipartisan opposition in Congress. Powerful AI can integrate this fragmented, individually harmless data to create a complete picture of anyone's life—automatically and on a massive scale. **Fully Autonomous Weapons.** Partially autonomous weapons, such as those currently used in Ukraine, are crucial for defending democracy. Even fully autonomous weapons (those that automatically select and attack targets without human intervention) could be critical to our national defense. However, the reliability of advanced AI systems is currently insufficient to power fully autonomous weapons. We would never intentionally supply products that would jeopardize the safety of American service members and civilians. We have proactively offered to work directly with the Department of Defense on research and development to improve the reliability of these systems, but they have declined this offer. Furthermore, without proper oversight, fully autonomous weapons cannot be expected to make critical judgments daily like our well-trained professional forces. They require robust safeguards for deployment, which currently do not exist. To the best of our knowledge, these two exceptions have not so far prevented our armed forces from accelerating the adoption and use of our models. The Department of Defense has stated that they will only contract with AI companies that agree to “any legitimate use” and remove security measures in the aforementioned circumstances. They threatened to remove us from their systems if we continued to maintain these security measures; they also threatened to designate us as a “supply chain risk”—a label typically used against U.S. adversaries and never before applied to U.S. companies—and invoke the Defense Production Act to force the removal of these security measures. The latter two threats are contradictory: one views us as a security risk, the other as an integral part of national security. However, these threats do not change our position: we cannot compromise our conscience by complying with their demands. The Department of Defense has the right to choose the contractors best suited to its vision. But given the immense value Anthropic's technology brings to our military, we hope they will reconsider. We strongly desire to continue serving the Department of Defense and our warfighters, provided the two safeguards we requested are in place. If the Department of Defense chooses to terminate its partnership with Anthropic, we will work to ensure a smooth transition to another supplier, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military programs, operations, or other critical missions. We will continue to provide our products for as long as necessary, in accordance with the preferential terms we have proposed. We stand ready to continue our efforts to safeguard U.S. national security.</p></li></ul></div></div>",

However, PayPal, which already launched $PYUSD, and Coinbase, which proposed the x402 protocol, both saw their stock prices fall. We urgently need to address two issues: first, who is fueling market sentiment in this new payment war; and second, are agents and stablecoins truly the next big thing? This article focuses on the former. The relationship between AI, blockchain, and stablecoins will be discussed later, and the outlook for yield-generating stablecoins will follow after a clearer bill is enacted. The losers eat dust; Fintech is more anxious than Crypto. Crypto has hope, but no future for individuals. US stocks and bonds are going blockchain, BlackRock and WisdomTree are frequently embracing DeFi, and token economics is inevitably heading towards its end. No one believes in the wealth-creating effect of blockchain anymore. Even if public chains and Vaults are adopted in reality, it doesn't mean that the prices of $ETH and $Aave will rise. This view isn't entirely wrong, but it exaggerates the predicament faced by Crypto, because Fintech has reached a critical juncture. Yes, this counterintuitive judgment can be made after Stripe broke through the $159 billion valuation. Following Peter Thiel's funding flow, selling off Wise stock and holding onto NeoBroker projects like Trade Republic, or looking at Revolut ($75 billion), Europe's most valuable NeoBank project, reveals a changed valuation logic for Fintech. After more than 20 years of effort, Fintech's attempt to build payment channels independent of banks has failed. Only the ability to retain or convert user funds has value. Wise's transfers and Stripe's acquiring have no real future. </span></strong></p><figure><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span leaf=\"\"><img alt=\"yTqYVMnSmEsNKNp9VQO7pqXRNnOTukcAIWY5C5Z3.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.com.cn/7436497_image3.png\" title=\"7436497\"/></span></p><figcaption><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span leaf=\"\">Image description: Fintech &amp; Payment value changes</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span leaf=\"\">Image source: @zuoyeweb3</span></p></figcaption></figure><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">One ​​reason is that they cannot completely bypass the banking industry to handle funds, and another reason is that blockchain can make it cheaper.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">One ​​reason is that they cannot completely bypass the banking industry to handle funds, and another reason is that blockchain can make it cheaper.</span></p> This isn't just a problem for a single company. The entire Fintech sector reached its peak during the pandemic. PayPal, rumored to be selling itself today, was valued at $340 billion in 2021. By 2026, the entire Fintech sector will be scrambling to prove its superiority over stablecoins and agents. Stripe's valuation is 5 times that of Adyen's market capitalization ($35 billion) and about 13 times that of Checkout.com ($12 billion), but Stripe's business volume isn't 5 times that of Adyen. This leverage stems from people's imagination regarding the concepts of stablecoins and agents. The anxiety of Fintech companies is far more severe than that of Crypto, after all, \"public chain + stablecoin\" is a self-contained system, and DeFi is a killer application. The new payment war we are seeing now is nothing more than the fuel inflated valuations of Fintech. Fintech only has an advantage in existing users; the future belongs to the crypto industry. <figure><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span leaf=\"\"><img alt=\"RE5nVa4xKRKxHn1nf3SzeKBe7I8CP0pB1VaYFOMc.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.com.cn/7436498_image3.png\" title=\"7436498\"/></span></p><figcaption><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span leaf=\"\">Image description: Forbes Fintech 50 list</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span leaf=\"\">Data source: @ForbesCrypto</span></p></figcaption></figure><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">According to Forbes data, payments, as a target in the Fintech sector, takes an average of 8.1 years to make the list, but crypto only takes 6.2 years.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">According to Forbes data, payments, as a target in the Fintech sector, takes an average of 8.1 years to make the list, but crypto only takes 6.2 years.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"> From a direct business perspective, long-distance runners like Stripe need to give the capital market an explanation, or even a reason for exiting, as the funds tied up need to be allocated to a newer or larger future. Larger: Agents will exponentially increase the number of payments; Stripe founders, the Collison brothers, believe a chain with 1 billion TPS is needed. Newer: Utilizing stablecoins to completely revolutionize the existing payment technology stack represents the biggest technological revolution since the API-first model. To realize this promising future, Fintech not only needs to prove itself superior to Crypto companies, but also faces resistance from the banking industry and internet super platforms. With numerous participants, the situation has become utterly chaotic. Compared to unicorns like Stripe, super platforms like Meta/Google are far larger, with trillions of dollars in market capitalization and billions of users being commonplace. They primarily act as conduits, sharing profits. You could say they see hope in creating stablecoins or payment protocols, or you could say they're leveraging their existing advantages to charge higher tolls. Under the benevolent leadership of Vitalik Buterin, Crypto proactively relinquished its independent hardware layer to the internet, becoming a dependent entity of AWS. However, at least blockchain technology, as a new infrastructure for money transfer, has gained consensus among the banking industry, internet companies, Fintech firms, and regulators. The remaining point of consensus lies in whether to completely replace banks, and how payment stablecoins can encircle B2C businesses from the C2C/B2B dichotomy. Tether and Circle's two-way encirclement: USDT fades into obscurity, entering the third world and surrounding Europe and America; USDC focuses on on-chain development, with compliance merely a protective shield for replacing banks. Blockchain not only bypasses the banking-dominated financial industry, achieving a theoretical minimum for independent existence through the underground economy, but also, in the 10 years of Ethereum's development, has demonstrated overwhelming superiority over TradFi in terms of capital efficiency. Most interestingly, this dominance isn't based on the sheer volume of funds; the combined $236 billion in ETH, $300 billion in stablecoins, and $1.32 trillion in BTC still don't exceed JPMorgan Chase's $2.5 trillion in deposits. The advantage lies in the fact that the banking industry can use alliances to block the continuous attempts of Fintech and PSPs (Payments  service Providers, or third-party payment providers), because you simply cannot bypass the banking industry to handle the electronic flow of US dollars independently. However, blockchain can. Even the most difficult stablecoin companies to penetrate the banking system have loopholes, with Silicon Valley Bank as an example and Lead Bank as an example. Capitalists can sell their nooses; the \"traitors\" in the banking industry cannot be absorbed by itself, and Wall Street has no regulatory power. The value orientation of regulation is very contradictory. On the one hand, after the 2008 financial crisis, the \"too big to fail\" banking industry is not popular; on the other hand, the crypto industry may be even more brutal than Wall Street in terms of financial order. The ancient political wisdom of \"surrounding three sides and leaving one side open\" has been skillfully employed by various bureaucratic systems. A closer look at the regulatory actions following the brilliant legislation reveals that the Fed, OCC, CFTC, and SEC have opened the door wide for payment stablecoins, but at the cost of erasing the foundation for yield-based stablecoins in response to the \"deposit outflow\" crisis in the banking sector, while simultaneously guiding stablecoins into the existing system. </span></p><figure><p id=\"_img_parent_tmp\" style=\"text-align:center\"><span leaf=\"\"><img alt=\"n4vsqRsXYj3IqaGs2i03e3aqsntu48GwcFcbowyT.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.com.cn/7436499_image3.png\" title=\"7436499\"/></span></p><figcaption><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span leaf=\"\">Image description: Progress of regulatory implementation</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span leaf=\"\">Image source: @zuoyeweb3</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><span leaf=\"\">Since the 1970s, Merrill Lynch invented the CMA (Cash Management Account) and MMF (Money Market Fund).</span></p> Since then, the banking industry has accused it of causing deposit outflows from small and community banks. However, the die is cast; CMA-backed MMFs not only offer flexible access but also higher interest rates than bank deposits. Ultimately, it was only when the banking industry was gradually allowed to engage in diversified operations and offer similar MMF products that the deposit outflow was finally stopped. Ironically, large banks ultimately used their scale advantage to seize deposits from smaller banks. Heretics are more dangerous than heretics. Stablecoin yields are not a problem; the banking industry wants to distribute the yields itself to avoid being eliminated by historical processes. For another example, in 2013, when Alipay and WeChat were booming, the US banking industry once again raised the banner of protecting small banks. Of course, the ultimate victims are American Fintech companies like PayPal, which also sowed the seeds of the false narrative that third-party payments rely on banks to disrupt them. But Crypto is different, really, it's different. Faced with the aggressive moves of the banking industry and regulators, Circle is undoubtedly more American and more compliant, while Tether is a comeback platform from overseas and the underground. However, for a considerable period and in a vast region, $USDC and $USDT are not competitors. Simply put, USDC follows the \"+stablecoin\" logic of DeFi + B2B, while USDT follows the \"stablecoin+\" narrative of CEX + P2P. It sounds strange, but USDC is indeed more widely used in the DeFi field, extensively used for quotation assets, and far surpasses USDT in mainstream scenarios such as DEX/Lending. Furthermore, apart from Coinbase, the vast majority of CEX liquidity is denominated in USDT. In the financial industry, USDC has become the standard stablecoin, and Circle's CCTP stack, built for it, serves as an entry point for institutions to enter the blockchain. However, USDT has shown remarkable resilience; the $80 billion in USDT on Tron supports the global demand for personal transfers. In Argentina and Nigeria, the dollarization of currency is essentially USDT-ization. According to a joint study by Artemis and McKinsey, the $35 trillion in global stablecoin transaction volume is not substantial enough; only about $390 billion (approximately 1%) represents genuine stablecoin payments, accounting for 0.02% of the total global payments (over $2 trillion). B2B payments: $226 billion (the primary use case, accounting for 60%, with a year-on-year growth of 733%), representing only 0.01% of the approximately $1.6 trillion in global B2B payments. Global salaries and cross-border remittances: $90 billion (&lt;1% of the global share). Clearing and settlement: $8 billion (&lt;0.01% of the global share). U-Card: $4.5 billion. This data is clearly more realistic in everyday experience. Perhaps the trend of stablecoin adoption is more important; you'll see Fintech actively connecting with banks, but banks will resist stablecoin yields while simultaneously supporting more stablecoins. If you observe Tether's recent actions, the partnership with Lutnik and the launch of USAT are just a cover; the $200 million investment in Whop is more authentic and can be interpreted as buying channel fees from 18 million users, using remittances from the Third World to encircle the First World. Therefore, you'll see that cross-border remittance companies in Latin America ⇄ the US, South Asia ⇄ the Middle East, and Africa ⇄ Europe more commonly support USDT, while Stripe and Huma default to USDC. The underlying nature of the cryptocurrency world is P2P, and Circle's conscious efforts to network with businesses and banks, particularly in the B2B sector, which is widely reported and even touted as a future trend, misinterpret the direction of payment itself. As mentioned earlier, pure transfer, clearing, and aggregation channels have little value; processing volume is ultimately a fixed number, lacking the foundation for a market-dream-like valuation. Everyone needs a graphics card for gaming; at most, 7 billion 5090 tokens could be sold, clearly less than the potential gains from AI being considered the fourth industrial revolution. \"Payment is not a SaaS or a function, but rather an AI payment infrastructure similar to Cloudflare, where the distribution network cannot be valued by quantity.\" This is the story Crypto wants to tell the world: to make stablecoins something beyond payments, allowing money to remain on-chain end-to-end. People are talking about the demise of SaaS and the aging of channel providers, as if decades of Fintech will change hands overnight. Of course, things won't happen that quickly, especially since USDC's adoption by B2B institutions still needs time, and Tether's unilateral promotion of USDT and its aggressive buying of old channels may not necessarily lead to the future. If we're looking to establish a point of observation for the payment story in Crypto, the only useful one is how to handle the relationship between payments and returns. It's very clear now: For returns, they can only remain in on-chain DeFi, like MetaMask U Card's partnership with Aave to bypass the US market and enter the broader consumer system; for payment scale, they need to obtain a banking license from an OCC to issue compliant, non-yielding stablecoins, entering the vast financial derivatives field of the CFTC and SEC. As for BitGo's Asian institutional-grade USD stablecoin $FYUSD and Circle's Euro stablecoin $EURC, they've both chosen to confine themselves to a small corner of the market. The essence of B2B is a pipeline, the essence of C2C is scale, and the essence of B2C is a plugin. Looking at the history of payment stablecoins, the hope of replacing card organizations as a new channel is provided by public chains/L2, but compared to the advantage of Fintech \"replacing\" banks, it must be a new product with MMF + payment functions, that is, surpassing banks in capital efficiency. Peter Thiel is optimistic about Neobank and Neobroker, while Vitalik is optimistic about ETH-backed yield stablecoins. On this point, Vitalik actually sees it more clearly: if there is no ETH-based yield stablecoin to diversify holding risks, at the very least, one should consider using RWA assets to diversify income sources. In short, lacking payment functionality based on on-chain yields, stablecoins cannot escape the dominance of dollar assets and will ultimately be tamed into the banking industry by OCC. Those willing to sacrifice freedom for security will ultimately gain neither freedom nor security. Here's a second dangerous assessment: existing B2B enterprise use cases based on USDC and cross-border remittance projects incorporating USDT transfers are insufficient to propel payment stablecoins towards global adoption. They only possess temporary significance and will not become major players in the next era. <figure><span leaf=\"\"><img alt=\"H1Cmq5DcbWJZhCHTozd4eWoahKce5qvy5pYBm58K.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.com.cn/7436500_image3.png\" title=\"7436500\"/></span><figcaption><p><span leaf=\"\">Image description: Payment stablecoin circulation</span></p><p><span leaf=\"\">Image source: @zuoyeweb3</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><span leaf=\"\">The phase mission of using revenue as a customer acquisition method has been terminated. Under the obstruction of the banking industry, not only will off-chain be inevitably affected, but after $USDe and $xUSD, on-chain has also been shut down. It is indeed necessary to study the adoption of payments in the real world. However, it's important to note that if you only study payments and ignore yield characteristics, you'll miss the most valuable 50% of this wave. USDT/USDC, using government bond interest rates, has been recruited, and the banking industry has won the third wave, continuing to wield its power with the cheapest demand assets. Conclusion: Following the footsteps of Fintech, we hope Crypto will forge a different future. Four driving forces constitute the new payment war: Stripe and others are frantically embracing new narratives for their IPOs; Meta/Google sees their bargaining power as channel providers; the banking industry wants to retain channel fees and cheap assets; and Tether is investing heavily in payment companies, hoping to surround Circle. Two new narratives are packaged into future visions: stablecoins are seen as the obvious agent payment tool, but no one has ever asked whether agents actually need them. This issue will be discussed later.</span></p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Author: Ye Huiwen, Wall Street Insights</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Trump administration has officially designated artificial intelligence startup Anthropic as a \"national security supply chain risk,\" completely banning its applications in the federal government and military. This unprecedented rupture stems from fundamental disagreements between the two sides on whether AI should be involved in lethal military decisions such as nuclear war.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that **any contractor doing business with the US military must immediately cease commercial activities with Anthropic, and existing services will be phased out within six months. President Trump subsequently publicly pressured the company, stating that if it does not cooperate during the transition period, it will face civil and criminal charges.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This move has caused a major upheaval in Silicon Valley, reshaping the rules of cooperation between tech giants and the US military.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This move has reshaped the rules of cooperation between tech giants and the US military.</p> For Anthropic, valued at $380 billion and having previously secured approximately $200 million in military contracts, this not only represents a direct commercial loss but also sends a strong signal of compliance risks to the entire AI industry, indicating that the government will not allow companies to erect technological barriers in key defense sectors. As Anthropic faces expulsion, its competitors OpenAI and Musk's xAI are rapidly moving to fill the market vacuum. According to the Wall Street Journal, OpenAI CEO Altman has told employees that they are negotiating a new cooperation agreement with the Pentagon, attempting to find a balance between meeting military needs and maintaining the company's security bottom line. The core of the conflict between the Pentagon and Anthropic lies in the right to apply AI systems in extreme military operations. A serious conflict erupted last month between the two sides during discussions of an extreme nuclear war scenario: whether the military could use Anthropic's Claude AI system to assist in intercepting missiles if the United States were attacked by an intercontinental ballistic missile. Pentagon officials accused Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei of attempting to veto the military's operational decisions. Emil Michael, the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, publicly criticized Anthropic for prioritizing its own ideology over national security and stressed that large technology companies should never be allowed to determine the outcome of a war. Anthropic strongly refuted the military's accusations, calling their claims about missile interception \"completely false.\" Dario Amodei issued a statement emphasizing that current AI systems lack sufficient reliability to drive autonomous weapons, which would endanger soldiers and civilians. The company adheres to its core principle of refusing to use AI technology for autonomous lethal weapons and domestic mass surveillance. OpenAI and xAI Accelerate Market Vacuum Squeezing Anthropic's exit directly altered the competitive landscape of the AI ​​military market. OpenAI is attempting to offer the military a compromise. Altman told employees that the government was willing to include OpenAI's \"red lines\" in contracts, allowing the company to build its own \"security stack.\" This means that if the AI ​​refuses to execute instructions that violate security principles, the government will not force it to. Meanwhile, Musk's xAI and its chatbot Grok, with fewer restrictions, have become another more attractive option for the Pentagon and have been approved for use in some top-secret operations. However, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing sources familiar with the matter, several federal agencies, including the General Services Administration (GSA), have issued serious warnings about Grok's security and reliability, expressing concerns that its data bias and vulnerability to manipulation could pose systemic risks. The tech industry faces a reassessment of compliance and investment risks. A Bloomberg analysis points out that Trump's decision will prompt tech companies investing billions of dollars in AI research to reassess the best way to contract with the federal government. Anthropic was previously the only AI system capable of operating in the Pentagon's classified cloud environment, and its Claude Gov tool was favored by defense personnel for its ease of use. The ban represents a significant risk for both the government and businesses. Even more worrying for the market is the potential for coercive measures from the government. Pentagon officials have previously hinted that they might use their government authority to force Anthropic to hand over its technology. Industry experts warn that such extreme policy options will have a chilling effect on the entire industry, causing investors and companies to worry that deep cooperation with the Department of Defense could ultimately lead to the loss of control over core technologies.</div></div>",
