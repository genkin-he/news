Data: Google Trends. We believe the time to be interested in \"devaluation trading\" was a few years ago. At that time, Bitcoin was priced at $25,000 and gold at $2,000. At that time, nobody was talking about it except cryptocurrency and macro analysts. In our view, the \"deal\" was essentially complete. Therefore, our job is to understand the conditions that created it, and whether those conditions will continue to exist. What drove this deal? In our view, there are primarily two factors. 1. Treasury spending. During the Biden administration, we implemented a massive fiscal deficit. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://www.hellobtc.com/d/file/202510/5561b832c82f42c40d0ea4351510d61b.png?t=1761725202\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Data: US Treasury<br/></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The fiscal year 2025 has just ended, and the deficit has slightly decreased—primarily due to increased taxes (tariffs) rather than reduced spending.

This is why we need to cut interest rates. \"We will privatize the economy, revitalize the private sector, and shrink the government.\" - Scott Bessent. 2. \"Treasury QE\". To fund the excessive spending by the Treasury during the Biden administration, we also saw a new form of \"quantitative easing\" (QE). We can observe this below (black line). \"Treasury QE\" supported the market by funding government spending through short-term notes rather than long-term bonds. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://www.hellobtc.com/d/file/202510/3c55f30e9a43d6ead04e76e719df777d.png?t=1761592689\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Data: Global Liquidity Index<br/></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">We believe that it was fiscal spending and the Treasury's quantitative easing that fueled the “devaluation trade” and “everything bubble” we have seen in the past few years. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But now we are transitioning to a “Trump economy,” with the private sector taking over the baton from the Treasury.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Similarly, this is why they **need to cut interest rates**.

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Alice Liu, Forbes; Translator: Felix, PANews</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Despite the hype surrounding a potential crypto boom during the \"Trump era,\" Bitcoin has lagged behind almost all major asset classes. Looking back at Bitcoin's performance so far in 2025, 2025 can be described as a \"disappointing year.\"</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Since the US presidential inauguration in January of this year, Bitcoin's return has been only around 5.8%, while the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 have both achieved double-digit gains, and even classic safe-haven assets like gold have significantly outperformed Bitcoin.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Investors hoping for a boost from the \"Trump trade\" are now facing a harsh reality: unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, fund rotation into AI stocks, and profit-taking by long-term investors have limited Bitcoin's upside potential for most of the year.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://cdn-img.panewslab.com/yijian/2025/11/1/images/1d65b230d5e471242c878d0af6a9b193.png\"/></p><pre style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Since Trump's inauguration on January 20: Bitcoin has risen 5.78%, the S&amp;P 500 has risen 11.95%, and the Nasdaq has risen 16.17%. Source: X</span></pre><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The $100,000 resistance level</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The key question everyone is asking is: Why can't Bitcoin break through?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Simply put, $100,000 has become a psychological profit zone.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"> On-chain data shows that whenever Bitcoin breaks through this price level, selling by long-term holders increases significantly. These holders include early adopters, whales, and long-term staunch supporters; they are not panic selling, but rather reducing risk and shifting funds to other high-performing sectors, such as AI and tech stocks. Every time Bitcoin breaks $100,000, it triggers a wave of selling: this is not panic, but profit-taking. This creates structural selling pressure, making it difficult for Bitcoin's price to maintain new highs. Weak Demand and Market Structure Another reason for the market downturn is weak demand. Bitcoin is currently trading below the cost base for short-term holders: approximately $106,100 (as of October 30th), and is struggling to maintain above $110,000, which can be considered the 0.85 support level. This is important because historically, when Bitcoin fails to hold this range, it often foreshadows a larger pullback—potentially down to $97,000, the price level where the $0.75 support is located. This pattern has been seen for the third time in the current cycle: a strong rally, exhaustion of demand, followed by a prolonged period of consolidation. In short, the market needs a reset. There is no large-scale inflow of new funds at present. Retail sentiment is weak. Institutional investors are also cautious. Without new demand, each rally will fade faster. </h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://cdn-img.panewslab.com/yijian/2025/11/1/images/89caafc4d0bbba627f2cb3f0b45e0a69.png\"/></p><pre style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Currently, listed companies hold more than 5% of the total Bitcoin supply. Data source: CoinMarketCap</span></pre><h3>Miners and Macroeconomic Factors</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition, miners and macroeconomic factors have brought double pressure.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">First, let's talk about miners: After the Bitcoin halving, miners' profit margins were squeezed. Many miners had to sell some of their holdings to pay for operating costs. Coupled with the rise in US real yields earlier this year, this caused miners to turn from net buyers to net sellers.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> However, from a macro perspective, the lower-than-expected September Consumer Price Index (CPI) offered some relief, mainly due to easing housing inflation. This provides the Federal Reserve with room to cut interest rates in October and December, an expectation largely priced into the market. If this easing cycle materializes, it could boost risk sentiment by the end of the fourth quarter. However, this positive factor has not yet translated into Bitcoin's strength: liquidity remains tight, and funds are still chasing high-beta AI stocks (PANews note: a financial indicator reflecting the performance of highly volatile stock markets) rather than crypto assets. Options Boom and Market Evolution A major structural change this year has emerged in the derivatives sector. Bitcoin options open interest has reached a record high and continues to grow. This is actually a positive sign of a maturing market. This has also changed investor behavior. Instead of directly selling spot Bitcoin, they are using options to hedge risk or bet on volatility. This has reduced the pressure of direct selling in the spot market, but it has also amplified short-term volatility. Now, every significant move triggers hedging by traders, further exacerbating intraday price fluctuations. We are currently entering a new phase where price movements are more influenced by derivatives positions than by long-term convictions. This indicates that Bitcoin has become a fully financialized macro asset. Where is the market currently in this cycle? Overall, it appears to be a consolidation phase at the end of a cycle. Long-term holders are reducing risk, miners are selling, short-term buyers are at a loss, and derivatives dominate. This combination typically leads to prolonged consolidation before the next major market move. Historically, Bitcoin thrives during cyclical resets—weak hands exit, strong hands rebuild positions, and macro liquidity eventually returns. We are currently in a rebuilding phase. The crypto market is in a rebuilding phase. Data source: CoinMarketCap. So what's next? The $97,000 to $100,000 range will be crucial. If Bitcoin can hold this range during the two Fed meetings, the outlook for early 2026 will look optimistic—especially if interest rate cuts and fiscal expansion begin to reignite risk appetite. However, if this support level breaks, we could see a capitulation sell-off before the next rally—similar to the corrections of 2019 and mid-2022. The key point is: this is not a crash, but a recalibration. Bitcoin's poor performance this year is not due to fundamentals, but rather to fund rotation and natural volatility in mature asset classes. Once the macroeconomic environment turns favorable again, Bitcoin is poised to once again become the preferred high-beta safe-haven asset in the global market.</p></div></div>",

Aave (AAVE) is one of the leading projects that launched a systemic buyback program relatively early. Since April 2025, Aave DAO has been using protocol revenue to buy back approximately $1 million of AAVE weekly, and in October discussed making the mechanism \"normalized,\" with an annualized budget of up to $50 million. On the day the proposal was approved, AAVE briefly rose 13%, but after a six-month pilot program, its book profit was negative. </h2></h2><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Screenshot 2025-10-31 8:21:04 AM.png\" src=\"https://images.bitpush.news/cn/20251031/176192610213293281.png\" title=\"1761924071403692.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>MakerDAO (MKR) launched the Smart Burn Engine in 2023, using DAI surplus to periodically buy back and burn MKR. In its first week of operation, MKR rebounded by 28%, hailed as an example of \"cash flow returning to holders.\"</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, a year later, the market presents a paradox of \"confidence recovery lagging behind valuation.\" Despite strong fundamentals (MakerDAO continuously increases DAI reserve returns through real-world asset RWA), the MKR price (fluctuating around $1,800 USD as of the end of October 2025) is still only one-third of its all-time high during the 2021 bull market ($6,292 USD). The latest proposal from the Ethereum liquidity staking protocol Ether.fi (ETHFI) is undoubtedly the most attention-grabbing move recently. The DAO authorizes up to $50 million to buy back ETHFI in batches below $3 USD, using a Snapshot voting process, with the goal of \"stabilizing the price and restoring confidence.\" However, the market is also wary: if the funds mainly come from treasury reserves rather than sustainable income, this \"price-stabilizing buyback\" will inevitably lack sustainability. PancakeSwap (CAKE) has chosen the most programmatic path. Its \"Buyback &amp; Burn\" mechanism is integrated into the token model, disclosing net inflation data monthly. In April 2025, CAKE's net supply shrank by 0.61%, entering a state of sustained deflation. However, the price still hovers around $2, far below the 2021 high of $44—the improved supply brings stability, not a premium. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Screenshot 2025-10-31 8:34:44 AM.png\" src=\"https://images.bitpush.news/cn/20251031/176192610225564800.png\" title=\"1761924892449707.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Synthetix (SNX)</strong> and <strong>GMX</strong> are also using protocol fees to buy back and burn tokens. <br/>Synthetix added a buyback module in its 2024 version update, while GMX automatically puts a portion of its transaction fees into a buyback pool. Both saw a 30% to 40% rebound during the peak of buybacks in 2024, but both suspended buybacks when stablecoin pegs came under pressure and fees declined, shifting funds to risk reserves. The real \"exceptional winner,\" however, is the perpetual contract platform Hyperliquid (HYPE). It treats buybacks as part of its business narrative: a portion of the protocol's revenue automatically enters a secondary market buy pool. <br/>Dune data shows that Hyperliquid invested a total of $645 million in the past year, accounting for 46% of the industry total, and its HYPE token has risen by 500% since its launch in November 2024. <br/>However, HYPE's success is not only due to buying pressure, but also to revenue and user growth—daily trading volume tripled in a year.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why do buybacks often \"fail\"?</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">From the perspective of traditional financial logic, buybacks are highly sought after mainly for three reasons:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">First, it promises to increase value share. Protocols use real money to buy back and burn tokens, and the reduction in circulating supply means that each token will enjoy a higher future return.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Second, it conveys governance confidence. Willingness to initiate buybacks indicates that the protocol has profitability, financial leeway, and governance efficiency.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> This is seen as a significant sign that DeFi is shifting from \"burning money on subsidies\" to \"operating dividends.\" Furthermore, it creates scarcity expectations. When combined with mechanisms like lock-up and slashing, buybacks can create a deflationary effect on the supply side, optimizing the token economic model. However, theoretical perfection does not equate to practical feasibility. Firstly, timing often backfires. Many DAOs generously invest during bull markets but reduce funds during bear markets, creating an awkward situation of \"buying high and waiting low,\" contradicting the initial intention of value investing. Secondly, the source of funds is often a concern. Many projects use treasury reserves rather than continuous profits; once revenue declines, buybacks become an unsustainable \"putting on a brave face.\" Finally, there is the opportunity cost. Every dollar used for buybacks means one less dollar invested in product iteration and ecosystem development. Market maker Keyrock warned in October: \"Excessive buybacks may be one of the least efficient ways to allocate capital.\" Even if buybacks are implemented, their effects are easily diluted by continuous unlocking and new token issuance. When supply-side pressure remains, limited buybacks are like a drop in the ocean. Messari researcher Sunny Shi points out: \"We haven't found that the market will continue to inflate valuations due to buybacks; prices are still determined by growth and narrative.\" Furthermore, the macro liquidity structure of the entire DeFi market has changed. Despite a strong rebound in total value locked (TVL) to a three-year high (approximately $160 billion), it still falls short of the all-time peak of the 2021 bull market (approximately $180 billion). More importantly, while protocol revenue and capital utilization are high, secondary market trading volume and the inflow of speculative capital will take time to fully return to the \"euphoric\" state of the previous cycle. In a tight liquidity environment, even the most generous buybacks cannot offset the structural problem of insufficient demand. Confidence can be bought back temporarily, but only genuine capital inflows and a growth cycle can allow DeFi to become self-sustaining again.</p></div></div>",

            "title": "MEV Robot Case: Crimes Exploiting Ethereum Asset Pool Rules",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div>The core of this case is not simply about profiting from operating the MEV robot, but rather that two American men exploited vulnerabilities in the MEV robot to conduct a \"hacking attack\" and extort approximately $25 million. The individuals involved are Anton Peraire-Bueno (then 24 years old) and James Peraire-Bueno (then 28 years old), brothers who graduated from MIT. The U.S. Department of Justice charged them with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to launder money. Their primary crime involved exploiting the public nature of the Ethereum blockchain's \"validators\" and MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) system to plan and execute a sophisticated attack, \"stealing\" cryptocurrency from pending transactions and then using it to blackmail victims. The amount involved is approximately $25 million in cryptocurrency. Those involved in the case were arrested and charged in May 2024, and the case is currently under trial. They could face more than 20 years in prison. II. Key Details To understand this case, several key concepts need to be understood: MEV (Maximum Extractable Value): On a blockchain, the maximum profit that can be obtained by adjusting, including, or excluding the order of transactions. Common MEV activities include arbitrage and liquidation. Legitimate MEV bot operators bid for advantageous transaction positions by paying high gas fees. Transaction Mempool: A public pool of transactions awaiting validation to be packaged into blocks. Validator: A network participant responsible for packaging transactions and creating new blocks. Their modus operandi can be simplified into the following steps: Step 1: Snooping and Locating. Like other MEV bots, they continuously monitor the Ethereum Mempool, looking for profitable arbitrage opportunities. They discovered several arbitrage bundles consisting of three transactions that could generate high profits. Step Two: Planning the \"Trap\". Instead of bidding for these transactions by increasing gas fees like normal players, they devised a complex attack plan. They exploited a vulnerability in the Ethereum code specifically targeting the operation of MEV-Boost (software that helps validators acquire MEVs). Step Three: Executing the Attack - \"Hijacking\" the Transactions. By setting up their own validator nodes and leveraging their technical knowledge, they successfully \"hijacked\" these pending transactions within a very short time window (approximately 12 seconds). Specifically, through a series of complex operations, they prevented these transactions from being properly packaged into blocks, while simultaneously making the MEV bots that originally submitted these transactions believe the transactions had failed. Step 4: Theft and Reconstruction. After the original MEV bots abandoned their operations, they quickly rearranged these \"hijacked\" transactions, directing arbitrage profits to wallet addresses under their control. The entire process appears on the blockchain as a series of normal transaction reorganizations, but in reality, it's theft exploiting vulnerabilities. Step 5: Attempts at Money Laundering and Extortion. After succeeding, they didn't stop. They laundered the stolen funds through a series of complex on-chain operations (such as using mixers, cross-chain bridges, and transferring funds to overseas cryptocurrency exchanges), attempting to conceal the source of the funds. More seriously, they contacted the victims and threatened to report their cryptocurrency activities to tax authorities and publicly reveal their identities if they didn't pay the ransom. This constitutes extortion. III. Significant Impact This is the first time the U.S. Department of Justice has filed criminal charges against attacks related to MEVs. It classifies a relatively new and highly technical activity within the blockchain field as a criminal offense. The case clearly distinguishes between \"competitive\" MEVs and \"fraudulent\" hacking attacks. Simply running MEV bots to compete is not illegal, but exploiting vulnerabilities to steal discovered transaction value and then extorting money constitutes a serious crime. In a statement, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco emphasized, \"The defendants used highly specialized technical knowledge to manipulate and defraud the Ethereum blockchain to steal cryptocurrency. Despite their sophisticated methods, they were identified and arrested.\" The prosecution also suggested that digital asset policies should be formulated by Congress, not decided by the courts, potentially setting a precedent for cryptocurrency-related cases. This case sends a strong signal to participants in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and MEV fields: even in the realm of \"code is law,\" exploiting technical vulnerabilities for illegal profit is subject to traditional legal sanctions. It also prompts blockchain communities like Ethereum to place greater emphasis on the security of their protocols and infrastructure. IV. Further Reflections The perpetrators' actions in illegally obtaining others' cryptocurrency through technical means in this case meet the elements of theft under Chinese criminal law. According to Article 264 of the Criminal Law, anyone who secretly steals public or private property of an exceptionally large amount shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than ten years or life imprisonment. The amount involved in this case reached US$25 million (approximately RMB 180 million), far exceeding the standard for \"an exceptionally large amount.\" Their extortion may constitute the crime of blackmail. The perpetrators' threat to report them and demand money fully meets the provisions of Article 274 of the Criminal Law. This crime, along with theft, is punished concurrently, reflecting a comprehensive evaluation of complex criminal acts. Of course, their subsequent attempt to conceal the proceeds of crime also constitutes suspected money laundering. In my country's judicial procedures, based on a focused examination of the perpetrator's subjective intent, the amount of illegal profits, and the illegality of the technical means used, and according to relevant guiding opinions of the Supreme People's Court, virtual currency can be considered as property protected under criminal law. Specifically, at the operational level of criminal justice procedures, this case highlights three core issues. First, the nature of the crime: illegally transferring assets using blockchain vulnerabilities is essentially a crime against property rights. Second, evidence identification: blockchain data serves as the standard for fixing, extracting, and identifying electronic evidence. Third, cross-border cooperation: if Chinese entities or funds are involved, international criminal judicial assistance needs to be initiated. This case also reminds us from another perspective that my country needs to strengthen its analysis of new types of crimes in the blockchain field, improve relevant judicial interpretations, and ensure that while maintaining the principle of technological neutrality, it can effectively combat crimes committed using new technologies. In conclusion, this $25 million MEV robot case is essentially a high-tech financial theft and extortion case using blockchain protocol vulnerabilities. The defendant's actions far exceeded the scope of legitimate MEV competition, constituting clear fraud and money laundering crimes. The outcome of this case will set an important legal precedent for handling similar cases in the future.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: PANews, Zen</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As Kalshi and Polymarket further extend their business focus to the sports sector, the prediction market is expected to see a turning point this year with both volume and price increases: media reports indicate that Polymarket is in talks for a new round of financing, targeting a valuation of $12-15 billion; Kalshi completed a new round of financing mid-year, valuing the company at approximately $2 billion.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Meanwhile, leading platforms have seen a significant increase in monthly transaction volume and daily active users—according to the Wall Street Journal, the combined transaction volume of the two major platforms in October increased by over 90% month-on-month; and most of Kalshi's transaction volume growth comes from sports contracts, making sports predictions its main growth engine.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Driven by both industry and capital, Kalshi and Polymarket are seeking official partnerships and endorsements from major sports leagues.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://cdn-img.panewslab.com/yijian/2025/11/1/images/149eebfd29ad82a4cae79dacbb2dc151.jpeg\"/></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Firing the first shot, the NHL takes the lead in partnering with prediction markets</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The National Hockey League (NHL), the North American professional hockey league with the lowest commercial value among the four major North American sports leagues, was the first to embrace the emerging category of prediction markets. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In late October, the NHL announced multi-year partnership agreements with two prediction market platforms, Kalshi and Polymarket, becoming the first major sports league to partner with such platforms. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This partnership is seen as a signal that prediction markets are receiving increasing attention from the sports industry.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Through this landmark agreement, the NHL granted Kalshi and Polymarket the right to use the league's official data, logo, and name, and allowed them to display their branding during live game broadcasts. NHL President of Business Development Keith Wachtel stated that, so far, the prediction market has not negatively impacted the league's existing 10 official sports betting partners; instead, it has brought incremental growth to the entire ecosystem. Kalshi's Head of Corporate Development, Sara Slane, stated that this move validates the legitimacy of its business model. Prediction market platforms operate differently from traditional sports betting companies. These platforms allow users to buy and sell \"yes/no\" contracts for the outcome of specific events (including sporting events), with prices fluctuating dynamically based on market expectations. For example, on Kalshi, users can trade contracts such as \"whether a team will win the championship,\" with prices fluctuating based on the progress of the game and changes in probability. This trading mechanism is similar to betting companies adjusting odds based on game progress, but prediction contracts are classified as financial derivatives and regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), rather than betting. This regulatory difference means that Kalshi and Polymarket do not need to obtain sports betting licenses in each state. Theoretically, even in states like California and Texas where sports betting is prohibited, prediction markets can still be used by local users. Therefore, the NHL believes that introducing prediction markets will help attract a new audience that is tech-savvy and financially savvy, allowing more fans to participate in games in new ways. Through formal partnerships, the NHL can also have a say in the market contracts related to its league on the platform, preventing betting types that jeopardize the integrity of the game. For example, given that certain individual performance or roster-related markets may raise insider information and moral hazards, official partnerships give the NHL more say in the types of markets related to its league. Furthermore, the NHL has required Kalshi and Polymarket to adhere to the same integrity monitoring standards as official betting partners, including the use of league-authorized data providers and game irregularity monitoring systems. NHL Commercial Director Keith Wachtel emphasized that the league's collaboration with prediction platforms better upholds sports integrity because \"as a league, we can participate in deciding which markets can be listed, which benefits the NHL and all sports organizations.\" </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://cdn-img.panewslab.com/yijian/2025/11/1/images/834c51c5f5fef12e7be71f8cf14775a1.png\"/></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The skepticism and wait-and-see attitude of the NBA, NFL, and MLB</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Compared to the NHL's open attitude, the other three major professional sports leagues in the United States—the NBA, NFL, and MLB—have been cautious and resistant to the issue of prediction markets.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The three leagues have not only not established official partnerships with any prediction platforms, but have also expressed their concerns about such platforms through various channels. Earlier this year, the NBA, NFL, and MLB each sent a letter to the CFTC, emphasizing the importance of protecting sports integrity in this emerging market.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> The NFL's position is quite representative. Jonathan D. Nabavi, NFL's Director of Public Policy, emphasized in a written statement to the CFTC that these contracts \"simulate sports betting in effect, but lack the full integrity and consumer protection mechanisms found in regulated sports betting.\" Meanwhile, David Highhill, NFL Vice President of Sports Betting, stated in a media interview that the league will treat the prediction market as a form of betting and is concerned that \"insufficient regulation could lead to manipulation or price distortions\"; therefore, it should have the same level of protection and risk control standards as state-licensed sports betting. The NBA and MLB hold similar views. Although neither has publicly elaborated on their positions, their communication with the CFTC and industry feedback suggest that the core concern of these two leagues lies in the integrity of the game and the regulatory vacuum. They question how the leagues can ensure that insider information is not exploited and game results are not manipulated if fans and investors can circumvent state laws to bet on game outcomes on these platforms. The caution of the three major leagues is not unfounded. The NBA, in particular, has been embroiled in numerous scandals over the past two years, including major incidents of arbitrage using non-public injury and attendance information such as \"whether someone plays/when they leave the game.\" From a more pragmatic business perspective, the three leagues have deep partnerships with traditional betting companies, investing significant resources to create a standardized betting system. The \"gray area\" practices of prediction market platforms seem to circumvent state laws and league agreements, naturally raising concerns among the league's management. However, the temporarily closed door may reopen. Historically, the NFL strongly resisted the legalization of sports betting before 2018, subsequently gradually establishing partnerships with compliant betting ecosystems, indicating that its stance will adjust as regulatory and risk control conditions mature. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver's views may be more open; he advocated for the proper recognition and regulation of the betting market from the early days of legalization. Therefore, his attitude towards prediction markets is unlikely to be conservative; the key may lie in whether there is a clear regulatory framework and a risk-controlled operating model. The betting industry association strongly criticizes, focusing on sports integrity risks. Compared to the wait-and-see attitude of sports leagues, the US betting industry is the most vocal in its reaction. The authoritative industry body, the American Gaming Association (AGA), has strongly criticized prediction market platforms such as Kalshi and Polymarket. After the NHL announced its partnership with Kalshi and Polymarket, AGA Chairman Bill Miller publicly stated that the move was \"deeply disappointing and extremely dangerous.\" He denounced these prediction platforms as \"backdoor gambling schemes disguised as 'financial products',\" warning that the NHL's move sent a bad signal: that integrity, responsibility, and clear legality were optional in the sports betting industry. The AGA stated that its primary concern was the integrity risks of sporting events and the potential for consumer protection. The association pointed out that the United States spent seven years building \"the world's most robust, transparent, and legal sports betting market,\" which includes rigorous integrity monitoring, responsible betting measures, and consumer protections. Kalshi and Polymarket operate nationwide, bypassing state regulations, effectively circumventing state-level oversight and restrictions. Miller questions whether these platforms, lacking the stringent compliance reviews and player protection mechanisms required by state gambling regulators, could become breeding grounds for illegal activities. For example, without state regulation, how can it be ensured that minors do not participate in the transactions? How can insider trading or large-scale market manipulation be prevented? AGA believes these are unresolved risks. The AGA further stated that commodity futures regulators lack the in-depth monitoring and enforcement capabilities of state betting regulators, and placing sports betting under the CFTC's jurisdiction would likely fail to effectively maintain the integrity of the games. Besides criticizing prediction markets for exploiting legal loopholes, the AGA actively courted the three major sports leagues. Shortly after the NHL announced its partnership, the AGA sent letters to the NFL, NBA, and MLB, urging them to avoid commercial partnerships with \"inadequately regulated prediction market platforms.\" The letter strongly argued that allying with such platforms circumventing regulations would \"undermine the legitimate market achievements built over the past few years, exposing the leagues themselves to reputational and legal risks.\" It is foreseeable that the AGA will continue to lobby regulators, legislatures, and sports leagues to tighten policies on prediction markets and ensure that \"regulatory vacuums and gray areas\" do not emerge in the sports betting sector. </p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Regulatory and legal challenges continue, prediction markets embroiled in litigation</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Faced with industry skepticism and resistance, Kalshi and Polymarket have actively sought cooperation and endorsement, while also facing long-standing regulatory and legal disputes. In recent years, these two platforms have been involved in numerous enforcement and litigation cases with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and regulators in multiple states, and the legal status of prediction markets has remained controversial.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In early 2022, the CFTC initiated enforcement action against Blockratize, Inc., the operating company of Polymarket, alleging that the platform had been offering event trading without registration since June 2020, violating the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> These contracts covered a wide range of topics, including political elections, economic indicators, and even popular culture. Essentially, they were swap transactions in the form of binary options. However, Polymarket was neither a registered exchange (DCM) nor licensed a swap execution facility (SEF). Ultimately, Polymarket chose to settle with regulators, agreeing to pay a $1.4 million fine and shut down all non-compliant markets on its website to avoid further regulatory violations. Compared to Polymarket, Kalshi's legal battle is more complex and ongoing. Kalshi is currently the only prediction exchange registered with the CFTC as a \"Designated Contract Market\" (DCM), granting it the qualification to list event derivatives contracts at the federal level. Since the beginning of this year, Kalshi has launched several sports-related contracts (such as whether a team advances or wins the championship) and put them into trading without being rejected by the CFTC. However, these products violated several state gambling laws. Regulatory agencies in several states, including New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Ohio, issued stop-loss orders to Kalshi, claiming that its sports contracts were equivalent to unlicensed sports betting and should immediately cease providing services to residents within their states. Kalshi did not back down but instead countersued these state regulators, seeking a judicial ruling in federal court. The core legal dispute lies in whether federal commodity exchange law takes precedence over state gambling laws. Kalshi argues that as a federally sanctioned exchange, its event contracts fall under federal regulation, and the CFTC has exclusive jurisdiction over these products, which states cannot interfere with under their local gambling laws. In its lawsuit, Kalshi claims that state regulators' attempts to forcibly suspend federally licensed trading using state law contradict Congress's intention—the CFTC was established precisely to prevent fragmented regulation of interstate derivatives markets. Currently, Kalshi's legal battle with the states is extending to the federal appeals courts. In June of this year, a case filed by Kalshi against the New Jersey Gaming Enforcement Bureau reached the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. As many as 34 state attorneys general co-signed an amicus brief in support of New Jersey. These legal officials from states with open betting, such as New York and Michigan, as well as states with total bans, such as Utah and Idaho, reached a consensus that Kalshi's contracts were \"essentially sports betting, just disguised as commodity contracts.\" Their interpretation of federal law aimed to circumvent state betting regulations, constituting a usurpation of the long-standing sovereign rights of states in betting regulation. They emphasized that allowing Kalshi to continue this model would weaken the regulatory system established by states since the lifting of the PASPA ban in 2018 and erode the authority of state law in the field of sports betting. The aforementioned betting industry stakeholders naturally also stood against Kalshi in this legal battle. The American Sports Betting Association (ASBA), representing the industry, submitted its opinion in the aforementioned case, emphasizing that the CFTC lacks the appropriate professional capacity to manage complex sports betting and cannot allow federal commodity laws to cover sports betting. Some sports league officials also worry that if Kalshi wins, any exchange could follow suit and launch its own customized sports betting contracts, leaving states unable to regulate and posing a significant risk to sports integrity. Conversely, Kalshi insists that its contract design helps the market \"hedge\" sports risks and provides liquidity, criticizing the regulators' hardline stance as \"stifling innovation.\" Kalshi CEO Mansour even described the multi-state blockade as \"censorship,\" arguing that the prediction market should be protected like free speech, prompting a strong rebuttal from officials. The legal battle between Kalshi and state regulators continues. The ruling will not only determine the survival of their own businesses but also the position of the sports prediction market within the US legal system. In the short term, the uncertainty of the law itself is a major obstacle to the expansion of these platforms. </p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Entry and Counterattack: Traditional Betting Giants Also Target Emerging Markets</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Faced with the rise of prediction market platforms, traditional sports betting operators are not all resolutely resisting. Some betting giants have also realized the new business opportunities contained in prediction markets and have chosen to try to enter the market through investment and acquisition or independent development to avoid falling behind in the new round of competition.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">DraftKings, a leading online betting company in the United States, recently took a noteworthy action. In October 2025, DraftKings announced that it would acquire Railbird Technologies and planned to use it to launch a new platform called \"DraftKings Predictions,\" providing users with contract trading services based on real-world events.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition, DraftKings also announced a partnership with Polymarket, which will act as the designated clearinghouse for DraftKings' prediction market products, responsible for transaction matching and fund settlement.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> DraftKings CEO Jason Robins stated that incorporating Railbird's technology and Polymarket's underlying support will \"enable us to succeed in this new growth market.\" Instead of competing head-on, it's better to participate. Some analysts believe that this foray into the prediction market not only helps DraftKings expand into states where gambling is not yet legal (by offering its product through the CFTC), but is also a defensive strategy: rather than watching Kalshi and others grab users, it's better to establish a foothold in the market early. Judging from the stock price reaction, DraftKings' stock rose by about 2% on the day of the announcement, indicating that the capital market approves of its strategy. Besides DraftKings, industry giants like FanDuel are also closely monitoring developments in this field. According to ESPN, FanDuel is \"ready to enter the prediction market\" and is conducting internal technical and compliance assessments. In this battle between tradition and innovation, who will prevail? Overall, the expansion of prediction market platforms in the sports sector is sparking a debate between supporters and opponents. Supporters include leagues willing to try new things (such as the NHL) and capital firms eyeing the opportunity (such as DraftKings). Their argument is that prediction markets offer innovative ways to engage fans and financialized risk hedging tools, and that with proper regulation and integrity measures, they can coexist and thrive alongside traditional betting. Opponents, comprised mostly of sports organizations, betting regulators, and vested interests, warn that the prediction market is \"growing wildly\" outside the existing legal system and could undermine long-established safeguards of integrity and consumer protection. The two sides hold differing views on issues such as sports integrity, legal jurisdiction, and market fairness, leading to heated debate. Looking ahead, the fate of the sports prediction market in the United States will gradually become clearer as the court rulings on the Kalshi lawsuit, the attitudes of regulatory agencies become clearer, and more leagues express their support. If all parties can find a compromise (such as introducing federal standards while respecting state interests), this emerging phenomenon may be able to integrate into the mainstream and inject new vitality into the sports industry; however, if the conflict intensifies, the prediction market may be forced to shrink, and its ambitions in the sports field will be thwarted. As a neutral observer, PANews will continue to monitor the movements of Polymarket and Kalshi: whether they can overcome regulatory hurdles, gain more league support, or ultimately adjust their strategies in the face of resistance, this game between tradition and innovation is still evolving. The outcome of the game will not only determine the rise and fall of the two companies, but may also influence the future landscape of the integration of sports betting and financial markets.</p></div></div>",

Mid-2027: Pilot transactions and initial user testing may begin. 2029: If all goes well, the digital euro may be issued for the first time and enter public payment scenarios.

The following lists several types of projects that may be passively or actively affected, for your attention. Stablecoin Ecosystem If the digital euro gains widespread adoption, the use of dollar-pegged or other crypto stablecoins within the Eurozone may be suppressed. Projects such as Tether (USDT) and USDC may face regulatory or competitive pressures in their European operations. This may also give rise to \"European stablecoins,\" such as compliant Eurozone stablecoins or digital tokens issued by banks. On-chain payment infrastructure/wallets/fintech will find new \"downward penetration points\" in the digital euro ecosystem. Payment service providers (PSPs), wallet applications, and merchant access tools may participate as \"technological bridges,\" but they also face competition from central banks. Projects that can collaborate with central bank digital currencies/payment infrastructure in advance will have a first-mover advantage. </span></span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410574_image3.png\" type=\"block\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">Blockchain Financial Infrastructure / Tokenization Platform</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">The digital euro, as a \"public version of digital cash,\" entering the blockchain, has the potential to further promote asset tokenization (for example, compliant on-chain stocks in Europe suddenly became popular overnight!). </span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">Corresponding projects, such as those focusing on asset on-chain and compliant tokenization infrastructure platforms, will benefit. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">At the same time, compliant financial chains (such as banks + blockchain + regulation) will mature more rapidly, putting regulatory adaptation pressure on purely decentralized projects. On-chain asset compliance is a major trend.

            "title": "Financial Report Analysis: Coinbase Q3 Earnings 2025",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div>On October 31, 2025, Coinbase released its Q3 financial report. This timely report injected a much-needed boost into the liquidity-starved crypto industry. Total revenue reached $1.87 billion, a 55% year-over-year increase and a 25% quarter-over-quarter increase. Net profit was $433 million, compared to only $75.5 million in the same period last year. Earnings per share were $1.50, exceeding analysts' expectations by 45%. Wall Street analysts applauded, and J.P. Morgan upgraded its rating to \"overweight\" last week with a target price of $404. While many anticipated poor liquidity and lower-than-expected trading volume in the cryptocurrency market in Q3, Coinbase delivered a stellar performance, with consumer trading volume surging to $59 billion, a 37% increase from the previous quarter. Retail trading revenue reached $844 million. Furthermore, Coinbase has been consistently increasing its Bitcoin holdings. Through weekly dollar-cost averaging, it added $299 million to its Bitcoin holdings this quarter. As of now, its total Bitcoin holdings have reached 14,548. CEO Brain Armstrong stated in the company's earnings call, \"'Everything can be traded' is central to the next phase of our development.\" In addition, Coinbase is integrating prediction markets, tokenized stocks, and other products into its platform. Behind the trend of everything being tradable, Coinbase is no longer just a guardian of cryptocurrency; it's transforming into a \"crypto Apple ecosystem\" connecting people and capital. Behind this acquisition of 14,548 BTC, what ambitions does Coinbase have in store? Wall Street applauds the turnaround: Base x USDC from a side business to a cash cow. Looking back from 2023 to the present, Coinbase's stock price has been like a rollercoaster, climbing from a low of $30 to over $300 today. This wasn't due to luck, but rather a two-pronged approach: Base and USDC. These two, originally \"side businesses,\" have now become cash cows, and Wall Street's approval of their turnaround has been swift and direct. COIN Price Chart | Source: Tradingview First, let's talk about J.P. Morgan's upgrade to \"overweight.\" On October 24th, analyst Kenneth Worthington stated in a report that \"Coinbase's valuation is undervalued, with the potential opportunity for the Base token being worth $12-34 billion.\" Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 network incubated by Coinbase, was launched in 2023 as a \"low-fee testing ground,\" but has now become a star. Where does this money come from? As an Optimistic Rollup, Base requires each transaction to be packaged and recorded on-chain by a single sequencer, resulting in low fees (averaging $0.01 per transaction), but a terrifying scale effect—daily transaction volume has repeatedly exceeded 5 million, double that of the mainnet. The sequencer model makes fee revenue a strong source of cash flow. Coinbase transferred all these fees to its own escrow account, citing \"security and auditing\" reasons, but the community criticized this as \"centralized exploitation.\" Management responded in the earnings call that they would explore ecosystem revenue sharing in the future, such as returning a portion of the fees to developers or users, creating a positive feedback loop. Even more anticipated is the potential for a native Base token. J.P. Morgan predicts that if Base issues its native token, its market capitalization could reach tens of billions of dollars. What can the token do? It incentivizes usage elasticity; holders can participate in governance, stake to earn fee sharing, and even use it for gas fee discounts. With millions of daily active users and huge elasticity in fee revenue, if the token is launched, Base can transform from a \"cost center\" into a \"profit engine\" in no time. Looking at USDC, this stablecoin is a joint venture between Coinbase and Circle. The Q3 financial report shows that USDC's market capitalization reached a record high of $74 billion, and the average USDC balance on the Coinbase platform was $15 billion, a 9% increase quarter-over-quarter. The average USDC balance outside the platform was $53 billion, a 12% increase month-over-month. Stablecoin revenue was $355 million, a 7% increase month-over-month. Stablecoin revenue and blockchain revenue | Source: Coinbase Its revenue sources are diverse, including interest rate spreads (USDC reserves invest in US Treasury bonds, earning a 4-5% yield), custody fees (Coinbase Prime provides institutional custody, taking a 0.1-0.2% commission), clearing fees (cross-border transfer fees), and merchant revenue sharing (integrated into e-commerce platforms such as Shopify, taking a 1% commission). Why is USDC so profitable? Because it has penetrated merchant and cross-border settlement markets. Management revealed that USDC has a 15% penetration rate in cross-border payments, especially in emerging markets such as Latin America and Southeast Asia, where users use it to avoid foreign exchange fluctuations. For example, after Remitly and Wise integrated USDC, transfer costs decreased by 30%, and Coinbase benefited from this. More importantly, USDC is transforming from a \"store of value\" into a \"payment medium.\" Sell-side analysts mentioned that Coinbase may expand its distribution, such as issuing L2-specific USDC variants or deeply integrating it with DeFi protocols. Timeline? Management said, \"We'll see in the first half of next year.\" The synergy between Base and USDC is its trump card. Base uses USDC as its native gas fee, resulting in transaction costs as low as $0.001, attracting the DeFi and NFT ecosystems. Wall Street's praise essentially reflects Coinbase's shift from \"volatility dependence\" to \"stable revenue generation.\" Previously, transaction revenue accounted for 80%, which was halved during bear markets; now, subscription services account for 40%, demonstrating strong counter-cyclical resilience. Of course, risks remain. Regulation is a double-edged sword—the SEC's scrutiny of stablecoins is becoming increasingly stringent, and Base's centralized sequencer may also attract attacks from \"decentralization fundamentalists.\" But judging from the financial report, management is full of confidence: \"We're not betting on the market, we're building infrastructure.\" Coinbase is taking a steady yet ambitious path from a side business to a cash cow. Coinbase's expansion resembles the Roman Empire, proceeding step by step, from exchange to custody, and then to the primary market. The most eye-catching acquisition in the Q3 financial report was the $375 million acquisition of the Echo blockchain financing platform on October 21st. From issuance and listing to trading and custody, Coinbase uses six anchors to secure its ecosystem, pushing itself towards becoming a \"crypto Apple.\" Developers come and don't want to leave, institutions come and can't leave, and users can't live without it. First, let's talk about the technological infrastructure, the cornerstone of the Coinbase empire. The Base chain isn't just another Layer 2 blockchain; it's Coinbase's \"iOS,\" compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem but with its core controlled in-house. Leading protocols like Aave and Uniswap have already joined, but Base's value lies in its \"app store\" attributes. Through the acquisition of Spindl (an on-chain advertising attribution tool), Coinbase can track user origins and conversion rates, similar to the App Store's recommendation mechanism, controlling traffic distribution. Developers want to acquire customers? They must use Spindl; Coinbase uses this to decide who appears on the recommendation list. The acquisition of IronFish addresses privacy shortcomings. Under intense regulatory scrutiny, Base integrates zero-knowledge proofs to balance compliance and user privacy, emulating Apple's privacy protection strategy. More importantly, Base directly connects to Coinbase's 100 million users, allowing developers to reach massive traffic immediately upon launch—an advantage that Arbitrum or Polygon cannot match. The capital formation system is the second pillar, and the acquisition of Echo is a major highlight. Echo is an on-chain capital succession platform founded by renowned crypto trader Cobie, and it operates the Sonar public offering tool. Echo has helped over 300 projects raise more than $200 million, such as Plasma's XPL token sale. Why did Coinbase choose it? Because primary issuance is the \"upstream source\" of crypto. Traditional VC models are closed, making it difficult for retail investors to participate; Echo allows projects to raise funds directly from the community, encompassing both private and public sales. The acquisition price of $375 million (cash + stock) is a drop in the ocean compared to Coinbase's $70 billion market capitalization, but its strategic value is enormous, filling Coinbase's gap in \"capital formation.\" Echo fundraising trend chart | Source: Dune The integration roadmap is already taking shape. Echo will be integrated into the Coinbase ecosystem, utilizing Coinbase's compliance framework (KYC/AML) for issuance approval, Coinbase's transparent ledger for disclosure, Coinbase Exchange for secondary market making, and Prime for custody. The initial offerings will focus on crypto tokens, with a target size of $1 billion in Q1 of next year. For institutions, Coinbase will offer a settlement toolkit, real-time clearing, and a data API; for developers, Sonar will upgrade to support privacy-enhanced fundraising (zero-knowledge proofs to avoid sensitive disclosures). Ethena's on-chain crowdfunding platform, founded by KOL Cobie, has raised $51 million and completed 131 transactions. The rapid growth of its first project, Ethena's USDe stablecoin, demonstrates its potential. Echo's Sonar tool allows founders to self-manage token sales, reviving the 2017 ICO model, but things are different now—protected by the GENIUS Act, the regulatory framework is clear. Coinbase has officially stated that it will start with cryptocurrency token sales and expand to tokenized securities and real-world assets (RWA). This ambition extends beyond crypto; it aims to financialize everything, issuing stocks, real estate, and art on the blockchain. The final piece of the puzzle is the acquisition of Liquifi, which provides full lifecycle management of tokens—issuance, allocation, locking, and liquidity. Echo manages \"who can raise funds,\" while Liquifi manages \"how to operate and maintain,\" forming a closed loop. The institutional market is the third pillar. The Deribit acquisition is a milestone in crypto history, acquiring the world's largest derivatives exchange for $2.9 billion. Institutional clients account for 70% of its business, with daily trading volumes in the billions. Coinbase previously focused primarily on retail, with weak derivatives; now, it has addressed this weakness, significantly increasing options depth and futures liquidity. This is comparable to Goldman Sachs' investment banking + retail dual-track approach. Institutions are not just trading, but have also become seed users of Base/USDC. Management revealed that after the Deribit integration, the cross-selling rate reached 40%, with institutions expanding from derivatives to custody and clearing. The retail entry point is the fourth pillar. Coinbase's credit card is not just a payment tool, but the \"final link\" in the ecosystem. Partnering with AmEx, it targets the high-end market, with users spending an average of $3,000 per month, above average. Cashback of 2-4% in Bitcoin, linked to platform assets, with high holdings and proportions. At a deeper level, data and consumer habits are used for targeted marketing, recommending NFTs or DeFi. This model creates a closed-loop effect: users receive cashback by swiping their cards, invest the cashback amount in Base, thereby obtaining higher cashback and further stimulating more consumption. With regulatory support, this bridges fiat currency and crypto, lowering the barrier to entry. Content ecosystem is the fifth pillar. On October 20th, Coinbase spent $25 million to buy NFTs and relaunched the UpOnly podcast—a bullish show hosted by Cobie/Ledger. This is no coincidence, as it belongs to the Cobie group, the same group as Echo. This is about cultural positioning, using UpOnly to spread its philosophy and products, and enhance its community influence. Coinbase doesn't control advertising/creation, focusing purely on community tribute, which has sparked heated discussions. Combined with Echo, it forms a \"content + capital\" dual-engine, with podcasts exposing projects and Echo financing following. Future expansion will include Apple TV+-style services, with content becoming the stickiness engine. Regulatory barriers are the sixth pillar. Coinbase is listed domestically, subject to the SEC, and holds licenses in multiple states. After the GENIUS Act, its stock price rose 30%, highlighting the compliance advantages of USDC. It attracts traditional institutions, partners with JPMorgan, and allows Chase points to be converted to crypto. These barriers are high—Binance/OKX face pressure offshore, making it difficult for newcomers to overcome. Similar to the App Store's review process, it's strict in the short term but maintains quality in the long term. These pillars are not isolated, but form a closed loop. Developers raise funds using Echo/Liquifi, deploy on Base, acquire customers through Spindl, gain exposure through UpOnly, facilitate institutional Deribit trading, use Prime custody, facilitate retail credit card spending, and continuously optimize data. Coinbase is not buying companies, but weaving a network—from issuance to trading, from technology to culture, building a crypto \"Apple empire.\" Laying the groundwork for the next era. If Base and USDC are current cash cows, the x402 Foundation is Coinbase's bold bet on the future. Imagine an HTTP code that has been dormant for 30 years suddenly awakens and becomes a bridge connecting humans and the machine economy. This isn't science fiction; it's a real-life scenario that unfolded on September 23rd, when Coinbase and Cloudflare jointly established the x402 Foundation, while Google's AP2 protocol followed closely behind, transforming the HTTP 402 \"Payment Required\" status code into a native machine payment process. The story begins with a clear access path. In Coinbase's ecosystem, Base acts like an efficient tollbooth manager, handling low-fee settlements of just $0.001 per transaction; USDC plays the role of a frictionless universal currency, avoiding exchange rate \"roadblocks\"; and Custody, as the \"guardian\" of institutional-grade security, handles all ledger entries. The core of the protocol is the revival of HTTP 402, a long-dormant code that has now become a \"highway\" for AI payments. Imagine an AI agent crawling Cloudflare's CDN data and encountering a 402 response. It doesn't stop; instead, it automatically initiates a USDC payment, confirms it instantly, and continues to retrieve content—all without human intervention. The lineup of partners is truly star-studded, with initial partners including Google (launching with AP2), Adyen, PayPal, Mastercard, and developer platforms such as Etsy and Service Now. The pilot phase has begun, with Cloudflare's Agents SDK being the first to integrate x402 and is privately testing a \"pay per crawl\" mode—AI crawlers voraciously access massive amounts of web pages, with fees settled daily. Google's AP2 extends x402, supporting mixed payments of credit cards and stablecoins, with the first B2B procurement pilots launched on the Cloud Marketplace, involving Intuit and Salesforce. Coinbase acts as the \"bridge architect\" for crypto here: x402 settles through Base, while AP2's Mandates (digital contracts) act like smart sentinels, ensuring that every step of authorization and auditing is flawless. Why does AI need this \"payment script\"? Because AI agents are about to \"learn to spend money for you.\" Currently, AI like ChatGPT is still in the era of human order placement and payment, but in the future, they will autonomously shop or subscribe to services, requiring a reliable payment framework. AP2's Intent/Cart Mandates act as a \"plot twist\" to prevent fraud, allowing users to pre-sign a budget, the agent generates a shopping cart, and the entire process is traceable. x402 represents the \"climax\" of Crypto's instant settlement, using stablecoins to bypass bank delays. Gartner predicts that the AI ​​payments market will surge to a trillion dollars by 2030, with Crypto accounting for 10%. For Coinbase, the result of this story is that Base benefits from the low-fee advantage. Ten years ago, Coinbase started by facilitating human transactions, even raising funds in China, braving wind and rain. Ten years from now, it's more like laying an underground network: Base handles settlements, low-cost and efficient; USDC handles clearing, ensuring stable circulation; Echo handles issuance, securing an upstream position; and x402 connects to \"machines that spend money\" at the remote end. This Q3 financial report is a milestone, with total revenue of $1.87 billion and net profit of $433 million, but behind the numbers lies an imperial blueprint—from volatility dependence to stable rent collection; from an exchange to a full-stack hub. The future of crypto isn't about betting on prices, it's about building infrastructure. Coinbase's ambition, like Rome's road network, connects everything. In the next decade, when AI agents are everywhere, Coinbase may already be the \"Federal Reserve of the digital economy.\" But don't forget, imperial expansion always has its frontiers—regulation, competition, and black swan events. Investors, hold on tight; this show has only just begun.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div>CleanSpark CEO S. Matthew Schultz stated that the new regulations will provide faster grid access for BTC miners and AI data centers. The U.S. Energy Secretary urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to develop new regulations that would allow large-scale electricity users, such as AI data centers and BTC mining farms, to directly and quickly connect to the grid. In a letter released Thursday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright requested that FERC, the independent agency responsible for regulating interstate power grids, expedite the approval process, accelerate the review of grid access applications from large-scale electricity users, and develop standardized procedures that would allow them to directly connect to high-voltage transmission systems. High-voltage transmission systems have larger capacities, and large industrial facilities, such as high-speed, power-consuming facilities, are often directly connected to these systems. In his letter, Chris Wright wrote, \"U.S. electricity demand is projected to grow at an astonishing rate, primarily driven by the rapid expansion of large-scale electricity loads.\" While many factors drive this demand growth, such as home and vehicle electrification, a growing number of large commercial and industrial loads—especially data centers—are rapidly connecting to the power grid. BTC miners and AI centers will benefit. S. Matthew Schultz, CEO of BTC mining company CleanSpark, posted on the X platform on Friday that under new regulations, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) will be required to expedite the approval process for connecting \"flexible loads such as BTC miners and data centers\" to the grid.

            "title": "PYUSD: PayPal's Crypto Journey",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p>Author: Liu Honglin (Founder of Shanghai Mankiw Law Firm)</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">A $300 Trillion Mishap</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the early hours of October 16, 2025, a dramatic scene unfolded in the crypto market when stablecoin issuer Paxos accidentally minted and destroyed 300 trillion PayPal USD (PYUSD). CoinMarketCap data shows that PYUSD currently has a market capitalization of only about $2.6 billion, meaning the erroneous minting amount is equivalent to 113,250 times the circulating supply. If priced at $1, the total amount of erroneously minted PYUSD is equivalent to more than twice the global GDP, far exceeding the entire market capitalization of the US crypto market.</p> This means that, firstly, even if Paxos has sufficient reserves, its asset collateral ratio will instantly drop to zero in the face of a supply of 300 trillion, rendering users' PYUSD worthless, causing market confidence to collapse and triggering a chain reaction; secondly, if this massive amount of PYUSD is used for on-chain transactions and captured and exploited by arbitrage bots or market makers, even for just a few seconds, it will cause a sharp decoupling of the PYUSD price. Paxos's \"God-like authority\" (absolute control over minting and burning coins) due to the nature of its fiat-backed stablecoin ultimately led to a human error with potentially severe consequences. However, this same \"God-like authority\" also saved PYUSD from an instant collapse during the error correction process. PayPal USD (PYUSD) is a US dollar stablecoin launched by global payment giant PayPal in August 2023, and is the first compliant stablecoin issued by a \"non-crypto\" company. This stablecoin is 100% backed by US dollar cash, short-term US Treasury bonds, and cash equivalents, and is issued by New York-based cryptocurrency financial services company Paxos Trust, gradually rolling it out to PayPal customers in the United States. At that time, the stablecoin market was dominated by two giants: Tether's USDT, with a market capitalization exceeding $100 billion, and Circle's USDC, ranking second with approximately $30 billion. PayPal is a leading global third-party payment platform. As of the second quarter of 2025, the company had 438 million active users and approximately 20 million merchant accounts, processing a total transaction volume of $1.68 trillion in the past year. Its business covers over 200 markets. PYUSD, issued by PayPal, will be independently audited by a third-party accounting firm and subject to strict regulation by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). With its massive user base, mature payment network, and extensive regulatory compliance experience, PayPal seems to possess a natural advantage in issuing stablecoins—all of which suggests that PYUSD can easily replicate PayPal's success in the traditional payment sector and quickly seize the stablecoin market. But is this really the case? Why did PayPal launch a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a real asset (such as fiat currency, gold, or a basket of assets). It aims to maintain relative price stability through specific mechanisms. Its core objective is to solve the problem of large price volatility in traditional cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin), acting as a \"safe haven\" and an efficient payment tool in the crypto economy. For example, one stablecoin pegged to the US dollar (such as USDT, USDC, PYUSD) is typically equal to one US dollar. Stablecoins are a bridge connecting traditional finance and the crypto world; they represent the \"internetization of value.\" In the crypto ecosystem, they act as \"base money,\" providing functions such as a measure of value, a medium of payment, and a store of value. Cross-border transactions of traditional fiat currencies are like having a physical package delivered through multiple international courier companies. Each company needs to constantly verify information to ensure consistency, a very time-consuming process. Each courier company has different and fixed operating hours and charges certain handling fees, service fees, and exchange rate differences. Any problem in any link (such as incorrect information or damaged packages) will cause delays in the entire process. Its core is the \"institutional trust model,\" meaning we trust these centralized institutions to accurately record and transfer value for us. In contrast, cryptocurrency transactions are like sending a digital file via email. The transaction initiator creates a transaction, broadcasts it to the entire blockchain network, and nodes automatically verify the source and balance, transfer the funds, and record it on a globally shared, unique, and tamper-proof public ledger. The entire process requires no intermediaries and can be completed in just a few minutes or even seconds. **At its core is the \"mathematical trust model,\" meaning we no longer rely on the reputation of a particular institution, but rather trust the security and accuracy of mathematical algorithms, cryptography, and distributed networks.** Cryptocurrency transactions in the crypto world have restructured the way value is transferred, fundamentally simplifying processes and eliminating unnecessary intermediaries. World Bank data shows that the global average cost of cross-border remittances is as high as 6.2%, and for remittances of $200 to Africa, the average fee even exceeds 8%. However, using PYUSD for the same amount of cross-border transfer can reduce the cost to below 1%, with real-time arrival.** PayPal, as a traditional payment giant, chose to actively embrace stablecoins primarily to address its own growth pressures, improve payment efficiency, and adapt to the wave of financial digitalization. First, around the time PYUSD was launched, PayPal was facing growth pressure. The transaction profit margin of its core payment business was declining, and its stock price was also under pressure, making it urgently need to find new growth points. Meanwhile, the stablecoin market showed enormous profit potential. Taking USDT as an example, its issuer, Tether, earned approximately $13 billion in net profit through investment income from its reserve assets (mainly US Treasury bonds). In 2024, Tether held approximately $113 billion in US Treasury bonds, exceeding the holdings of all countries except 17, including Germany, the UAE, and Australia. As shown in the image above, PayPal's stock price had fallen by approximately 80% compared to ATH at the time. Secondly, based on the PayPal ecosystem and the massive user payment demand, PYUSD can effectively improve transaction efficiency and maintain account value through incentive policies. In short, PYUSD aims to be a medium of exchange for purchasing goods, sending, and receiving US dollars to US users. PYUSD supports: Transferring PYUSD between PayPal and compatible external wallets; making peer-to-peer payments using PYUSD; selecting PYUSD as the payment method at checkout; and converting any PayPal-supported cryptocurrency to PYUSD. As a stablecoin supported by the PayPal network, PYUSD combines PayPal's experience in payments with the high speed, low cost, and high programmability of blockchain protocols to significantly improve payment efficiency, reduce payment friction for users in virtual environments, and facilitate rapid value transfer. Furthermore, with its collaboration with more blockchains, PYUSD can be deployed not only within the PayPal ecosystem but also circulated and used in external wallets, Web3 application communities, and exchanges. In the future, PayPal hopes to leverage global payment scenarios to establish PYUSD as a bridge between fiat currency and Web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, covering remittances, B2B payments, and digital goods transactions, helping consumers, merchants, and developers seamlessly connect fiat and digital currencies. PYUSD is not operating alone in the payment field but collaborates with other stablecoins to jointly solve cross-border transaction issues, striving to achieve faster and lower-cost user payment solutions. For example, Paxos, the issuer of PYUSD, launched a stablecoin payment platform in October 2024 that simultaneously supports PYUSD, USDC, and Paxos' own USDP. Payment service providers can easily achieve instant conversion between USD and these various stablecoins. PayPal also partnered with Fiserv, a leading global payment service provider, in June 2025 to enable the circulation and conversion of PYUSD and FIUSD across their respective platforms and ecosystems. For users, a world that simultaneously supports multiple stablecoins and allows for free choice according to needs is perhaps a more anticipated world. PYUSD, with its ability to link with other stablecoins, can better meet interoperability requirements. <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"1761923758251031356.jpg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410531_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Finally, PayPal's issuance of a stablecoin is also aimed at positioning itself in the future trading market. The issuance of PYUSD can, on the one hand, enrich its product line, leveraging its massive user base (hundreds of millions of active users globally) and merchant network to create new value; on the other hand, PayPal also hopes to extend its advantages in the payment field to the emerging fields of crypto assets and blockchain, providing its users with a better payment experience, in order to gain a favorable position in future market competition.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The current stablecoin market can be divided into two parts based on the users and compliance requirements: the compliant world and the grassroots world.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> The compliant world is an elite game for PYUSD and USDC. There, transparency, regulatory compliance, and institutional adoption are core metrics. PYUSD and USDC are vying for the market of digital upgrades in traditional commerce and finance. USDC's advantage lies in its transparency and trust as a cornerstone of DeFi. The competition between the two is a race within the elite circle. The grassroots world is USDT's survival tool. There, entry barriers, ease of use, and cost are decisive factors. USDT users may not have bank accounts, proof of identity, or even a stable internet connection. They transfer USDT through Telegram bots, without gas fees or complex wallet addresses—as simple as sending a voice message. This is a parallel system that bypasses all traditional financial infrastructure. By 2025, PYUSD's market capitalization will have grown to approximately $2.64 billion, making it the world's sixth-largest stablecoin, but its market share will still be relatively small compared to the two giants. So, beyond the grassroots market dominated by USDT and the DeFi market controlled by USDC, where does PYUSD's future lie? The answer lies within the PayPal ecosystem itself. Unlike USDT, which primarily serves cryptocurrency transactions, PYUSD's biggest advantage lies in its seamless and deep integration with PayPal's vast existing payment network. On the one hand, PYUSD can upgrade stablecoins from simple \"payment tools\" to \"interest-bearing assets.\" For example, by offering PYUSD holders an annualized return of approximately 3.7%, users no longer need to transfer funds back and forth between bank accounts and payment tools, making PYUSD an integrated solution for payment and savings. On the other hand, PYUSD can become a breakthrough for cross-border trade for SMEs. For the 20 million SME sellers on the PayPal platform, cross-border payments have always been a pain point. Traditional bank wire transfers are expensive and slow, while through PYUSD, US sellers can make real-time, low-cost payments to suppliers anywhere in the world. When US merchants need to pay overseas suppliers, using PYUSD avoids cumbersome currency exchange, reduces friction costs, and saves time. This path, based on real business needs, is difficult for other stablecoins to replicate. When we discuss PYUSD, we are actually discussing two completely different topics: the evolution of stablecoin technology itself and different paths to financial inclusion. PYUSD represents a top-down, compliance-first approach—making cross-border payments more efficient and cheaper by transforming existing financial infrastructure; this is an elegant path of improvement. USDT, on the other hand, represents a bottom-up, demand-driven approach—directly serving those left behind by traditional finance, providing them with the most basic financial tools; this is a crude path of revolution. These two paths are not incompatible. In the foreseeable future, we will live in two parallel worlds simultaneously: in one world, multinational corporations use PYUSD for efficient cross-border settlements; in the other world, villagers in rural Africa receive remittances from overseas relatives using USDT. The future of the stablecoin market is likely not a \"winner-takes-all\" scenario, but rather a coexistence and prosperity of niche markets. Each stablecoin will operate on its own track, serving different users and solving different problems. For example, USDT will continue to dominate the grassroots economy and emerging markets, USDC will serve as a reliable cornerstone for DeFi and institutional finance, and PYUSD will continue to deeply cultivate the fields of compliant commercial payments, cross-border trade for SMEs, and daily transaction payments. The value of PayPal issuing PYUSD lies not in whether it can replace USDT or USDC, but in truly solving the pain points of the \"compliant world\" that other stablecoins cannot reach in its own arena—not replicating the success of USDT or USDC, but paving a unique path for compliant giants, focusing on the payment track of real-world needs. The Development History of PYUSD showcases a significant attempt by a traditional financial giant to enter the cryptocurrency field. Prior to the official launch of PYUSD, PayPal had been exploring the cryptocurrency space for nearly a decade. As early as 2013, PayPal began paying attention to cryptocurrencies. By 2020, PayPal supported US users in buying and selling mainstream cryptocurrencies, laying the technological and user foundation for the launch of PYUSD. Preparations for PYUSD can be traced back to 2022. On-chain records show that its first minting test occurred in November 2022, with a total of 1.1 million PYUSD tokens. The issuance of PYUSD was not without its challenges. Its original plan to issue in partnership with FTX was terminated due to the latter's collapse, and subsequent issuance plans were suspended in early 2023 due to an investigation by the New York State Department of Financial Services into its partner, Paxos. On August 7, 2023, PayPal officially announced the launch of its stablecoin PYUSD on Ethereum. As an ERC-20 token issued on Ethereum, PYUSD can seamlessly integrate with external developers, wallets, and Web3 applications, much like a new mobile phone with a mainstream operating system, allowing immediate access to numerous app stores, greatly reducing the barrier to entry for users and integration costs for developers. Furthermore, PYUSD is **issued by Paxos Trust Company** and is committed to being 100% backed by cash equivalents such as US dollar deposits and short-term US Treasury bonds, with monthly proof-of-reserve data released regularly to ensure PYUSD's security. Following its launch, PYUSD quickly gained market attention, reaching a market capitalization of $300 million within approximately five months. It was listed on several major exchanges, including Coinbase and Kraken. The large user base and deep liquidity on these exchanges created a perfect synergy with its application within the PayPal payment network. Users could easily trade and acquire PYUSD on exchanges like Coinbase and then transfer it to their PayPal or Venmo accounts for daily payments and transfers. In August 2024, PYUSD's market capitalization surpassed $1 billion for the first time, growing at a rate far exceeding that of USDT and USDC. Its primary issuance platform shifted from Ethereum to the Solana network. Compared to Ethereum's security but slower transaction speeds and higher payment fees, Solana's advantages lie in its instant settlement, average transaction fees below 1 cent, an ecosystem of over 2,500 developers, and unique token scaling features, supporting confidential transfers, transfer pegs, and memo fields required by PYUSD. Early growth of PYUSD was primarily driven by incentives within decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems like Solana. DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is an application of blockchain technology that aims to decentralize financial services through smart contracts and distributed ledgers, providing users with greater freedom and lower transaction costs. DeFi encompasses various financial services such as lending, financing, derivatives, trading, and insurance, and has rapidly emerged globally in recent years, attracting widespread attention and discussion. According to data from Syndica_io, at the time, 81% of PYUSD on Solana was used for DeFi protocols, primarily in the Kamino Finance project. Kamino Finance is a DeFi protocol launched in 2022 that integrates lending, liquidity provision, and leverage. On Kamino, approximately 470 million PYUSD could enjoy an annualized yield of 13.24%, with depositors receiving over 1.2 million PYUSD in additional rewards each week. Furthermore, on Kamino, PYUSD borrowers paid an interest rate of 3.28%, with a utilization rate of 5.31%; while on Kamino's competitor, the lending protocol MarginFi, the interest rate was only 1.54%, with a utilization rate of 4%. These incentives significantly boosted demand in the short term, causing the circulating supply of PYUSD on the Solana chain to surpass that of its native chain, Ethereum. As of August 2024, Solana held a 64% market share, while Ethereum held 36%. However, such high incentive levels could not be sustained in the long run. After PYUSD reduced yield opportunities on major decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms such as Kamino, the market capitalization of the PYUSD stablecoin fell from a peak of $1 billion in August to $618 million, a drop of approximately 40%. Entering 2025, PYUSD's development has shown a more diversified and in-depth trend: In early 2025, PayPal began offering a 3.7% annualized return on PYUSD balances to eligible US users, transforming PYUSD from a payment tool into a yield-generating digital asset and enhancing its appeal to retail users. In February 2025, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concluded its 16-month investigation into PYUSD, which had begun in November 2023, announcing that no enforcement action would be taken. This eliminated regulatory uncertainty for PYUSD, boosted market confidence, and paved the way for its widespread future application. In April 2025, PYUSD expanded its partnership with the exchange Coinbase, which began supporting a 1:1 exchange rate between PYUSD and USD, waiving transaction fees for retail and institutional clients. Coinbase also planned to explore new on-chain use cases for PYUSD with PayPal, and further support stablecoin use by PayPal's major merchant partners. This partnership expanded the adoption, distribution, and use of PYUSD, enhancing its competitiveness. In May 2025, PayPal unveiled its new AI-based, autonomous financial operating system, Financial OS, at its 2025 Dev Days. Financial OS provides the infrastructure for digital identity, smart wallets, agent communication protocols, and implementation APIs. PayPal aims to combine the Financial OS system with PYUSD to create an AI-driven financial infrastructure, hoping that AI agents will assist humans in executing complex business processes in the future. In June 2025, PYUSD's market capitalization **returned to $1 billion**, signifying a further increase in PYUSD's market acceptance. That same month, PayPal partnered with Fiserv, a leading global payment service provider, to enable the circulation and conversion of PYUSD and FIUSD across each other's platforms and ecosystems, expanding PYUSD's use cases. In September 2025, PYUSD **further innovated its technology and expanded its ecosystem**. On one hand, PYUSD partnered with the cross-chain interoperability protocol LayerZero, expanding to nine new blockchains, including Avalanche, Aptos, and Tron, each with its own unique features, allowing users to choose freely according to their actual needs. This expansion also introduced a permissionless version called PYUSD0, which acts as a highly efficient \"cross-chain highway,\" aiming to eliminate liquidity barriers between different blockchains. This marks PYUSD's evolution from a multi-chain stablecoin to a full-chain stablecoin in terms of liquidity. On the other hand, in the Asian market, PYUSD, through a partnership with BDACS, introduced KRW1 (a stablecoin backed by the Korean Won), facilitating local remittances and payments. In the same month, PayPal partnered with the decentralized finance platform Spark to integrate PYUSD into its lending marketplace, SparkLend. This collaboration aims to expand PYUSD's on-chain liquidity from the initial $100 million to $1 billion. This partnership leverages Spark's existing $8 billion stablecoin reserve pool to provide deep liquidity for PYUSD, enabling it to quickly become an important foundational asset in the DeFi ecosystem. During its two-year development, PYUSD rapidly expanded its application boundaries through cooperation with partners in different fields. Its cooperative ecosystem can be mainly divided into the following four categories: PYUSD's Business Model Stablecoins themselves have clear profit potential. PayPal's issuance of PYUSD primarily targets the following profit models: Float Gold Yields: This is the most direct way for stablecoins to generate profit. PYUSD is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar and backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasury bonds, and similar cash equivalents. Issuers can earn interest income by managing these reserve assets (primarily invested in safe assets such as short-term U.S. Treasury bonds). For example, as a reference, its main competitor, Tether (the issuer of USDT), achieved a net profit of $1.48 billion in the first quarter of 2025. Transaction and Settlement Revenue: PYUSD is deeply integrated into PayPal's payment ecosystem. By facilitating the circulation of PYUSD within its network, PayPal can collect potential transaction fees or settlement service fees. For example, PayPal's cryptocurrency payment service has a transaction fee rate of approximately 0.99%. Exploring Profitability in the DeFi Sector: PayPal is also actively exploring the application of PYUSD in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, such as through cooperation with DeFi protocols like Spark. Typically, the DeFi world generates revenue through providing liquidity, lending, and other services, and as the underlying asset, PYUSD's issuers can indirectly benefit from this. PYUSD is primarily marketed through the following methods: **Leveraging Payment Scenarios:** PayPal, with its network of over 400 million users and 20 million merchants, naturally embeds PYUSD into high-frequency, essential trade scenarios, creating genuine demand. For example, PayPal plans to offer PYUSD as a payment option to over 20 million small and medium-sized merchants on its platform by the end of 2025, particularly for US merchants to pay overseas suppliers. Furthermore, PayPal integrates with payment service providers like Hyperwallet to help businesses use PYUSD for large payments to freelancers and contractors worldwide. **Earnings Incentives (Providing Holding Rewards)** PayPal CEO Alex Chriss has explicitly stated that existing payment methods are convenient enough for US users, and stablecoins lack sufficient incentive to use them. Early on, PYUSD attracted users by offering an annualized deposit yield of 13.24% and a borrowing rate of 3.28% within decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems like Solana, leading to rapid user growth. Currently, PayPal's incentive programs target both retail users (e.g., PYUSD will offer users a 3.7% annualized yield starting in the summer of 2025) and institutional users (e.g., PayPal is preparing to partner with Anchorage Digital to launch a rewards program for institutional holders, aiming to allow users to earn yields without staking, borrowing, or reusing assets). PayPal is also partnering with several major exchanges, including Coinbase and Kraken, leveraging their large user base and deep liquidity to promote PYUSD. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Compliance Lessons from PYUSD Practice</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For publicly traded companies like PayPal, subject to multiple regulations, **compliance with the law is a legal prerequisite for conducting business.** The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) regulations explicitly require financial institutions under its jurisdiction to establish, record, and maintain effective KYC and AML programs to prevent financial crimes; the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and global anti-money laundering initiatives also mandate compliance obligations for financial institutions. PYUSD issuers PayPal and Paxos operate globally; failure to comply with these rules would mean immediately losing their licenses and ending their operations entirely.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Simply put, **non-compliance means closure**, which is the most fundamental and direct reason for PYUSD's compliance efforts.</p> Based on meeting legal requirements, a robust compliance system gives PYUSD a **strategic advantage**, allowing it to differentiate itself in the fiercely competitive stablecoin market. On the one hand, sound compliance procedures reassure traditional users, large enterprises, and traditional financial institutions unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies; on the other hand, if PYUSD is widely used for illicit activities, PayPal and Paxos will face substantial regulatory fines, criminal charges, and reputational damage. **Adhering to compliance is the lowest-cost risk management strategy**. Seeking a Compliance Partner<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>PYUSD is a stablecoin issued through a collaborative effort between PayPal and Paxos Trust Company. PayPal, as a payment platform with a large user base, is responsible for PYUSD's application scenarios and promotion, acting as its \"driver.\" Paxos, on the other hand, is responsible for PYUSD's technical support, compliant issuance, redemption, and reserve asset management, acting as its \"engine maker and maintainer.\" This division of labor allows PYUSD to leverage both PayPal's user base and Paxos's compliance advantages.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Seeking a Compliance Partner</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">PYUSD is a stablecoin issued through a collaborative effort between PayPal and Paxos Trust Company.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"1761923976251031642.jpg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410538_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>What are KYC and AML?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">PYUSD has not made any explicit disclosures regarding its KYC and AML practices. However, since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched an investigation into PYUSD in November 2023, Paxos actively cooperated with the regulatory investigation. By February 2025, the SEC had concluded its 16-month investigation into PYUSD without taking any enforcement action, proving that it complies with regulatory standards. This cleared up regulatory uncertainty for PYUSD, enhanced market confidence, and paved the way for its widespread future application.</p> ... Returning to the stablecoin minting and burning incident mentioned at the beginning of the article, it exposed the inherent technical governance and internal control risks of centralized stablecoins. While fiat currency reserves and regular audits are important, they cannot eliminate these risks. However, does this mean stablecoins are not secure in transactions? This incident actually demonstrates the transparency advantage of blockchain technology. Upon discovering the anomaly, Paxos immediately activated its emergency mechanism, burning and recovering all misminted tokens within 22 minutes, ensuring the total supply returned to normal levels. Compared to errors that may be hidden for a long time in traditional finance, blockchain errors are easier to detect and correct. In this sense, given the regulatory framework and the transparency of the blockchain, PYUSD may be safer and more trustworthy. Future stablecoin issuances must reconsider how to maintain rapid intervention capabilities (centralization) while minimizing the probability of human error (decentralization/automation). For example, at the technical level, outlier detection and time-based locking can be implemented. Outlier detection mechanisms can be embedded in smart contracts; for instance, any single transaction exceeding a certain threshold (e.g., 10%) of the total reserve must initiate a cooling-off period of one hour or be automatically suspended by the system, awaiting manual approval. At the internal control level, multi-signature should be mandatory. Minting/burning operations must employ a strict multi-signature mechanism, requiring at least three senior executives with different functional backgrounds (e.g., technology, finance, compliance) to jointly approve and sign, ensuring the verification of input parameters. Conclusion Looking back at the development of PYUSD, we can see a clear strategic path: not pursuing direct competition with USDT and USDC in the trading arena, but rather focusing on payment scenarios, especially cross-border business payments. PYUSD may never be able to replicate USDT's dominant position in cryptocurrency trading, nor does it need to. It is pioneering a new path connecting traditional commerce with the digital asset world—a more compliant path, more focused on real business needs, and more acceptable to the mainstream market. Centralization and decentralization are not opposites, but rather alternative tools. For ordinary users and small businesses, reliable, easy-to-use, and compliant payment tools are sometimes more practical than idealized decentralization. The story of PYUSD is far from over; it represents a possible integration of traditional finance and the crypto world—not disruption or replacement, but rather fusion and gradual progress.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div>A while ago (around October 20th, Eastern Time), Amazon Web Services experienced a widespread outage, severely impacting many blockchain systems in the crypto ecosystem, including Ethereum. Data shows that approximately 37% of Ethereum's mainnet nodes are hosted on Amazon Web Services, making these nodes vulnerable to the outage. The offline status of these nodes also hampered the performance of the Ethereum mainnet. Consequently, many online voices began to claim that \"Ethereum's decentralization is fake.\" Such events and their potential consequences were frequently discussed in the early days of the crypto ecosystem. I remember reading many articles on this topic when I first entered the crypto world. Back then, pioneers had already provided clear explanations of these issues, so such discussions didn't usually elicit such widespread agreement. Time has passed, and perhaps the pioneers of yesteryear have left the ecosystem, or perhaps they are no longer willing to waste their breath on such topics (as Satoshi Nakamoto said, those who understand, understand; those who don't, he doesn't have time to convince others). Now, when this situation arises, I see virtually no detailed feedback or response online regarding such agreement. Over the years, many new forces have entered this ecosystem. They are not as fortunate as I was back then, unable to understand the explanations of those pioneers on this issue. I don't want these new forces to be misled by such agreement, so in this article, I will do my best to share my understanding and views on this issue. First, the general viewpoint: - Whether it's Bitcoin or Ethereum, their greatness lies in designing a disruptive mechanism. This mechanism avoids the fatal single point of failure in traditional centralized systems. It also ensures that even if nodes in the system are subjected to a large-scale attack, the system will only experience performance degradation, not crash. The \"decentralization\" we are discussing does not guarantee that nodes themselves are not hijacked or controlled by centralization, but rather focuses on ensuring that the system does not crash even if nodes are hijacked and controlled by centralization, or even used to attack the system. Such a system can be considered free from centralized control, achieving technological neutrality and trust neutrality. To achieve the most ideal level of decentralization, nodes need to avoid being controlled or interfered with by centralization as much as possible. However, such decentralization does not fall from the sky automatically; it is never perfect and always requires continuous improvement and effort from generations of participants. Bitcoin must follow this path, and Ethereum must follow the same path. To some extent, Ethereum needs to work harder and improve in this area, because Bitcoin has already made significant progress in this regard. In a sense, the responsibility for the decentralization of the entire crypto ecosystem largely rests on Ethereum's shoulders. To understand this, let's start with the history of Bitcoin. In 2009, shortly after Bitcoin's launch, Madhi, a Finnish university student later considered one of Bitcoin's pioneers, eagerly asked Satoshi Nakamoto: What could he do for Bitcoin? Nakamoto's reply was straightforward (in essence): Run Bitcoin. What did Nakamoto mean? He meant that for the nascent Bitcoin, survival was paramount, and to survive, as many people as possible needed to run Bitcoin clients. The more people running Bitcoin clients, the more decentralized Bitcoin became. The more decentralized Bitcoin is, the stronger it becomes. At that time, Bitcoin had too few nodes and was too easily hijacked. If some force were to suddenly hack the few existing Bitcoin clients and delete the Bitcoin source code, Bitcoin would be immediately killed. Those who were watching the joke had every reason to say, \"Bitcoin's decentralization is fake.\" However, the birth of Bitcoin created a mechanism that made decentralization possible—a disruptive change from 0 to 1. However, this \"possibility of decentralization\" was still precarious. Therefore, Satoshi Nakamoto urgently hoped that more people would run Bitcoin so that it could flourish as soon as possible. In 2010, after WikiLeaks exposed the US diplomatic incident, the Bitcoin community called for using Bitcoin donations to break financial blockades, which Satoshi Nakamoto strongly opposed. His reasoning is simple: the number of Bitcoin nodes, still in their infancy, is very small, and the entire system could still be completely hijacked. In this situation, if Bitcoin is drawn into a political conflict, its fate could be dire. If the US government were to use its national power to attack Bitcoin at this time, Bitcoin could very well be destroyed. Those who are watching the spectacle could easily say, \"Bitcoin's decentralization is fake.\" However, Bitcoin at this point is much stronger than it was in 2009. Even if the US government uses its national power, attacking it would become much more difficult. Bitcoin has gradually evolved from 1 to 10, and decentralization has begun to grow stronger. This \"strength\" didn't fall from the sky; it was built by the efforts of participants in the community, inspired by Bitcoin's ingenious mechanisms, and is the result of the selfless dedication and hard work of a large number of Bitcoin pioneers. In 2017, Blockstream launched Bitcoin in space, on a satellite. Bitcoin went from Earth to space. It's no exaggeration to say that even if the internet on Earth were destroyed, Bitcoin could still run on a satellite in space. At that point, it would be extremely difficult for any force in the world to completely destroy Bitcoin. And today, Bitcoin's robustness is even more evident. All of this is the achievement of generations of community members through continuous effort and innovation. Without the tireless efforts of these individuals, Bitcoin could have been easily destroyed at any point, and those who were gloating could have said, \"Bitcoin's decentralization is fake.\" This is true for Bitcoin, and it's also true for Ethereum. Ethereum's efforts are focused on continuously improving and refining its mechanisms, ensuring that it can function normally even when some nodes are controlled by centralized institutions (this is part of the definition of a consensus mechanism), but it cannot guarantee that the nodes themselves will not be controlled by centralized entities. Returning to the problem Ethereum encountered this time, I would view it as follows: Amazon controlled 37% of Ethereum's nodes and used this to launch an attack on Ethereum (paralyzing these nodes). Did Ethereum crash under this attack? If Ethereum crashed, then there is a real problem, and decentralization is fake. If not, it proves that Ethereum's decentralization is effective, although the effect is not ideal and there is still much room for improvement. On the contrary, the other systems that crashed in this attack fully exposed their own \"centralization\" problems—they were centrally controlled, and once a problem occurred, the consequences were what we saw. From another perspective, this further proves the importance of decentralization. In this incident, 37% of Ethereum nodes were controlled by \"centralized institutions,\" indicating that the operation and maintenance of Ethereum nodes is not decentralized enough. How to solve this problem? The Bitcoin community already has classic examples: Maddie contributed an extra node to Bitcoin, and Blockstream ran a Bitcoin node in space. They are all doing their best to contribute to Bitcoin's decentralization. Without them, Bitcoin would not have the brilliance and achievements it has today. Similarly, the decentralization of Ethereum nodes also requires community effort. For example, avoid relying solely on a single cloud service; instead, try using private server systems to run nodes. Although many node operators, for commercial reasons, are reluctant to leave Amazon due to its superior service and experience, I believe this incident will prompt them to be more vigilant and make significant improvements. Of course, the best solution is to hope that one day the crypto ecosystem will have a decentralized cloud that surpasses Amazon. This is precisely the direction the crypto ecosystem has been striving for. Ethereum's decentralization is not a sham. It effectively withstood Amazon's \"attack,\" but it is not perfect and needs further improvement. This requires the efforts of the entire community and a genuine belief in the fundamental value of \"decentralization.\"</div></div>",
