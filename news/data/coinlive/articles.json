            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Matt Crosby, Head of Research and Analysis, Bitcoin Magazine Pro; Translated by: Shaw &amp; Jinse Finance</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On-chain metrics and technical analysis alone cannot fully understand Bitcoin's price movements. External macroeconomic factors have a significant impact on Bitcoin's cyclical behavior. To understand Bitcoin, these external factors need to be combined with other key indicators to gain a comprehensive market perspective.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Monetary Policy</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Bitcoin and the S&amp;P 500 index exhibit a very strong positive correlation, meaning they typically move in tandem. When the stock market rises, Bitcoin tends to rise as well; when the stock market falls, Bitcoin typically falls as well. This correlation indicates that understanding the factors influencing the stock market is crucial for Bitcoin analysis.</strong> The Federal Reserve's balance sheet provides key information about monetary conditions. During periods of quantitative tightening, balance sheets shrink, and liquidity constraints suppress speculative desires, typically limiting Bitcoin's upside potential. Conversely, during periods of quantitative easing, balance sheets expand rapidly, and ample liquidity encourages risk-taking, which usually aligns with Bitcoin's bullish performance. Figure 1: Relationship between the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet and Bitcoin Price. Global M2 Money Supply Global broad money supply (M2) represents the total amount of money circulating globally, including cash equivalents and short-term deposits. While many analysts focus on the absolute value of the M2 supply, **examining the year-on-year growth rate of M2 provides a deeper understanding of Bitcoin price dynamics.** Year-on-year growth reflects the acceleration or deceleration of monetary expansion, rather than the absolute value of a natural upward trend over decades. Figure 2: Analyzing global M2 money supply using year-on-year growth rate to illustrate its correlation with BTC. The year-on-year growth rate of global M2 money supply almost perfectly coincides with Bitcoin's expansion and severe bear market periods. This indicator is crucial because Bitcoin is a global asset, not limited to US investors. Global monetary policy, not just the Federal Reserve's policy, is the main driver of Bitcoin's macroeconomic landscape. Institutional Fund Flows The introduction of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in recent years has fundamentally changed the dynamics of Bitcoin fund flows, making it easy for institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals to accumulate Bitcoin. **ETF cumulative fund flows can reflect institutional holdings in real time.** Large inflows into ETFs typically coincide with periods of rising Bitcoin prices, as institutions invest significant amounts. Conversely, large outflows from ETFs usually occur before or simultaneously with falling Bitcoin prices, as institutions reduce their holdings. Figure 3: Growth of Bitcoin ETFs. The Relative Strength Index (DXY) measures the relative purchasing power of the US dollar against a basket of other fiat currencies. Examining the year-over-year change in DXY provides deeper insights than the absolute value. Bitcoin is negatively correlated with DXY. A weakening DXY year-over-year suggests a favorable trend for Bitcoin. A weaker dollar makes hard assets like Bitcoin more attractive as dollar holders seek to preserve value. However, **when the DXY (US Dollar Index) strengthens year-over-year, it indicates that Bitcoin will face headwinds.** Figure 4: The inverse relationship between the US Dollar Index and Bitcoin prices. <br/></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Treasury Companies Accumulate</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Digital asset treasury reserves have rapidly incorporated Bitcoin into their corporate strategies, with the top 20 Bitcoin treasury companies currently holding approximately 1 million Bitcoins. More than 100 publicly listed treasury companies globally are actively adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This represents a significant reduction in the supply of Bitcoin, as held Bitcoin typically remains illiquid for extended periods rather than being frequently traded.</p> Figure 5: Bitcoin Treasury Tracker shows the BTC accumulation of the top 10 listed treasury companies. From a purely supply and demand economics perspective, these institutions removing 1 million Bitcoins from the liquid supply is equivalent to building structural support. Any asset that can attract hundreds of billions of dollars in inflows represents genuine confidence and optimistic market sentiment. Conclusion A true understanding of Bitcoin requires combining on-chain metrics, technical analysis, and macroeconomic factors. The maturation of Bitcoin necessitates a complex, multi-faceted analysis.</div></div>",

            "title": "Has the AI ​​unemployment wave begun, with Blockchain laying off nearly 50% of its staff?",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div>On February 26, 2026, Block, Inc. notified its global employees that more than 4,000 employees had been laid off or entered a consultation period, reducing the company's total global workforce from 2025. The number of employees plummeted from 10,205 at the end of the year to less than 6,000, representing a layoff rate of nearly 40% to 50%. This is one of the largest single institutional layoffs in the technology and fintech sector since 2026, and several mainstream media outlets such as Reuters, CNBC, and Bloomberg have called it a landmark event driving layoffs through AI. <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span mpa-font-=\"\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Layoff Decision Amid Strong Financial Report</span></span></span></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span mpa-font-=\"\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span leaf=\"\">Block</span></span><span leaf=\"\">This is not a troubled company.</span></span></p><span leaf=\"\">Block is not a troubled company.</span><span leaf=\"\"> This company, formerly known as Square, was led by Jack Dorsey and its business covered merchant payments, mobile finance, and installment payments, including Cash App and Afterpay. In the fintech sector, it is not on the verge of recession; on the contrary, it has just delivered a solid growth report. In the fourth quarter of 2025, Block's gross profit reached $2.87 billion, a year-on-year increase of 24%. Cash App's gross profit was $1.83 billion, a year-on-year increase of 33%; Square's gross profit was $993 million, a year-on-year increase of 7%. Adjusted operating income was $588 million, with a profit margin of 20% and earnings per share of $0.65. The full-year figures were also impressive. Gross profit totaled $10.36 billion in 2025, representing a 17% year-over-year increase. Guidance for 2026 has been further revised upwards, with gross profit projected at $12.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share increasing by 54%. Looking only at the financial statements, it's hard to imagine this company laying off employees at this time. Layoffs Lead to Stock Price Surge: Why Did the Market Buy It? In the past, layoffs often meant declining demand or operational pressure, but Block's market reaction was completely the opposite. As news of layoffs and financial reports were released simultaneously, the company's stock price surged by over 23% in after-hours trading, reaching a high of nearly $69, increasing its market capitalization by approximately $70 billion to $80 billion in a single day. The following day, in pre-market trading, the increase remained around 20%. The capital market's judgment is quite direct. In the past, the company's growth relied on personnel expansion. Increased revenue was often accompanied by rising costs, resulting in slow profit margin improvements. Now, investors are beginning to believe that a different model is emerging. If 6,000 employees, combined with intelligent systems, can achieve the output of 10,000 or even more people in the past, then business growth will no longer follow the old path of linear increases in labor and costs. </span><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span mpa-font-=\"\"><span leaf=\"\"><img alt=\"NsVohBibBC52aWXfqFwF24Gu3ZaT7m8HK0RyhwTx.jpeg\"

Meta Platforms or Google, which indirectly adjust their workforce size through slowing hiring, natural attrition, or structural optimization, Block opted to cut nearly half of its employees in one go. While similar signals have emerged in the industry—for example, IBM and SAP have publicly mentioned the efficiency restructuring brought about by AI—the magnitude of these developments is far less aggressive than that of Block. It is becoming increasingly clear which jobs are most easily replaced. Routine data analysis, report generation, basic coding, customer service Q&amp;A, and initial risk screening are all efficiently covered by automated models. What remains relatively irreplaceable are high-level strategic judgment, complex negotiations, ethical decision-making, original creativity, and genuine interpersonal leadership skills. Consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company predicts that by 2030, AI may automate nearly 45% of global work, while Gartner... The author leans more towards the \"enhancement\" theory, believing that AI will reshape jobs rather than simply eliminate them. The author clearly stands on the more radical side. However, dissenting voices also exist. Some analysts point out that this action also carries the characteristics of \"COVID-19 over-hiring adjustments\": the company's headcount surged from 3,900 in 2019 to 12,500 in 2022, with a significant increase in the proportion of international employees, which had previously begun to shrink slightly. Some employees anonymously reported that \"AI is an excuse, and performance pressure has long existed.\" AI as a Core Variable in Organizational Restructuring Technological revolutions have never merely changed tools, but rather the way organizations are organized. The Industrial Revolution eliminated artisans but gave rise to modern manufacturing; the internet diminished traditional media jobs while simultaneously creating the digital economy. Every leap in efficiency is accompanied by structural growing pains. This round of layoffs may signify that AI is beginning to truly enter the core of enterprise organizations, rather than just being a functional upgrade at the product level. The question is no longer whether AI will change the company, but rather the speed at which that change occurs. On February 26, 2026, what the fintech industry saw was not just a company's layoff announcement, but the nascent form of a new company model. According to a Challenger report, over 55,000 layoffs directly related to AI occurred in 2025. This trend accelerated into 2026. The technology industry is bearing the brunt. Highly digitized sectors such as fintech, software, and e-commerce are more likely to be restructured. Laying off ordinary jobs and hiring AI engineers and model training experts has become the new hiring logic. A \"talent war\" for AI is brewing. A deeper impact lies on the demand side. If automation leads to job losses and decreased consumer spending, business growth may conversely be suppressed. Some social media comments have raised this cyclical question: when companies increase profits through AI, but weaken customer revenue streams, how long can this growth be sustained? The tension between efficiency and employment is becoming a new macroeconomic variable. The divergent reactions of the capital market and public sentiment are evident. Investors and analysts are generally positive. Forbes called it a watershed moment in the AI ​​era, while Seeking Alpha argued that the company's aggressive actions would significantly increase operating leverage. Management emphasized that this was positioned for long-term growth. Public discussion, however, was more complex. Some believe that AI can free humans from repetitive labor, allowing them to focus more on creation and judgment; others worry that if automation outpaces re-employment, it could create a cycle of job contraction and declining demand. A relatively neutral viewpoint points out that technology often creates new jobs, but only if society invests in a sufficiently large-scale reskilling training system. Dorsey's assessment is straightforward: most companies will follow suit within a year. He even feels he's moving too slowly. If this assessment holds true, it means the tech industry will shift from a logic of scale expansion to a logic of intelligent leverage. The size of a company is no longer determined by the number of employees, but by the density of intelligent systems. Over the past year, the capabilities of generative AI and automation tools have seen near-exponential growth. Model update frequency has decreased, costs have fallen, and inference capabilities have improved. Tasks that previously required ten people to complete, such as report analysis, marketing material creation, or customer service triage, may now require only one person and one system. Rising stock prices have reinforced this expectation—the market rewards not only cost reductions, but also new production functions. Meanwhile, public sentiment remained somber. Some comments bluntly stated, \"Profitable companies cut 40% of their workforce,\" while others sarcastically remarked, \"The market treats humanity as a liability.\" Some departing employees described the process as \"decent but burdensome,\" noting that while compensation was acknowledged, the reality of unemployment remained severe. Policy discussions are rapidly approaching a practical level. In Europe, the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) came into effect in 2024, covering high-risk employment-related AI systems such as recruitment, performance evaluation, and task assignment. These systems are expected to be fully implemented around 2026. The EU has also passed the Digital Europe Programme and... The InvestAI plan invests hundreds of billions of euros in retraining, skills subsidies, and the development of a lifelong learning system in an attempt to mitigate the impact of AI transformation on the employment structure. In the United States, the job displacement caused by AI has gradually become a public issue. Businesses and policymakers are increasing their investment in retraining, and technology companies are launching AI skills training programs for workers. At the same time, universal basic income (UBI) has re-entered mainstream discussion, with figures such as Elon Musk and Andrew Yang arguing for the need for new social safety net mechanisms to avoid the structural risk that automation could increase efficiency while weakening consumer spending. The layoffs at Block have transcended personnel adjustments within a single company; they are more like a public signal: AI is no longer just an auxiliary tool, but is becoming a core variable determining organizational structure. The way we measure company size is changing—from expanding headcount to increasing intelligence density. This transformation means higher productivity and profit potential, but it inevitably comes with structural growing pains. Transparent communication and relatively generous compensation can buffer the impact, but they cannot mitigate the sharpness of this era's turning point itself. 2026 may be seen as a turning point—when companies begin to systematically rebuild themselves around AI, the labor market must also be restructured in tandem. The question has changed. It's no longer whether AI will change employment, but how human society can find a new balance between growth and stability amidst the leap in efficiency. </p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Headline</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>▌OpenAI Announces $110 Billion New Investment at a Valuation of $730 Billion</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">OpenAI announced that it has secured $110 billion in new investment at a valuation of $730 billion. OpenAI's funding includes $30 billion from SoftBank, $30 billion from Nvidia (NVDA.O), and $50 billion from Amazon. OpenAI and Amazon (AMZN.O) will develop custom models. OpenAI will utilize 2 gigawatts of Trainium chip computing power through Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. SoftBank's cumulative investment in OpenAI is estimated at $64.6 billion, giving it approximately a 13% stake in OpenAI after the transaction.</p> Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published an article on the X platform outlining Ethereum's scaling plan, covering short-term Gas optimization and long-term phased deployment of ZK-EVM. In the short term, the Glamsterdam upgrade will introduce a block-level access list for parallel verification, ePBS will allow for a larger proportion of time slots to be used for block verification, and Gas repricing will ensure that operational costs are aligned with actual execution time. A multi-dimensional Gas mechanism will be implemented in phases. First, in Glamsterdam, the cost of \"state creation\" will be separated from the cost of \"execution and calldata,\" with state creation Gas not included in the approximately 16 million transaction Gas cap. At the EVM level, a \"reservoir\" dimension mechanism will be introduced, prioritizing the consumption of dedicated dimension Gas by default, and consuming from the reservoir when insufficient. Later, a multi-dimensional pricing mechanism will be implemented, with different dimensions having different floating Gas prices. Long-term scaling includes two parts: ZK-EVM and blob. Regarding blob, the plan is to continuously iterate PeerDAS, aiming to achieve a data processing capacity of approximately 8MB per second. In the future, Ethereum block data will directly enter the blob. ZK-EVM will be implemented in phases: in 2026, validator clients supporting ZK-EVM will be available, allowing approximately 5% of the network to rely on it; in 2027, this will expand to a larger proportion of a minority of nodes, while simultaneously advancing formal verification; once conditions are ripe, it will transition to a three-out-of-five mandatory proof mechanism, ultimately continuously improving the security and formal verification level of ZK-EVM, and involving VM changes such as RISC-V. As of press time, according to CoinGecko data: BTC price is $65,865.85, a 24-hour change of -2.5%; ETH price is $1,930.04, a 24-hour change of -5.0%; BNB price is $614.11, a 24-hour change of -2.0%.

Policy: ▌SEC Chairman Paul Atkins: Missed Crypto Opportunities During Gensler's Tenure, Accelerating the Reshaping of the Regulatory Framework. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins stated that the SEC is attempting to regain momentum in crypto regulation and make up for previous \"significant misses.\" At a University of Texas event, he criticized the SEC for failing to adapt to innovation during Gary Gensler's tenure. Atkins pointed out that since the Donald Trump administration took office, the SEC's stance has become more industry-friendly, establishing a crypto task force, dropping several enforcement cases, and launching \"Project Crypto\" to modernize regulatory rules. He emphasized that while the price of individual cryptocurrencies may fluctuate, he is more optimistic about the potential of distributed ledger technology in payment clearing and settlement systems. This week, the SEC approved WisdomTree's digital currency market fund to enable 24/7 trading and instant settlement. Atkins also stated that tokenized bank deposit products will be launched in the future. <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>▌Coinbase Litigation Head: Some US States \"Mislead\" the Public on Prediction Markets</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Coinbase's Vice President of Legal Affairs and Head of Global Litigation, Ryan VanGrack, stated that some US state governments have \"misled\" the public on prediction markets, attempting to rewrite the scope of Congress's authorization for derivatives regulation.</p> Previously, after launching a prediction market in partnership with Kalshi, Coinbase had filed lawsuits in Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, and Nevada. Some state regulators issued stop-loss orders or public warnings, stating that sports event contracts constitute illegal gambling. VanGrack stated that these actions pose a \"real and imminent\" risk to customers, forcing the company to seek clarification on regulatory jurisdiction in federal court. Senator Warren and OCC Chief Discuss WLFI-Related Crypto Bank Application Senator Warren called the application \"the most despicable\" presidential corruption scandal, pointing to investment institutions related to UAE National Security Advisor Sheikh Tahnoonbin Zayed Al Nahyan investing $500 million in WLFI four days before Trump's inauguration, acquiring a 49% stake, of which approximately $187 million went to Trump family entities. Warren urged Gould to reject or suspend the review of the application, stating that approval would make it \"an accomplice to corruption.\" Gould refused to intervene, stating that he would process the application according to standard procedures, and countered that the only political pressure he felt came from Warren. Forty-one House Democrats had previously written to the Treasury Secretary, warning that approving the license could threaten \"the legitimacy of the U.S. banking system and its independence from foreign actors.\" <hr/><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Blockchain Applications</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>▌Barclays is evaluating the construction of a blockchain platform to process payments and deposits</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Barclays has sent requests for information to some potential technology vendors to evaluate how to build a blockchain platform to process banking services such as payments. Its applications may include stablecoins and tokenized deposits, with the goal of finalizing vendor selection as early as April. The application of stablecoins in the payment field is expanding; Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that annual stablecoin payment transaction volume could exceed $50 trillion by 2030. Meta has also previously tested integrating stablecoin payments into its applications.</p> Several banks have already begun deploying blockchain systems. JPMorgan previously launched JPM Coin, a deposit token for institutional clients, for payments. HSBC plans to expand its tokenized deposit service to corporate clients in the US and UAE in the first half of this year. OpenAI Executive: ChatGPT Daily Active Users Exceed 900 Million, Paid Subscribers Reach 50 Million. OpenAI executive Nick Turley stated that ChatGPT's daily active users have exceeded 900 million, and paid subscribers have reached 50 million. Cryptocurrency ▌JPMorgan Chase: Market to Boost if Crypto Market Structure Bill Passes JPMorgan Chase states that even with current market sentiment remaining weak, the crypto market could see a significant boost in the second half of the year if the US legislature passes a comprehensive crypto market structure bill before mid-year. In a research report, the bank noted, \"If the bill passes, it will reshape the market structure by clarifying regulatory rules, ending 'enforcement instead of regulation,' promoting asset tokenization, and encouraging greater institutional participation.\" ▌Tether's Secondary Market Valuation Could Reach $375 Billion, Largest Shareholder's Wealth Could Surpass Buffett According to Forbes, stablecoin issuer Tether's valuation could reach $375 billion, placing its owners among the world's richest people. Industry sources say Tether's trading price on the secondary market ranges from $350 billion to $375 billion. Based on conversations with cryptocurrency investors and executives, Forbes currently values ​​Tether at approximately $200 billion, still significantly higher than the $50 billion valuation a year ago. At a $200 billion valuation, CFO Giancarlo Devasini, holding approximately 44-45% of the shares, would have a net worth of approximately $89 billion; CEO Paolo Ardoino and former CEO Jean-Louis van der Velde, each holding approximately 19%, would have a combined net worth of approximately $38 billion; and General Counsel Stuart Hoegner, holding approximately 12%, would have a net worth of nearly $25 billion. If we use the lower end of the secondary market valuation of $350 billion, Devasini's stake would be worth over $156 billion, enough to place him among the world's top ten richest people, surpassing Warren Buffett's current net worth of $147.8 billion. Former Mt. Gox CEO Proposes Bitcoin Hard Fork to Recover $5.2 Billion in Stolen Assets Mark Karpelès, former CEO of the defunct exchange Mt. Gox, recently proposed a Bitcoin hard fork to recover approximately 79,956 BTC stolen in the 2011 hack, worth about $5.2 billion at current prices. The proposal targets a wallet address associated with the 2011 Mt. Gox system breach, which received nearly 80,000 Bitcoins after the attack and has remained untouched for over 15 years. Under current Bitcoin rules, these funds can only be transferred if the corresponding private key is held. According to the proposal, the new rules would allow the unspent outputs in an Mt. Gox recovery address to be controlled via signatures, thereby bringing the funds into the existing judicial oversight and compensation process to repay Mt. Gox creditors. Karpelès stated that this proposal is only a starting point for discussion, intending to limit the rule change to a single address and activate it at a specific block height in the future. However, the proposal also acknowledges that this plan requires a coordinated upgrade across the entire network, and if some community members refuse to support it, it could lead to a blockchain split risk. It should be noted that these approximately 80,000 BTC are not currently part of the assets allocated to Mt. Gox creditors, nor are they controlled by the bankruptcy trustee. According to market news, Block, Inc., the payment company owned by Jack Dorsey, just disclosed that it added 340 BTC to its holdings in the fourth quarter of 2025, worth $22 million. Liquid Capital (formerly LD Capital) founder Yi Lihua responded to rumors of a \"Jane Street sell-off\" on social media, stating that he is currently waiting for confirmation of the bottom before buying. He clarified that he is not engaging in conspiracy theories; the trend is downward, and he is currently waiting for confirmation of the bottom before buying. Amundi purchased 3.77 million shares of MSTR, bringing its total holdings to $641 million. According to market news, Amundi, a French asset management company with $2.8 trillion in assets under management, disclosed that it purchased 3.77 million shares of MSTR, bringing its total holdings to 4.79 million shares, worth $641 million. This represents a 373% increase in its MSTR holdings. **▌Bitcoin Mining Company Mara Holdings Increases Holdings by 572 Bitcoins** According to market news, publicly traded Bitcoin mining company Mara Holdings (stock code $MARA) has increased its holdings by 572 Bitcoins, bringing its total holdings to 53,822. **▌US 2-Year Treasury Yield Falls to Lowest Level Since 2022** The yield on the US 2-year Treasury note has fallen to its lowest level since 2022. **▌Trump: Fed Chair Powell Will Soon Leave the Fed** US President Trump stated that Federal Reserve Chair Powell will soon leave the Federal Reserve. <hr/><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Golden Encyclopedia</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>▌What is the value of BTC?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">BTC is often compared to \"digital gold,\" but its core value is actually the \"promise of immutable scarcity.\" First, BTC has monetary properties, but it is not a currency because it lacks a stable unit of account. It is a pure \"monetary property,\" that is, a consensus game among humans regarding \"what can serve as a store of value.\" Gold also has this core value, but gold's scarcity depends on the physical constraints of geology, while BTC's scarcity depends on mathematics and game theory—it's a scarcity at the information level.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But what makes BTC truly unique is not the coin itself, nor the \"digital gold\" narrative, but rather that blockchain is the first permissionless, unclosable value settlement layer in human history. This is a completely new category of infrastructure. No sovereign entity can unilaterally prevent the final settlement of a BTC transaction.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> This attribute may be underestimated in peacetime, but it will be repriced during periods of geopolitical conflict and escalating capital controls. BTC is a systemic hedge. It doesn't hedge against inflation, nor does it hedge against the US dollar. It hedges against the structural degradation of institutional trust. In other words, BTC's value is not endogenous, but reflexive: the more people believe it has value, the more valuable it becomes, and vice versa. Therefore, BTC is the financialized expression of humanity's distrust of its own institutional capabilities. Its ceiling depends on the depth and breadth of this distrust, and its floor depends on the existence of a superior alternative.</p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Blue Fox Notes</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some people have asked whether Ethereum would collapse if stablecoin issuers like Circle (USDC) and Tether (USDT) built public chains. I wasn't planning on answering this question. However, several friends have privately messaged me asking about it, so I'll briefly discuss it.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The conclusion is that Ethereum will not collapse. Overall, it will benefit.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the future stablecoin battle, the most important thing is the front-end distribution channels: Meta, MrBeast (Tom Lee's Bitmine has invested $200 million), Robinhood, Aave, Polymarket, Lighter, Uniswap, exchanges, wallets… Stablecoin issuers are not the strongest in the entire chain, and their L public chains do not naturally possess network effects.</p> ... Major players like Meta won't just support Circle's chain, but will support multiple chains; channels like MrBeast, which are expected to be deeply integrated with the Ethereum ecosystem, will prioritize supporting Ethereum; Robinhood is also building its L2 network (Ethereum ecosystem) on Arbitrum, and may become an independent L2 in the future; Polymarket also plans to build an Ethereum L2... The source of network effects lies where users are reached. As long as Ethereum L1/L2 fees are low enough and speeds are fast enough (at the same level), its security and decentralization advantages are unique. Currently, Ethereum L1 is moving towards 10,000 tps, and L2 is moving towards over one million tps, so fees and speed will not be an issue in the future. Issuers building their own chains will not lead to a large-scale migration of traffic; on the contrary, they may eventually gradually become Ethereum L2. Arc, developed by Circle, is an L1 chain that supports USDC as its native gas fee, provides sub-second settlement, and offers institutional-grade privacy/compliance. It is expected to launch later this year. Even so, USDC is still issued on multiple chains, including Ethereum and Solana, with the Ethereum ecosystem still holding the majority share. How it will develop after launch remains uncertain. Tether's USDT also operates on multiple chains. Each stablecoin issuer builds its own L1 chain, creating competitive pressure and making it difficult to run on each other's chains. The Ethereum ecosystem, being inclusive, will remain the most important chain supporting different stablecoins. Multi-chain issuance of stablecoins is common, meaning that even with Arc's launch, it will only supplement existing systems, not replace them. It will have its own institutional trading scenarios, but its ultimate market share will not entirely depend on the stablecoin issuer, but rather on the stablecoin's distribution channels and high-frequency application scenarios. For distribution channels, cost, speed, and security are all important, and Ethereum currently offers the best balance among these three. Distribution channels cannot and will not ignore Ethereum. Currently, Ethereum dominates the stablecoin market share, and its share continues to grow. The total stablecoin market capitalization in February 2026 is estimated at $3100-$3200 (DefiLlama/TRM Labs data), of which: • Ethereum: 52-60% (~$1530-$1650), with a 40% growth in 2025 (from $115B to $153B). It has the largest share, handling more than half of stablecoin activity. • Tron: 25-30% (~$830-$840), dominated by USDT, but growth is slowing (fees have risen to $0.50 per transaction). • Solana: 4.5% (~130), USDC accounts for 77%, benefiting from low fees ($0.01 USD/transaction).\n• Others: BNB Chain grows by 133% (2025), but its share is small; L2 such as Arbitrum/Base accounts for ~100%, totaling over 70% of the Ethereum ecosystem (L1+L2).\n• In addition, by currency, USDT ~1840 (59%), USDC ~750 (24%). USDC is growing rapidly (+6.39% in February 2026), but most of it is on Ethereum. In terms of transaction volume, stablecoin transfers exceeded $10.5T in January 2026 (a record high). Ethereum handled the majority of institutional/DeFi traffic (projected to exceed ~40T for the whole year), far surpassing PayPal (20T) and approaching Visa (15T). These are all due to network effects. Do you think users will naturally migrate simply because a stablecoin chain has emerged? Ethereum still boasts the largest developer ecosystem, the most thriving DeFi ecosystem, and stable operation without downtime. Would institutions really place their trading scenarios on potentially unreliable centralized L1 chains? Ethereum's competitor has always been itself, not any other chain. As long as its fees/speed are no less than any other L1 chain, its security and decentralization advantages will be unparalleled. The future of Ethereum, besides stablecoins, includes asset tokenization, DeFi, and the AI ​​agent economy—all major trends. The L1 chains built by stablecoin issuers are not enough to kill Ethereum. By the way, what's the status of Tether's support for the Plasma chain?</div></div>",

            "title": "Hibernation and Return: Meta Knocks on the Door of Stablecoin Payments Once Again",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div>At the beginning of 2026, a rumor about global social media giant Meta has once again stirred up the already turbulent crypto payment market. According to CoinDesk, citing multiple sources, Meta plans to relaunch its stablecoin strategy in the second half of this year. Unlike the Libra (later renamed Diem) project that shocked the world six years ago, Meta has chosen a more pragmatic and covert path this time: instead of attempting to challenge global monetary sovereignty, it seeks to achieve a closed-loop payment system within its vast ecosystem of 3 billion users by integrating third-party stablecoin technologies. This is not a simple feature update, but a landmark event marking the entry of global Web3 payment infrastructure into a \"compliant integration period.\" This marks the starting point for exploring the magnificent path of RWA development in China. <h1 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">I. The Echoes of History: From Libra's \"Utopia\" to a \"Pragmatist\" Turnaround</span></h1><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">Back in 2019, Meta (then known as Facebook) released the Libra white paper, intending to build a global digital currency based on a basket of currencies. This radical attempt to challenge the boundaries of sovereign currencies was quickly met with a global crackdown by regulators. With members withdrawing, hearings being blocked, and Diem ultimately being sold in 2022, Meta's Web3 ambitions seemed to have entered a period of stagnation.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">However, technological evolution and regulatory logic have undergone profound changes in the past four years.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"> Meta's \"return\" comes against a completely different backdrop: A clearer regulatory framework: With the implementation of the EU's Crypto Asset Market Regulation Act (MiCA) and the advancement of US legislation on stablecoins, compliance is no longer a blind spot. A pioneering example from payment giants: PayPal's PYUSD, launched last year, has validated the feasibility of the \"social/payment giant + compliant stablecoin\" model. A shift in technological paradigm: From \"chain creation\" to \"integration,\" by leveraging existing, mature stablecoin infrastructure (such as Bridge acquired by Stripe), Meta can significantly reduce its regulatory burden. </span></p><h1 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">II.</span><span leaf=\"\">In-depth analysis: Stripe, Bridge, and the \"power puzzle\" behind them</span></h1><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">In the details disclosed this time, Stripe's presence is particularly crucial. Stripe's acquisition of stablecoin payment startup Bridge last year is considered one of the most important infrastructure integrations in the industry in recent years. Bridge's core capability lies in enabling enterprises to easily send, receive, and exchange stablecoins through APIs, which is precisely the \"last mile\" that Meta needs to complete its financial landscape.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">Even more interesting clues are hidden in the personnel arrangements. Stripe CEO Patrick Collison officially joined the Meta board of directors in April 2025. This overlap in top-level design indicates that the cooperation between Meta and Stripe is by no means an accidental business pilot, but a deep coupling based on strategic complementarity.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"> Meta provides traffic entry points and scenarios (Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram), while Stripe provides compliant clearing and stablecoin gateways. This combination of \"traffic + infrastructure\" will directly disrupt the traditional SWIFT system and the cross-border remittance market. The first half of this year's key words: III. Macro Perspective: \"Financial Equality\" or \"Walled Garden\" for 3 Billion Users? From a macro perspective, Meta's return to the stablecoin arena will have an impact far exceeding the crypto community itself. First, this represents the ultimate evolution from a social network to a value transfer network. In the Web2 era, Meta solved the problem of low-cost information flow; in the Web3 era, if stablecoin payments can be seamlessly embedded into WhatsApp chat windows or Instagram shopping interfaces, 3 billion users worldwide will instantly gain a near-real-time cross-border payment experience without the need for traditional bank accounts. For regions with underdeveloped financial infrastructure, such as Latin America and Southeast Asia, this is not only a payment tool but also a tool for achieving \"financial equality.\" Secondly, this indicates that \"stablecoins as the underlying payment method\" is a foregone conclusion. In the past, stablecoins were mostly seen as a medium for trading cryptocurrencies, but Meta's entry signifies that stablecoins are accelerating their return to their \"payment attributes.\" When mainstream payment companies (Stripe) and mainstream social networks (Meta) complete their integration, stablecoins will truly transform from a hedging tool in the secondary market into a settlement currency at the retail level. IV. Industry Implications and Outlook For blockchain practitioners and policymakers, Meta's actions send a clear signal: Compliance is the only pass: Meta abandoned its ambition to establish its own token issuance rights and instead sought cooperation with compliant third parties, indicating that under the existing regulatory framework, \"professional division of labor and compliant integration\" is the standard approach for major companies entering Web3. The explosion of stablecoins RWA (Real-World Assets): With the involvement of giants like Meta, the demand for stablecoins pegged to underlying US dollar assets will grow exponentially, which will in turn drive further prosperity in the RWA market. In summary, Meta's second attempt lacked the fervor of \"changing the world's monetary system\" and instead demonstrated a more pragmatic approach of \"deeply cultivating existing financial logic.\" In the second half of 2026, when Meta's digital wallet and stablecoin payments officially launch, we may find that the \"Internet of Value,\" once considered a distant vision, is entering households in a pragmatic way after experiencing several bubbles and baptisms.</span></p></div></div>",

These loans are not issued or traded on the public market. Unlike public bonds, these loans are negotiated bilaterally, recorded privately, and typically held by the originating fund until maturity. After 2008, as banks scaled back their operations under new regulatory restrictions (Basel III), the private lending asset class grew rapidly. Investment funds, private equity firms, and specialized financial companies flocked in, filling the lending gap. By 2020, the global private lending market had grown to approximately $2 trillion. By early 2025, the market had reached $3 trillion, and it is projected to reach $5 trillion by 2029 (Morgan Stanley, McKinsey). The traditional private lending market suffers from three core structural problems that make it an ideal target for tokenization. **Insufficient Liquidity:** Once a fund issues a loan, it typically holds it until maturity. There are currently no mature trading platforms for trading shares of private loans. Secondary market trading is customized, slow, and requires extensive due diligence from buyers. **Lack of Transparency:** Fragmented data means investors often lack a clear understanding of leverage ratios, collateral quality, or real-time performance. Reports are typically released quarterly, resulting in significant information asymmetry. Entry Threshold: The minimum investment is $5 million to $10 million, with a multi-year lock-up period and qualified investor requirements, effectively excluding everyone except the largest institutional investors. What is Tokenized Private Credit? Tokenized private credit is the process of converting private loans or debt instruments into blockchain-based digital tokens. These tokens represent claims to loan cash flows, ownership of fund units, or rights to interest and principal payments. In reality, the underlying loan or credit exposure remains off-chain, with the same legal structure and regulatory approach as traditional markets. However, ownership claims or rights to proceeds are represented on-chain in the form of tokens. These tokens can be issued, traded, and settled more efficiently using blockchain infrastructure. The working principle is as follows: Origin: The originating institution constructs private credit products (SME loans, structured credit, trade finance, home equity lines of credit, etc.). Legal Packaging: A legal entity (usually a special purpose entity) is created to hold the loan exposure. Tokenization: Digital tokens representing ownership or cash flow rights of the credit are minted. Subscription: Investors subscribe using fiat currency or stablecoins and receive tokens in return. Performance: The loan continues to be executed off-chain, but payments, investor reports, and ownership records are managed on-chain. <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Two Tokenization Models</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is a key distinction that most articles overlook.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Representative Tokenization: The blockchain serves solely as a transparent record system for off-chain lending. These tokens are non-transferable and non-tradable; the blockchain only provides operational upgrades (immutable ledger, real-time tracking). Figure primarily employs this model.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.com.cn/7436354_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Figure's Data</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Distributable Tokenization: Loans are natively issued and held on-chain as transferable tokens. Investors can hold, trade, and combine these tokens within the DeFi ecosystem. Platforms like Maple, Centrifuge, and Tradable are closer to this model.</p> According to research data from HTX_Global, of the approximately $19 billion in active on-chain private lending, only about 12% is held in a transferable, distributable tokenized form. The remainder is \"recorded but immovable.\" This is a crucial nuance in assessing the true state of the market. **Evolution Process** **Phase 0: Prehistory (2017-2019)** **2017: Centrifuge was founded as one of the first DeFi projects to integrate RWA. It initially focused on tokenizing invoices and accounts receivable through its Tinlake protocol (an open asset pool powered by smart contracts).** **2018: Figure was founded by Mike Cagney (former CEO of SoFi). The company focused on integrating blockchain into financial services, first launching Home Equity Credit (HELOC) based on blockchain infrastructure. Figure developed the Provenance Blockchain Foundation (a Layer 1 based on the Cosmos SDK) as its infrastructure.** 2019: Cadence (later renamed Percent) launched its first tokenized private debt product, attempting to reduce back-office costs by standardizing and reusing smart contract templates for structured products. Early challenges followed, such as higher-than-expected on-chain contract mirroring costs and insufficient demand for tokenized debt due to a lack of sufficient crypto-native investors to invest effectively. Phase 1: DeFi Integration and Early Development (2020-2021) 2020 (Centrifuge V1): Centrifuge proved that tokenized private credit could serve as collateral in DeFi, notably its integration with SkyEcosystem. Early 2021: Goldfinch launched, focusing on decentralized lending in emerging markets. This protocol enables cryptocurrency investors to provide loan funds to fintech institutions in developing countries (Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, Kenya). It employs a dual-pool model: retail funds enter a senior pool for stable returns (7-10% annualized), while community-elected junior supporters provide first-loss funding in exchange for higher returns. 2021: Maple launched as an institutional lending platform on Ethereum, using \"pool representatives\" for credit assessment. Initially serving institutional borrowers such as hedge funds, trading firms, and cryptocurrency market makers. TrueFi and Clearpool also entered the market. 2021: Figure began settling Home Equity Credits (HELOCs) on the Provenance Blockchain Foundation, reducing financing cycles from months to days and eliminating intermediaries. Mid-2021 to end of 2022: Active lending in the on-chain private lending market peaked at nearly $1.5 billion. Lending was primarily driven by cryptocurrency exchanges and market makers. Phase 2: Crypto Winter and Reset (2022) 2022: The crypto winter severely impacted on-chain private lending. Maple defaulted on $69.3 million in debt during institutional turmoil (the collapses of FTX/Alameda/3AC). Low-collateralized loans to crypto companies proved disastrous. Goldfinch experienced bad credit through its emerging market offerings. Total on-chain private lending value plummeted from its peak. Lending to crypto-native companies (trading desks, market makers) created a cyclical risk. The market began to shift towards real-world lending as a driver of recovery. Phase 3: Real-world Transformation and Institutional Investor Entry (2023-2024) 2023 (Centrifuge V2): Multi-chain expansion and institutional-grade fund structuring tools. New growth primarily came from real-world lending. 2023: Hamilton Lane tokenized its Senior Credit Opportunities (SCOPE) private credit fund on Ethereum and Polygon through Securitize, lowering the minimum investment from $5 million to $20,000. 2022 (Early): KKR launched its healthcare strategic growth fund on the Avalanche blockchain via Securitize. 2024: Hamilton Lane extended SCOPE to the Solana chain via the Libre platform. Mid-2024: Centrifuge had an outstanding loan balance of $289 million, primarily invested in consumer asset-backed securities (ABS), real estate bridge loans, and trade finance. Over 85% of loans issued through Centrifuge were financed via the Sky Protocol (formerly MakerDAO). 2024 (Centrifuge V3): Interoperability, Standardization, and Composability. Develop ERC-7540, an extension of ERC-4626, for standardizing asynchronous investing and redemption. End of 2024: BlackRock launches BUIDL (a tokenized money market fund), reaching $1.2 billion in assets under management within six months. Early 2024: The private lending tokenization space reaches approximately $8 billion, primarily driven by Figure, Centrifuge, Maple, Goldfinch, Clearpool, and Credix. Phase 4: Institutional Acceleration (2025) January 2025: Apollo launches the tokenized diversified credit fund (ACRED) across six blockchains via Securitize. By November 2025, its assets under management reached $170 million. In February 2025: Figure formed a joint venture with Sixth Street (Sixth Street committed $200 million in equity to Figure Connect for continued private lending liquidity). By mid-2025: Figure had tokenized over $13 billion in loans (primarily home equity lines of credit). It became the number one non-bank home equity line of credit lender in the U.S. It settled over $600 million in loans monthly on Provenance. September 2025: Figure listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol FIGR, raising $787.5 million in its IPO, valuing the company at $5.3 billion (later reaching $7.6 billion). October 2025: Total tokenized real-world assets (RWA) reached approximately $33 billion, with private lending accounting for $16-18 billion. As of November 2025: On-chain private lending exceeded $18.91 billion, with cumulative disbursements reaching $33.66 billion (RWA.xyz data). The value increased by 82% from the end of 2024, reaching $17.9 billion as of October 2025 (PwC data). Securitize issued nearly $4 billion in tokenized assets and is a tokenization partner of BlackRock, Apollo, Hamilton Lane, KKR, and VanEck. **Phase 5: Status Quo (Early 2026)** February 2026: Figure Technologies currently leads the market with approximately $15 billion in active loans, representing 75% of the total active loan volume of approximately $20 billion (RWA.xyz data). The total value of tokenized assets on the Provenance platform reached $1.2 billion in TVL. Hamilton Lane and Securitize launched an RWA-backed stablecoin on OKX's X Layer platform. This stablecoin is backed by tokenized exposure from Hamilton Lane's SCOPE fund and employs a dual-token architecture to separate yields from the stablecoin itself. The tokenized private lending market continues to expand into the DeFi composability space: Apollo's ACRED fund is being used in leveraged cycles on platforms like Morpho and Kamino, demonstrating that on-chain assets can be combined in ways that are impossible in traditional finance. Industry expectations for 2026 include major institutions \"transitioning from pilot phases to large-scale, production-ready products,\" and the potential for on-chain lending to receive ratings from traditional rating agencies. How Tokenized Private Lending Works** **Token Standards and Structure** **Loan-Specific Tokens:** Each loan is tokenized into one or more ERC-20 tokens, representing a claim to the cash flow of that asset. For example, real estate lenders issue tokens that entitle holders to mortgage repayments. These tokens typically constitute securities and must be issued under exemptions (Reg D for accredited investors, and Reg A+ for broader but restricted retail investors).** **Loan Pool Model:** Lenders contribute to a public pool of funds, which then distributes loans to borrowers on their behalf. Loans are represented on-chain as debt securities (non-tradable tokens) linked to NFTs, while lenders receive ERC-20 tokens representing their share of the pool. Smart contract enforcement clauses mean that if a borrower fails to repay the loan, the loan defaults, triggering pre-defined remedies. Fund tokenization: The fund structure itself is tokenized (e.g., Hamilton Lane's SCOPE). Investors hold tokens representing fund units, rather than direct claims on individual loans. This is currently the mainstream institutional model. Key Standards: ERC-20: Standard fungible token for loan pool shares and fund tokens. ERC-721 (NFT): For individual loan representations in certain protocols. ERC-4626: Standard for tokenized vaults for yield positions. ERC-7540: An extension of ERC-4626 for asynchronous investing and redemption, a leading DeFi RWA standard developed by Centrifuge. Tiered Structure: Advanced/Junior Tiered Structure (Centrifuge's DROP/TIN model) allows for risk-return differentiation. Lifecycle Management. Smart Contract Processing: Loan Issuance and Interest Accumulation; Token Holder Collection and Distribution; Redemption and Principal Return; Compliance Checks (Whitelist, KYC/AML, Jurisdiction Restrictions); Default Trigger Mechanism and Waterfall Repayment Mechanism; Transparency Issues. This section of the article applies the RWA Transparency Framework, which distinguishes between the actual allocated content and the content merely presented on-chain. What does Figure's dominance really mean? Figure accounts for approximately 75% of tokenized private lending. However, Provenance is a specially constructed chain whose smart contracts require governance approval. As Glider co-founder Brian Huang points out: \"Unless the asset is composable, on-chain assets are no more useful than off-chain assets. Provenance is not composable.\" This means that, in dollar terms, the vast majority of tokenized private lending is essentially an operational upgrade, rather than a distributable, DeFi-composable asset. These loans are not tradable tokens that investors can freely transfer, combine, or use across ecosystems. This is crucial for transparency analysis. The 12% Problem: According to HTX research, only about 12% of on-chain private credit is held in a transferable tokenized form. The rest, while documented, cannot be distributed. While some say tokenized private credit is worth $20 billion, a more accurate figure for truly distributable, composable tokenized credit should be between $2 billion and $3 billion. On-Chain Verifiable Content: Fully verifiable: Token ownership, transfer history, fund share balance, smart contract terms, compliance status (whitelist), and payment and distribution. Partially verifiable: Total outstanding loan value (depending on oracle/report accuracy), collateral ratio (for overcollateralized models). On-chain verifiability includes: borrower creditworthiness, actual loan performance (still relying on off-chain reports), collateral quality of off-chain assets, true default rate, and recovery rate. Underlying credit risk assessment, underwriting, and counterparty evaluation remain entirely off-chain. Blockchain provides transparency at the token layer, but not necessarily at the asset layer.</div></div>",

Few people discussed AI and energy together. I remembered Altman's investment in OKLO, but I didn't understand it. Around the same time, I was discussing a far-fetched question with AI: If electricity could be transported and traded as freely as oil, could China leverage its electricity cost advantage to establish a pricing system similar to the petrodollar? This idea stemmed from a simple observation—China's electricity costs are indeed cheap globally. China has the world's largest installed capacity of wind and solar power, and while coal-fired power is not environmentally friendly, it is stable. If electricity could be directly exported, theoretically, this would be a huge comparative advantage. But the discussion quickly stalled. Two Impossible Paths There are two intuitively feasible paths for electricity export, which we have analyzed one by one. The first is direct grid connection. Laying transnational transmission lines to sell electricity directly to neighboring countries and even further afield. The problem is obvious: the construction cost of ultra-high-voltage transmission lines is staggering, each country along the route is a negotiation node, and geopolitical risks make this path almost impossible to scale up. China to Southeast Asia might still have some possibility, but covering the entire globe like oil pipelines is unrealistic. The second route is battery export. Storing electricity in batteries and shipping it out is like canning food. This route is hampered by the laws of physics—batteries have a ceiling on energy density, and the self-discharge losses, temperature control costs, and logistics weight during long-distance transportation can make it more expensive than generating electricity locally. Not to mention the production cost of the batteries themselves, where the price fluctuations of minerals like lithium and cobalt are far greater than the cost of electricity. We've also discussed indirect routes: exporting electricity through energy-intensive products, such as electrolytic aluminum and industrial silicon. However, the cost structure of these products is too complex; electricity is only one component, with layers of mining, processing, and transportation added on top. Unlike oil, where a barrel of oil is simply a barrel of oil with a clear price. At this point in the discussion, my conclusion is: Before a qualitative leap occurs in energy storage and power transmission technologies, electricity will be difficult to become a commodity that can be directly exported. This conclusion seemed reasonable at the time. </span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"cEdTuWfl3UWjMVweY4rn42WG5kfrfcnJD8XWf0H7.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.com.cn/7436347_image3.png\" title=\"7436347\"/></p><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><span leaf=\"\">Comparison of three paths for electricity export</span></figcaption><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">Altman probably figured it out earlier than everyone else</span></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">Then the AI ​​era arrived.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">Not at the moment ChatGPT was released—back then, the discussion was still about \"whether AI can replace programmers.\"</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">Not at the moment ChatGPT was released—back then, the discussion was still about \"whether AI can replace programmers.\"</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"> It wasn't until 2024-2025, when large-scale models began to be commercially available on a large scale and token pricing became a business, that I suddenly realized something. Tokens are essentially the unit of electricity. This isn't a metaphor. If you open the pricing page of any AI API, the core costs of a token, broken down, are computing power and electricity. Computing power is the depreciation and amortization of GPUs, and electricity is the operating cost of data centers. Other costs—such as manual annotation and the amortization of model training R&amp;D—are actually a small percentage of each token. When a user sends a request to DeepSeek or MiniMax, they are essentially purchasing the electricity consumed in a data center in China at that instant. Looking back at Altman's investment in OKLO, the logic becomes clear. He wasn't making energy diversification investments; he was securing electricity supply for OpenAI's future. He foresaw the endgame early on: in the end, AI companies' competition will lead to convergent model architectures, talent mobility, and the only irreplaceable resource will be electricity. Google's TPU is the other side of the same logic. The GPU arms race is essentially a talent competition—when Nvidia engineers are poached, new chip companies emerge. But electricity isn't a talent issue; it's a resource issue, and it won't shift due to the movement of people. A New Way to Exit Electricity is indeed difficult to export directly. But tokens can. A US user calls DeepSeek's API; data travels from California, through a Pacific undersea fiber optic cable to a data center in China, where the GPU consumes power to complete inference, and the results are then transmitted back. Throughout the entire process, the electricity never leaves China's power grid, but its value is delivered across borders through tokens. There is no transmission line loss, no battery self-discharge, and no geopolitical negotiations. The signal loss from fiber optic transmission is negligible compared to grid transmission. Electricity has finally found its export form—not joules, but tokens. MiniMax and Zhipu can offer competitive token prices in the global market, partly because they are undervalued, due to China's electricity costs. Of course, it's not just electricity; the efficiency of the model architecture (such as MoE) and the optimization capabilities of the engineering team are also important. But if these \"soft\" factors are aligned, electricity cost becomes the hard, unreplicable differentiator. This differs from my previous refutation of the \"electricity export of electrolytic aluminum.\" In the cost structure of electrolytic aluminum, electricity may account for 30%-40%, with the remainder being ore and processing. However, in the cost structure of tokens, electricity plus computing power may account for over 70%, and the computing power itself also depends on electricity. Tokens are, to date, the purest electricity derivative. </span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"kMR6aOYxHyLWlmeCDWevcM0IadAIJwRfD1hCKFMZ.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.com.cn/7436348_image3.png\" title=\"7436348\"/></p><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><span leaf=\"\">Token Purity Comparison: Electrolytic Aluminum vs. Battery vs. Token</span></figcaption><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">Opportunities and Risks in the Time Difference</span></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">But the current situation is not an equilibrium state.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">AI's demand for electricity is growing far faster than the construction speed of power infrastructure.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">The current situation is not an equilibrium state.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">AI's demand for electricity is growing much faster than the construction speed of power infrastructure.</span></p> The electricity required to train a cutting-edge large-scale model is increasing annually, while a new power plant typically takes 3-5 years from project initiation to grid connection. This time mismatch is the root cause of the current surge in energy prices. It's not that there isn't enough electricity—China's installed power generation capacity has been increasing year after year. Nor is it that the technology is inadequate—the cost per kilowatt-hour for solar and wind power is already lower than that for coal-fired power. The problem is that the demand for AI is growing too fast, so fast that the existing power allocation system cannot keep up. It's like a highway designed for 100,000 vehicles per day, but suddenly 500,000 vehicles flood in every day; it's not that the road isn't wide enough, it's that there's no time to expand it. This time lag creates short-term opportunities: whoever currently has sufficient electricity supply has a pricing advantage in the AI ​​token market. Regions like China, the Middle East, and Northern Europe, with their low electricity costs or abundant supply, are naturally suited to become the \"world's factory\" for AI inference. However, the other side of the time difference is risk. <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"u6AZEfDhUWZXhaM378zupxrU6ct5KwsahP15HvY0.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.com.cn/7436349_image3.png\" title=\"7436349\"/></p><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><span leaf=\"\">AI Power Supply and Demand Time Mismatch</span></figcaption><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">If, in 3-5 years, the power capacity built for AI comes online in a concentrated manner, while AI inference efficiency improves significantly due to advancements in model compression and quantization technologies (resulting in a continuous decrease in the power consumed per token), then a classic supply and demand reversal will occur—a sudden surplus of power prepared for AI.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">This is not just my wishful thinking.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">This is not just wishful thinking.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">This is not just my ... wishful thinking.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">This is not just wishful thinking.</span> Similar cycles have occurred repeatedly throughout history. The entrance to Jevons' paradox is possible, though things may not evolve so linearly. In 1865, British economist Jevons discovered a counterintuitive phenomenon: the increased efficiency of steam engines did not reduce coal consumption; on the contrary, the lower operating costs spurred more coal use, leading to an increase in total consumption. This is Jevons' paradox. Once the cost of AI reasoning decreases, it may well enter the same cycle. When a token is cheap enough, people will start using AI for things that currently seem \"unworthy\": automatically generated personalized educational content, 24/7 private health advisors, AI customer service for every product, and real-time translation accessible to everyone. The expansion of consumption scenarios may once again outpace supply growth, leading to an increase in electricity demand instead of a decrease. This leads us into a larger-scale spiral: electricity capacity expansion → decreased inference costs → explosion of new consumption scenarios → renewed surge in electricity demand → a new round of capacity expansion. In each spiral, the role of tokens as a unit for monetizing electricity is strengthened. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"YEdTuskFRE8z1lsyFgwFpQJXMnTwan0hx9e2B2mR.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.com.cn/7436350_image3.png\" title=\"7436350\"/></p><figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><span leaf=\"\">Jevens' Paradox: The Spiral Cycle</span></figcaption><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">I'm not sure how many times this spiral will turn, nor am I sure at which point the inflection point of true oversupply will occur.

            "title": "A Chinese man mining Bitcoin received his enlistment notice in Russia.",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div>On February 23, 2025, the Chinese Consulate in Russia once again reminded Chinese citizens in Russia to pay attention to Presidential Decree No. 821 issued by Putin. This decree presents Chinese miners in Russia with a very real \"either-or\" choice: either give up their residency status or enlist in the military. To legally stay and earn rubles, they may first have to go through a conflict zone. The decree is clear: foreign men aged 18 to 65 who wish to apply for a long-term residency permit in Russia must agree to serve in a Russian military unit for at least one year. Once, miners went to Siberia for cheap electricity, but now, before their mining equipment has even recouped its costs, they might be treated as \"expendable resources.\" Now, those gold miners, with their millions of dollars worth of computing power, will they be able to escape unscathed? I. The Vicious Cycle of Compliance: To Be Legal, First Join the Army. Many miners who went to Russia felt they were just passing through, making money across borders, and that the frontline battles had nothing to do with them. But since last year, a network specifically targeting foreign miners has been quietly laid. The first step, \"luring the snake out of its hole.\" Russia officially legalized cryptocurrency mining in 2024, which briefly became a paradise for miners. However, the prerequisite was that individuals or businesses with high electricity consumption must join the official \"miner register,\" fully disclosing their wallet addresses and income. Failure to report would result in hefty fines and equipment confiscation. This tactic forced all miners who wanted to earn a stable income legally to voluntarily hand over their names and details. Once the details were disclosed, the next step followed naturally. The second step, \"identity locking.\" As a foreigner, if you want to legally register for large-scale mining, you must have a Russian long-term residence permit or a registered address within Russia. This is precisely the most dangerous move in the entire scheme. The third step, \"hitting the snake's vital spot,\" came in 2025 when Russian Presidential Decree No. 821 took effect, completely changing the rules for applying for long-term residence permits. You must either submit a Russian military service contract or proof that you are unfit for military service. This move directly impacted a large number of foreign male miners working in Russia—their original hope of obtaining long-term residency by registering as sole proprietors or companies is now blocked. The closed loop is now locked. If you want to mine legally, you need to register with your real name; if you want to register, you need to get a residence permit; if you want a residence permit, you need to be ready to go to the front lines at any time. First, they lure you in with the bait of legality, then they force you to comply with the law with severe penalties, and finally, they use a residence permit to precisely turn you into a potential recruit. You think you're mining Bitcoin with a machine, but in the eyes of the machine in wartime, you are just the \"mine\". II. The Countdown to Nominee Ownership and \"Visa Abduction\" Since obtaining long-term residency is risky, is it feasible to \"play guerrilla warfare\" in the gray area using business visas? The answer is no; this path is being completely blocked. In the past, many miners exploited loopholes by \"leaving the country once every 90 days,\" and even had locals hold mining licenses on their behalf. However, starting in 2025, Russia has taken several drastic measures, targeting individuals, behaviors, and assets one by one. First, immigration controls have been tightened on individuals. The \"Register of Controlled Persons,\" which came into effect in Russia in February 2025, is extremely precise. If a visa issue arises, bank accounts are instantly controlled, with even daily spending subject to very low limits. More importantly, police can detain individuals and initiate deportation proceedings within 48 hours without court approval. Using a business visa to mine is essentially illegal work, and one could easily become the next person to be removed from the program. Furthermore, the legal definition of the act has changed. According to the draft amendment to the Criminal Code in December 2025, illegal mining carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and hefty fines. Previously, it was at most considered a violation; now it's a criminal offense. The gray area's space for survival is being eroded inch by inch by the law. Next comes the targeting of assets. In February 2026, Putin further signed a new law, giving courts the power to directly confiscate mining equipment and Bitcoin involved in cases. Nasdaq-listed The9 once stated that Russia might \"nationalize and confiscate the assets of foreign companies under certain circumstances.\" In Russia, it doesn't matter whose name the machine is registered under; if it's suspected of being illegal, it will be confiscated. Besides, you can't hide it anyway. Since the end of 2024, the Russian power grid has established an integrated air-ground detection network. In the air, thermal imaging drones precisely locate targets; on the ground, AI meters monitor electricity in real time; and at the terminals, intelligent algorithms proactively identify threats. In Dagestan alone, from January to November 2025, 73 cases of illegal electricity mining were uncovered, resulting in losses of 85.7 million rubles. The four avenues—people, actions, assets, and hiding places—have all been blocked. The window for discreetly mining by exploiting visa loopholes is closing. <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Third, the state apparatus only wants energy, not computing power</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Even if one manages to secure residency and weather the risks of nominee shareholding, there simply isn't enough electricity to mine in Russia.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">After China shut down mining in 2021, Siberia, Russia, with its naturally low temperatures and cheap electricity, became a haven for miners worldwide.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">BitRiver, Russia's largest mining company, started there, at its peak managing 175,000 mining rigs.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In those years, as long as you had electricity and the guts, money followed.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But the power grid couldn't hold up.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> By the end of 2024, cryptocurrency mining had consumed 1.5% of Russia's total electricity, pushing power grids in many areas to the brink of overload. Aging infrastructure needed maintenance, and heating for residents couldn't be interrupted. In Russia's non-natural gas-powered regions, electric heating was the most affordable way to keep warm in winter. Therefore, these \"electricity hogs\" naturally became the first targets. Starting in 2025, a series of bans were implemented. Several regions in the North Caucasus and Siberia experienced complete power outages or seasonal power rationing, even BitRiver couldn't withstand it. However, what ultimately crushed it wasn't the price of Bitcoin, but the combined blows of legal debt collection, account freezes, and regional power rationing. As for foreign miners without local connections, under the triple strangulation of \"identity thresholds (military service contracts + controlled personnel registration) + energy regulations + asset confiscation,\" they will be the first to be sacrificed. The window of opportunity for rampant growth based on cheap electricity and audacity has closed. Faced with rigid policies, computing power is merely code that can be disconnected at any time. When they withdrew from China in 2021, everyone was betting on the same thing: with the emperor far away, electricity would be enough to survive. Four years later, reality has provided a different answer. You can outrun the regulations of one country, but not the conscription order of another. In the story of the global miners' migration, Russia's chapter is drawing to a close. Those who haven't yet evacuated, and their machinery, have little time left.</p></div></div>",

            "title": "Did Marx already predict the future of AI?",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div>When discussing AI, most people are still preoccupied with whether their jobs will be taken away. However, Deutsche Bank believes this perspective might be too narrow. According to a recent report by George Saravelos, Global Head of FX Research at Deutsche Bank, published on the TrendFocus Trading Platform, two extreme endgame scenarios for AI development are proposed: The first scenario is \"complete replacement.\" Similar to Marx's prediction over 180 years ago and Musk's vision today: in the factors of production in economics, \"capital\" itself becomes \"labor power\" itself, the value of labor becomes zero, and capitalism becomes obsolete. AI will massively replace human jobs, wealth and income will be highly concentrated in the hands of a few capital owners, the income and needs of ordinary people will be weakened, and the economy will fall into a predicament of \"plenty of things, but no one can afford them.\" Did Marx predict artificial intelligence? About 200 years ago, he wrote a book about \"machines,\" envisioning a scenario of full automation. In this world, the problem of scarcity is solved. However, as the value of labor falls to zero, capitalism becomes obsolete, and we transition to a completely new world of immense material abundance. The endpoint envisioned by Marx is strikingly similar to Elon Musk's vision today. The second outcome is a \"history repeating itself.\" AI, like previous technological revolutions, increases efficiency but doesn't completely replace human labor; it merely \"empowers\" humanity. New jobs constantly emerge, and the policy system can still patch up the shocks. In this scenario, the economic logic is similar to that of the past few decades, with inflation, interest rates, and the stock market more likely to rise moderately. Will we ultimately head towards an abyss, a paradise, or simply experience a normal industrial upgrade? This Deutsche Bank report offers a completely new perspective. When \"capital becomes labor,\" why might traditional economics fail? To understand the ultimate destructive power of AI on the economy, we must return to the starting point of modern economics. From Adam Smith onward, all classical economists have based their work on a fundamental assumption: capital and labor are two completely independent factors of production. The prices (interest rates and wages) of both capital and labor are determined by their relative scarcity in the market. Looking back over the past two centuries, all previous waves of technological innovation have largely conformed to this model. By analogy, the invention of the steam engine eliminated coachmen but created train drivers; the internet destroyed traditional print media but created countless programmers and delivery drivers. Throughout these historical cycles, labor always had something to do. Machines were capital, but operating, maintaining, and designing machines was still labor. Capital was merely a \"supplement\" to labor. However, fully automated robots possessing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) completely shatter this classification. \"In this situation, capital becomes labor. It is no longer a supplement to labor, but a substitute,\" George Saravelos pointed out incisively in the report. When an AI machine can think, produce, and iterate completely autonomously, this machine is both capital and labor. The fundamental structure of modern economics breaks down at this moment. The report states bluntly: \"When capital equals labor, the value of work drops to zero, and wages also drop to zero. Economists call this an unacceptable equilibrium. Scientists call it a singularity. Classical economic theory collapses. Consequently, capitalism as a system also becomes obsolete.\" When the law of \"supply creates demand\" fails, growth may face \"long-term stagnation.\" Once labor is massively replaced, what kind of changes will occur in the gears of the macroeconomy? Deutsche Bank introduces a deeper theoretical deduction. In a world where AI replaces workers, wages decline, but material abundance increases unprecedentedly. Machines tirelessly produce massive quantities of goods and services for the market. According to classical economists like Say, Walras, and Wicksell, \"supply automatically creates its own demand.\" In their theoretical models, the market possesses self-correcting capabilities. Goods prices decrease as production costs fall, allowing workers to ultimately buy more with less money or find work in new fields. However, Deutsche Bank warns that in a world of fully automated AI, this self-correcting mechanism will completely fail. The logic is straightforward: automation will concentrate wealth and income extremely in the hands of a narrow class of \"capital owners.\" And according to economic principles, the \"marginal propensity to consume\" of the wealthy (capital owners) is far lower than that of ordinary workers. To illustrate: an AI factory could produce 10,000 cars a day at extremely low cost. However, all profits would go to the AI ​​owner. This owner couldn't possibly buy all 10,000 cars; and many ordinary people who lost their jobs and had zero income couldn't afford them even at the lowest prices. \"The supply-demand chain has broken,\" Saravelos writes. This completely cleared market equilibrium would manifest as structurally low labor income, deflationary price levels, and massive amounts of \"excess savings\" replacing strong demand for goods. Deutsche Bank points out that this is precisely the scenario of \"secular stagnation\" proposed by economists Eggertsson and Mehrotra, and in extreme cases, could trigger a Marxist-style revolution. \"Keynesianism can save the day, but it may not be enough,\" the key lies in the speed of government and institutional response. Faced with market failures, can Keynesianism, another major pillar of modern economics, turn the tide? Keynesianism's revolutionary nature lies in acknowledging the failure of classical theory. Within the Keynesian framework, economic imbalances are not permanent but cyclical. When price adjustments are slow and workforce retraining lags behind, strong government intervention is necessary. In the AI ​​era, this intervention might manifest as levying a high \"AI tax\" on AI companies, using this as a funding pool to distribute \"stimulus checks\" or universal basic income (UBI) to the entire population. Through this strong fiscal transfer, the economy will eventually reach a new equilibrium. However, this logic faces significant practical constraints. The report cites extensive research on the history of technology deployment by renowned economists Acemoglu and Johnson. History has shown that policy and institutional adjustments are often extremely slow. For example, in the early stages of the British Industrial Revolution, the lack of corresponding institutional protections suppressed workers' real wages for decades. To prevent a decline in living standards, Deutsche Bank has listed the necessary institutional reforms: \"a stronger labor bargaining body, competition policies that limit the monopolies of dominant firms, tax and subsidy structures that do not artificially favor capital at the expense of labor, public investment in skills and technologies for creating tasks, and expanding and even reforming corporate governance.\" If the pace of technological change outpaces the adaptation of governments and institutions, Keynesian remedies will not be effective in time. From Marx to Musk: The End of Property Rights and Scarcity<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Even with a highly proactive and responsive government, deeper political and economic challenges remain.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The report raises a philosophically significant phenomenon: Karl Marx's vision of \"machines\" and full automation nearly 200 years ago bears a striking resemblance to Elon Musk's ultimate vision for AI today.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In this endgame of full automation, humanity solves the age-old problem of \"scarcity.\"</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But this is accompanied by the disintegration of fundamental social consensus.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> \"In this fully automated scenario, the very essence of capitalism collapses. Political questions no longer revolve around how to subsidize wages. They become more fundamental to social structures: if scarcity is resolved, what is the meaning of property rights?\" As Keynes famously asked in his 1930 essay, \"The Possible Economic Prospects for Our Descendants\": When humans no longer need to labor for survival, what is the meaning of human existence? While these topics seem grand, Deutsche Bank emphasizes that, given the existential nature of these questions, they are absolutely relevant to current financial market pricing. Deutsche Bank's Two End-Game Deductions and Pricing Logics For the market, it is essential to consider both the \"transition period to the end game\" and the \"end game itself.\" Deutsche Bank divides the future world into two extreme parallel universes and provides a clear asset pricing logic. Endgame 1: AI Completely Replaces Labor (Towards Extreme Disruption) This is a world where AI can quickly and (almost) completely replace human labor. From a living standards perspective, this is a euphoric world where the problem of economic scarcity is permanently solved. But Deutsche Bank warns that the road to it will be \"the most disruptive and uncertain.\" Macroeconomic Characteristics: Rising unemployment, continued pressure on government intervention, and escalating social conflict. An endless game will unfold between capital owners and labor over resource allocation. Market Pricing Logic: The macroeconomy will face extremely strong deflationary pressures, and real interest rates will structurally and continuously decline. Due to the extreme efficiency of AI, corporate profitability will soar. Stock and Foreign Exchange Performance: Despite soaring profits, the stock market will be mired in prolonged uncertainty and volatility. The logic is that the risk of corporate confiscation (such as extremely high taxes or nationalization) will increase significantly, and the distribution of profits among different stakeholders will remain unresolved. In the foreign exchange market, Deutsche Bank explicitly points out: \"The currencies of countries that can most successfully manage this smooth transition are most likely to reap the greatest benefits.\" Endgame Two: AI is merely an enabling technology (history repeating itself) In this world, AI does not trigger a singularity, but rather, like all innovations of the 20th century, it is merely an augmentation technology. Macroeconomic Characteristics: This is a coherent world. The limitations of technology adoption, gradual institutional evolution, and Keynesian countercyclical fiscal policies will be effective. Despite persistent distributional conflicts and labor market pains, new jobs will always be found. Market pricing logic: In stark contrast to the first endgame, macroeconomic indicators here will point upwards. Stock and currency market performance: Inflation levels, real interest rates, and the stock market are all more likely to move higher. Deutsche Bank concludes: \"History will rhyme, not break, as it has for the past few decades.\" What should we look at now? Deutsche Bank points out that the purpose of this report is not to provide an absolute prediction, but to establish an analytical framework. In this extremely broad range of results, the debate about the macroeconomic impact of AI will certainly not cease in the short term. From an investor's perspective, how should we observe the progress of the AI ​​economy's evolution? Deutsche Bank has identified clear \"observation indicators\": Qualitative changes in labor market data: Are we beginning to observe a rise in structural unemployment? Has the already declining share of labor compensation entered a trajectory of accelerated downward spiral? Shifts in fiscal and antitrust policies: How willing is the government to adopt proactive fiscal and institutional policies? Has it begun to strongly implement income redistribution? Has it taken substantial antitrust preventative measures against monopolistic capital conglomerates (tech giants)?</p></div></div>",
