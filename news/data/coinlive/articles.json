In the following sections, we will delve into Ondo's business model, product architecture, and strategic positioning to understand how this project is shaping the future of on-chain financial infrastructure.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Key Takeaways</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>1. Ecosystem Expansion Prioritizes Profitability</strong> Ondo's primary goal is ecosystem growth, not immediate profitability.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>2. Assets Under Management and Coverage are Strategic Priorities</strong> The project's core strategy emphasizes the expansion of assets under management (AUM) and ecosystem penetration, rather than short-term profitability.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>2. Assets Under Management and Coverage are Strategic Focuses</strong> The project's core strategy emphasizes the expansion of assets under management (AUM) and ecosystem penetration, rather than short-term profitability. Ondo's goal is to establish dominance in the on-chain risk-weighted asset (RWA) market by expanding product coverage and increasing liquidity depth, rather than optimizing current yields. 3. A Clear Long-Term RWA Roadmap Ondo follows a structured, phased roadmap for RWA product evolution, gradually transitioning from highly liquid assets (stablecoins) to highly utility assets (sovereign bonds, stocks, ETFs). This reflects its full-stack infrastructure vision, evolving from stablecoins to tokenized government bonds, and ultimately to tokenized securities. It's worth noting that Ondo's model focuses on primary market issuance rather than secondary market trading. 4. Distribution Channels Remain a Structural Weakness Despite product maturity, USDY's liquidity and trading volume remain limited, indicating low retail participation and an unclear target customer base. This highlights that distribution and channel development are Ondo's most pressing bottlenecks. 5. Token Unlocking Risk: A large-scale token unlocking event expected in early 2026 could bring selling pressure. Lacking sustainable cash flow, Ondo may become increasingly reliant on token sales to sustain operations. 6. Macroeconomic Yields: The ongoing global interest rate cut cycle is compressing risk-weighted asset yields, putting pressure on government-backed stablecoins. In the short to medium term, Ondo must leverage its Global Markets (GM) products to maintain growth momentum and offset declining fixed-income returns. Ondo's Business Lines, Model, and Revenue: Ondo operates multiple product lines, each targeting different tiers of the RWA value chain, evolving from highly liquid, low-risk assets to complex tokenized securities and financial infrastructure products. The roadmap follows a clear logic of expansion from \"liquidity to utility,\" proceeding sequentially from stablecoins → tokenized government bonds → tokenized stocks/ETFs → multi-chain settlement infrastructure. The company views stablecoins as a proof-of-concept for the availability of on-chain assets, demonstrating that blockchain-based settlements can operate at scale. However, more complex financial instruments, such as government bonds, ETFs, and stocks, are expected to deliver more significant efficiency gains and improved user experience. Within this framework, stablecoins serve as an entry point for liquidity bootstrapping and user registration, while tokenized government bonds act as a bridge to fully on-chain securities. The next phase of development focuses on the tokenization of highly liquid stocks, directly connecting traditional market makers and brokers to the blockchain network. By enabling 24/7 issuance/redemption operations and 24/7 secondary market trading, Ondo aims to make stocks and ETFs composable components of the DeFi ecosystem, thereby significantly expanding the asset range and extending the trading hours of on-chain finance. To truly realize the usability of these securities, complementary financial protocols, such as lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, and collateral frameworks, must be developed in parallel. Ondo's lending platform, Flux Finance, has demonstrated that tokenized securities can serve as collateral in DeFi, enabling recyclable liquidity. As one of the pioneers in the RWA field, Ondo's multi-tiered product evolution model provides a representative blueprint for how real-world asset projects can expand across product verticals. Through this framework, investors can better understand Ondo's operating model, growth trajectory, and strategic differentiation advantages, thus gaining a replicable perspective to analyze the broader RWA market landscape. USDY – A Yield Stablecoin USDY is a yield stablecoin backed by bank deposits and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds. While its primary issuance is limited to KYC-verified investors, secondary market trading is permissionless, ensuring its widespread adoption in the DeFi space. Ondo generates revenue through the yield of its underlying assets, distributing the majority of the yield to holders while retaining a small interest rate spread and charging a 20 basis point redemption fee as its primary source of income. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\"

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Liza Savenko, Source: Cointelegraph, Translated by: Shaw &amp; Jinse Finance</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Key Takeaways:</h2><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A sharp drop in Bitcoin often triggers systemic contagion, dragging down the prices of other cryptocurrencies through liquidity and confidence channels.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">During crises, markets tend to view cryptocurrencies as single risk assets rather than focusing on their individual utility, as demonstrated by the high correlation between BTC-ETH and BTC-XRP.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Correlation and Beta coefficient analysis is crucial for quantifying the dependence of Ethereum and XRP on Bitcoin's performance.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Monitoring correlation metrics, using derivatives, and holding stable or yield-generating assets can help hedge against shocks related to Bitcoin.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Monitoring correlation metrics, using derivatives, and holding stable or yield-generating assets can help hedge against shocks related to Bitcoin.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Bitcoin's dominance in the cryptocurrency market has always been a defining characteristic of cryptocurrency cycles. But what happens if Bitcoin's dominance weakens or its price plummets by 50%? In this scenario, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization—Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP)—will become key cases for examining how the market restructures. This article will explain how to assess Ethereum and XRP when Bitcoin is impacted, including measuring their dependence, assessing risks, and developing effective hedging strategies. Why Bitcoin's Dominance Matters So Much In traditional stock markets, when an industry giant suffers a setback, the chain reaction is immediate. Smaller companies often depreciate as a result because they rely on the ecosystem, investor confidence, supply chain connections, and reputation of the industry leader. The same principle applies to the cryptocurrency market: Bitcoin acts as an \"anchor asset.\" When Bitcoin's price falls, the entire market loses stability and direction. Historically, Bitcoin has accounted for a large share of the cryptocurrency market capitalization, a phenomenon known as the \"dominance\" metric. Most altcoins, including Ethereum and XRP, exhibit strong correlations with Bitcoin's price movements. For example, following the tariff announcement on October 10, 2025, the cryptocurrency market experienced a massive liquidation event, with Bitcoin's price plummeting. According to CoinMetrics data, over the next eight days, the correlation between BTC and ETH rose from 0.69 to 0.73, while the correlation between BTC and XRP also increased from 0.75 to 0.77. This significant convergence suggests that altcoins do not decouple due to their individual utility during liquidity crises triggered by macroeconomic panics. Metrics such as Ethereum's trading volume or XRP's institutional adoption offer little protection in such situations. Instead, a high positive correlation can serve as an empirical indicator of the sharing of systemic risk. This indicates that the market views the entire cryptocurrency industry as a single asset class. This amplifies the subsequent impact of a Bitcoin price crash on Ethereum and XRP. This means that if Bitcoin's market share declines or its price crashes, Ethereum and XRP are unlikely to fluctuate independently. They are likely to be affected by two factors: Liquidity/Structural Channels Market structures related to Bitcoin, including derivatives, trading flows, and investor behavior, are weakening. A significant Bitcoin crash can trigger massive liquidations, with margin calls and chain sell-offs being the primary causes. This typically leads to a massive outflow of funds, impacting all crypto assets regardless of their fundamentals. The reason for their decline is simple: they share the same risk basket. The collapse of decentralized assets shakes the core principles of the entire cryptocurrency industry, eroding investor confidence in the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies. As panic spreads, investors often turn to safer assets like fiat currencies or gold. The result is a prolonged bear market, further reducing investor enthusiasm for Ethereum and XRP. How to Measure Dependence on Bitcoin and Risk Step 1: Define the Impact Scenario The analysis begins by selecting a potentially high-impact Bitcoin event. This might include defining a specific price shock, such as Bitcoin falling 50% in 30 days, or a structural shift, such as Bitcoin's market share dropping from 60% to 40%. Step 2: Quantifying Dependency The next step is to calculate the current Pearson correlation coefficient between Ethereum, XRP, and Bitcoin. This statistic reflects the linear relationship between the daily returns of these assets, providing a benchmark for measuring their dependence. The closer the correlation coefficient is to +1, the stronger the correlation between the altcoin's performance and Bitcoin's. Step 3: Estimate Immediate Price Response Using correlation data, regression analysis is applied to calculate the Beta coefficient of each altcoin relative to Bitcoin. The Beta coefficient estimates the expected price change of the altcoin for every unit change in Bitcoin. This is similar to calculating the Beta coefficient of stocks relative to benchmark indices such as the S&amp;P 500 in traditional finance. For example, if Ethereum's Beta coefficient against Bitcoin is 1.1, and the defined scenario assumes Bitcoin drops by 50%, then the implied change in Ethereum would be -55% (1.1 × -50%). Step 4: Adjusting for Liquidity and Structural Risks The adjustment strategy needs to go beyond simple Beta coefficient calculations and incorporate key market structural risks. Order books from exchanges with lower trading volumes should be analyzed to assess liquidity risk. The structural risks and potential cascading liquidation risks of high-volume derivative open interest must also be assessed. For example, if the implied -55% drop in step 3 is exacerbated by insufficient liquidity, the actual loss could increase by another 10%, bringing the total drop to -65%. Furthermore, open interest and margin positions should be reviewed, as high leverage can accelerate a decline through cascading liquidations. What happens to Ethereum and XRP if Bitcoin suffers a major blow? In traditional finance, a crash in the S&amp;P 500 or the sudden collapse of a large brokerage firm often triggers rapid and indiscriminate risk aversion—an effect known as \"financial contagion.\" The cryptocurrency market exhibits similar dynamics, but at a faster pace and on a larger scale, typically triggered by shocks originating from Bitcoin. Data from past crises (including the FTX and Terra crashes) reveals a clear pattern: when Bitcoin falls, other cryptocurrencies typically follow suit. Bitcoin remains the primary risk indicator for the market. In such situations, liquidity often flows into stablecoins or exits the market entirely to hedge against the risks of volatile assets. While Ethereum benefits from its strong Layer-1 utility, it is not entirely immune; its correlation with Bitcoin typically strengthens during periods of market stress as institutional capital views both as risk assets. However, Ethereum's staking lock-up mechanism and extensive decentralized application ecosystem may provide a utility-driven support, helping it rebound more quickly after a crisis subsides. On the other hand, assets like XRP, facing higher regulatory and structural risks and lacking Ethereum's extensive and natural on-chain yield mechanisms, may suffer disproportionate shocks. Such shocks often trigger a vicious cycle where the loss of collective confidence outweighs the token's fundamental utility, leading to a correlated decline across the entire market. What if Bitcoin loses market dominance or its price falls? How to hedge your strategy? To hedge against a Bitcoin crash, basic diversification alone is insufficient. Systemic shocks demonstrate that extreme correlations often negate the benefits of diversification. Explore Derivatives During periods of extreme market panic, futures market prices can be significantly lower than spot prices. This provides experienced traders with opportunities for relatively low-risk, non-directional arbitrage. They leverage market inefficiencies to hedge volatility risk rather than taking on directional price risk. Diversify your portfolio with risk buffers Hold tokenized gold, real-world assets (RWA), or fiat-backed stablecoins to preserve and grow wealth. These assets serve as liquidity reserves when the cryptocurrency market crashes. Monitoring dominance and correlation ratios: Tracking the rolling short-term correlation between Ethereum and XRP and Bitcoin can serve as a real-time early warning signal that diversified investment returns are disappearing. It can identify when immediate hedging measures are needed. Rebalancing to yield-generating positions: Transferring some assets to staking, lending, or liquidity pools—assets that generate returns regardless of market movements. Stable returns help offset valuation losses and increase asset recovery potential.</p></li></ul></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Jake, Messari Analyst; Translation: xz@Jinse Finance</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">After the hype surrounding the release of the Ethereum Foundation's Kohaku wallet SDK subsided, I conducted some research and reflection on RAIL, which I summarize as follows:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>(1) In the past two weeks, RAIL has been fluctuating within a channel between $2.00 and $3.20.</strong> I currently hold a large position in RAIL, with an average cost of approximately $1.50. If the price breaks below the support level, I will start adding to my position. If you haven't entered the market yet, the price level near the lower edge of the channel is quite attractive.</p> ... <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Pda1RNdacXjNX9s0kapr4oWG89ujJubRkug1QLAe.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410359_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410359\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>（2）The core logic remains unchanged; only the market has changed</strong>. After the liquidation event on October 10, RAIL plummeted from approximately $5.00 to $2.20. Since then, its price movement has consistently been highly synchronized with the sideways trading pattern of BTC. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"VFBu2V84o6Wj8jANtYh5BFp0PFECVCBCTTnH38Ky.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410360_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410360\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>（3）According to the quick calculation model of AJC, Corporate Research Manager at Messari</strong>: If 1% of ETH and stablecoins on Ethereum flow through the RAILGUN privacy collection, it will generate approximately $82.4 million in annualized revenue. This calculation is based on a 1.25% revenue capture rate (historical annualized capture rate is 4-10% of TVL) and a 1.0% potential market penetration rate (current market size is $450-500 billion in ETH and approximately $175 billion in stablecoins). At $2.30, its fully diluted valuation (FDV) is $132 million, meaning that in the baseline scenario, annual revenue is equivalent to 62% of its total FDV. Even under pessimistic assumptions (0.1% market penetration + 1.25% revenue capture), it still generates $8.2 million in annual revenue, representing 6.2% of its total FDV (while in a bull market scenario, 10% market penetration would generate $823 million in annualized revenue, equivalent to 624% of FDV). Furthermore, this is only one dimension for evaluating RAIL. Compared to similar valuations (Zcash − FDV $6.46 billion / Monero − FDV $5.95 billion), RAIL's current FDV is less than 3% of its competitors (considering Railgun's quantifiable cash flow potential, a reasonable valuation should be closer to 10-15% of its competitors). Not to mention, ZEC's continued strong performance will further boost the bullish logic for RAIL in the privacy sector. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"eYB6bZlHZpiV8ieefJ2BnQbaxa8LGpa0oTpMh5ik.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410361_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410361\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>（4）Potential Catalyst: Continued Growth in Usage</strong>. Railgun processed $1.6 billion in privacy transactions this year, slightly less than half of the protocol's total transaction volume since 2021 ($4 billion). </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Railgun plans to demonstrate its wallet technology at the Devconnect conference in Argentina in two weeks.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Railgun plans to demonstrate its wallet technology at the Devconnect conference in Argentina in two weeks.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> The Ethereum ecosystem continues to increase its investment in privacy, especially Railgun… The Ethereum Foundation continues to increase its investment in institutional-grade solutions, especially institutional-grade privacy solutions like Railgun… (5) With the occurrence of market liquidation events, the window for short-term trading of RAIL has closed, but the window for long-term investment (with at least 3-5 times potential) is fully open. Summary: Hold RAIL firmly.</p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Arnav Pagidyala, Source: Bankless, Translated by: Shaw Jinse Finance</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On-chain lending has become a pillar of decentralized finance (DeFi). However, despite its rapid development, its underlying architecture has remained virtually unchanged since Compound v2. Over 99% of DeFi still operates in some form of over-collateralized, floating-rate model pioneered a few years ago.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For the world to truly operate on-chain, lending must mature far beyond its current form.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">What began as a simple stablecoin lending mechanism is now evolving into a complete financial system. This article aims to highlight the latest breakthroughs in protocol design, credit architecture, and regulation that are driving on-chain lending to become the foundational layer of a programmable global economy.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> 1. DeFi as a New Financial Operating System Over the past cycle, DeFi has quietly evolved from a series of isolated applications into a **composable global financial operating system**. In 2018, protocols such as Aave, Compound, and Uniswap operated as independent applications, each with its own liquidity, governance mechanisms, and user base. By 2025, they had evolved into a \"financial kernel\": a programmable environment where liquidity, risk, and execution are abstracted into modular layers that other developers can combine, extend, or build into new financial systems. In traditional software, an operating system provides three functions: shared memory, standardized interfaces, and permissionless scalability. The same model is now appearing in the DeFi space. These new \"operating system protocols\" manage the shared state of funds, rather than the shared state of files. Liquidity acts as the memory layer, the interest rate curve and Automated Market Makers (AMMs) act as system calls, while oracles, treasuries, and governance mechanisms constitute the layer for coordinated execution. Several mainstream protocols already embody this design philosophy: Aave v4 is evolving into a hub-and-spoke liquidity operating system. At its core is a controlled kernel called the \"Liquidity Hub,\" surrounded by modular markets for RWAs, GHOs, and permissioned pools. Liquidity only needs to be provided once and can be deployed to all branches under controlled risk parameters, achieving unified capital efficiency rather than fragmented liquidity pools. This marks a significant step forward for Aave v4 from the isolated market architecture of Aave v3 to a fully shared liquidity layer. Morpho v1 and Euler v2 take a completely different approach: they employ a minimalist credit core, sharing only logic and not liquidity. Each vault is an independent micromarket, but all inherit the same underlying architecture—a unified accounting and clearing engine. Morpho v2 extends this by replacing static vaults with an intent-based Request for Quotation (RFQ) matching layer, allowing fixed-rate and floating-rate loans to coexist in a unified credit market. Fluid represents the most vertically integrated version, a unified liquidity operating system where lending, trading, and collateral all originate from a shared pool of funds. It is the first system to treat every dollar of idle capital, collateral, and borrowed funds as an interconnected resource. These architectures collectively mark the next stage in the development of DeFi. The era of isolated money markets is giving way to more interoperable financial systems that function more like operating environments than applications. Liquidity, risk, and governance are becoming shared infrastructure, not product features. Whether through modular hubs, minimalist kernels, or vertically integrated engines, the ultimate goal is the same: to build an open, programmable, and globally composable financial system. 2. Order Book-Based Lending Most DeFi lending still relies on the pool model, where all liquidity providers share risk and reward. This model offers simplicity and shared liquidity, but at the cost of insufficient precision. Furthermore, interest rates are not determined through negotiation but generated by algorithms or decentralized autonomous systems (DAOs), a stark contrast to the refined interest rates offered by traditional finance (TradFi). The next breakthrough in lending microstructure is the order book-based lending model, where lenders and borrowers post specific quotes, similar to a centrally limited order book (CLOB) in traditional finance. This structure allows for granular control over terms: fixed or floating interest rates, maturity dates, collateral requirements, and even custom risk parameters. Hybrid models are also emerging, combining pooling liquidity for increased depth with order book mechanisms for price discovery. Just as AMMs evolved into models with centralized liquidity, lending markets may also tend towards this more expressive design. However, the key difference is that lending markets are built for passive lenders, so the experience is largely the same for ordinary borrowers, but borrowers will have more choices. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"3kVrJDsZ9IRJ4j3gbq7q1K70ZsitwHF3IV55mPgE.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410340_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410340\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Order books can be used for both floating-rate and fixed-rate loans, but their basic mechanism is similar: lenders publish quotes, borrowers accept quotes, and the matching results generate credit positions on-chain. Most of the funding in these systems comes from passive lenders, typically deployed through custodians or vault managers who aggregate liquidity and manage parameters on behalf of passive lenders. Avon is pioneering a hybrid architecture that combines a centrally controlled order book with custom strategies (independent markets), allowing compatible orders to be atomically cleared while still meeting the needs of passive lenders.</p><br/><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">3. The Era of Convenience</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As mentioned above, the underlying lending protocol will be completely abstracted by a series of consumer-facing products. Examples include revolving lending, automated risk management, yield abstraction, and consumer agency.</p><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Revolving strategies</strong> are being abstracted into seamless, one-click operation products. Platforms like Contango and Loopscale have already automated the process, while lending marketplaces like Jupiter, Euler, and Silo are beginning to integrate these mechanisms directly into their front-end interfaces.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Yield Abstraction</strong>: For end users, lending will be simplified to a single \"net return\" figure. The underlying strategies will gradually fade from view, just as banks hide the operation of overnight repurchase agreements behind current account interest rates.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Yield Abstraction</strong> With direct integration between exchanges like Coinbase and protocols like Morpho, yield will become a basic user experience feature, rather than a complex financial operation. Consumer Agents: Smart agents will dynamically manage collateral ratios, refinance, and liquidation protection on behalf of users. These systems will rebalance positions across protocols in real time, optimize borrowing costs, and hedge volatility in real time, transforming active portfolio management into a back-office process. 4. Ratings, Benchmarking, and Compliance DeFi can only reach trillions of dollars if using it doesn't jeopardize the CFO's job. Any financial market needs standards, and the lending market is no exception. Credit ratings, transparent benchmarks, and compliance frameworks constitute the trust infrastructure that connects code-based markets with real-world capital. Ratings: Just as Moody's or S&amp;P assess corporate and sovereign credit, independent risk rating agencies will emerge to evaluate DeFi vaults, protocols, and on-chain credit portfolios. These ratings will quantify smart contract risk, collateral quality, counterparty risk exposure, and historical performance, allowing institutional risk frameworks to be clearly mapped to the underlying DeFi technology. While I believe S&amp;P and Moody's will likely remain dominant in this space, emerging agencies like Web3SOC and Credora are also appearing. Benchmarking: Standardized indices, such as \"DeFi LIBOR\" or \"on-chain SOFR,\" will enable borrowers, lenders, and vaults to price risk and compare yields across different protocols. This will lay the foundation for native on-chain building of derivatives, yield curves, and structured credit markets. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Compliance</strong>: With the addition of institutions, embedded KYC/AML will become a basic requirement. Protocols will increasingly divide liquidity into permissionless and compliant tiers, enabling regulated entities to access DeFi tracks while maintaining open access for all other users. For example, Morpho v2 vaults support customizable access controls designed to meet institutional compliance requirements. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">These elements together constitute the institutional interface for on-chain lending.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">5. Beyond Overcollateralization</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The current market is dominated by crypto asset overcollateralization and floating-rate lending, which, while practical, is essentially a narrow niche market. The future development of on-chain lending will go far beyond this model, unlocking the complete credit system that underpins traditional finance.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Fixed-Rate Loans: Predictable payments, clear maturity dates, and structured instruments are prerequisites for institutional adoption. Protocols like Morpho v2 are pioneering intent-based fixed-rate markets, while emerging designs like Term and Tenor are exploring auction-driven and order book mechanisms to price term risk directly on-chain. In effect, Morpho v2 may serve both ends of the market: a highly liquid, order book-based market on one end, and a highly customizable over-the-counter (OTC) market on the other, with custodians allocating liquidity vaults and lending divisions managing more targeted credit risk exposures. Low-Collateralized Loans: Protocols like 3Jane and Wildcat are pioneering frameworks for trust-minimized, low-collateralized lending, combining the guarantees enforced by smart contracts with real-world underwriting and trusteeship reputation. Alternative Credit Markets: Lending is also expanding into the long tail and non-traditional collateral areas, such as tokenized RWAs, alternative FX pairs, stablecoin arbitrage trading, and even credit lines guaranteed by credit. These markets introduce new dimensions of risk, including diversification, cross-border liquidity, and reflection of the complexities of global finance. The explosive growth of Midas is a prime example, highlighting the dynamics of two-way demand: traditional finance seeks to enhance on-chain liquidity through cyclical mechanisms, while crypto-native investors seek high-yield exposure to uncorrelated traditional financial instruments. These cutting-edge areas collectively signify DeFi's evolution from a collateral-constrained niche into a comprehensive, programmable credit system capable of collateralizing a wide range of financial products, from consumer loans to sovereign debt, with all transactions settled directly on-chain. Finally, when discussing the future of DeFi lending, I must mention the rise of custodians like Gauntlet, Re7, Steakhouse, and MEV Capital. These institutions actively manage liquidity, optimize returns, and adjust protocol parameters. They are evolving into on-chain versions of Millennium or Citadel, deploying quantitative strategies, risk models, and dynamic liquidity management across multiple protocols. In the past few years, custodians have earned modest performance fees and often subsidize users with incentives to attract deposits. But this is not a quick fix. They understand that custody itself will be one of the most scalable and profitable businesses of the next decade. Attracting deposits is merely a means of user acquisition; the ultimate goal is data distribution. As these companies grow in size and reputation, it's easy to imagine them becoming on-chain asset management firms managing over $10 billion in assets and holding a significant position across all major protocols. The competition for deposits will only intensify. There are many hedge funds, but only one Millennium, and every project manager in the DeFi space is vying to become its on-chain successor. Conclusion DeFi lending is no longer a collateral-based leverage experiment; it is evolving into the architecture of a programmable financial system. From order book-based credit markets and one-click revolving products to institutional-grade ratings and low-collateral frameworks, each layer of architecture is being rebuilt for scale, precision, and accessibility. Once lending truly becomes programmable, finance will no longer be confined to institutions but will exist within the network.</p></li></ul></div></div>",

            "title": "Current Status of the X402 Track",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Haotian; Source: X, @tmel0211</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Let's talk about the current situation of the x402 track and give a brief commentary, for reference only</strong>:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>1) The phrase \"change of leadership\" should actually be in quotation marks, but looking back, it's \"leading player\" that should be in quotation marks.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">PING attracted a lot of attention and made the track popular, but it failed to show its kingly dominance. It's all about timing and fate. It's not even close to the GOAT of the past. Who can blame them when the liquidity is dry?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">PAYAI's name, Pay, played a big role. Facilitator did play a significant role in the technical architecture of x402, but the overall technical threshold of the x402 track is not high, so most people are still rushing in with the mentality of speculating on MEME.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Therefore, regarding the current track, I tend to think that it's too early to talk about the \"top two\" players, at least it's not stable yet, but fortunately the track's popularity hasn't waned, waiting for the next turning point; 2) Many people complain that CEXs aren't supporting the x402 track. Yes, I'd also like to know why. But the fact is, the resurgence of on-chain innovation has gone from providing valuable assets for exchanges to the awkward situation of stealing CEXs' attention. This is the fundamental motivation for me to keep advocating for on-chain innovation; once on-chain innovation is passive, more innovation will be stifled. However, we can also see the clues of exchanges' strategies. I wrote a suggestion to Star Xu, and he should have taken it to heart by looking at XLayer's recent actions. In addition, OKX's listing of Virtuals also expresses its attitude; they need to find certainty amidst the chaos. Therefore, it is expected that many more \"regulars\" in the x402 track will receive offers from OKX. Interestingly, Bybit reacted particularly quickly, quietly launching PAYAI's Alpha when PING was trending, and Mantle is also making a series of moves related to the x402 track. This shows that CEXs are not completely indifferent; the rise of the x402 track is an opportunity for them to break the unfair competition among their peers, and a key juncture for them to pull the industry back from the hype and infighting surrounding MEME to the main theme of technology. Caution indicates they are taking it seriously, which can be seen as a positive sign; 3) Many pessimists compare the x402 track to the early days of inscription and the later AI Agent craze, believing that the hype is only temporary and will eventually end in chaos. I acknowledge the existence of a bubble, and that most projects will inevitably fail, but I am optimistic about its long-term intrinsic value. I've analyzed the reasons for this in previous articles. In short, Inscription is an asset issuance game where inscriptions are merely decorative carvings on gold. x402's current focus is on AI Pay infrastructure services; Launchpad's numerous appearances haven't truly taken off yet, and it's not purely based on operational logic. As for the AI ​​Agent craze, I believe the x402 sector's current popularity is a continuation of the previous AI Agent wave, evolving from meaningless scenarios where AI Agents only chatted to AI Agents participating in payments. This transformation is significant and difficult to disprove. That's all. In short, don't be discouraged. To sum it up in one sentence: The x402 track currently lacks a true main driving force, and many Dev teams are likely preparing new innovative products, gameplay, and mechanics... CEX teams are also quietly preparing their strategies... Be patient, maintain your confidence, and let the dust settle.</p></div></div>",

Everyone has easy access to professional information, including company disclosures, financial statements, and analyst reports. Market access and information access have never been so convenient. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"qUnp1lsQ7a41ZbDuR7tE7olMILmh8hQqgz8bMiNl.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410297_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410297\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: JPMorgan Chase</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>However, despite improvements in market and information access, sufficient infrastructure has not been provided to effectively analyze and utilize data. The complex market environment and higher volatility have increased the burden on retail investors.</strong> Investors must monitor massive amounts of data from multiple services to invest in various assets, including national stock markets and cryptocurrencies. Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange plan to emulate the cryptocurrency market model and establish 24-hour trading systems. The investment environment will undergo more dramatic changes. Retail investors lack sufficient infrastructure to cope with this complexity. Since investing is not their primary profession, they lack the time and resources to systematically analyze massive amounts of data. Complex financial data places a huge cognitive burden on understanding and utilizing it. Many retail investors, while having access to a wealth of information, fail to use it effectively and in a timely manner. They rely on social media, fragmented news, apps, or homemade spreadsheets to make investment decisions. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"WQtWYR4JvDKIV4gLll8ckkak4i5pW1mFCOfxfbZK.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410298_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410298\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Bloomberg Terminal</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Institutional investors typically use professional systems like the Bloomberg Terminal to manage this complexity. Ultra-high-net-worth individuals access personalized portfolio management and customized investment strategies through private bankers. The Bloomberg Terminal costs tens of thousands of dollars annually and requires professional training. Private banking services require a minimum of several billion Korean won in assets.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Most retail investors cannot access these professional tools.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> However, retail investors face the same market environment as institutional investors. Increased market participation forces retail investors to make quick and accurate decisions in complex and volatile markets. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have opened up new possibilities for bridging this information gap. Today, services can analyze massive amounts of data in real time, like the Bloomberg Terminal, while also providing personalized investment insights to retail investors like private bankers. Edgen is a leading example of this possibility. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Edgen: An AI-powered Bloomberg Terminal for All Investors</h2><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"1SxFyIBEWZlFCjQhBb9qdknJgqE8ognnhKTlBL7Y.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410299_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410299\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Edgen is an AI-driven financial intelligence platform designed to be \"an AI-powered Bloomberg terminal for everyone.\" The platform enables retail investors to seamlessly monitor and analyze the stock and cryptocurrency markets from a single interface.</p> ... <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"l1XAEBX5keGrTt9Y6FpEeWfAqy1HdvsQf1VyBCiB.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410300_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410300\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Tiger Research</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Edgen's capabilities go far beyond simple data aggregation. The platform transforms fragmented data into actionable insights. Traditional financial information platforms provide raw data such as news, charts, and financial statements, while Edgen analyzes this data and delivers investment insights in multiple formats: conversational answers, visual charts, comprehensive reports, and quantitative scores tailored to each investor.</p> Edgen goes a step further, building personalized analytics tailored to each investor's investment style and goals. The platform presents optimized, personalized insights, rather than showing the same data to all users. This approach is similar to personalized social media feeds. Just as Facebook and Instagram show different content to each user, Edgen provides different dashboards for each investor. For example, in the same Bitcoin market, long-term investors might receive a personalized pivot point alert saying \"Bottomed out, consider adding to your position,\" while short-term traders might see a personalized pivot point alert saying \"Short-term oversold zone, watch for potential rebound.\" <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"9i0KGmTXg3NlwAJrD55HH91XmrNTFl94TNoiDLu1.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410301_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410301\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Efficient Decision Guidance Model (EDGM) supports this function.</strong>. EDGM coordinates various specialized agents and tools through a multi-agent system, rather than operating as a single holistic model. Unlike general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that only process language and words, this inference model interprets user queries and assigns them to appropriate professional agents based on a specialized investment framework (macroeconomic analysis, technical analysis, fundamental analysis) and real-time market data. Each agent utilizes a guidance model and a knowledge model to collect the necessary data. This process integrates real-time market data, individual investor search history, portfolio composition, and trading patterns. The system also references data from investors with similar investment characteristics. Subsequently, market tools and the Large Language Model (LLM) process and synthesize the collected data, presenting the results in the form of conversational responses, charts, or reports. This solution combines the comprehensive market analysis of the Bloomberg Terminal with the personalized strategy development of private banks on a single platform. Now, retail investors can also access financial information previously only available to institutional investors and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">3. How Edgen Supports the Entire Investment Process</h2><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">3.1 Market Discovery: Uncovering Investment Opportunities</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In today's complex markets, even experienced investors struggle to find valuable investment opportunities. Investors must sift through and analyze massive amounts of data: countless news reports, charts, financial statements, and social media signals. Edgen simplifies this process through a variety of methods.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"jkSbWJ2LqY7A0iabZIBHGk3vReykSo4JDOdxjHfK.gif\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410302\" title=\"7410302\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Edgen's search function allows investors to explore the market in a conversational manner without directly analyzing complex financial data. For example, when an investor asks, \"Why has Tesla's stock price recently fallen?\", Edgen analyzes the company's news, financial situation, technical indicators, and market sentiment simultaneously, providing a comprehensive answer. Personalization also plays a role here. Edgen learns from users' search history, identifies the themes, industries, and indicators that each investor values, and then progressively tailors search results and investment recommendations to that user. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"7eRGIA6x6zqymYTdHiRdGQlEFq5AMxtBRPhF4GHc.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410303_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410303\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Investment Philosophy: Systematically uncover noteworthy market opportunities through thematic sections. \"Hot Stocks\" and \"Hot Cryptocurrencies\" highlight assets with strong market momentum. \"Stock Screener\" and \"Cryptocurrency Screener\" allow investors to create custom asset lists by setting criteria such as market capitalization, trading volume, and price action. The \"Cryptocurrency Attention &amp; Funding\" section captures signals unique to the cryptocurrency market.</p> ... “Cryptocurrency Attention” tracks tokens that are rapidly gaining popularity on social media in real time using X’s (formerly Twitter) “Hotness Index.” “Latest Funding” provides information on recently funded projects, including funding size and participating investors. “Decentralized Exchange Tracker” analyzes on-chain transactions to reveal the flow of funds from professional investors. <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">3.2. Intelligent Portfolio Management: Asset Valuation and Management</h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"G8U0sMCSkrVQm4i4lHMJfz1LzdxTewGiijCGOZU2.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410304_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410304\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">After identifying investment opportunities, investors need tools to deeply analyze assets and continuously monitor their trends. 360° reports can automatically generate comprehensive analyses for individual assets.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> The system evaluates stocks from four perspectives: valuation, growth, profitability, and momentum, and cryptocurrencies from three perspectives: fundamentals, token economic models, and momentum. Edgen's professional analysts analyze each category and assign ratings from A+ to D-. The platform transparently displays the analysis process so investors can verify the basis of each analyst's judgment. In addition to analyzing individual assets, investors must also manage multiple assets holistically. Edgen offers intelligent portfolio management features. Investors can manage their portfolio of stocks and cryptocurrencies on a single screen. The portfolio offers three views: a \"Market View\" displaying real-time prices and asset ratings; a \"360° Report View\" summarizing in-depth analysis of each asset; and a \"News View\" filtering and providing news relevant to the portfolio. Edgen plans to further advance its Smart Portfolio functionality. The platform will offer a comprehensive portfolio score that goes beyond single asset ratings, along with specific action plans to help investors achieve higher ratings. 3.3 Customization Tools: Building Your Own Investment Strategy Edgen provides a Smart Assistant Store for investors who require more specialized analysis. This store offers a range of AI assistants focused on specific investment areas. Investors can directly select and deploy smart assistants that match their investment style and goals. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"zBIOMD0gLCHJN3yR9GK4pvGAW12sIJVnj8cTSoUt.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410306_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410306\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For example, the technical signal broker automatically calculates indicators such as RSI, MACD, and moving averages, and then gives a \"bullish\" or \"bearish\" judgment, providing a comprehensive three-star rating. The pivot point alert broker detects when assets are approaching local highs or lows, helping investors optimize trading timing at key inflection points. Other brokers offer various functions, including on-chain activity analysis and TGE pre-opportunity discovery. Investors can choose and deploy the brokers they need based on their own goals. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"l2PCL8BDfSVB84B3RyfQHgR5BxBG3NUoBiiklfHR.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410307_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410307\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition, Edgen is about to launch an intelligent trade execution function, which can automatically execute investors' trade requests. For stock trading, the Edgen platform can interface with platforms such as Robinhood and XStocks; for cryptocurrency trading, Edgen can integrate with protocols such as Hyperliquid and Pendle. The AI ​​assistant can understand the investor's intent and execute trades directly. With this function, Edgen is moving from an intelligent platform to a comprehensive investment operation platform.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"x0S74xd0t7RA0V5zmKE6yePMQrtHo6L2jkoB5f1H.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410308_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410308\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Users earn Aura Points by publishing market analysis or insights on the platform or sharing such content on social media. 30% of the reward pool is used for distribution activities, and 70% is used for AI training contributions. The platform evaluates all contributions through AI scoring, community assessment, and expert verification. Users can view their Aura Points through the platform's leaderboards and on X (formerly Twitter) via browser extensions. The system divides points into three levels: Aura, Super Aura, and Ultra Aura.</p> ... The platform publicly records the provider of each analysis and its submission time. User-provided insights are used to train artificial intelligence. User contributions improve AI, which in turn provides users with better analysis, creating a virtuous cycle. Through this participatory structure, Edgen has gradually evolved into a platform that learns and progresses together with the community. 5. From Wall Street to Every Street Bloomberg Terminal and private banking services have long served only institutional investors and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. These institutions maintain an overwhelming competitive advantage in the market thanks to their unique information channels and analytical tools. Meanwhile, retail investors can only make investment decisions with incomplete information, fragmented data, and limited tools. The increasing complexity of the market further widens this gap. The variables that investors must consider are growing exponentially: on-chain data analysis, social media signal tracking, global market trend identification, and so on. In such a massive deluge of information, it's nearly impossible for individual investors to uncover meaningful insights and make timely investment decisions. Edgen bridges this information gap. The platform automates complex analytical tasks through a multi-agent system and integrates stocks and cryptocurrencies into a unified interface. Investors can now easily access institutional-grade analytics tools without having to collect and cross-reference information across multiple platforms. Edgen takes a further step in personalized financial intelligence. The platform provides optimized analysis and strategies tailored to each investor's style, risk tolerance, and goals. This approach goes beyond simply providing institutional tools to retail investors. Edgen essentially provides each investor with their own personal banker. Retail investing is rapidly diversifying. Edgen, through artificial intelligence, transforms \"Wall Street privilege\" into \"opportunity for everyone.\" Financial information once accessible only to a select few is now available to all investors. The investment landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation. </div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Author: Shen En</span></p><blockquote style=\"text-align: left;\"><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">With a single stroke of Trump's pen, the king of cryptocurrencies regained his innocence, but the political deal behind it is far more intriguing than the pardon itself.</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">On October 23, when President Trump signed the pardon for Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, his tortuous fate once again became the focus of global attention. White House Press Secretary Levitt stated bluntly in a statement: \"The Biden administration's war on cryptocurrencies is over.\"</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">Four months ago, Changpeng Zhao was still serving time in Seattle federal prison, sentenced to four months in prison for failing to establish an effective anti-money laundering mechanism and violating US economic sanctions regulations.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"> Now, he has not only regained his freedom but also received a presidential pardon, a turn of events that has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. From imprisonment to presidential pardon, Zhao Changpeng's fall was as rapid as his rise. In November 2023, this entrepreneur, who once topped the list of the richest Chinese people with a net worth of $94.1 billion, admitted to violating US anti-money laundering regulations, and Binance paid a record-breaking $4.3 billion fine. He also resigned as CEO. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland stated at the time, \"Binance became the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange partly because of the crimes it committed.\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen further criticized Binance for \"ignoring\" its legal obligations in its pursuit of profits, allowing funds to flow through its platform to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers. In April 2024, a Seattle federal court sentenced Changpeng Zhao to four months in prison, far less than the three-year sentence initially sought by prosecutors. The judge told Zhao, \"No one is immune from prosecution or above U.S. law, regardless of wealth, power, or status.\" Now, Trump's pardon has erased Zhao's criminal record, clearing the way for his return to the cryptocurrency arena. The Political Deal Behind the Pardon Trump's decision to pardon Changpeng Zhao was not without precedent. In March 2025, the Wall Street Journal reported that representatives of the Trump family had negotiated a stake in the cryptocurrency exchange Binance US. The report at the time indicated that Zhao had served four months in prison after pleading guilty and was seeking leniency from the Trump administration. Although Zhao denied the reports on the X platform, the contact between the Trump family and Binance has raised questions about a potential conflict of interest. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the Trump family's cryptocurrency business, which has been operating since the 2024 election, has generated $4.5 billion in revenue and has a partnership with the trading platform Binance, which is quietly managed. This pardon decision has therefore been viewed by outsiders as potentially involving a quid pro quo. Trump described his pardon decision as ending the Biden administration's \"political persecution\" of the crypto industry. However, this explanation cannot conceal the possible commercial ties between his family and Binance. The Rise and Fall of Changpeng Zhao: Changpeng Zhao's story is a microcosm of the cryptocurrency industry. Born in Jiangsu, China in 1977, Zhao Changpeng immigrated to Canada with his parents at the age of 10. During his teenage years, he worked at a Chevron gas station and McDonald's, and also served as a volleyball referee. At the age of 13, his father bought him an IBM-compatible 286 computer, an investment that helped him embark on a career in technology. He later earned a bachelor's degree in computer science from McGill University and subsequently developed systems for the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Bloomberg Futures Trading. In 2013, Zhao Changpeng first learned about cryptocurrency while playing poker. He subsequently sold his Shanghai apartment and invested approximately $1 million in cryptocurrency at $600 per coin. Even after his Shanghai property doubled in value while cryptocurrency prices halved, he remained bullish on the latter. In 2017, Zhao Changpeng founded Binance in Hong Kong. With the surge in cryptocurrency prices, Binance rapidly grew into the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. At the end of 2021, Changpeng Zhao topped the Forbes list of the richest Chinese people with a net worth of $90 billion. However, Binance's rapid expansion was accompanied by compliance risks. US regulators alleged that Binance failed to establish an effective anti-money laundering mechanism and violated US economic sanctions regulations. These issues ultimately led to his conflict with the US judicial system. The Legal and Political Realities Behind Pardons: The US president's power of pardon originates from Article II, Section 2 of the US Constitution, which, except in cases of impeachment, grants probation and pardons to those who violate federal laws. This virtually unlimited power allowed Trump to drop Zhao Changpeng's criminal conviction. This wasn't the first time Trump had used his pardon power. Before his term ended in January 2021, he pardoned dozens of people, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner's father and former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. At the time, some US media outlets even reported that Trump's allies and aides received fees from those seeking presidential pardons. For Zhao Changpeng, the actual legal value of the pardon may be limited, as he has already served his sentence. However, its symbolic significance is enormous—the pardon erases his criminal record, paving the way for his return to the business and political arena. A New Chapter in Cryptocurrency Regulation Trump's decision to pardon Changpeng Zhao symbolizes a shift in US cryptocurrency policy. The White House explicitly stated that this move aims to end the Biden administration's stringent regulations on the cryptocurrency industry. In recent years, global regulation of cryptocurrencies has been continuously tightening. In 2023, with the bankruptcy of FTX, one of the world's top five cryptocurrency exchanges, regulations on cryptocurrencies became even stricter in various countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission also filed 13 charges against Binance. Chen Jia, a researcher at the International Monetary Institute of Renmin University of China, pointed out that for cryptocurrencies to achieve sustainable development in the future, they urgently need to address four key issues: compliance, security, risk control, and liquidity. These are also the four cornerstones of future US cryptocurrency exchanges. Trump's pardon of Changpeng Zhao sends a clear signal: his administration will adopt a more lenient regulatory stance towards the cryptocurrency industry. This policy shift may open the door for Binance to re-enter the US market. For Changpeng Zhao, the pardon signifies a new beginning. In a September interview with Caixin, Zhao mentioned focusing more on his venture capital firm, YZi Labs, and has been invited to serve as an official cryptocurrency industry advisor to several governments. Binance may also face significant changes. Although the settlement agreement required Binance to completely withdraw from the US and appoint a five-year oversight officer, Trump's pardon may create favorable conditions for Binance's return to the US market. Meanwhile, Changpeng Zhao is also expected to rejoin Binance's management. His previous sentence prohibited him from participating in Binance's management or decision-making activities for three years after his release, but the amnesty may lift this restriction. The market reacted positively to Zhao's return. Following the amnesty news, BNB rose 7%, returning above $1100, and Bitcoin also returned to $110,000. This market reaction shows that investors view Zhao's return as a positive development for the industry. Trump's amnesty has rewritten Zhao's fate, but the global cryptocurrency game has only just begun. As the Trump family's relationship with Binance deepens, and as Changpeng Zhao moves among political figures worldwide, the future of cryptocurrency will become inextricably linked to geopolitics. Zhao Changpeng's promise after his release to \"do everything in his power to help the United States become the cryptocurrency capital\" carries profound implications. Wherever he goes, the future of cryptocurrency will be reshaped in the clash between national interests and decentralized ideals.</span></p></div></div>",
