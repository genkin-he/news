            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p>Author: Liu Honglin (Founder of Shanghai Mankiw Law Firm)</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">A $300 Trillion Mishap</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the early hours of October 16, 2025, a dramatic scene unfolded in the crypto market when stablecoin issuer Paxos accidentally minted and destroyed 300 trillion PayPal USD (PYUSD). CoinMarketCap data shows that PYUSD currently has a market capitalization of only about $2.6 billion, meaning the erroneous minting amount is equivalent to 113,250 times the circulating supply. If priced at $1, the total amount of erroneously minted PYUSD is equivalent to more than twice the global GDP, far exceeding the entire market capitalization of the US crypto market.</p> This means that, firstly, even if Paxos has sufficient reserves, its asset collateral ratio will instantly drop to zero in the face of a supply of 300 trillion, rendering users' PYUSD worthless, causing market confidence to collapse and triggering a chain reaction; secondly, if this massive amount of PYUSD is used for on-chain transactions and captured and exploited by arbitrage bots or market makers, even for just a few seconds, it will cause a sharp decoupling of the PYUSD price. Paxos's \"God-like authority\" (absolute control over minting and burning coins) due to the nature of its fiat-backed stablecoin ultimately led to a human error with potentially severe consequences. However, this same \"God-like authority\" also saved PYUSD from an instant collapse during the error correction process. PayPal USD (PYUSD) is a US dollar stablecoin launched by global payment giant PayPal in August 2023, and is the first compliant stablecoin issued by a \"non-crypto\" company. This stablecoin is 100% backed by US dollar cash, short-term US Treasury bonds, and cash equivalents, and is issued by New York-based cryptocurrency financial services company Paxos Trust, gradually rolling it out to PayPal customers in the United States. At that time, the stablecoin market was dominated by two giants: Tether's USDT, with a market capitalization exceeding $100 billion, and Circle's USDC, ranking second with approximately $30 billion. PayPal is a leading global third-party payment platform. As of the second quarter of 2025, the company had 438 million active users and approximately 20 million merchant accounts, processing a total transaction volume of $1.68 trillion in the past year. Its business covers over 200 markets. PYUSD, issued by PayPal, will be independently audited by a third-party accounting firm and subject to strict regulation by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). With its massive user base, mature payment network, and extensive regulatory compliance experience, PayPal seems to possess a natural advantage in issuing stablecoins—all of which suggests that PYUSD can easily replicate PayPal's success in the traditional payment sector and quickly seize the stablecoin market. But is this really the case? Why did PayPal launch a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a real asset (such as fiat currency, gold, or a basket of assets). It aims to maintain relative price stability through specific mechanisms. Its core objective is to solve the problem of large price volatility in traditional cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin), acting as a \"safe haven\" and an efficient payment tool in the crypto economy. For example, one stablecoin pegged to the US dollar (such as USDT, USDC, PYUSD) is typically equal to one US dollar. Stablecoins are a bridge connecting traditional finance and the crypto world; they represent the \"internetization of value.\" In the crypto ecosystem, they act as \"base money,\" providing functions such as a measure of value, a medium of payment, and a store of value. Cross-border transactions of traditional fiat currencies are like having a physical package delivered through multiple international courier companies. Each company needs to constantly verify information to ensure consistency, a very time-consuming process. Each courier company has different and fixed operating hours and charges certain handling fees, service fees, and exchange rate differences. Any problem in any link (such as incorrect information or damaged packages) will cause delays in the entire process. Its core is the \"institutional trust model,\" meaning we trust these centralized institutions to accurately record and transfer value for us. In contrast, cryptocurrency transactions are like sending a digital file via email. The transaction initiator creates a transaction, broadcasts it to the entire blockchain network, and nodes automatically verify the source and balance, transfer the funds, and record it on a globally shared, unique, and tamper-proof public ledger. The entire process requires no intermediaries and can be completed in just a few minutes or even seconds. **At its core is the \"mathematical trust model,\" meaning we no longer rely on the reputation of a particular institution, but rather trust the security and accuracy of mathematical algorithms, cryptography, and distributed networks.** Cryptocurrency transactions in the crypto world have restructured the way value is transferred, fundamentally simplifying processes and eliminating unnecessary intermediaries. World Bank data shows that the global average cost of cross-border remittances is as high as 6.2%, and for remittances of $200 to Africa, the average fee even exceeds 8%. However, using PYUSD for the same amount of cross-border transfer can reduce the cost to below 1%, with real-time arrival.** PayPal, as a traditional payment giant, chose to actively embrace stablecoins primarily to address its own growth pressures, improve payment efficiency, and adapt to the wave of financial digitalization. First, around the time PYUSD was launched, PayPal was facing growth pressure. The transaction profit margin of its core payment business was declining, and its stock price was also under pressure, making it urgently need to find new growth points. Meanwhile, the stablecoin market showed enormous profit potential. Taking USDT as an example, its issuer, Tether, earned approximately $13 billion in net profit through investment income from its reserve assets (mainly US Treasury bonds). In 2024, Tether held approximately $113 billion in US Treasury bonds, exceeding the holdings of all countries except 17, including Germany, the UAE, and Australia. As shown in the image above, PayPal's stock price had fallen by approximately 80% compared to ATH at the time. Secondly, based on the PayPal ecosystem and the massive user payment demand, PYUSD can effectively improve transaction efficiency and maintain account value through incentive policies. In short, PYUSD aims to be a medium of exchange for purchasing goods, sending, and receiving US dollars to US users. PYUSD supports: Transferring PYUSD between PayPal and compatible external wallets; making peer-to-peer payments using PYUSD; selecting PYUSD as the payment method at checkout; and converting any PayPal-supported cryptocurrency to PYUSD. As a stablecoin supported by the PayPal network, PYUSD combines PayPal's experience in payments with the high speed, low cost, and high programmability of blockchain protocols to significantly improve payment efficiency, reduce payment friction for users in virtual environments, and facilitate rapid value transfer. Furthermore, with its collaboration with more blockchains, PYUSD can be deployed not only within the PayPal ecosystem but also circulated and used in external wallets, Web3 application communities, and exchanges. In the future, PayPal hopes to leverage global payment scenarios to establish PYUSD as a bridge between fiat currency and Web3 for consumers, merchants, and developers, covering remittances, B2B payments, and digital goods transactions, helping consumers, merchants, and developers seamlessly connect fiat and digital currencies. PYUSD is not operating alone in the payment field but collaborates with other stablecoins to jointly solve cross-border transaction issues, striving to achieve faster and lower-cost user payment solutions. For example, Paxos, the issuer of PYUSD, launched a stablecoin payment platform in October 2024 that simultaneously supports PYUSD, USDC, and Paxos' own USDP. Payment service providers can easily achieve instant conversion between USD and these various stablecoins. PayPal also partnered with Fiserv, a leading global payment service provider, in June 2025 to enable the circulation and conversion of PYUSD and FIUSD across their respective platforms and ecosystems. For users, a world that simultaneously supports multiple stablecoins and allows for free choice according to needs is perhaps a more anticipated world. PYUSD, with its ability to link with other stablecoins, can better meet interoperability requirements. <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"1761923758251031356.jpg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410531_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Finally, PayPal's issuance of a stablecoin is also aimed at positioning itself in the future trading market. The issuance of PYUSD can, on the one hand, enrich its product line, leveraging its massive user base (hundreds of millions of active users globally) and merchant network to create new value; on the other hand, PayPal also hopes to extend its advantages in the payment field to the emerging fields of crypto assets and blockchain, providing its users with a better payment experience, in order to gain a favorable position in future market competition.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The current stablecoin market can be divided into two parts based on the users and compliance requirements: the compliant world and the grassroots world.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> The compliant world is an elite game for PYUSD and USDC. There, transparency, regulatory compliance, and institutional adoption are core metrics. PYUSD and USDC are vying for the market of digital upgrades in traditional commerce and finance. USDC's advantage lies in its transparency and trust as a cornerstone of DeFi. The competition between the two is a race within the elite circle. The grassroots world is USDT's survival tool. There, entry barriers, ease of use, and cost are decisive factors. USDT users may not have bank accounts, proof of identity, or even a stable internet connection. They transfer USDT through Telegram bots, without gas fees or complex wallet addresses—as simple as sending a voice message. This is a parallel system that bypasses all traditional financial infrastructure. By 2025, PYUSD's market capitalization will have grown to approximately $2.64 billion, making it the world's sixth-largest stablecoin, but its market share will still be relatively small compared to the two giants. So, beyond the grassroots market dominated by USDT and the DeFi market controlled by USDC, where does PYUSD's future lie? The answer lies within the PayPal ecosystem itself. Unlike USDT, which primarily serves cryptocurrency transactions, PYUSD's biggest advantage lies in its seamless and deep integration with PayPal's vast existing payment network. On the one hand, PYUSD can upgrade stablecoins from simple \"payment tools\" to \"interest-bearing assets.\" For example, by offering PYUSD holders an annualized return of approximately 3.7%, users no longer need to transfer funds back and forth between bank accounts and payment tools, making PYUSD an integrated solution for payment and savings. On the other hand, PYUSD can become a breakthrough for cross-border trade for SMEs. For the 20 million SME sellers on the PayPal platform, cross-border payments have always been a pain point. Traditional bank wire transfers are expensive and slow, while through PYUSD, US sellers can make real-time, low-cost payments to suppliers anywhere in the world. When US merchants need to pay overseas suppliers, using PYUSD avoids cumbersome currency exchange, reduces friction costs, and saves time. This path, based on real business needs, is difficult for other stablecoins to replicate. When we discuss PYUSD, we are actually discussing two completely different topics: the evolution of stablecoin technology itself and different paths to financial inclusion. PYUSD represents a top-down, compliance-first approach—making cross-border payments more efficient and cheaper by transforming existing financial infrastructure; this is an elegant path of improvement. USDT, on the other hand, represents a bottom-up, demand-driven approach—directly serving those left behind by traditional finance, providing them with the most basic financial tools; this is a crude path of revolution. These two paths are not incompatible. In the foreseeable future, we will live in two parallel worlds simultaneously: in one world, multinational corporations use PYUSD for efficient cross-border settlements; in the other world, villagers in rural Africa receive remittances from overseas relatives using USDT. The future of the stablecoin market is likely not a \"winner-takes-all\" scenario, but rather a coexistence and prosperity of niche markets. Each stablecoin will operate on its own track, serving different users and solving different problems. For example, USDT will continue to dominate the grassroots economy and emerging markets, USDC will serve as a reliable cornerstone for DeFi and institutional finance, and PYUSD will continue to deeply cultivate the fields of compliant commercial payments, cross-border trade for SMEs, and daily transaction payments. The value of PayPal issuing PYUSD lies not in whether it can replace USDT or USDC, but in truly solving the pain points of the \"compliant world\" that other stablecoins cannot reach in its own arena—not replicating the success of USDT or USDC, but paving a unique path for compliant giants, focusing on the payment track of real-world needs. The Development History of PYUSD showcases a significant attempt by a traditional financial giant to enter the cryptocurrency field. Prior to the official launch of PYUSD, PayPal had been exploring the cryptocurrency space for nearly a decade. As early as 2013, PayPal began paying attention to cryptocurrencies. By 2020, PayPal supported US users in buying and selling mainstream cryptocurrencies, laying the technological and user foundation for the launch of PYUSD. Preparations for PYUSD can be traced back to 2022. On-chain records show that its first minting test occurred in November 2022, with a total of 1.1 million PYUSD tokens. The issuance of PYUSD was not without its challenges. Its original plan to issue in partnership with FTX was terminated due to the latter's collapse, and subsequent issuance plans were suspended in early 2023 due to an investigation by the New York State Department of Financial Services into its partner, Paxos. On August 7, 2023, PayPal officially announced the launch of its stablecoin PYUSD on Ethereum. As an ERC-20 token issued on Ethereum, PYUSD can seamlessly integrate with external developers, wallets, and Web3 applications, much like a new mobile phone with a mainstream operating system, allowing immediate access to numerous app stores, greatly reducing the barrier to entry for users and integration costs for developers. Furthermore, PYUSD is **issued by Paxos Trust Company** and is committed to being 100% backed by cash equivalents such as US dollar deposits and short-term US Treasury bonds, with monthly proof-of-reserve data released regularly to ensure PYUSD's security. Following its launch, PYUSD quickly gained market attention, reaching a market capitalization of $300 million within approximately five months. It was listed on several major exchanges, including Coinbase and Kraken. The large user base and deep liquidity on these exchanges created a perfect synergy with its application within the PayPal payment network. Users could easily trade and acquire PYUSD on exchanges like Coinbase and then transfer it to their PayPal or Venmo accounts for daily payments and transfers. In August 2024, PYUSD's market capitalization surpassed $1 billion for the first time, growing at a rate far exceeding that of USDT and USDC. Its primary issuance platform shifted from Ethereum to the Solana network. Compared to Ethereum's security but slower transaction speeds and higher payment fees, Solana's advantages lie in its instant settlement, average transaction fees below 1 cent, an ecosystem of over 2,500 developers, and unique token scaling features, supporting confidential transfers, transfer pegs, and memo fields required by PYUSD. Early growth of PYUSD was primarily driven by incentives within decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems like Solana. DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is an application of blockchain technology that aims to decentralize financial services through smart contracts and distributed ledgers, providing users with greater freedom and lower transaction costs. DeFi encompasses various financial services such as lending, financing, derivatives, trading, and insurance, and has rapidly emerged globally in recent years, attracting widespread attention and discussion. According to data from Syndica_io, at the time, 81% of PYUSD on Solana was used for DeFi protocols, primarily in the Kamino Finance project. Kamino Finance is a DeFi protocol launched in 2022 that integrates lending, liquidity provision, and leverage. On Kamino, approximately 470 million PYUSD could enjoy an annualized yield of 13.24%, with depositors receiving over 1.2 million PYUSD in additional rewards each week. Furthermore, on Kamino, PYUSD borrowers paid an interest rate of 3.28%, with a utilization rate of 5.31%; while on Kamino's competitor, the lending protocol MarginFi, the interest rate was only 1.54%, with a utilization rate of 4%. These incentives significantly boosted demand in the short term, causing the circulating supply of PYUSD on the Solana chain to surpass that of its native chain, Ethereum. As of August 2024, Solana held a 64% market share, while Ethereum held 36%. However, such high incentive levels could not be sustained in the long run. After PYUSD reduced yield opportunities on major decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms such as Kamino, the market capitalization of the PYUSD stablecoin fell from a peak of $1 billion in August to $618 million, a drop of approximately 40%. Entering 2025, PYUSD's development has shown a more diversified and in-depth trend: In early 2025, PayPal began offering a 3.7% annualized return on PYUSD balances to eligible US users, transforming PYUSD from a payment tool into a yield-generating digital asset and enhancing its appeal to retail users. In February 2025, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concluded its 16-month investigation into PYUSD, which had begun in November 2023, announcing that no enforcement action would be taken. This eliminated regulatory uncertainty for PYUSD, boosted market confidence, and paved the way for its widespread future application. In April 2025, PYUSD expanded its partnership with the exchange Coinbase, which began supporting a 1:1 exchange rate between PYUSD and USD, waiving transaction fees for retail and institutional clients. Coinbase also planned to explore new on-chain use cases for PYUSD with PayPal, and further support stablecoin use by PayPal's major merchant partners. This partnership expanded the adoption, distribution, and use of PYUSD, enhancing its competitiveness. In May 2025, PayPal unveiled its new AI-based, autonomous financial operating system, Financial OS, at its 2025 Dev Days. Financial OS provides the infrastructure for digital identity, smart wallets, agent communication protocols, and implementation APIs. PayPal aims to combine the Financial OS system with PYUSD to create an AI-driven financial infrastructure, hoping that AI agents will assist humans in executing complex business processes in the future. In June 2025, PYUSD's market capitalization **returned to $1 billion**, signifying a further increase in PYUSD's market acceptance. That same month, PayPal partnered with Fiserv, a leading global payment service provider, to enable the circulation and conversion of PYUSD and FIUSD across each other's platforms and ecosystems, expanding PYUSD's use cases. In September 2025, PYUSD **further innovated its technology and expanded its ecosystem**. On one hand, PYUSD partnered with the cross-chain interoperability protocol LayerZero, expanding to nine new blockchains, including Avalanche, Aptos, and Tron, each with its own unique features, allowing users to choose freely according to their actual needs. This expansion also introduced a permissionless version called PYUSD0, which acts as a highly efficient \"cross-chain highway,\" aiming to eliminate liquidity barriers between different blockchains. This marks PYUSD's evolution from a multi-chain stablecoin to a full-chain stablecoin in terms of liquidity. On the other hand, in the Asian market, PYUSD, through a partnership with BDACS, introduced KRW1 (a stablecoin backed by the Korean Won), facilitating local remittances and payments. In the same month, PayPal partnered with the decentralized finance platform Spark to integrate PYUSD into its lending marketplace, SparkLend. This collaboration aims to expand PYUSD's on-chain liquidity from the initial $100 million to $1 billion. This partnership leverages Spark's existing $8 billion stablecoin reserve pool to provide deep liquidity for PYUSD, enabling it to quickly become an important foundational asset in the DeFi ecosystem. During its two-year development, PYUSD rapidly expanded its application boundaries through cooperation with partners in different fields. Its cooperative ecosystem can be mainly divided into the following four categories: PYUSD's Business Model Stablecoins themselves have clear profit potential. PayPal's issuance of PYUSD primarily targets the following profit models: Float Gold Yields: This is the most direct way for stablecoins to generate profit. PYUSD is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar and backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasury bonds, and similar cash equivalents. Issuers can earn interest income by managing these reserve assets (primarily invested in safe assets such as short-term U.S. Treasury bonds). For example, as a reference, its main competitor, Tether (the issuer of USDT), achieved a net profit of $1.48 billion in the first quarter of 2025. Transaction and Settlement Revenue: PYUSD is deeply integrated into PayPal's payment ecosystem. By facilitating the circulation of PYUSD within its network, PayPal can collect potential transaction fees or settlement service fees. For example, PayPal's cryptocurrency payment service has a transaction fee rate of approximately 0.99%. Exploring Profitability in the DeFi Sector: PayPal is also actively exploring the application of PYUSD in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, such as through cooperation with DeFi protocols like Spark. Typically, the DeFi world generates revenue through providing liquidity, lending, and other services, and as the underlying asset, PYUSD's issuers can indirectly benefit from this. PYUSD is primarily marketed through the following methods: **Leveraging Payment Scenarios:** PayPal, with its network of over 400 million users and 20 million merchants, naturally embeds PYUSD into high-frequency, essential trade scenarios, creating genuine demand. For example, PayPal plans to offer PYUSD as a payment option to over 20 million small and medium-sized merchants on its platform by the end of 2025, particularly for US merchants to pay overseas suppliers. Furthermore, PayPal integrates with payment service providers like Hyperwallet to help businesses use PYUSD for large payments to freelancers and contractors worldwide. **Earnings Incentives (Providing Holding Rewards)** PayPal CEO Alex Chriss has explicitly stated that existing payment methods are convenient enough for US users, and stablecoins lack sufficient incentive to use them. Early on, PYUSD attracted users by offering an annualized deposit yield of 13.24% and a borrowing rate of 3.28% within decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems like Solana, leading to rapid user growth. Currently, PayPal's incentive programs target both retail users (e.g., PYUSD will offer users a 3.7% annualized yield starting in the summer of 2025) and institutional users (e.g., PayPal is preparing to partner with Anchorage Digital to launch a rewards program for institutional holders, aiming to allow users to earn yields without staking, borrowing, or reusing assets). PayPal is also partnering with several major exchanges, including Coinbase and Kraken, leveraging their large user base and deep liquidity to promote PYUSD. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Compliance Lessons from PYUSD Practice</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For publicly traded companies like PayPal, subject to multiple regulations, **compliance with the law is a legal prerequisite for conducting business.** The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) regulations explicitly require financial institutions under its jurisdiction to establish, record, and maintain effective KYC and AML programs to prevent financial crimes; the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and global anti-money laundering initiatives also mandate compliance obligations for financial institutions. PYUSD issuers PayPal and Paxos operate globally; failure to comply with these rules would mean immediately losing their licenses and ending their operations entirely.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Simply put, **non-compliance means closure**, which is the most fundamental and direct reason for PYUSD's compliance efforts.</p> Based on meeting legal requirements, a robust compliance system gives PYUSD a **strategic advantage**, allowing it to differentiate itself in the fiercely competitive stablecoin market. On the one hand, sound compliance procedures reassure traditional users, large enterprises, and traditional financial institutions unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies; on the other hand, if PYUSD is widely used for illicit activities, PayPal and Paxos will face substantial regulatory fines, criminal charges, and reputational damage. **Adhering to compliance is the lowest-cost risk management strategy**. Seeking a Compliance Partner<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>PYUSD is a stablecoin issued through a collaborative effort between PayPal and Paxos Trust Company. PayPal, as a payment platform with a large user base, is responsible for PYUSD's application scenarios and promotion, acting as its \"driver.\" Paxos, on the other hand, is responsible for PYUSD's technical support, compliant issuance, redemption, and reserve asset management, acting as its \"engine maker and maintainer.\" This division of labor allows PYUSD to leverage both PayPal's user base and Paxos's compliance advantages.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Seeking a Compliance Partner</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">PYUSD is a stablecoin issued through a collaborative effort between PayPal and Paxos Trust Company.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"1761923976251031642.jpg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410538_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>What are KYC and AML?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">PYUSD has not made any explicit disclosures regarding its KYC and AML practices. However, since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched an investigation into PYUSD in November 2023, Paxos actively cooperated with the regulatory investigation. By February 2025, the SEC had concluded its 16-month investigation into PYUSD without taking any enforcement action, proving that it complies with regulatory standards. This cleared up regulatory uncertainty for PYUSD, enhanced market confidence, and paved the way for its widespread future application.</p> ... Returning to the stablecoin minting and burning incident mentioned at the beginning of the article, it exposed the inherent technical governance and internal control risks of centralized stablecoins. While fiat currency reserves and regular audits are important, they cannot eliminate these risks. However, does this mean stablecoins are not secure in transactions? This incident actually demonstrates the transparency advantage of blockchain technology. Upon discovering the anomaly, Paxos immediately activated its emergency mechanism, burning and recovering all misminted tokens within 22 minutes, ensuring the total supply returned to normal levels. Compared to errors that may be hidden for a long time in traditional finance, blockchain errors are easier to detect and correct. In this sense, given the regulatory framework and the transparency of the blockchain, PYUSD may be safer and more trustworthy. Future stablecoin issuances must reconsider how to maintain rapid intervention capabilities (centralization) while minimizing the probability of human error (decentralization/automation). For example, at the technical level, outlier detection and time-based locking can be implemented. Outlier detection mechanisms can be embedded in smart contracts; for instance, any single transaction exceeding a certain threshold (e.g., 10%) of the total reserve must initiate a cooling-off period of one hour or be automatically suspended by the system, awaiting manual approval. At the internal control level, multi-signature should be mandatory. Minting/burning operations must employ a strict multi-signature mechanism, requiring at least three senior executives with different functional backgrounds (e.g., technology, finance, compliance) to jointly approve and sign, ensuring the verification of input parameters. Conclusion Looking back at the development of PYUSD, we can see a clear strategic path: not pursuing direct competition with USDT and USDC in the trading arena, but rather focusing on payment scenarios, especially cross-border business payments. PYUSD may never be able to replicate USDT's dominant position in cryptocurrency trading, nor does it need to. It is pioneering a new path connecting traditional commerce with the digital asset world—a more compliant path, more focused on real business needs, and more acceptable to the mainstream market. Centralization and decentralization are not opposites, but rather alternative tools. For ordinary users and small businesses, reliable, easy-to-use, and compliant payment tools are sometimes more practical than idealized decentralization. The story of PYUSD is far from over; it represents a possible integration of traditional finance and the crypto world—not disruption or replacement, but rather fusion and gradual progress.</div></div>",

            "title": "From Bitcoin to Ethereum: The Current State of Decentralized Development",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div>A while ago (around October 20th, Eastern Time), Amazon Web Services experienced a widespread outage, severely impacting many blockchain systems in the crypto ecosystem, including Ethereum. Data shows that approximately 37% of Ethereum's mainnet nodes are hosted on Amazon Web Services, making these nodes vulnerable to the outage. The offline status of these nodes also hampered the performance of the Ethereum mainnet. Consequently, many online voices began to claim that \"Ethereum's decentralization is fake.\" Such events and their potential consequences were frequently discussed in the early days of the crypto ecosystem. I remember reading many articles on this topic when I first entered the crypto world. Back then, pioneers had already provided clear explanations of these issues, so such discussions didn't usually elicit such widespread agreement. Time has passed, and perhaps the pioneers of yesteryear have left the ecosystem, or perhaps they are no longer willing to waste their breath on such topics (as Satoshi Nakamoto said, those who understand, understand; those who don't, he doesn't have time to convince others). Now, when this situation arises, I see virtually no detailed feedback or response online regarding such agreement. Over the years, many new forces have entered this ecosystem. They are not as fortunate as I was back then, unable to understand the explanations of those pioneers on this issue. I don't want these new forces to be misled by such agreement, so in this article, I will do my best to share my understanding and views on this issue. First, the general viewpoint: - Whether it's Bitcoin or Ethereum, their greatness lies in designing a disruptive mechanism. This mechanism avoids the fatal single point of failure in traditional centralized systems. It also ensures that even if nodes in the system are subjected to a large-scale attack, the system will only experience performance degradation, not crash. The \"decentralization\" we are discussing does not guarantee that nodes themselves are not hijacked or controlled by centralization, but rather focuses on ensuring that the system does not crash even if nodes are hijacked and controlled by centralization, or even used to attack the system. Such a system can be considered free from centralized control, achieving technological neutrality and trust neutrality. To achieve the most ideal level of decentralization, nodes need to avoid being controlled or interfered with by centralization as much as possible. However, such decentralization does not fall from the sky automatically; it is never perfect and always requires continuous improvement and effort from generations of participants. Bitcoin must follow this path, and Ethereum must follow the same path. To some extent, Ethereum needs to work harder and improve in this area, because Bitcoin has already made significant progress in this regard. In a sense, the responsibility for the decentralization of the entire crypto ecosystem largely rests on Ethereum's shoulders. To understand this, let's start with the history of Bitcoin. In 2009, shortly after Bitcoin's launch, Madhi, a Finnish university student later considered one of Bitcoin's pioneers, eagerly asked Satoshi Nakamoto: What could he do for Bitcoin? Nakamoto's reply was straightforward (in essence): Run Bitcoin. What did Nakamoto mean? He meant that for the nascent Bitcoin, survival was paramount, and to survive, as many people as possible needed to run Bitcoin clients. The more people running Bitcoin clients, the more decentralized Bitcoin became. The more decentralized Bitcoin is, the stronger it becomes. At that time, Bitcoin had too few nodes and was too easily hijacked. If some force were to suddenly hack the few existing Bitcoin clients and delete the Bitcoin source code, Bitcoin would be immediately killed. Those who were watching the joke had every reason to say, \"Bitcoin's decentralization is fake.\" However, the birth of Bitcoin created a mechanism that made decentralization possible—a disruptive change from 0 to 1. However, this \"possibility of decentralization\" was still precarious. Therefore, Satoshi Nakamoto urgently hoped that more people would run Bitcoin so that it could flourish as soon as possible. In 2010, after WikiLeaks exposed the US diplomatic incident, the Bitcoin community called for using Bitcoin donations to break financial blockades, which Satoshi Nakamoto strongly opposed. His reasoning is simple: the number of Bitcoin nodes, still in their infancy, is very small, and the entire system could still be completely hijacked. In this situation, if Bitcoin is drawn into a political conflict, its fate could be dire. If the US government were to use its national power to attack Bitcoin at this time, Bitcoin could very well be destroyed. Those who are watching the spectacle could easily say, \"Bitcoin's decentralization is fake.\" However, Bitcoin at this point is much stronger than it was in 2009. Even if the US government uses its national power, attacking it would become much more difficult. Bitcoin has gradually evolved from 1 to 10, and decentralization has begun to grow stronger. This \"strength\" didn't fall from the sky; it was built by the efforts of participants in the community, inspired by Bitcoin's ingenious mechanisms, and is the result of the selfless dedication and hard work of a large number of Bitcoin pioneers. In 2017, Blockstream launched Bitcoin in space, on a satellite. Bitcoin went from Earth to space. It's no exaggeration to say that even if the internet on Earth were destroyed, Bitcoin could still run on a satellite in space. At that point, it would be extremely difficult for any force in the world to completely destroy Bitcoin. And today, Bitcoin's robustness is even more evident. All of this is the achievement of generations of community members through continuous effort and innovation. Without the tireless efforts of these individuals, Bitcoin could have been easily destroyed at any point, and those who were gloating could have said, \"Bitcoin's decentralization is fake.\" This is true for Bitcoin, and it's also true for Ethereum. Ethereum's efforts are focused on continuously improving and refining its mechanisms, ensuring that it can function normally even when some nodes are controlled by centralized institutions (this is part of the definition of a consensus mechanism), but it cannot guarantee that the nodes themselves will not be controlled by centralized entities. Returning to the problem Ethereum encountered this time, I would view it as follows: Amazon controlled 37% of Ethereum's nodes and used this to launch an attack on Ethereum (paralyzing these nodes). Did Ethereum crash under this attack? If Ethereum crashed, then there is a real problem, and decentralization is fake. If not, it proves that Ethereum's decentralization is effective, although the effect is not ideal and there is still much room for improvement. On the contrary, the other systems that crashed in this attack fully exposed their own \"centralization\" problems—they were centrally controlled, and once a problem occurred, the consequences were what we saw. From another perspective, this further proves the importance of decentralization. In this incident, 37% of Ethereum nodes were controlled by \"centralized institutions,\" indicating that the operation and maintenance of Ethereum nodes is not decentralized enough. How to solve this problem? The Bitcoin community already has classic examples: Maddie contributed an extra node to Bitcoin, and Blockstream ran a Bitcoin node in space. They are all doing their best to contribute to Bitcoin's decentralization. Without them, Bitcoin would not have the brilliance and achievements it has today. Similarly, the decentralization of Ethereum nodes also requires community effort. For example, avoid relying solely on a single cloud service; instead, try using private server systems to run nodes. Although many node operators, for commercial reasons, are reluctant to leave Amazon due to its superior service and experience, I believe this incident will prompt them to be more vigilant and make significant improvements. Of course, the best solution is to hope that one day the crypto ecosystem will have a decentralized cloud that surpasses Amazon. This is precisely the direction the crypto ecosystem has been striving for. Ethereum's decentralization is not a sham. It effectively withstood Amazon's \"attack,\" but it is not perfect and needs further improvement. This requires the efforts of the entire community and a genuine belief in the fundamental value of \"decentralization.\"</div></div>",

According to CNN, three officials familiar with the matter revealed that the Pentagon has assessed that supplying long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine would not weaken the US military's existing stockpile, and has therefore given the green light to the White House, leaving the final political decision to President Trump. Earlier this month, Trump made it clear during a working lunch with Ukrainian President Zelensky that he was unwilling to provide the missiles, stating that \"we cannot give up the weapons stockpile we need to defend our country.\" The Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted its assessment report to the White House earlier this month, just as Zelensky was continuing to lobby for the acquisition of the missiles—Ukraine hopes to use their approximately 1,600-kilometer range to more effectively strike deep energy facilities within Russia. Two European officials pointed out that this assessment has encouraged European allies, who believe that the US now lacks a legitimate reason to refuse to provide the missiles. It is worth noting that just days before meeting Zelensky, Trump publicly stated that the US \"possesses a large number of Tomahawk missiles that can be supplied to Ukraine.\" The US Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Federal Reserve's ruling, rejecting Custodia's request for a master account. According to crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett, the US Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled in the Custodia v.

Trump denies having decided to launch a military strike against Venezuela, contradicting media reports that he had approved the attack. When asked by reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday whether a decision had been made, Trump briefly replied, \"No.\" The Miami Herald had earlier reported that the Trump administration had decided to attack military facilities in Venezuela, and that the strike could begin at any time. When asked about the report, White House Press Secretary Anna Kelly stated that \"anonymous sources have no idea what happened\" and emphasized that any official statement would be released by the president himself.

Speaking at an event hosted by the Dallas Fed, she noted profound changes in the money market structure, indicating a shift from the current federal funds rate target to other interest rate indicators. \"I think it's time to explore more broadly how to best implement monetary policy,\" Hamack emphasized in her remarks. This statement echoes her recent consensus with Dallas Fed President Logan that financial market pricing mechanisms have gradually moved away from the traditional anchoring effect of the federal funds rate. Spot gold fell $50.29, or 1.25%, during the day, currently trading at $3974.27 per ounce, a drop of 1.25%.

Google's Willow chip marks a new era in quantum performance, enabling complex calculations and having a significant impact on various industries, including cryptography. With the launch of Google's 105-qubit Willow chip, built on the company's Sycamore processor, quantum computing has reached a major milestone. Willow nearly doubles the number of qubits in Sycamore, unlocking the ability to handle exponentially more complex computations. One of Willow's most significant advancements is its progress in quantum error correction, a crucial step towards scalable, fault-tolerant quantum systems. In benchmarks such as random circuit sampling (a test of a quantum computer's ability to solve complex problems), Willow completed tasks in minutes that would take conventional supercomputers billions of years. Quantum computers using algorithms like Shor and Grover have the potential to solve complex problems exponentially faster, potentially breaking traditional cryptographic algorithms. The rollout of powerful quantum computers like Willow has raised concerns about their impact on cryptographic security, including the impact of the Willow chip on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and many other blockchain systems rely on cryptographic algorithms designed to resist classical attacks. However, the potential impact of quantum computing on cryptographic security has raised concerns. Google's Willow quantum chip currently does not pose a direct threat to Bitcoin's cryptographic system. Cracking Bitcoin's ECDSA or SHA-256 encryption would require at least 1,500-3,000 fault-tolerant logical qubits, far exceeding Willow's capabilities. The scalability of current quantum systems is insufficient to challenge Bitcoin's robust defenses. Bitcoin's layered cryptographic structure, combining ECDSA and SHA-256, ensures resistance to today's quantum technologies. This technological gap currently guarantees the security of Bitcoin's cryptographic protections.</p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Lacie, Bitget Wallet Researcher</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">I. Introduction: The \"Payment Gap\" Between Web2 and Web3</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The current digital ecosystem is being torn apart by the inherent conflict between Web2 and Web3. On the one hand, Web2's convenient payments (such as Apple Pay and WeChat Pay) are firmly locked within a \"walled garden\" by centralized platforms and geographical boundaries; on the other hand, while Web3 promises a globally open, permissionless financial future, it has become a \"technological island\" that deters mainstream users due to its drastic price fluctuations and complex user experience.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The gap between \"convenience\" and \"openness\" has long burdened Web3 with the labels of \"difficult to implement\" and \"speculative hype.\" Against this backdrop, an open protocol called x402 has come into view.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Its proposed solution is quite innovative: instead of starting from scratch, it attempts to revitalize a dormant internet underlying standard—HTTP 402 (Payment Required)—that has been dormant for 26 years. [Image: x402 official website homepage introduction image] [Source: x402 official website (https://www.x402.org/)] Can this \"reactivation\" of the internet's underlying protocol standard be the key to bridging the aforementioned gap? Does it foreshadow the birth of a native, open Web payment layer, fundamentally reshaping the way value flows on the internet? Bitget Wallet will provide an in-depth analysis of this topic in this article. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">II. A Belated Breakout: What is x402, and why is it only now gaining popularity?</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">x402 is an open protocol developed and open-sourced by Coinbase in May 2025. Its core goal is to activate the long-unused HTTP 402 status code, transforming it into an internet-native, permissionless payment mechanism, ultimately establishing a channel between Web2 applications and Web3 value networks.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, an interesting phenomenon is that although the x402 protocol was launched as early as May, it only suddenly became popular after five months of silence. In fact, the 402 status code itself is not a \"new invention\" in the crypto world, but rather a reserved code in the HTTP protocol from the 1990s.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> So why has an \"old standard\" and a \"not-so-new\" protocol only recently sparked heated discussions in the market? The table below outlines the key timelines from the birth of x402 to its explosive popularity, which helps us understand the facts behind this \"delayed explosion\". </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/842-1761898283158.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Table: Timeline of the Birth and Application of x402 (as of October 28, 2025)</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Data Source: Bitget Wallet, compiled from publicly available data (transaction data from x402scan)</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As shown in the timeline above, the evolution of x402 reveals the following key facts:</p><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">First, x402 is based on the HTTP 402 of 1999.</p></li><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/842-1761898313521.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Table: Summary Table of HTTP Status Codes</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Data Source: Compiled by Bitget Wallet</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In this vast codebase, the 402 (Payment Required) status code stands out. From its inception, it envisioned a protocol-native micropayment method, aiming for instant payments that were \"seamlessly integrated, like loading an image\"—without intermediaries or delays. However, as the internet economy shifted towards advertising, platforms, and complex credit card forms, the concept of the 402 status code was shelved, and the standard has never been widely adopted.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/842-1761898376215.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Figure: Comparison of existing intelligent agent payment process and x402 per-use charging</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Data source: x402 White Paper</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The deeper significance lies in the fact that x402 allows a single HTTP request to simultaneously possess the dual attributes of \"data transmission\" and \"value transmission.\" This truly integrates the dimension of \"value\" into the information protocol at the very beginning of the Internet, and at the application level, it has the potential to truly revolutionize the traditional WEB system that has been used for more than 20 years.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/842-1761898376215.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> At the same time, this may answer a long-standing pain point for Web3: how can the crypto world empower entities and change the world? For a long time, the crypto world has been criticized for lacking truly mainstream applications, and x402 may become such a singularity—it's not starting from scratch, but rather attempting to \"inject\" Web3's value settlement capabilities into the vast Web2 ecosystem, becoming a true bridge connecting the two worlds—this is the underlying logic behind the protocol's widespread popularity and discussion. However, behind this optimistic vision, the challenges facing x402 cannot be ignored. First, there are concerns from within the HTTP protocol itself. HTTP 402 is still a \"non-standardized\" reserved code. As shown in MDN Web Docs (the developer documentation repository), it is defined as \"reserved but undefined.\" This means it has not been fully accepted by mainstream Web standards and has compatibility issues with underlying protocols. Therefore, the current implementation of x402 largely relies on \"custom HTTP headers\" like X-PAYMENT, rather than the true standard 402 status code, casting a shadow over its long-term standardization. [Image: HTTP 402 status code has been pointed out for compatibility issues by the developer documentation library] Secondly, the subsequent attitudes of many traditional internet giants remain to be seen. Despite giants like Google announcing their adoption of the protocol within the AI ​​framework, x402's advocacy of \"bypassing platforms and peer-to-peer payments\" essentially stands in opposition to the internet giants who currently profit from \"walled gardens\" and payment commission models. The combination of x402 and AI Agents is more like a \"declaration of war\" on the traditional internet ecosystem—whether the giants genuinely accept it or merely use it temporarily remains to be seen. Finally, and most alarmingly, is the potential backlash from the speculative bubble. Since the x402 protocol itself hasn't issued any tokens, all tokens currently associated with it (such as PING) are experimental projects called memes. While the meme craze has objectively boosted x402's popularity, it also raises serious questions: will this movement fall into a false prosperity of \"speculative narratives,\" ultimately undermining genuine technological ideals when the bubble bursts? This is a persistent dilemma the crypto world struggles to escape. (The image below shows the x402 ecosystem map)</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/842-1761898413569.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Figure: x402 Ecosystem Overview</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Source: X @henloitsjoyce</em></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">VI. Conclusion: Beyond the Noise, What is the Value?</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">x402 provides an extremely pragmatic solution for AI Agent payments—it doesn't require users to abandon their existing internet, but rather attempts to complete the key upgrade of \"payment\" at the most basic protocol level.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">x402 provides an extremely pragmatic solution for AI Agent payments—it doesn't require users to abandon their existing internet, but rather attempts to complete the key upgrade of \"payment\" at the most basic protocol level.</p></ul></div></div>",

When asked about the matter, Treasury Mint nominee Paul Hollis stated that he is \"100% committed to always complying with the law.\" </p><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"></ol><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">DeFi Hot Topics</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>1.

Some traders believe that this high may have marked the top of Bitcoin's current cycle.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Bitcoin's technical indicators suggest a \"top has appeared.\"</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A cryptocurrency analyst stated that Bitcoin's price action appears to have confirmed a \"MACD bearish crossover,\" which, combined with historical trends, could signify the end of the Bitcoin bull market.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Bitcoin's technical indicators suggest a \"top has appeared.\"</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A cryptocurrency analyst stated that Bitcoin's price action appears to have confirmed a \"MACD bearish crossover,\" which, combined with historical trends, could mean the end of the Bitcoin bull market.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Analyst Jesse Olson posted on the X platform on Wednesday, stating, \"A bearish MACD crossover is about to form on the three-week Bitcoin chart,\" adding, \"The histogram also shows a long-term bearish divergence.\" As shown in the chart below, the bearish crossover pattern is confirmed when the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD, blue curve)—a technical indicator traders use to identify trend changes and momentum shifts—breaks below the signal line (orange curve). It's worth noting that the last two times the MACD issued such a bearish signal, it occurred at the peak of the 2017 and 2021 bull market cycles, both indicating a peak in Bitcoin's price. A bearish engulfing pattern also appeared on the same three-week chart, similar to patterns observed at the peaks of the 2017 and 2021 bull markets. Jesse Olson stated in another blog post on Thursday that these signals, along with \"several other warning signs,\" suggest a top has been reached. Other signals include declining network activity, indicating reduced on-chain demand. Nansen data shows that the number of daily active addresses on the Bitcoin network dropped from 632,915 to 447,225 in October, a decrease of 30%. A decrease in daily active addresses indicates reduced network participation and weakened user demand, which is often a precursor to price corrections or prolonged consolidation. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Bitcoin Cycle Top Approaching</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Anonymous trader and investor Mister Crypto supports the \"cycle top theory,\" arguing that based on Bitcoin's quadrennial halving cycle, it is currently at a \"historically typical peak point.\"</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Looking back at the Bitcoin halving cycles of 2012 and 2016, a similar trend exists: prices gradually accumulate momentum, typically peaking within 518 to 580 days after the halving event (as shown in the chart below).</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">558 days have passed since the 2024 Bitcoin halving, meaning the current Bitcoin market is within ±40 days of the historical peak window (518-580 days).</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Mister Crypto posted on the X platform, stating, \"We are currently near a period when Bitcoin typically peaks,\" and then asked rhetorically, \"Will this time be an exception?\" Analyst CryptoBird also stated that, following historical patterns of halving cycles, the current Bitcoin price surge may only last a few days. In his latest Bitcoin analysis, CryptoBird pointed out that Bitcoin is \"consolidating before a breakout, and the top window has opened.\" As Cointelegraph previously reported, analysts such as former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes believe that the four-year Bitcoin cycle has become ineffective, and the current price is driven more by monetary policy and liquidity than by the halving event. Another view holds that the impact of the halving event is gradually weakening. They suggest that the current period is one of rising interest rates, with institutions gradually entering the market through ETFs and Bitcoin treasury companies, and Bitcoin's maturity as a mainstream asset is constantly increasing. These factors may drive Bitcoin to see more upside potential in 2026. Has Bitcoin's upside potential truly run out? Besides the view that the four-year Bitcoin cycle no longer determines the duration of a bull market, some analysts believe, based on technical indicators, that Bitcoin still has room to rise. Analyst Jelle, referring to Bitcoin's daily price chart, stated that Bitcoin \"has formed higher lows and the trading range remains intact,\" and that \"if it recovers the $116,000 level, the upward trend will resume.\" Analyst Mags pointed out that Bitcoin is currently in a \"bullish megaphone pattern,\" which historically often leads to a breakout, suggesting \"a significant breakout is imminent.\" As Cointelegraph reports, Bitcoin's Meyer multiples indicate that the current price level remains near \"oversold\" territory, meaning the $180,000 target price is still achievable.</p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Eleanor Terrett Translator: Shan Ouba, Jinse Finance</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Following the submission of a revised S-1 filing last Friday, Canary Capital's XRP spot ETF is poised to become the next cryptocurrency fund to list on Wall Street.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On October 24, the filing was quietly amended, removing the delay clause that granted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the power to determine the effective date of registration. If Nasdaq approves the crucial Form 8-A to allow its listing, this would clear the way for the ETF's potential November 13 launch.</p> This operation follows the legal mechanism used by Bitwise and Canary this week when they launched the Solana, Hedera, and Litecoin ETFs—relying on the 20-day statutory waiting period stipulated in Section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933: unless the SEC declares the registration effective in advance, the registration statement will automatically become effective 20 days after submission. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has expressed support for this approach, praising a company called MapLight, which went public during the government shutdown using the automatic effective mechanism. Tuesday's ETF launch broke with the tradition of all cryptocurrency ETFs starting trading on the same day, regardless of the submission date, during the Gensler era. Subsequently, with the government shutdown and the SEC operating at a limited pace, other issuers rushed to update their S-1 filings to bring their products to market. Fidelity, VanEck, and Canary all updated their Solana ETF registration documents this week, removing the delay amendment clauses and planning to launch in mid-November after obtaining exchange approval. If Canary's XRP ETF launches as scheduled on November 13th, the company will once again gain a first-mover advantage in the XRP ETF market—currently, other issuers that have also submitted XRP ETF applications, such as Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and Grayscale, have not yet updated their documents. It is worth noting that the resumption of government operations may affect Canary's target launch date. ETF experts say that if the SEC resumes operations early and the documents meet all requirements, the launch date may be earlier; however, if staff return to work before the 13th and provide additional feedback, the launch may be delayed. <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Market Structure Bill Progressing</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As the saying goes, teamwork makes dreams come true, and this is exactly what's happening on Capitol Hill in the US—pro-crypto Republicans and Democrats are more determined than ever to complete the review process for the cryptocurrency market structure bill before Thanksgiving.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Last week, industry figures and lawmakers held multiple roundtables to mend the differences caused by the leak of decentralized finance (DeFi) regulatory proposals and get back on track with the legislation. Furthermore, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) and David Sacks, Trump's appointee as head of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, both expressed their encouragement, and these efforts appear to be yielding results.</p> Staff-level negotiations on the Senate Banking Committee are accelerating; meanwhile, on the Senate Agriculture Committee, the text of a bipartisan bill jointly drafted by Senators John Boozman (Republican, Arkansas) and Cory Booker (Democrat, New Jersey) is reportedly nearing completion and could be released as early as today, although final negotiations may delay the release until next week. Multiple sources within Capitol Hill and industry insiders told Crypto In America that both parties are currently highly focused on getting the bipartisan bill through both house committees before Thanksgiving and then to the full Senate for a vote.</div></div>",

narrative amplification and harvesting effect?</span> ... Essentially, the significant volatility of these cryptocurrencies after their listing stems from two main factors: firstly, direct manipulation by market makers and project teams; and secondly, the Alpha platform narrative accelerating retail investor entry, providing market makers with a broader \"hunting ground,\" evolving into a standardized script that allows for faster replication and more ruthless exits. This may also reveal one of Binance's design intentions for Alpha: to attract speculators with its low circulating supply and high volatility. After all, someone is always willing to pay for volatility—some come for the profit, some stay for short-term gains, and ultimately, some pay the price for the volatility. Besides highly controlled cryptocurrencies like MYX, AIA, and COAI, the platform has also seen numerous irregularities: some projects went to zero or crashed immediately after launch, while others were involved in false narratives or code plagiarism. Overall, the platform's motivation to attract speculative funds far outweighs its motivation to incubate projects. To put it another way, the emergence of Alpha was not inherently sinful; it was merely a highly volatile experimental field focusing on early new products. However, when narrative, structure, and human nature are superimposed, volatility becomes a harvesting machine. According to CoinMarketCap data, Binance Alpha's 24-hour trading volume exceeds $8 billion, far surpassing many small and medium-sized cryptocurrency exchanges, illustrating this \"wild growth.\" This is not accidental, but rather a product of the combined effects of capital and traffic. In conclusion, on one hand, market manipulators and project teams are using the high volatility of Alpha platforms to create a safe exit channel; on the other hand, retail investors remain obsessed with the fantasy of the next \"100x coin.\" Greed and fear intertwine—such is human nature. Instead of blindly chasing the next COAI, it's better to consider where you stand in this game.</strong></p></div></div>",

As panic withdrawals surged into the billions, he claims FTX was in the process of selling assets, securing financing, and even preparing to resume withdrawals before the plug was pulled.</p><p></p><div class=\"media-wrap embed-wrap\"><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">[SBF says:]<br/><br/>This is where the money went. <a href=\"https://t.co/HVRwEw5Z1k\">https://t.co/HVRwEw5Z1k</a><a href=\"https://t.co/5DrA13L5YE\">https://t.co/5DrA13L5YE</a><a href=\"https://t.co/O6q77DvmTn\">pic.twitter.com/O6q77DvmTn</a></p>— SBF (@SBF_FTX) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1984091090795032939?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 31, 2025</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></div></div><p></p><p>He argues that both FTX and its sister company Alameda Research had assets exceeding liabilities through most of 2022 — and even at the point of bankruptcy, internal records allegedly showed a balance sheet that was roughly neutral or positive.</p><p></p><p>But SBF’s defense goes further: he blames the bankruptcy process itself for destroying value. According to him, decisions made by the appointed administrators—including “poorly timed” asset sales—cost creditors billions in potential recovery.</p><p></p><h1>The Missed Windfall Argument</h1><p>SBF and his team highlight what they see as the ultimate proof of their claim: the soaring value of several key assets FTX once held. Tokens like Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI), along with a private stake in Anthropic, have all skyrocketed since being liquidated by the estate.</p><p></p><div class=\"media-wrap embed-wrap\"><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Drop your <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Solana?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Solana</a> address 👇<br/><br/>I will send you $9999 in 24h❤<br/>(Yes for real )<br/><br/>RT and Follow🔥 <a href=\"https://t.co/WmZFOohSij\">pic.twitter.com/WmZFOohSij</a></p>— Crypto Emperor (@Cryptoemperor06) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cryptoemperor06/status/1984196954591842426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 31, 2025</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></div></div><p></p><p>In his telling, if FTX’s management had been left in place and allowed to wait out the market downturn, customers could have been repaid directly in crypto — and would now be sitting on enormous gains. Instead, because repayments are being made in U.S. dollar equivalents based on 2022 prices, SBF argues customers were denied the upside of the recent crypto bull run.</p><p></p><p>It’s a bold argument — one that positions him not as a fraudster, but as a misunderstood founder caught in a panic spiral.</p><p></p><h1>A Story That’s Hard to Believe</h1><p>Still, SBF’s narrative has glaring holes. The same bankruptcy investigation he criticizes uncovered massive intercompany loans, commingled funds, and billions in customer deposits diverted to Alameda — facts that severely undermine his “bank run” framing.</p><p></p><div class=\"media-wrap embed-wrap\"><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">In a stetement released through his X account, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SBF_FTX</a> released a report claiming that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FTX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FTX</a> was never insolvent.<br/><br/>The report claims that 98% of creditors have been paid 120% repayments already.<br/><br/>Could we also see SBF pardoned? 🤔 <a href=\"https://t.co/5Ttte6WlN3\">pic.twitter.com/5Ttte6WlN3</a></p>— Rand (@cryptorand) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cryptorand/status/1984197403394633974?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 31, 2025</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></div></div><p></p><p>While it’s true that creditors are now on track to receive near-total repayment, that’s largely thanks to the bankruptcy team’s asset recovery and litigation wins, not SBF’s foresight. The “liquidity crunch” he describes was, in reality, a symptom of FTX’s structural misuse of funds.</p><p></p><p>Even if the numbers technically balanced at moments in time, the way they were managed — and who had access to them — remains the core issue.</p><p></p><h1>A Redemption Attempt or Reputation Play?</h1><p>Bankman-Fried, now serving a 25-year prison sentence for fraud and money laundering, is clearly attempting to reshape his legacy. His latest claims seem designed to position him as a fallen visionary rather than a criminal mastermind.</p><p></p><p>But while his arguments make for an intriguing thought experiment — what if FTX had simply been given more time? — the broader crypto community remains skeptical. After all, solvency isn’t just about assets exceeding liabilities on paper; it’s about trust, transparency, and responsible control of customer funds — all things FTX catastrophically lacked.</p><p></p><p>There’s no denying the irony here: FTX’s creditors are getting back more than they lost, a rarity in crypto collapses. But to frame that outcome as proof that the company was “never insolvent” misses the point. The returns stem from a booming market and diligent recovery efforts — not from the integrity of FTX’s internal systems.</p><p></p><p>If anything, this saga proves that crypto institutions must be built on transparency, not charisma or complexity. Bankman-Fried may be trying to reclaim the narrative, but numbers alone can’t rewrite history.</p></div></div>",
