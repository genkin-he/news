            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">A funny thing is that this afternoon, the most frequent questions I received weren't about the US-China negotiations, but about this news from a certain financial media outlet:</span><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Starting December 1st, all principal payments on maturing US Treasury bonds will be rolled over.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span leaf=\"\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410214_image3.png\" type=\"block\"/></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">1. What does this mean?</span></span></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Answer: It means stopping the quantitative tightening. The FOMC announced this this morning. No new information.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\"> This is a minor translation error. The original text is \"beginning in December 2025, to roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities.\" In Chinese, \"rollover\" can refer to both a creditor's proactive renewal of maturing loans (continuing to lend money to the debtor after maturity) and a debtor's debt restructuring or extension of repayment periods. The two meanings are completely opposite. Here, \"rollover\" refers to the former. Because the Federal Reserve's balance sheet reduction method is \"not renewing maturing Treasury securities,\" not reducing the balance sheet means the Federal Reserve \"automatically renewing maturing Treasury securities.\" 2. How does the Federal Reserve actually \"stop reducing its balance sheet\"? For US Treasury bonds, this means re-auctioning upon maturity. In practice, the Federal Reserve will repurchase the equivalent principal amount of maturing US Treasury bonds in this month's Treasury bond auction using a non-competitive method; this is called \"add-on.\" Regarding Agency MBS, Powell clearly stated today that the proceeds from maturing MBS will be reinvested in short-term debt (Tbills). The ultimate goals are: 1) The Federal Reserve will only hold US Treasury bonds and not MBS; 2) The average duration of the US Treasury bonds held by the Federal Reserve (approximately 9 years) will gradually converge with the average duration of the outstanding US Treasury bonds in the market (approximately 6 years). 3. What asset implications does stopping balance sheet reduction have? For major asset classes, it's negligible. Those who truly need to care about the pace of balance sheet reduction are money market and derivatives market players, such as money market fund managers or traders doing FF-SOFR spreads or swap spreads. For 99% of investors, whether the Fed stops reducing its balance sheet, and where it stops, is purely redundant information. This is because the pace of balance sheet reduction primarily affects overnight interbank lending rates; even in the event of a brief liquidity crunch, its impact on major asset prices is almost zero. A case in point is the liquidity crunch of September 17, 2019. SOFR rates surged to around 5%, but US stocks and bonds showed almost no reaction. </span></span></p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Becca Bratcher, Forbes &amp; Translation: Saoirse, Foresight News</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">From multi-billion dollar hacks to a presidential-level Meme coin launch, 2025 has been a year of thorny entanglements with politics and power, both fraught with anxiety and highly revealing for the cryptocurrency space. As the fourth quarter of 2025 unfolds, five moments stand out—profoundly demonstrating how the cryptocurrency industry continues to test the boundaries of public trust and regulatory tolerance.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/842-1761792989918?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Bitcoin hit a new all-time high in 2025, but the industry remains deeply mired in controversy.</em></p> (Image illustration: Miguel Candela / SOPA Images/LightRocket, courtesy of Getty Images) January: Trump's Meme Coin Makes its Debut At the start of 2025, an unexpected move by the US president-elect drew attention. Just hours before his inauguration, Donald Trump launched his official Meme coin, TRUMP. The token initially sold for around $1, briefly surging to over $70 before plummeting. Shortly after, First Lady Melania Trump launched her own token, MELANIA, whose price fluctuations mirrored those of TRUMP. Currently, TRUMP is trading around $7, while MELANIA hovers around $0.13. These tokens were marketed as \"celebrated digital collectibles,\" but their launch immediately sparked questions about their ethics and legality. Previously dismissive of cryptocurrencies, Trump has now repositioned himself as an industry \"supporter\"—actively courting the growing voter base in the cryptocurrency space and promising to make the US a global digital asset hub. Meanwhile, his family business, World Liberty Financial, has expanded its cryptocurrency operations. Within hours, the combined market capitalization of these two Meme coins approached $11 billion, turning what was initially a simple political branding campaign into the first major controversy in the cryptocurrency industry in 2025. February: The Largest Financial Theft in History. Just one month later, public trust in the security of cryptocurrencies suffered a severe blow. Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit disclosed that hackers stole approximately $1.5 billion worth of ETH from one of its offline cold wallets. This unprecedented security breach panicked investors, and blockchain analytics firm Elliptic subsequently confirmed that it was the largest single theft on record in both digital and traditional finance. Subsequent investigations revealed that the data breach was linked to a hacking group supported by the North Korean government. This discovery instantly added geopolitical seriousness to what might have been categorized as a \"regular exchange security vulnerability.\" In May: US President Rewards Top TRUMP Meme Coin Buyers. In May, news triggered a \"small but significant\" surge in TRUMP Meme coin trading volume—President Trump announced that he would only invite top holders of TRUMP tokens to a formal dinner at his private golf club. This \"exclusive paid participation\" model effectively turned the token into a \"bidding tool\": anyone holding a sufficient number of tokens could gain the opportunity for private contact with the president. Among the dinner attendees was Tron founder Justin Sun, who had previously invested over $18 million in TRUMP tokens and faced charges from the US SEC (later suspended). This event sparked a double controversy: protesters rallied outside the venue, while inside it was under close scrutiny from the US Congress. Although the White House insisted that Trump's assets were under \"blind trust management\" (i.e., assets were managed by a third party without his direct intervention), on-chain blockchain analysis showed that entities associated with Trump controlled approximately 80% of the remaining supply of the token and had earned over $320 million in transaction fees through token trading. US Representatives Adam Smith and Sean Casten, along with 35 other House Democrats, wrote to the Department of Justice requesting an investigation into Trump's actions: whether offering \"dinner\" opportunities to top Trump token investors constituted bribery or violated the \"Foreign Remuneration Clause\" of the US Constitution (which prohibits federal officials from accepting unauthorized remuneration from foreign governments or individuals). In their letter, they pointed out that this incident \"opened the door for foreign interference in U.S. policy decisions, could constitute corruption, and is suspected of violating pay clauses. This is just the latest example of President Trump's disregard for ethical standards, exacerbation of conflicts of interest, and abuse of power for personal gain.\" October: The \"10/11\" Incident Fast forward to October: Blockchain analysts discovered that an anonymous trader suddenly shorted Bitcoin and Ethereum minutes before President Trump announced new tariffs on China. Trump's tariff announcement directly triggered the largest \"liquidation waterfall\" in cryptocurrency history (i.e., a large number of leveraged positions were forcibly liquidated due to a price crash, further exacerbating the price decline). It was reported that before the market stabilized, this anonymous trader had already profited $160 million. Observers, including the commentary firm The Kobeissi Letter, publicly questioned: \"Did someone have prior knowledge of the tax increase?\" While there is currently no direct evidence of an \"insider information leak,\" this incident has once again raised public concerns about the digital asset market—the problem of information asymmetry and the interference of political influence in the market may be far more serious than imagined. October: A \"Profitable\" Pardon Just weeks later, another controversy erupted: President Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. Zhao had pleaded guilty to \"anti-money laundering violations\" in 2023 and served four months in prison; Binance itself also paid over $4 billion in fines for this. <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/842-1761792999208?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>On April 30, 2024, Changpeng Zhao, former CEO of Binance, left the U.S. Federal Court in Seattle, Washington. Zhao, the founder and former CEO of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, was sentenced to four months in prison that day for pleading guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws. (Photo: Jason Redmond / AFP, courtesy of Getty Images)</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This pardon not only erased Zhao's criminal record but also cleared the way for his return to the cryptocurrency industry. The White House explained that this move was to correct \"the problem of excessive regulation during the Biden administration.\"</p> However, a BBC report further fueled the controversy: Zhao Changpeng's company had previously collaborated with \"enterprises related to the Trump family's cryptocurrency projects.\" This connection significantly heightened public suspicion that \"there was a quid pro quo behind the pardon.\" Objectively speaking, this pardon further solidified the \"alliance\" between the current US government and the digital asset industry, while also raising deeper questions: To what extent does political influence ultimately dictate regulatory outcomes? Conclusion: Another \"Ordinary Year\" for the Cryptocurrency Sector These five events collectively made 2025 another \"headline year\" for the cryptocurrency industry. Despite ongoing controversy, compared to historical records, this year is far from the industry's \"worst period.\" The debut of Meme Coin in January blurred the lines between \"hype\" and \"governance\"; the Bybit hack in February exposed vulnerabilities even in the most trusted systems; the dinner in May transformed \"token holding\" into \"political leverage\"; the trading scandal in October revealed the power of \"speculation\" and \"timing\" to manipulate the entire market; and the presidential pardon in the same month made 2025 a year in which the \"legality and ethical boundaries of the cryptocurrency industry were repeatedly challenged.\" Every year in the cryptocurrency field is accompanied by new innovations, challenges, breakthroughs, and controversies—2025 is no exception.</div></div>",

This round was led by YZi Labs, with participation from Baidu Ventures, Jinqiu Fund, Amino Capital, BridgeOne Capital, and several well-known investors.</span></span></p> This is also the first AI product company invested in by YZi Labs. Founder Kai Zhao stated that VideoTutor received recognition and support from Changpeng Zhao and the YZi Labs investment team, with YZi Labs ultimately leading this round of financing. They received more than 10 term sheets (TS) and ultimately selected these few. The first version of their product was launched on May 14th (first appearance on the Founder Park product marketplace), gaining market recognition and PMF validation. In less than five months, they completed this $11 million seed round of financing. According to Kai, the core reason they were able to secure this funding is that, given the correct direction, the \"Little Genius Team\" solved the pain points of US college entrance exam preparation in the K-12 education sector using a visual learning approach. \"This field is well-suited for young people, especially those with strong engineering skills, insightful leadership, and experience, coupled with rapid execution.\" It's not just them; Cursor, Mercor, Pika, GPTZero, and other Silicon Valley students are redefining our understanding of AI entrepreneurship with their record-breaking funding AI products. Starting a business in the AI ​​era is truly different. We talked with the young people at VideoTutor to find out why they were able to secure this seed round funding, what changes are happening in Silicon Valley startups today, and why they are so keen to recruit employees from major Chinese companies. The following is the interview content, edited and compiled by Founder Park. Founder Park: So many institutions are optimistic about you. In your opinion, what is the core point that impressed them? Kai: I think the first thing is that the direction is correct. The AI ​​education sector has great potential and prospects. We've entered the education field of the US college entrance exams, SAT and AP. Our target user group is K-12 high school students. The gap between us and this user group is very small, basically no generation gap. We've gone through the entire test preparation and learning cycle, we know where the pain points of the exam and test preparation are, and we can create a product that truly solves the pain points of this group. Secondly, the team is excellent. James comes from Gemini and was a core engineer in AI engineering and algorithms at Google. I myself have three educational startup experiences. I started an educational software business in my freshman year of college, and in my sophomore year, I participated in the creation of MathGPTPro, a project that was selected for the Miracle Innovation Forum, etc. I have experience in successfully creating educational products. Thirdly, in the AI ​​education field we work on, the core is the animation engine, and we are the core developers of VideoTutor. We are the team that best understands the core technology and can achieve highly accurate rendering of the animation engine. The team itself has a very strong marketing background and knows how to promote the product. VideoTutor perfectly aligns with a consensus among mainstream US VCs: a \"young genius team.\" This refers to a field well-suited for young people, coupled with strong engineering skills, a founder with excellent insight and experience, and rapid execution. I think this is a consensus reason why all investors are optimistic about it. <p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p><section><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"P3pa0F2bwEWwFLUhH7KV2kkE5sXcXLkPgULiMrTH.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410151_image3.png\" title=\"7410151\"/></p></section><p></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">VideoTutor listed on the NYSE at YZi Labs EASY Residency Demo Day</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Founder Park: What core problem in the education industry does your product aim to solve?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Kai:</strong>Currently, learning products on the market can be categorized into two types: active learning products and passive learning products.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Kai:</strong> Passive learning products, such as ByteDance's Gauth, Chegg, and AnswersAi, cover what we call \"homework help,\" with a very short learning path; students primarily pay for homework assistance. VideoTutor, on the other hand, covers active learning scenarios. We don't need to consider students' learning motivation because they have to study and take exams, such as the SAT and AP exams in the US. In this scenario, there are numerous pain points related to visualization; 80% of the content in the SAT involves functions, calculus, and other knowledge requiring complex image rendering. VideoTutor's animation engine can solve this problem very well. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p><section><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"PaaJnnbtS6BXe6FyjS4skg0Y7HsPfNnGNNrXkFAN.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410152_image3.png\" title=\"7410152\"/></p></section><p></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Moreover, the average order value in this field is very high. In the US, an average of 2.6 million students take the SAT exam each year, creating a huge demand for paid services. Offline SAT courses are expensive, charged by the hour, not by package, starting at an average of $150 per hour, with most costing around $230. Many students and parents pay for these courses. However, VideoTutor can effectively transfer or even replace teacher training because, currently, AI-generated videos are almost indistinguishable from teacher training content.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> This way, students can have their own AI-powered personalized test preparation tutor at the lowest possible cost. Founder Park: What prompted you to create this product? Kai: Actually, before us, a team at Stanford had already done it, called Gatekeep AI. They also wanted to do visual learning. I had already realized the impact of this direction. In my previous startups, the educational products we made were basically just connecting to the GPT API, similar to a ChatGPT wrapper product. But we found that these products, based solely on text-based question and answer, have a ceiling. We can see that the business of companies like Chegg and Gauth is declining, with a large portion of their scenarios being replaced by ChatGPT, because students can solve many homework problems by paying $20 to use ChatGPT. Products based on API wrappers and optimizations have reached their limit. However, multimodal visual generation has a very promising future because there are many visualization learning scenarios in the US college entrance exam field. Unfortunately, Gatekeep made a good start but didn't continue because it launched a bit too early; the basic model programming capabilities weren't mature at the time, and GPT-4 hadn't been released yet. Furthermore, mathematical animation engines involve rendering and algorithms, which they couldn't overcome. But our team mastered all the core development of the animation engine, solved this problem, and made video rendering very accurate. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><span ace-line=\"\" ai=\"\" answersai=\"\" api=\"\" chatgpt=\"\" day=\"\" demo=\"\" easy=\"\" founder=\"\" gap=\"\" gatekeep=\"\" gauth=\"\" gpt=\"\" gpt-4=\"\" h2=\"\" heading-2=\"\" homework=\"\" img=\"\" insight=\"\" james=\"\" k12=\"\" labs=\"\" leaf=\"\" line-height:=\"\" margin-bottom:=\"\" marketing=\"\" mathgptpro=\"\" nodeleaf=\"\" p=\"\" residency=\"\" sat=\"\" span=\"\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410145_image3.png\" strong=\"\" text=\"\" vc=\"\" videotutor=\"\" wrapper=\"\" yzi=\"\">PMF: Strong User Willingness to Pay</span></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Founder Park: After your product launched, you also reached cooperation with several schools. In your opinion, when or which feature made you feel, \"I've done the right thing with this product, and I've found the right pain point,\" and you felt that you had found PMF?</span></span></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Kai:</span></span></strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">It can be explained from three dimensions.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">First, from the revenue metric, VideoTutor has received API requests from 1,000 companies so far, including all the well-known large educational institutions in the United States, and even institutions in China. In addition, many schools want to purchase the service.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\"> Consumer-facing (C-end) users have a more direct intention. One parent, who is also an investor, tried the product and then gave it to all his friends and family to try, and everyone was willing to pay. Then, somehow, he got my phone number and texted me wanting to invest in us. C-end users have a very strong willingness to pay. Secondly, from the perspective of user needs. Why is offline one-on-one tutoring so essential in the US? Because parents feel that one-on-one teaching is effective and are willing to pay for it. Now, multimodal AI technology can achieve a human-like one-on-one teaching effect, answering questions directly. Moreover, the video lessons recorded by online one-on-one tutors in the US are practically indistinguishable from AI-generated videos. This is what I mean by \"demand transfer.\" Students pay a lot of money for pre-recorded courses, which are indistinguishable from AI-generated ones, so why not use AI? Lower costs and better teaching results. We've received a lot of very positive feedback from students, and many teachers are also willing to spread the word about the product. The initial completion rate and usage time were particularly good. The 200 seed users we've selected are all from our early accumulation. The third point is about the product's taste and feel. When you continuously work backward from the progress of the entire education industry, to the core needs of students and parents who want to pay, and then to the evolution of the product itself, the whole logic is a closed loop. So, from these three dimensions, you'll feel that PMF is sufficient. The most crucial point is that the willingness to pay is extremely strong. </span></span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410146_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">We've partnered with FIZZ</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Founder Park: Many users are proactively willing to pay, and some have even contacted you wanting to invest.</span></span></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Kai:</span></span></strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Yes. In the SAT and AP fields, the willingness to pay is inherently strong. The average order value in this field starts at $100 to $200, and offline classes are even more expensive, possibly reaching $800.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410146_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\"> In the US, 2.6 million students take the SAT, and 37% of them actively pay for it. This is a market with very strong willingness and demand. Our product can achieve a very good transfer of demand. Founder Park: In the SAT arena, for test takers, would they trust AI over a human tutor? Kai: Currently, AI rarely makes factual errors when answering questions at the level of the US college entrance exams SAT and AP. In this case, why is it better than an offline tutor? One advantage is its affordability, and the other is that students can ask any questions they have without worrying about teachers being annoyed or impatient with their questions. They can learn anytime, anywhere, 24/7. Moreover, this market is transferable. After completing the US market, we can expand to A-Level exams in Canada and the UK, etc., where there is huge demand for paid services. Founder Park: What are your current plans regarding paid services? Kai: We offer monthly subscriptions, and we also offer pay-per-learning options. I think AI can already achieve pay-per-results now. We might offer a package where, for example, you pay $799 and we guarantee your child a perfect score on the SAT Math. Founder Park: But doesn't paying based on exam results also depend on the student's individual motivation? Kai: This might not be possible with the Chinese college entrance exam (Gaokao) because it covers thousands of topics. However, the American SAT only has 62 topics, 50 of which are standard and most students have no problem with them. The remaining 12 are generally mastered as well. Unless a student has a genuine problem with logic, there's virtually no chance they won't learn it. Furthermore, the efficiency improvement effect of AI is very significant. Actually, many online tutors in the US also offer this service. You pay a tutor $1800, and the tutor's success rate is basically 100% because the SAT test points are fixed. As long as the student's IQ is normal, there's basically no problem. But the Chinese college entrance exam (Gaokao) is different; you can't improve your Gaokao score in a short period. Moreover, the Chinese Gaokao requires a wide score gap, which presents challenging questions, but the American SAT doesn't have absolutely difficult questions because it tests your mastery of the knowledge points. Pay-per-result is a model that tutors have already used, and it has this prerequisite. Founder Park: In your pricing, is model cost a concern? Does it account for a large proportion? Kai: Our average order value in this field is very high, starting at $69 per month. Model costs are currently very low, so it's not a problem. The education industry isn't like the coding field, where everyone is competing on price because coding requires supporting very long contexts. Founder Park: I remember you said last time that your first prototype only took about two months. How did you consider the entire development cycle, such as the division of labor, deciding which features to include and which not to include? Kai: Our team's consensus is that iteration must be fast, because speed is crucial for getting early user feedback. The first version caused a huge stir on Twitter, attracting a large number of users. However, many of these users were programmers, investors, or tech enthusiasts—what we can collectively call \"early adopters.\" At that stage, the feedback from them was scattered and not very valuable. We needed to filter out the truly core seed users from this broad user base—high-quality high school students—and then obtain useful feedback through consultation. The core feedback we received was that video rendering accuracy must reach 100%, which was the most important area for optimization. Features like UI aesthetics or support for different TTS audio-visual selections were cut. Returning to the core of the product: we're working on knowledge learning for science-related scenarios, so the accuracy of graphics rendering is paramount. Founder Park: How was the generation time initially determined? Kai: At that time, the peak generation time was about 6 minutes. The main consideration was that explanations of ordinary questions and key concepts shouldn't exceed 6 minutes. However, in subsequent feedback, we found that some students with weaker learning abilities wanted the content explained more slowly and in greater depth. We realized that the time shouldn't be limited, but rather depend more on the user's learning ability. Founder Park: What's the longest you can go now? Kai: The longest should be under an hour, allowing for continuous questioning. It generates data in real-time during the interaction, but this feature is recent; it wasn't available in the initial version. Founder Park: Were there any features you initially considered but later decided against because they weren't considered important? Kai: For example, an app. We initially thought we should quickly develop an app, but then we discovered that most students in the US primarily use laptops or iPads for learning. Most K-12 schools in the US provide students with a Chromebook computer; computers are highly prevalent, and students complete their assignments on computers. High school students almost universally own a computer, and mobile phones account for less than 5% of learning scenarios—a very low percentage. Founder Park: So, if it's a product primarily targeting education or students, a web version is the first thing to develop; an app isn't as important. Kai: Yes, I already knew this data at the time, having studied in the US for many years. Later, we conducted research on 100 students from our initial tens of thousands of users. Over 90 of these students had computers, which further solidified our belief. Founder Park: When you launched your first version, were you also targeting the K-12 demographic? Kai: Yes, we've been targeting that group ever since. We're not exactly competitors with Gauth; we focus more on test preparation. Many high school students in the US already choose either offline tutoring or online learning platforms, and VideoTutor has effectively bridged this need. Founder Park: Will K-12 be your core user group for at least a year? Kai: It should be a core metric for at least two years. </span></span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span ace-line=\"\" app=\"\" chromebook=\"\" founder=\"\" gauth=\"\" h2=\"\"

experiences before, what were they mostly about?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Kai:</strong>I'm a junior in college now. In my freshman year, I started an educational product with James and received $200,000 in angel investment. Although that venture failed, I learned valuable lessons: you can't get caught up in homogeneous competition. At the time, our app had many similar products on the market, forcing us into early-stage competition for user acquisition, making monetization difficult.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">My second startup was MathGPTPro, where I joined as a co-founder for a few months. During that period, I learned how to analyze product metrics, how to build a product, and how to expand your user base.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> It was around that time that I came to a conclusion: Text-based, answer-oriented educational products had reached their limit. Because they were no different from ChatGPT, and the structured knowledge question banks that companies like Zuoyebang had invested heavily in were being replaced by large-scale model editing capabilities. Therefore, for my third venture, I knew that visualization was an inevitable trend. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p><section><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"F28nGF3IQzBCkOHQIxvcsORdYOaUJMSWifhdBnoA.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410155_image3.png\" title=\"7410155\"/></p></section><p></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A photo of Zhao Kai with Sam Altman at Harvard University</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Founder Park: Besides making you realize the limitations of text-based products, how have your past two experiences helped you in your current work on VideoTutor, in terms of teamwork or other aspects?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Kai:</strong>Very helpful.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">First, it helped me better judge the direction and whether the product had a future.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> I judge the overall product evolution direction by looking at competitors' website traffic and revenue. Secondly, in terms of product development, I can better judge the product development pace, including product design, front-end and back-end integration, and which metrics to look at. Thirdly, team management and organizational culture capabilities. I established a more complete management system, including the division of labor for each team member, rewards, and stock option issuance. Also, I learned how to raise funds. We completed this round of $10 million in funding within 20 days. Founder Park: How many people are on your team now? Kai: Six people, we all live together. Founder Park: How was the team initially built? Kai: James and I have already started two businesses. We both graduated from the same university, and we made an app together in our freshman year. In our sophomore year, I started a business with two other people, and we all knew each other. When we realized that this technology could bring a very big product vision, we contacted each other to form a team to develop this product. We were all alumni, including another partner on the team, Nick, who was also my college roommate. Founder Park: You are also planning to expand your recruitment now. What kind of people are you looking to hire? Kai: We are mainly recruiting backend, frontend, large language model, and UI/UX professionals, preferably with experience. Because we have now moved beyond the trial and error stage and entered the stage of rapid product building, we need experienced people to help us grow. Founder Park: We need experienced engineers, product managers, and growth leaders to grow the product from 1 to 10, or even from 10 to 100. Kai: Yes, that's the stage. We expect to expand the team to 9 to 10 people, with a primary focus on recruiting engineers. This recruitment will likely be based in China, so it will be a mix of in-person and remote hiring. Founder Park: What kind of person are you looking for? Kai: We prefer someone with experience at large companies like ByteDance or Meituan. ByteDance has a fast-paced, dynamic organizational culture and values ​​young people. Those trained at ByteDance possess strong methodologies and skills, and joining us allows them to bring their successful experiences and integrate them into our learning. We're looking for individuals with proven track records in major Chinese tech companies and experience in rapid iteration. We've moved beyond the student startup phase and don't need to hire complete novices anymore; we need more experienced individuals who aren't absolute industry veterans. Industry veterans might have family responsibilities and can't be as focused. Therefore, we prefer young, focused individuals at a middle level. We're willing to offer substantial stock options to outstanding talent. Although we've raised $11 million, why haven't we hired engineers in the US? Because we believe that China's product development and engineering capabilities are truly exceptional. This wave will almost certainly see Chinese-run teams creating great products that will succeed internationally. Many AI applications are currently being developed by Chinese; China's engineering capabilities are truly impressive. This is also our advantage—we leverage the strengths of both China and the US. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span ace-line=\"\" ai=\"\" altman=\"\" build=\"\" founder=\"\" h2=\"\" heading-2=\"\" img=\"\" in-person=\"\" james=\"\" leaf=\"\" line-height:=\"\" margin-bottom:=\"\" nick=\"\" nodeleaf=\"\" p=\"\" pitch=\"\" sam=\"\" span=\"\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410147_image3.png\" strong=\"\" text=\"\" ux=\"\" videotutor=\"\">College students in Silicon Valley,</span></strong><strong>are all starting AI businesses</strong></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Founder Park: Especially in Silicon Valley, the trend of college student entrepreneurship is particularly evident. What kind of situation are you observing? Kai: Let's look at a fact: take the companies with valuations in the recent round of funding, for example: Mercor, which focuses on AI recruitment, has completed a new round of funding of over $300 million, and its valuation is already in the tens of billions of dollars; while Cursor is already a sure thing for a $10 billion valuation. There are also companies like GPTZero and Pika, etc. These are all college student startups, especially since the founders of Cursor and Mercor were both college dropouts. This wave of young entrepreneurs all share a common characteristic: highly differentiated competition. They focus on doing things in extremely narrow fields, not creating anything generic. For example, Mercor initially focused on recruiting Indian programmers for its AI program. The second point is the environment. The entire Silicon Valley capital environment and underlying innovation, such as Stanford, Y Combinator, and Peter Thiel's fund, support student entrepreneurship in its earliest stages, regardless of whether your ideas are fully developed, and are willing to support you and provide a strong network of connections. The third point, I think, is the quality of these university students. Whether it's us or these Silicon Valley graduates, they all possess a very courageous spirit of adventure and extremely strong learning abilities. This adventurous spirit is something many students in China may not possess. Because in Silicon Valley, there are many successful examples of peers around you inspiring you, and the capital environment is willing to believe in young people. For me, I also compared the costs and benefits at the time. If I chose to finish university and then find a job, I might not be able to repay my family's tuition fees, nor would I necessarily see a significant return. But if I chose to start a business, I could study intensely while I was young, and my life would have unlimited possibilities. I've wanted to create a great company since I was a child. Founder Park: Why is it that today's generation of college graduates can build companies worth billions of dollars, while in the past, selling for ten or twenty million dollars was considered a great achievement? Is there any hype or bubble factor involved in this? Kai: I don't think it's entirely a bubble. Cursor has a real revenue of $450 million, which is very reliable. Behind this is the crucial methodology and cognitive insight of this generation of young teams. Look at these teams, their backgrounds are all quite excellent, and they have very good learning abilities. Early on, Cursor relied on the university student programmers around them, who had a high acceptance of AI and provided strong feedback. The founder himself is also a gifted engineer who deeply understands users and has strong engineering iteration capabilities. In the early days, only four people were needed to get the product up and running. After they iterated the product well, they built a good reputation among users, generated revenue, and investors, fearing they might miss out on the next Mark Zuckerberg, poured in more capital. The most fundamental condition is that many technologies in this wave of AI are new, and young people learn quickly, are pragmatic, reliable, and daring. Therefore, they have an exceptional understanding of users and an incredibly fast iteration speed to defeat traditional products. For example, before Cursor, GitHub Copilot was quite good, but why didn't it beat Cursor? It's because of user experience and execution speed. Founder Park: Could we say that because AI is a new technology, many product perceptions also need to be viewed from a new perspective? Kai: Yes, the younger generation of entrepreneurs has deeper insights and understanding than the previous generation, and they are closer to users. The mainstream AI users now are mostly Gen Z, and their learning and feedback iteration speed and tolerance are much faster than the previous generation of entrepreneurs. Therefore, the speed of cognitive iteration is key. In the mobile internet era, technological iteration was measured in years or quarters, but in the AI ​​era, it may be measured in days. As a founder, you must learn quickly, and young people are more likely to stay up late and have more drive. Founder Park: Some media outlets have reported that many founders in Silicon Valley have started working 996 (9am-9pm, 6 days a week). What's your take on that? Kai: Some of my white entrepreneur friends have raised a lot of money and are also working 996. They, like us, rent a large house where everyone lives and works together. I think 996 is more of an environmental necessity. Silicon Valley is like a gold rush now; nobody wants to fall behind, so the only competition is product iteration speed, which requires working late into the night for rapid iteration. It's an environment that forces people to do this. Founder Park: What are the trends in the choice of business tracks among college student entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley? Kai: I think whether we're in education or others, there's a general trend: starting a business within one's comfort zone. A comfort zone refers to having sufficient understanding of the field and its users. The founder of Cursor has a deep understanding of coding, and we in education do so because we understand the target audience well. Young people today are more likely to start businesses within their existing comfort zones, rather than rashly jumping into unfamiliar areas. This ensures that the user feedback they receive is quick and accurate. There's also the issue of knowledge accumulation. We've been in education three times, and my understanding has been constantly evolving. These college students aren't likely to rashly do things they've never done before; they're always thinking about how to do it better. They have a new generation of mindset, constantly iterating within their own cognitive circles and daring to create opportunities. Another point is their adventurous spirit; they're not easily swayed by others' criticism, possessing an attitude of \"I don't care what you think about me,\" very confident. Behind this is a culture of \"high-speed experimentation.\" I know my product isn't ready yet, but I don't care; I launch quickly, iterate quickly, and get feedback quickly. Founder Park: When did this trend start? Kai: I think it's a kind of consensus-based success. When people see projects like GPTZero grow from dorm rooms, iterate continuously, and then gain capital support and user recognition, and there are many such successful cases of rapid trial and error and rapid growth, a consensus is formed. In short, \"Better done than perfect,\" completion is more important than perfection. Moreover, people aren't too worried about competition. Many founders in Silicon Valley are willing to share their product ideas, unafraid of being copied; they just want to iterate quickly. I think this wave of young people also has a very good storytelling ability. This storytelling isn't empty rhetoric, but rather based on pragmatism and truthfulness, plus their vision for the future. Founder Park: First, market yourself. Kai: Yes. I think the underlying concept is a spirit of adventure and extreme self-confidence. Driven by this, they constantly and bravely try and fail, unafraid to say the wrong thing. They boldly express their product ideas, boldly execute them, and if they make a mistake, they can always correct it. This culture of not being afraid to try and fail has contributed to this wave of college student entrepreneurship and its success. VCs in the US also look at college student projects; Y Combinator regularly invests in some college student projects each round. Fundraising is the last thing VideoTutor needs to worry about right now. Founder Park: If you could go back to when you first started VideoTutor, what advice would you give yourself? What could you have done better? Kai: I think it would have been to move at a faster pace. Also, team composition. The VideoTutor team has gone through multiple rounds of refinement. If I had known earlier, I would have better assemble a team based on the skill profiles required for the product. I think that in the end, organizational ability is crucial for startups. I will spend more time on organizational capabilities: selecting people, identifying people, and utilizing people effectively. The current team is suited for growth from 0 to 1, but to make VideoTutor bigger, we need more experienced people to join, bringing their excellent experience and abilities to the team and helping the whole team grow together. Founder Park: What kind of product or technical challenges do you think VideoTutor might encounter in the next six months? Kai: I think one is rendering; to achieve true zero latency, we still need engineering breakthroughs. The second point is about growth, which I think is about the product's \"taste.\" This encompasses many things, such as whether the UI and interaction design are smooth and perfect, whether the functional interactions are bug-free, and whether the visual layout is aesthetically pleasing. These are all challenges for us. James: I think initially, our positioning for VideoTutor was to provide visual teaching and tutoring for all subjects, but later we became very vertical, focusing solely on mathematics, because that's what we excel at. Our mathematical rendering engine is the most professional. The key breakthrough we need to make next is probably horizontal expansion. For example, how do we bring the advantages of visualization to humanities scenarios? For example, explaining \"Hoeing the fields at noon, sweat drips onto the soil.\" This is a point we need to consider technically next. Founder Park: Will the founder's background cause any problems in subsequent expansion? Kai: Not really. Actually, many large VCs have approached us, like a16z. They don't invest too early; they only help when the team shows signs of success, so they know their investment won't fail. We maintain very good relationships with many large VCs. Fundraising is the least of VideoTutor's worries; their biggest concerns are the user ecosystem and the product itself.</span></span></strong></p></strong></h2></div></div>",

            "title": "Consensys's Journey to Glory: From Ethereum Ecosystem Builder to Capital Market Focus",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p>Deng Tong, Jinse Finance</p><p>On October 29, 2025, according to Axios, Consensys plans to go public and has selected JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs as the lead underwriters for its initial public offering (IPO). This listing will be one of the most important IPOs to date for an Ethereum infrastructure construction company.</p><p>A Consensys spokesperson stated that \"there is currently no information to announce, but the company will continue to evaluate various development options. The company has been exploring opportunities to expand its influence.\" Although the official stance remains cautious, the market generally regards this planned IPO as one of the important signs of the maturation of the crypto industry.</p><p>This article outlines Consensys' business lines, reviews Consensys's glorious journey, and analyzes the multiple factors favorable to Consensys's listing.</p><p> </p><h2>I. Consensys' Journey: Six Core Businesses Illuminating Its Ideal</h2><p>Founded in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, Consensys' mission is to build the core infrastructure of the Ethereum ecosystem. Over the past decade, Consensys has continuously expanded its business lines, growing from an Ethereum developer community incubator into a diversified Ethereum infrastructure giant encompassing wallets, developer tools, enterprise services, Layer-2 networks, and ecosystem investments.</p><h3>1. MetaMask</h3><p>MetaMask is Consensys' star product. Since its launch in 2016, it has become the primary entry point for tens of millions of users to interact with multiple blockchains such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon.</p><p>MetaMask provides functions such as account management, dApp integration, NFT storage, DeFi trading, and hardware wallet support. As a consumer-end entry point, it brings Consensys the most direct brand recognition and traffic foundation.</p><p>MetaMask provides functions such as account management, dApp integration, NFT storage, DeFi trading, and hardware wallet support.</p><p>As a consumer-end entry point, it brings Consensys the most direct brand recognition and traffic foundation.</p> On August 21st of this year, MetaMask announced the official launch of its native stablecoin, MetaMask USD (mUSD). MetaMask stated that mUSD will be issued by Bridge, a stablecoin issuance platform under Stripe, and minted through M0's decentralized infrastructure. On October 28th, MetaMask announced the launch of multi-chain accounts, increasing user asset loading speed by 30 times. 2. Infura Infura is a blockchain infrastructure platform launched in 2016. It provides stable APIs and node access services for Ethereum, IPFS, and Layer-2. Considered \"Ethereum's AWS,\" it supports mainstream applications such as Uniswap, Aave, MetaMask, and OpenSea. Infura provides developers with reliable RPC access, enabling them to deploy and run dApps without building their own nodes. On October 6th, Joseph Lubin, founder of Consensys and co-founder of Ethereum, stated that a \"token-driven economy\" is about to enter Consensys' product portfolio, including Infura. 3. Besu In 2018, Consensys Besu (formerly PegaSys) was launched, aiming to create an enterprise-grade Ethereum client to support both public and permissioned (private) blockchain deployments. In August 2019, the PegaSys team officially donated its core product, Pantheon, to the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger project, renaming it Hyperledger Besu. In 2020, Consensys continued to lead the development and commercial support of Besu, integrating it into Consensys' enterprise services division and providing long-term maintenance, security audits, and compliance consulting. JPMorgan Chase has partnered with Consensys on its Onyx blockchain platform, utilizing Besu technology for enterprise network construction; the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the French central bank's digital bond experimental project also adopted a private chain architecture based on Besu. 4. Codefi In September 2019, ConsenSys launched Codefi. Codefi is Consensys' enterprise-grade fintech platform, dedicated to helping banks, asset management companies, and enterprise clients build asset management, settlement, and compliance processes on the blockchain. Codefi has participated in the French central bank's digital currency experiment, technical cooperation for the JPMorgan Chase Onyx project, and on-chain bond issuance pilots for several European banks. 5. Mesh In February 2020, Lubin announced the establishment of Consensys Mesh, \"a global decentralized entrepreneurial ecosystem network\" aimed at supporting the development of the Ethereum ecosystem through investment, incubation, and accelerator programs. Mesh has invested in projects such as Gitcoin, Livepeer, Phantom, and MetaMask Snaps, focusing on infrastructure, DeFi, DAO, NFT, and privacy computing. 6. Linea On March 28, 2023, ConsenSys opened its testnet to all developers, users, and protocols, officially renaming ConsenSys zkEVM to Linea. Linea is Consensys' self-developed zkEVM Layer-2 extension solution, aiming to reduce Ethereum transaction costs and improve execution efficiency. Linea is built on zk-rollup technology, fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing developers to migrate applications directly without code modification. Linea is deeply interoperable with MetaMask and Infura, allowing users to seamlessly access it through their wallets, and developers to directly connect to the network using Infura. On July 29th, Linea announced it would become the first Layer 2 network to implement Ethereum's burning mechanism at the protocol level, burning 20% ​​of its net transaction fees. Linea also released a token allocation plan, allocating 85% of its tokens for ecosystem building, including 75% for development funds and 10% for early user incentives. On September 10th, Linea officially launched its TGE (Tencent Token Offering). On October 21, ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin stated, \"We will bring a next-generation tokenomics platform and launchpad to @LineaBuild. Furthermore, if we can accelerate the global penetration of prediction markets like @Polymarket and @MyriadMarkets, we can integrate collective wisdom and market forces into governance and decision-making processes at all levels of society.\" II. The Time is Ripe: Consensys Enters the IPO Window 1. Crypto Companies Usher in an IPO Wave On June 5th of this year, Circle went public on the New York Stock Exchange. Industry insiders point out that the success of a large-scale IPO like Circle may spur other companies to quickly follow suit with stablecoins. Companies such as Ionic Digital, Gemini Space Station, Inc., and BitGo... Companies like Inc. have filed for IPOs. The successful IPOs of Circle and Coinbase are providing a reference for crypto companies. 2. Continued Relaxation of Regulatory Policies Under the Trump administration, the US attitude towards cryptocurrencies has become more friendly. The SEC approved a spot Bitcoin ETF and rejected several lawsuits against crypto companies. Meanwhile, Congress is pushing forward stablecoin legislation, laying a clearer compliance framework for the entire industry. Just five days ago, Trump appointed Mike Selig as chairman of the CFTC to advance the modernization of US cryptocurrency regulation. Furthermore, Trump himself is a beneficiary of cryptocurrencies. According to an investigation by the Financial Times, Trump and his family earned over $1 billion in pre-tax profits from cryptocurrency businesses in the past year. The investigation shows that the Trump family's cryptocurrency empire includes multiple projects such as digital transaction cards, Meme Coin, stablecoins, tokens, and decentralized finance platforms. 3. Entry of Traditional Financial Institutions BlackRock, Visa Giants like BlackRock not only support cryptocurrency companies but also actively launch cryptocurrency-related businesses. For example, BlackRock planned to participate in Circle's IPO, raising over $150 million. BlackRock's move not only provided Circle with substantial financial backing but also signaled to the market that \"traditional finance is willing and prepared to intervene in crypto asset companies.\" Yesterday, Visa announced plans to support four stablecoins on four different blockchains; on July 30th, the CEO of Visa (V.N) stated that the best way to use stablecoins is through Visa. The entry of traditional financial institutions helps the crypto narrative evolve from the fringe to the mainstream and can reduce financing difficulties for crypto companies, benefiting the industry's development. The sensational effect of Circle's IPO can be seen as a successful example of the true integration of crypto finance and traditional finance. In the past year, Circle, Galaxy... The IPOs of cryptocurrency-native companies like Digital, eToro, and Exodus signify the entry of digital asset businesses into the mainstream financial arena. For ordinary investors, this wave presents more investment opportunities. The market today encompasses publicly traded exchanges, self-custodied wallets, institutional infrastructure providers, and fintech applications integrating cryptocurrency trading and staking capabilities. This diversification reflects the increasing maturity of the cryptocurrency industry, whose development is no longer driven by speculative trading but rather by genuine business models and long-term strategic visions. Importantly, IPOs also bring greater accountability. Publicly listed companies must meet higher standards of financial reporting, compliance, and governance, which in turn makes them more attractive to institutional capital. Going public allows these companies to responsibly access funding and scale under the oversight of regulators and public shareholders. In short, the entry of cryptocurrency companies into the public stock market marks a crucial step towards building institutional credibility, market discipline, and sustainable growth.</div></div>",

            "title": "Why are new crypto-based banks suddenly springing up everywhere?",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Thejaswini M A Translator: Shan Ouba, Jinse Finance</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">There's a principle in behavioral economics called mental accounting: people treat their money differently depending on where it's stored. $100 in a checking account feels readily available; while the same $100 in a retirement account feels untouchable. Although funds are inherently interoperable, the storage context changes how people perceive them.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Frax founder Sam Kazemian calls this the net worth theory: people prefer to keep their spare change where most of their wealth is already concentrated. If your net worth is primarily in stocks and bonds in a Charles Schwab account, you'll keep cash in a linked bank account—because transfers between the two are frictionless; if your net worth is primarily on-chain (like in Ethereum wallets and DeFi positions), you'll want the US dollar to easily integrate into this on-chain world as well.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> For the first time today, a significant number of people are storing most of their wealth on the blockchain. They're tired of the hassle of constantly transferring money back to traditional banks just to buy a cup of coffee. New cryptocurrency banks are solving this problem through one-stop integrated infrastructure. On these platforms, you can save with interest-bearing stablecoins and spend directly with a Visa card, without ever touching a traditional bank account. The rapid growth of these platforms is essentially a market response to a fact: the cryptocurrency space finally has enough real users and enough real funds on the blockchain to make the establishment of new crypto banks truly valuable. For over a decade, cryptocurrencies have promised to eliminate intermediaries, reduce fees, and give users more control, but they have always faced a core problem: merchants do not accept cryptocurrency payments, and it is simply unrealistic to expect all merchants to accept them simultaneously. You can't pay rent with USDC, employers won't pay salaries with ETH, and grocery stores won't accept stablecoins. Even if you convert all your wealth into cryptocurrency, daily life still revolves around traditional bank accounts. Every conversion between cryptocurrency and fiat currency means fees, settlement delays, and various frictions. This is also why most crypto payment projects fail: BitPay attempted to get merchants to accept Bitcoin directly, and the Lightning Network built peer-to-peer payment infrastructure, but was hampered by liquidity management and routing stability issues. Neither achieved large-scale adoption, primarily because the conversion costs were too high—merchants needed to confirm that users would use this payment method, and users needed to confirm that merchants would accept it; no one was willing to take the first step. Crypto banks, however, make these coordination problems invisible. You spend stablecoins from your self-custodial wallet, and the new bank automatically converts them into USD, then settles with merchants via Visa or Mastercard; the coffee shop still receives USD from its bank account, completely unaware of the cryptocurrency's existence. You don't need to convince all merchants to accept cryptocurrency; simply hide the conversion layer—allowing users to spend cryptocurrency at any merchant that accepts regular debit cards (virtually everywhere). After years of failed attempts, three infrastructure elements are now maturing simultaneously, finally making this possible: First, stablecoins gain legitimacy. The GENIUS Act, passed in July 2025, provides a clear legal framework for stablecoin issuance. The US Treasury Secretary predicts that by 2030, transaction volume for payment-related stablecoins will reach $3 trillion. This is equivalent to the US Treasury officially recognizing stablecoins as part of the financial system. Second, the commoditization of bank card infrastructure. Companies like Bridge provide white-label APIs, allowing teams to launch complete new banking products in just a few weeks (Stripe acquired Bridge for $1.1 billion). Today, teams no longer need to negotiate directly with card organizations or build bank partnerships from scratch. Third, people are truly putting their wealth on-chain. Early crypto payment projects failed because users didn't hold substantial net worth in cryptocurrencies—most savings remained in traditional brokerage accounts and 401(k) retirement accounts; cryptocurrencies were merely speculative tools, not a place to store life savings. Now, the situation is completely different. Young users and crypto natives are storing significant amounts of wealth in Ethereum wallets, staking positions, and DeFi protocols. Mental accounting has been completely reversed: keeping money on-chain and spending it directly from the chain is easier than transferring it back to bank deposits. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Products and Services of New Crypto Banks</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The differences between different new crypto banks mainly lie in their yield, cashback rates, and regional focus, but they all solve the same core problem: enabling people to spend cryptocurrency without giving up self-custody or frequently transferring it back to bank deposits. EtherFi's daily bank card spending has exceeded $1 million, and transaction volume has doubled in the past two months; similarly, Monerium's EURe stablecoin (the euro stablecoin) has seen significant growth in both issuance and burning. This growth is noteworthy because it demonstrates that these platforms are driving real economic activity, rather than simply engaging in cryptocurrency speculation—funds are flowing out of the crypto ecosystem and into the broader real economy. This is precisely the bridge that the crypto space has long lacked. Over the past year, the competitive landscape of new crypto banks has expanded rapidly: Plasma One, as the first native stablecoin bank, focuses on emerging markets where dollar access is limited; Tria, built on Arbitrum, offers self-custodied wallets and gas-free trading; EtherFi has transformed from a liquidity staking protocol into a complete new bank, with a total value locked (TVL) of $11 billion; and Mantle's UR, positioned with Swiss regulation and compliance as its priority, focuses on the Asian market. Each platform has a different path, but they are all solving the same problem: how to make people spend cryptocurrency without frequently transferring it back to traditional banks? While new crypto banks are small in scale, they can compete for another reason: their users are inherently more valuable. The average American's checking account balance is about $8,000, while native crypto users transfer six- or seven-figure sums between protocols, chains, and platforms. The transaction volume generated by a single crypto user requires hundreds of traditional bank customers to match—this fundamentally changes unit economics. Crypto banks don't need millions of users to be profitable; a few thousand high-value users are sufficient. Traditional banks pursue scale because the revenue generated by a single customer is limited; however, crypto banks can build sustainable businesses even with a small user base—because the value of a single customer in transaction fees, exchange revenue (card network share), and assets under management is 10 to 100 times that of a traditional customer. When your average user doesn't deposit $2,000 of their salary twice a month, the profit logic is completely different. All crypto banks have adopted the same architecture: separating spending balances from savings balances. Payment-oriented stablecoins like Frax's FRAUSD prioritize universal acceptance—backed by low-risk government bond reserves, making merchant integration easier. Interest-bearing stablecoins like Ethena's sUSDe focus on high returns—achieving 4%-12% annualized returns through complex arbitrage trading and DeFi strategies, but this complexity is something merchants are reluctant to assess. A few years ago, DeFi attempted to merge these two types of stablecoins, defaulting to interest-bearing capabilities for all products, but ultimately found that the friction caused by this functional overlap outweighed the problems solved. Traditional banks separated checking and savings accounts to meet regulatory requirements; the crypto space, however, rediscovered the necessity of this separation from a fundamental perspective—you need a payment layer that maximizes acceptance and a savings layer that maximizes returns; attempting to optimize both simultaneously only diminishes the value of both. New crypto banks can offer yields unmatched by traditional banks. They also access the yields of government bonds that support stablecoins, but with an additional compliance process; traditional banks, constrained by higher cost structures (physical branches, outdated systems, compliance expenses), simply cannot compete on interest rates. Crypto banks eliminate all redundant costs and then pass on the profits to users. The crypto space has attempted to build payment systems many times, so why is this time different? This time is different because three necessary conditions have finally been met simultaneously for the first time: a sufficiently clear regulatory framework, with banks willing to participate; sufficiently mature infrastructure, allowing teams to quickly launch products; and most importantly, enough users placing enough wealth on-chain, making the market viable. Mental accounting has shifted: in the past, people stored wealth in traditional accounts and used cryptocurrencies for speculation; now, people store wealth in cryptocurrencies and only exchange them for fiat currency when they need to spend. The infrastructure built by crypto banks simply matches this already occurring shift in user behavior. Money, in essence, has always been our own narrative of value. For centuries, this narrative has relied on the verification of intermediaries—banks safeguarding accounts, governments providing credit backing, and card organizations handling transaction clearing and distribution. Cryptocurrencies once promised to rewrite this narrative, completely eliminating intermediaries. However, we've found that a bridge still needs to be built between the old and new value narratives. And crypto-banks may just be that bridge. Interestingly, in building this bridge between the two monetary systems, these new crypto-banks haven't created entirely new models. They've simply revived operating paradigms that existed a century ago, paradigms that reveal the core essence of human interaction with money. Technology is constantly evolving, but our narrative of the nature of money and its ownership remains remarkably consistent. Perhaps this is the real revelation: we thought we were disrupting the financial system, but in reality, we were merely directing wealth to where it aligns with our current value narrative.</p></div></div>",

            "title": "x402 In-Depth Research Report: The Restructuring of the Internet Payment Paradigm and Investment Implications",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Abstract</strong></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The x402 protocol, jointly launched by Coinbase and Cloudflare in 2025, aims to build a native payment layer for the internet by activating the HTTP 402 status code, which has been dormant for thirty years. The protocol relies on blockchain and stablecoins to achieve low-cost, second-level settlement and a blockchain-agnostic architecture, particularly suited to the high-frequency, automated micro-payment scenarios required by the AI ​​agent economy. Compared with traditional payments, x402 has unique advantages such as \"payment as settlement,\" \"HTTP native,\" and \"extremely simple access,\" and has rapidly formed a cross-industry ecosystem with the support of partners such as Visa, Google, and Anthropic. The active participation of the open-source community has further promoted its expansion. Its potential lies in driving the internet business model from \"advertising and subscription\" to \"instant value exchange\" and providing infrastructure for the AI ​​machine economy. Risks mainly focus on technological scalability, regulatory uncertainty, user habit migration, and competitive substitution.</p> Overall, x402 not only fills a gap in internet payments but also marks a crucial starting point for restructuring future business models. If it can overcome adoption and regulatory challenges, it has the potential to become the next generation of global payment standards. <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>I. Project Background and Overview</strong><strong>Overview</strong></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Since the rise of the internet in the 1990s, the HTTP protocol has been the cornerstone of information transmission. It defines how browsers and servers communicate and has shaped internet usage habits. However, in the HTTP/1.1 standard, there is a long-neglected status code—402 \"Payment Required.\" This should have been the entry point for native internet payments, but it has never been widely activated in the past thirty years. The reason behind this is not that the demand doesn't exist, but rather the lack of early technological and ecological conditions: while solutions such as credit cards and PayPal promoted the popularization of electronic payments, they all relied on additional account systems, complex integration processes, and high cost structures, making it difficult to truly integrate into the semantics of HTTP. The result of this deficiency is that internet business models have moved towards a path dominated by \"free + advertising.\"</p> Users are accustomed to \"zero direct payment,\" while businesses rely on advertising monetization or subscription models to maintain operations. While this model has undoubtedly contributed to the rapid growth of the internet, its negative effects are becoming increasingly apparent: excessive collection and exploitation of user privacy, unreasonable income structures for content creators, and monopolistic traffic entry points by advertising oligopolies. It can be said that the lack of a native payment layer on the internet directly shaped the business ecosystem of the Web2 era. In September 2025, Coinbase and Cloudflare jointly proposed the x402 protocol, aiming to truly activate the 402 status code and create a native payment layer for the internet. Its concept is not simply \"making HTTP chargeable,\" but rather using Web3 technologies such as blockchain, stablecoins, and smart contracts to solve the core obstacle of early payments being difficult to embed into the internet. Coinbase provides the infrastructure for encrypted payments and a stablecoin ecosystem, while Cloudflare leverages its global CDN and edge computing capabilities to embed the protocol into the existing network stack, requiring almost no large-scale modification to the internet architecture. The core value of the x402 protocol can be summarized in three points: Payment as Settlement: Utilizing blockchain and stablecoins, transactions are confirmed within seconds, eliminating the need for intermediary clearing. HTTP Native: Designed based on standard status codes, it is compatible with existing internet protocols and naturally embedded in the web environment. Extremely Simple Integration: Websites or APIs can have payment functionality with just \"one line of code,\" significantly lowering the integration barrier. Essentially, x402 is not a replacement for payment systems like Visa and PayPal, but rather fills a long-standing gap in the internet protocol layer: a \"value transfer module.\" Just as SMTP is to email and DNS is to domain name resolution, x402 aims to become the \"payment protocol standard\" of the information world. To understand the necessity of x402, we need to return to the fundamental limitations of current payment systems: High Transaction Fees: Credit cards and third-party payment institutions typically charge 2-3% transaction fees, which can even exceed the transaction amount in micro-payment scenarios. Settlement Delays: Fund transfers generally require T+1 or even longer cycles, putting significant pressure on merchants' cash flow. Cross-border Barriers: The fragmentation of exchange rates, compliance, and regulatory systems makes cross-border small-amount payments almost impossible. Insufficient programmability: Traditional payment systems are not designed for automation and struggle to support condition-triggered or machine-to-machine payments without human intervention. These pain points were tolerable in the Web 2 era because the main business models relied on advertising and subscriptions. However, in the AI ​​economy era, micropayments and automated payments will become core demands, which traditional systems can no longer meet. The launch of x402 is closely related to the rise of AI agents. AI agents can autonomously complete tasks, invoke services, and make payment decisions, gradually becoming an important economic force on the internet. Gartner predicts that by 2030, machine customers will influence more than $30 trillion in global transactions. Research from the World Economic Forum also indicates that the AI ​​agent market will grow from $7.84 billion in 2025 to $50.3 billion in 2030, a compound annual growth rate of 45%. The operational logic of AI agents dictates that payment systems must meet the following conditions: High frequency, small amounts: Each API call and data read may only involve transactions in the range of $0.001–$0.01. Full automation: The payment process requires no human intervention and must be fully programmable. 24/7 operation: Uninterrupted machine transactions require extremely high system stability. Cross-border universality: AI agents are not geographically limited and require a globally unified value settlement layer. Traditional payment networks are almost completely ineffective in these aspects, and x402 is designed precisely to meet these new demands. It can be said that the AI ​​economy is the true historical mission of the 402 protocol. In the past few years, the maturity of several key technologies has collectively constituted the conditions for the implementation of 402: Stablecoins: USDC, USDT, etc., provide a stable value anchor for micropayments, eliminating concerns about cryptocurrency volatility. Layer 2 scaling: Networks like Base and Polygon significantly reduce gas fees, making payments as low as $0.001 possible. Account abstraction and smart contract wallets: Bringing the blockchain payment experience close to Web2 levels, supporting access control, multi-signature, and transaction limits. Edge computing adoption: Vendors like Cloudflare can accelerate verification and payment confirmation globally, reducing latency. The combination of these conditions has finally brought the \"dormant 402\" protocol into its optimal window of opportunity. Under the x402 system, payment and HTTP requests form a standardized closed loop: Client accesses resource → Server returns a 402 status code, along with the payment amount, receiving address, and currency requirements. The client wallet automatically generates the payment transaction and submits it to the blockchain. Payment confirmation → Client re-requests the resource with proof of payment. Server verifies the payment → Returns the original content. This \"payment equals access\" experience makes micro-payments as natural as browsing a webpage, with users experiencing almost no complexity. The greatest strategic significance of the x402 protocol lies in the fact that it is not a closed solution from any single company, but an open standard. Coinbase and Cloudflare chose to open-source it and promoted the establishment of a foundation for governance to avoid control by a single company. This means: Any service provider can integrate it without barriers. The protocol layer is independent of specific business models and does not directly compete with ecosystem applications. It complements rather than replaces giants like Visa, Google, and Anthropic. This positioning enhances the acceptability of x402, making it more like internet infrastructure than a proprietary product of a single company. Looking back at the development of the internet over the past thirty years, payment has always been a missing link. The 402 status code is like an \"unlit puzzle piece,\" abandoned due to technological limitations and locked business paths. Now, with the rise of blockchain, stablecoins, and AI agents, this puzzle piece finally has a chance to be filled. The launch of the x402 protocol is not just a technological upgrade, but more likely a profound reconstruction of the internet business paradigm: From advertising-driven to value-driven; From account system to protocol native; From person-to-person payment to machine-to-machine payment. All of this is precisely the core message revealed in the \"Project Background and Overview\" section: x402 is not simply a payment tool, but a piece of the puzzle in the history of the internet that has been delayed for thirty years, finally having the opportunity to be realized in 2025. The x402 protocol is not merely the release of a technical specification, but a recombination involving multiple ecosystems. After the protocol's release, both Coinbase and Cloudflare emphasized that x402 is not a proprietary protocol of a single company, but a \"native internet payment layer standard.\" This openness defines it from the outset as the core of an ecosystem, rather than an isolated product. The ecosystem building surrounding x402 is focusing on infrastructure, platform applications, partner integration, developer communities, and market education, demonstrating a bottom-up network effect growth model. In other words, the market prospects and ecosystem expansion of x402 are not a single breakthrough, but the combined force of multiple links. At the infrastructure level, the x402 protocol has chosen the simplest approach: through deep compatibility with HTTP via the 402 status code, developers only need \"one line of code\" to enable payment functionality for websites or APIs. This extremely simple integration logic not only lowers the barrier to entry for small and medium-sized developers but also allows large platforms to avoid incurring huge migration costs during the exploration phase. The middleware, client libraries, multi-chain adapters, and other components provided by Coinbase and Cloudflare further reduce development and maintenance costs. In particular, the existence of multi-chain adapters allows service providers to choose the optimal blockchain execution environment based on their specific scenarios. For example, they can use Polygon for low-cost, high-concurrency requirements, the Ethereum mainnet for high-security scenarios, or achieve deep integration with the exchange system on Coinbase's own Base chain. This flexibility greatly enhances the protocol's universality, thus increasing its likelihood of becoming a de facto standard. At the platform level, Coinbase's x402 Bazaar is the earliest application scenario with an ecosystem in place. This marketplace platform for AI agents and developers allows service providers to list their APIs, data sources, or functional modules, which users or AI agents can then call upon as needed and pay instantly via the x402 protocol. Its value lies in solving the long-standing billing and integration challenges in the API economy. Previously, API monetization often required complex registration, subscription, and monthly billing processes. However, in the x402 Bazaar environment, payment is instantaneous upon call, and settlement is instantaneous upon payment. The micropayment attribute makes pay-per-use a reality. For AI agents, this means they can autonomously and flexibly call upon various services in the marketplace without relying on manual human authorization or credit card binding. This market mechanism aligns perfectly with the autonomy of AI agents, presenting Coinbase and Cloudflare with a highly promising growth point. If x402 Bazaar can accumulate sufficient supply and demand, it could very well evolve into the \"App Store of the AI ​​agent economy.\" Cloudflare's involvement brings another layer of explosive power to the protocol. As one of the world's largest CDN and cybersecurity service providers, Cloudflare controls over 20% of internet traffic entry points, and its Workers edge computing platform has become a tool for millions of developers to deploy lightweight services. Embedding x402 payment functionality into Cloudflare Workers means that countless small and medium-sized websites, APIs, and services can quickly integrate payment functionality with zero modification costs. This \"frictionless deployment\" allows the protocol to rapidly spread to the long-tail developer community, and long-tail applications are precisely the most vibrant scenario for the micropayment model. Whether it's unlocking articles on an independent blog or a single call to a niche tool, payment capabilities can be obtained with the support of Cloudflare's distribution capabilities. This strategy contrasts sharply with traditional payment gateways, which typically target medium to large enterprises and require complex integrations. x402, however, takes the opposite approach, starting with the long tail and developer communities before gradually supporting the mainstream commercial system. More importantly, x402 doesn't confine itself to the crypto-native ecosystem but actively seeks interoperability with traditional payment systems. Visa's involvement provides a crucial bridge for the entire ecosystem. Through interoperability with Visa's TAP protocol, x402 achieves compatibility between stablecoin payments and traditional credit card networks. This bridging design is strategically significant, avoiding direct competition with traditional payment networks and providing users and businesses with a dual-track option: in familiar scenarios, they can still use credit cards for payments, while in new scenarios such as machine-to-machine and cross-border micropayments, they can complete transactions with stablecoins through the x402 protocol. This gradual transition reduces the difficulty of market education, allowing traditional businesses and consumers to accept the new protocol with less psychological and technical cost. In other words, Visa's involvement makes x402 not just a Web3 experiment, but a pathway into the mainstream financial system. The participation of tech giants like Google, AWS, and Anthropic in the partner matrix is ​​equally noteworthy. Google's AP2 (Agent Payments Protocol) was originally designed as a unified payment framework for AI agents, supporting various traditional payment methods. Its integration with x402 adds the dimensions of stablecoins and on-chain payments. In Google's demonstration, users only need to issue a prompt, and the AI ​​agent can complete a series of actions with the support of AP2 and x402 extensions, including research, inventory confirmation, payment, and settlement. This experience showcases a typical \"end-to-end automated transaction\" process in the AI ​​agent era, with x402 serving as the underlying payment layer. Anthropic's involvement demonstrates the urgent need for such payment standards among AI companies. AI assistants like Claude will need to interact with numerous third-party services in the future, and automated payments are an indispensable part. Without standards like x402, AI assistants will find it difficult to operate completely autonomously in a commercial context. Ecosystem building not only relies on the promotion of large enterprises, but the role of the open-source community is equally crucial. The x402 protocol chose the open-source path from the outset, adopting the Apache-2.0 license and releasing its code on GitHub. Within just a few months, the protocol garnered over 1600 stars, with developers contributing SDKs in multiple languages, visual configuration tools, and sample applications. These community tools further lowered the barrier to entry for ordinary developers, driving the self-expansion of the ecosystem. Engineers from Coinbase and Cloudflare actively participated in community discussions, responding to feedback and regularly releasing improved versions. This open model is highly similar to the IETF standards-setting process in the early days of the internet, indicating that x402 may be on a path to true standardization. From a market size perspective, x402 sits at the intersection of two high-growth markets: global digital payments and the AI ​​agent economy. The global digital payments market is projected to exceed $10 trillion by 2025, while the AI ​​agent market is expected to reach $50 billion by 2030, with a CAGR exceeding 40%. This means that x402 not only has the potential to penetrate the existing massive payments market but can also play an infrastructure role in the emerging machine economy. API economics and digital content micropayments are the most direct application scenarios. The global API management market is projected to reach $6.18 billion by 2027, while paid content is experiencing a new wave of growth due to limitations in advertising models. Traditional subscription models restrict user experience to some extent, as users may only want to pay for a single article, a single piece of music, or a single tool call. The micropayment capabilities of the x402 protocol make this \"deconstruction of subscriptions\" possible, thereby driving more diversified business models. In terms of competition, the x402 protocol is not without rivals. Micropayment solutions within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as Lightning Network, already exist, and some decentralized applications also offer token-driven payment mechanisms. However, their limitation lies in their failure to integrate with the internet protocol layer, creating natural barriers to integration with HTTP, browsers, and APIs. While traditional payment networks are robust, they lack advantages in micropayments, low cross-border fees, and automation. x402 establishes a differentiated position with its HTTP-native, simple access, and cross-chain compatibility. It does not directly compete with any single payment system but provides a common \"interface\" for all parties through protocol standardization. This positioning makes it easier for it to gain support from multiple parties, thus forming a broad alliance ecosystem. In summary, the x402 protocol's ecosystem development has already shown early vitality: from Coinbase Bazaar to Cloudflare Workers, to the collaboration between Visa TAP and Google AP2, from the activity of the open-source community to the improvement of developer tools, from micro-payment scenarios in long-tail applications to the autonomous transaction needs of AI agents—all of this collectively outlines a vast potential market space. While the market outlook still carries uncertainties, especially regarding regulatory and large-scale adoption challenges, the overall direction is quite clear: x402 is becoming a key interface for the integration of the AI ​​economy and internet payments. If the first part emphasized the historical background and technological inevitability of the 402 protocol's birth, then this section on ecosystem development and market outlook reveals the chain reactions and reshaping of the business landscape it may trigger. The future of the protocol depends not only on technological maturity but also on whether the ecosystem can form a positive feedback loop. Once the network effect is established, its diffusion speed will far exceed the path of traditional payment innovation. <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>III. Investment Potential and Risks</strong></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If the x402 protocol has already demonstrated sufficient prospects and practical application logic at the technical and ecosystem levels, then for investors, the most crucial perspective remains how to assess its potential value and risks. This involves not only its potential network effect as a protocol standard, but also the commercial value that applications, platforms, and services built around the protocol can unleash, and more importantly, the challenges it may encounter in the coming years across multiple dimensions, including technology, regulation, and market acceptance. In other words, investors need to establish reasonable expectations between macro narratives and micro indicators in order to grasp the strategic opportunities inherent in the x402 protocol.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">First, from a potential perspective, the greatest value of x402 lies in its \"protocol-layer network effect.\" In the history of the internet, every successful underlying protocol has often become long-term infrastructure, possessing investment value that transcends economic cycles.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> For example, TCP/IP laid the foundation for the entire internet's communication framework, SSL/TLS became the de facto standard for secure communication, and SMTP propelled the widespread adoption of email. Once established, these technologies are extremely difficult to replace and can bring long-term benefits to the industries built upon them. If the x402 protocol can become the standard for \"payment as HTTP,\" its value lies not in the profitability of a single application, but in the reinvention of the entire internet business model. Once widely adopted, the x402 protocol could provide payment capabilities for millions of websites, billions of devices, and countless AI agents, continuously strengthening the network effect and ultimately forming a path dependency on the de facto standard. Once this standard dividend emerges, its value is difficult to measure using traditional valuation methods because it involves a fundamental restructuring of the entire industrial ecosystem. Secondly, from an ecosystem investment perspective, multiple layers of business opportunities may emerge around the x402 protocol. The most basic are protocol-related infrastructure services, such as payment gateways, authentication services, multi-chain adapters, and currency exchange services. These belong to the \"protocol tool layer,\" similar to the routers, firewalls, and load balancers that emerged around TCP/IP. This layer is usually the first to be commercialized because it provides the necessary support for protocol operation, which users and developers cannot bypass. At a higher level are platform-based applications, such as Coinbase's x402 Bazaar and Cloudflare's Workers integration, which may become the earliest scenarios to achieve scalable revenue. Further up are new business models derived from the protocol, such as AI agents calling third-party services on demand, content creators directly benefiting through micropayments, and machine payments between IoT devices. Once these models are validated by the market, they may generate long-term, stable cash flow. Investors should focus on these different levels of ecosystem opportunities when evaluating their investments, betting on both the robust growth of the underlying infrastructure and capturing the high elasticity of the application layer. However, all potential must be weighed against risk. The primary risk facing the x402 protocol is its technical scalability. In theory, Layer 2 blockchains and state channels can achieve low-cost, high-concurrency, but in practice, when AI agents truly emerge on a large scale, payment systems may need to handle hundreds of thousands or even millions of microtransactions per second. This pressure may exceed the capacity of existing public chains and Layer 2 blockchains, leading to transaction congestion, increased fees, and a degraded user experience. If scalability issues cannot be resolved, x402's micropayment advantages will be weakened, and it may even be surpassed by alternatives. Therefore, investors need to continuously monitor the protocol's performance in real-world environments, including key metrics such as average confirmation time, failure rate, fee curve, and multi-chain load distribution. The second risk dimension is regulatory uncertainty. While stablecoins have gradually gained acceptance in the mainstream financial system, their compliance status varies significantly across different countries. In the United States, stablecoins are under intense scrutiny from Congress and regulatory agencies, involving multiple requirements such as Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC), and payment licensing. In Europe, frameworks like MiCA provide some compliance pathways, but operational details are still evolving. In emerging markets, stablecoin payments may even be considered a threat to monetary sovereignty and subject to restrictions. While the x402 protocol's \"accountless, direct payment\" model offers an excellent user experience, it may conflict with the identity verification and AML requirements emphasized by regulators. If regulations tighten in major markets, the protocol's adoption rate could be severely impacted. Therefore, regulatory policy uncertainty is a core external risk affecting its commercialization process. Market acceptance uncertainty is also not to be ignored. While the demand for micropayments and AI-assisted payments is logically clear, user and business habits often exhibit path dependence. Most internet users are accustomed to subscription models and advertising subsidies, and their willingness to switch to pay-per-use remains to be seen and requires market education. Furthermore, security risks are a crucial factor. As a payment protocol, a vulnerability in x402 could lead to large-scale financial losses or a systemic crisis of trust. Although the protocol incorporates mechanisms for tamper-proofing, replay attack prevention, and minimal information leakage, it still faces challenges such as hacker attacks, smart contract vulnerabilities, and wallet security issues. Historical experience shows that any protocol involving fund flows must undergo long-term security verification and iteration to gradually gain market trust. Investors should pay attention to whether the protocol has experienced any major security incidents in actual operation, as well as the foundation and development team's investment and performance in security audits and emergency response. In terms of competition, while the x402 protocol possesses unique advantages such as HTTP native compatibility and cross-chain compatibility, it is not without alternative threats. Lightning Network, micropayment solutions on Rollups, and proprietary payment systems of large internet companies (such as Apple Pay and Google Pay) could all provide alternative solutions in certain scenarios. It's particularly noteworthy that if traditional payment networks rapidly iterate, launching low-fee, programmable micropayment tools and quickly gaining widespread adoption through their existing massive user base, x402's differentiated advantages could be partially weakened. Therefore, investors need to dynamically monitor competitors' actions and assess the sustainability of x402's differentiation. Despite the numerous risks, the investment value of the x402 protocol lies in the \"paradigm shift dividend\" it represents. Just as cloud computing, despite early security and compliance concerns, ultimately became an inevitable choice for IT infrastructure, the demand for an internet-native payment layer is almost irreversible. If x402 can establish a standard first and gain multi-party endorsement through open-source and foundation models, its long-term value will not lie in short-term profits, but in its strategic position as the \"underlying standard of the digital economy.\" For venture capital firms, this means that early-stage investments in related ecosystem companies may yield excess returns; for traditional financial institutions, participating in standard setting and ecosystem building can ensure a proactive position in the AI ​​agent economy; for industrial capital, building application scenarios around x402 may bring entirely new growth curves. Investors should pay attention to several core indicators to judge the protocol's progress in practice: first, adoption rate, including GitHub developer activity, SDK downloads, Cloudflare Workers integrations, and the number of connected websites and APIs; second, transaction indicators, including daily transaction volume, average order value, confirmation time, and failure rate; third, ecosystem indicators, including active supply and demand on Bazaar, and integration with mainstream AI platforms and content platforms; and fourth, compliance indicators, including the legal status of stablecoins, KYC/AML compliance schemes in various jurisdictions, and communication between the foundation and regulatory agencies. These indicators collectively constitute key signals of whether the protocol can cross the \"early experimentation—mainstream adoption\" gap. Overall, the investment potential of the x402 protocol lies in its potential to become a de facto standard for internet payments, empowering the AI ​​agent economy and micro-payment models, and driving the restructuring of internet business models. However, it also faces multiple risks, including technological, regulatory, market acceptance, and competitive challenges. For investors, the key is to correctly understand the relationship between its long-term logic and short-term fluctuations; they must see the potential standardization benefits while also being prepared to cope with the challenges brought by uncertainty. Only those investors who can participate early, continuously track, and flexibly adjust their strategies can truly capture the maximum value from this potential payment revolution. The x402 protocol is not only a technological innovation but also a structural reshaping of the internet payment system. By reactivating the HTTP 402 status code, which has been dormant for thirty years, it embeds payment into the basic protocol layer of the internet, thus opening up a path for value transfer beyond information transmission. Relying on blockchain, stablecoins, and Layer 2 scaling solutions, x402 achieves the characteristics of \"payment as settlement,\" \"extremely simple access,\" and \"chain independence,\" providing much-needed underlying capabilities for AI agent economies and micro-payment scenarios. The joint efforts of Coinbase and Cloudflare, along with the participation of giants like Visa, Google, and Anthropic, have endowed this protocol with the potential for cross-industry integration and standardization from its inception. The positive response from the open-source community has further injected vitality into long-tail innovation. However, risks cannot be ignored. Technical scalability still needs to be verified in real-world environments, regulatory uncertainty may slow global adoption, user and business payment habits need time to change, and competitors may provide alternatives in certain scenarios. In other words, for x402 to truly become mainstream, it needs to traverse three stages: \"feasibility verification—mass adoption—de facto standardization,\" a process influenced by technological iteration, policy evolution, and market education. From an investment perspective, the value of the x402 protocol lies not in its short-term revenue curve, but in the paradigm shift it may trigger: internet business models are expected to move from \"advertising subsidies and subscription lock-in\" to \"micropayments and instant value exchange,\" AI-assisted autonomous payments will drive the rise of the machine economy, and the global payment system may usher in a new unified interface. For businesses, early piloting and integration means gaining a competitive edge in the future ecosystem; for investors, the multi-layered opportunities surrounding the protocol itself and its ecosystem deserve close attention. Therefore, it can be said that the x402 protocol is a crucial node in the development of the internet. It is both a product of technological maturity, demand-driven growth, and ecosystem synergy, and the starting point of a leapfrog transformation. In the coming years, whether it can truly become the standard for the \"internet-native payment layer\" will determine whether it is a fleeting innovative experiment or the infrastructure for a new round of global business restructuring. Regardless of the final outcome, x402 has already illuminated a long-missing piece of the puzzle in the long history of the internet, opening up new possibilities for the future of value transfer.</p></div></div>",
