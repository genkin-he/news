            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Haotian; Source: X, @tmel0211</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Let's talk about the current situation of the x402 track and give a brief commentary, for reference only</strong>:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>1) The phrase \"change of leadership\" should actually be in quotation marks, but looking back, it's \"leading player\" that should be in quotation marks.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">PING attracted a lot of attention and made the track popular, but it failed to show its kingly dominance. It's all about timing and fate. It's not even close to the GOAT of the past. Who can blame them when the liquidity is dry?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">PAYAI's name, Pay, played a big role. Facilitator did play a significant role in the technical architecture of x402, but the overall technical threshold of the x402 track is not high, so most people are still rushing in with the mentality of speculating on MEME.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Therefore, regarding the current track, I tend to think that it's too early to talk about the \"top two\" players, at least it's not stable yet, but fortunately the track's popularity hasn't waned, waiting for the next turning point; 2) Many people complain that CEXs aren't supporting the x402 track. Yes, I'd also like to know why. But the fact is, the resurgence of on-chain innovation has gone from providing valuable assets for exchanges to the awkward situation of stealing CEXs' attention. This is the fundamental motivation for me to keep advocating for on-chain innovation; once on-chain innovation is passive, more innovation will be stifled. However, we can also see the clues of exchanges' strategies. I wrote a suggestion to Star Xu, and he should have taken it to heart by looking at XLayer's recent actions. In addition, OKX's listing of Virtuals also expresses its attitude; they need to find certainty amidst the chaos. Therefore, it is expected that many more \"regulars\" in the x402 track will receive offers from OKX. Interestingly, Bybit reacted particularly quickly, quietly launching PAYAI's Alpha when PING was trending, and Mantle is also making a series of moves related to the x402 track. This shows that CEXs are not completely indifferent; the rise of the x402 track is an opportunity for them to break the unfair competition among their peers, and a key juncture for them to pull the industry back from the hype and infighting surrounding MEME to the main theme of technology. Caution indicates they are taking it seriously, which can be seen as a positive sign; 3) Many pessimists compare the x402 track to the early days of inscription and the later AI Agent craze, believing that the hype is only temporary and will eventually end in chaos. I acknowledge the existence of a bubble, and that most projects will inevitably fail, but I am optimistic about its long-term intrinsic value. I've analyzed the reasons for this in previous articles. In short, Inscription is an asset issuance game where inscriptions are merely decorative carvings on gold. x402's current focus is on AI Pay infrastructure services; Launchpad's numerous appearances haven't truly taken off yet, and it's not purely based on operational logic. As for the AI ‚Äã‚ÄãAgent craze, I believe the x402 sector's current popularity is a continuation of the previous AI Agent wave, evolving from meaningless scenarios where AI Agents only chatted to AI Agents participating in payments. This transformation is significant and difficult to disprove. That's all. In short, don't be discouraged. To sum it up in one sentence: The x402 track currently lacks a true main driving force, and many Dev teams are likely preparing new innovative products, gameplay, and mechanics... CEX teams are also quietly preparing their strategies... Be patient, maintain your confidence, and let the dust settle.</p></div></div>",

The Era of Retail Investing Requires New Wisdom</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The lowering of barriers to entry in financial markets has rapidly expanded the participation of retail investors.</strong> Today, anyone with just a smartphone can access global markets anytime, anywhere. Everyone has easy access to professional information, including company disclosures, financial statements, and analyst reports. Market access and information access have never been so convenient. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"qUnp1lsQ7a41ZbDuR7tE7olMILmh8hQqgz8bMiNl.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410297_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410297\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: JPMorgan Chase</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>However, despite improvements in market and information access, sufficient infrastructure has not been provided to effectively analyze and utilize data. The complex market environment and higher volatility have increased the burden on retail investors.</strong> Investors must monitor massive amounts of data from multiple services to invest in various assets, including national stock markets and cryptocurrencies. Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange plan to emulate the cryptocurrency market model and establish 24-hour trading systems. The investment environment will undergo more dramatic changes. Retail investors lack sufficient infrastructure to cope with this complexity. Since investing is not their primary profession, they lack the time and resources to systematically analyze massive amounts of data. Complex financial data places a huge cognitive burden on understanding and utilizing it. Many retail investors, while having access to a wealth of information, fail to use it effectively and in a timely manner. They rely on social media, fragmented news, apps, or homemade spreadsheets to make investment decisions. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"WQtWYR4JvDKIV4gLll8ckkak4i5pW1mFCOfxfbZK.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410298_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410298\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Bloomberg Terminal</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Institutional investors typically use professional systems like the Bloomberg Terminal to manage this complexity. Ultra-high-net-worth individuals access personalized portfolio management and customized investment strategies through private bankers. The Bloomberg Terminal costs tens of thousands of dollars annually and requires professional training. Private banking services require a minimum of several billion Korean won in assets.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Most retail investors cannot access these professional tools.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> However, retail investors face the same market environment as institutional investors. Increased market participation forces retail investors to make quick and accurate decisions in complex and volatile markets. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have opened up new possibilities for bridging this information gap. Today, services can analyze massive amounts of data in real time, like the Bloomberg Terminal, while also providing personalized investment insights to retail investors like private bankers. Edgen is a leading example of this possibility. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Edgen: An AI-powered Bloomberg Terminal for All Investors</h2><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"1SxFyIBEWZlFCjQhBb9qdknJgqE8ognnhKTlBL7Y.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410299_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410299\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Edgen is an AI-driven financial intelligence platform designed to be \"an AI-powered Bloomberg terminal for everyone.\" The platform enables retail investors to seamlessly monitor and analyze the stock and cryptocurrency markets from a single interface.</p> ... <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"l1XAEBX5keGrTt9Y6FpEeWfAqy1HdvsQf1VyBCiB.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410300_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410300\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Tiger Research</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Edgen's capabilities go far beyond simple data aggregation. The platform transforms fragmented data into actionable insights. Traditional financial information platforms provide raw data such as news, charts, and financial statements, while Edgen analyzes this data and delivers investment insights in multiple formats: conversational answers, visual charts, comprehensive reports, and quantitative scores tailored to each investor.</p> Edgen goes a step further, building personalized analytics tailored to each investor's investment style and goals. The platform presents optimized, personalized insights, rather than showing the same data to all users. This approach is similar to personalized social media feeds. Just as Facebook and Instagram show different content to each user, Edgen provides different dashboards for each investor. For example, in the same Bitcoin market, long-term investors might receive a personalized pivot point alert saying \"Bottomed out, consider adding to your position,\" while short-term traders might see a personalized pivot point alert saying \"Short-term oversold zone, watch for potential rebound.\" <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"9i0KGmTXg3NlwAJrD55HH91XmrNTFl94TNoiDLu1.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410301_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410301\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Efficient Decision Guidance Model (EDGM) supports this function.</strong>. EDGM coordinates various specialized agents and tools through a multi-agent system, rather than operating as a single holistic model. Unlike general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that only process language and words, this inference model interprets user queries and assigns them to appropriate professional agents based on a specialized investment framework (macroeconomic analysis, technical analysis, fundamental analysis) and real-time market data. Each agent utilizes a guidance model and a knowledge model to collect the necessary data. This process integrates real-time market data, individual investor search history, portfolio composition, and trading patterns. The system also references data from investors with similar investment characteristics. Subsequently, market tools and the Large Language Model (LLM) process and synthesize the collected data, presenting the results in the form of conversational responses, charts, or reports. This solution combines the comprehensive market analysis of the Bloomberg Terminal with the personalized strategy development of private banks on a single platform. Now, retail investors can also access financial information previously only available to institutional investors and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">3. How Edgen Supports the Entire Investment Process</h2><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">3.1 Market Discovery: Uncovering Investment Opportunities</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In today's complex markets, even experienced investors struggle to find valuable investment opportunities. Investors must sift through and analyze massive amounts of data: countless news reports, charts, financial statements, and social media signals. Edgen simplifies this process through a variety of methods.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"jkSbWJ2LqY7A0iabZIBHGk3vReykSo4JDOdxjHfK.gif\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410302\" title=\"7410302\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Edgen's search function allows investors to explore the market in a conversational manner without directly analyzing complex financial data. For example, when an investor asks, \"Why has Tesla's stock price recently fallen?\", Edgen analyzes the company's news, financial situation, technical indicators, and market sentiment simultaneously, providing a comprehensive answer. Personalization also plays a role here. Edgen learns from users' search history, identifies the themes, industries, and indicators that each investor values, and then progressively tailors search results and investment recommendations to that user. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"7eRGIA6x6zqymYTdHiRdGQlEFq5AMxtBRPhF4GHc.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410303_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410303\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Investment Philosophy: Systematically uncover noteworthy market opportunities through thematic sections. \"Hot Stocks\" and \"Hot Cryptocurrencies\" highlight assets with strong market momentum. \"Stock Screener\" and \"Cryptocurrency Screener\" allow investors to create custom asset lists by setting criteria such as market capitalization, trading volume, and price action. The \"Cryptocurrency Attention &amp; Funding\" section captures signals unique to the cryptocurrency market.</p> ... ‚ÄúCryptocurrency Attention‚Äù tracks tokens that are rapidly gaining popularity on social media in real time using X‚Äôs (formerly Twitter) ‚ÄúHotness Index.‚Äù ‚ÄúLatest Funding‚Äù provides information on recently funded projects, including funding size and participating investors. ‚ÄúDecentralized Exchange Tracker‚Äù analyzes on-chain transactions to reveal the flow of funds from professional investors. <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">3.2. Intelligent Portfolio Management: Asset Valuation and Management</h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"G8U0sMCSkrVQm4i4lHMJfz1LzdxTewGiijCGOZU2.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410304_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410304\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">After identifying investment opportunities, investors need tools to deeply analyze assets and continuously monitor their trends. 360¬∞ reports can automatically generate comprehensive analyses for individual assets.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> The system evaluates stocks from four perspectives: valuation, growth, profitability, and momentum, and cryptocurrencies from three perspectives: fundamentals, token economic models, and momentum. Edgen's professional analysts analyze each category and assign ratings from A+ to D-. The platform transparently displays the analysis process so investors can verify the basis of each analyst's judgment. In addition to analyzing individual assets, investors must also manage multiple assets holistically. Edgen offers intelligent portfolio management features. Investors can manage their portfolio of stocks and cryptocurrencies on a single screen. The portfolio offers three views: a \"Market View\" displaying real-time prices and asset ratings; a \"360¬∞ Report View\" summarizing in-depth analysis of each asset; and a \"News View\" filtering and providing news relevant to the portfolio. Edgen plans to further advance its Smart Portfolio functionality. The platform will offer a comprehensive portfolio score that goes beyond single asset ratings, along with specific action plans to help investors achieve higher ratings. 3.3 Customization Tools: Building Your Own Investment Strategy Edgen provides a Smart Assistant Store for investors who require more specialized analysis. This store offers a range of AI assistants focused on specific investment areas. Investors can directly select and deploy smart assistants that match their investment style and goals. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"zBIOMD0gLCHJN3yR9GK4pvGAW12sIJVnj8cTSoUt.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410306_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410306\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For example, the technical signal broker automatically calculates indicators such as RSI, MACD, and moving averages, and then gives a \"bullish\" or \"bearish\" judgment, providing a comprehensive three-star rating. The pivot point alert broker detects when assets are approaching local highs or lows, helping investors optimize trading timing at key inflection points. Other brokers offer various functions, including on-chain activity analysis and TGE pre-opportunity discovery. Investors can choose and deploy the brokers they need based on their own goals. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"l2PCL8BDfSVB84B3RyfQHgR5BxBG3NUoBiiklfHR.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410307_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410307\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition, Edgen is about to launch an intelligent trade execution function, which can automatically execute investors' trade requests. For stock trading, the Edgen platform can interface with platforms such as Robinhood and XStocks; for cryptocurrency trading, Edgen can integrate with protocols such as Hyperliquid and Pendle. The AI ‚Äã‚Äãassistant can understand the investor's intent and execute trades directly. With this function, Edgen is moving from an intelligent platform to a comprehensive investment operation platform.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"x0S74xd0t7RA0V5zmKE6yePMQrtHo6L2jkoB5f1H.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410308_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410308\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Users earn Aura Points by publishing market analysis or insights on the platform or sharing such content on social media. 30% of the reward pool is used for distribution activities, and 70% is used for AI training contributions. The platform evaluates all contributions through AI scoring, community assessment, and expert verification. Users can view their Aura Points through the platform's leaderboards and on X (formerly Twitter) via browser extensions. The system divides points into three levels: Aura, Super Aura, and Ultra Aura.</p> ... The platform publicly records the provider of each analysis and its submission time. User-provided insights are used to train artificial intelligence. User contributions improve AI, which in turn provides users with better analysis, creating a virtuous cycle. Through this participatory structure, Edgen has gradually evolved into a platform that learns and progresses together with the community. 5. From Wall Street to Every Street Bloomberg Terminal and private banking services have long served only institutional investors and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. These institutions maintain an overwhelming competitive advantage in the market thanks to their unique information channels and analytical tools. Meanwhile, retail investors can only make investment decisions with incomplete information, fragmented data, and limited tools. The increasing complexity of the market further widens this gap. The variables that investors must consider are growing exponentially: on-chain data analysis, social media signal tracking, global market trend identification, and so on. In such a massive deluge of information, it's nearly impossible for individual investors to uncover meaningful insights and make timely investment decisions. Edgen bridges this information gap. The platform automates complex analytical tasks through a multi-agent system and integrates stocks and cryptocurrencies into a unified interface. Investors can now easily access institutional-grade analytics tools without having to collect and cross-reference information across multiple platforms. Edgen takes a further step in personalized financial intelligence. The platform provides optimized analysis and strategies tailored to each investor's style, risk tolerance, and goals. This approach goes beyond simply providing institutional tools to retail investors. Edgen essentially provides each investor with their own personal banker. Retail investing is rapidly diversifying. Edgen, through artificial intelligence, transforms \"Wall Street privilege\" into \"opportunity for everyone.\" Financial information once accessible only to a select few is now available to all investors. The investment landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation. </div></div>",

White House Press Secretary Levitt stated bluntly in a statement: \"The Biden administration's war on cryptocurrencies is over.\"</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">Four months ago, Changpeng Zhao was still serving time in Seattle federal prison, sentenced to four months in prison for failing to establish an effective anti-money laundering mechanism and violating US economic sanctions regulations.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"> Now, he has not only regained his freedom but also received a presidential pardon, a turn of events that has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. From imprisonment to presidential pardon, Zhao Changpeng's fall was as rapid as his rise. In November 2023, this entrepreneur, who once topped the list of the richest Chinese people with a net worth of $94.1 billion, admitted to violating US anti-money laundering regulations, and Binance paid a record-breaking $4.3 billion fine. He also resigned as CEO. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland stated at the time, \"Binance became the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange partly because of the crimes it committed.\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen further criticized Binance for \"ignoring\" its legal obligations in its pursuit of profits, allowing funds to flow through its platform to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers. In April 2024, a Seattle federal court sentenced Changpeng Zhao to four months in prison, far less than the three-year sentence initially sought by prosecutors. The judge told Zhao, \"No one is immune from prosecution or above U.S. law, regardless of wealth, power, or status.\" Now, Trump's pardon has erased Zhao's criminal record, clearing the way for his return to the cryptocurrency arena. The Political Deal Behind the Pardon Trump's decision to pardon Changpeng Zhao was not without precedent. In March 2025, the Wall Street Journal reported that representatives of the Trump family had negotiated a stake in the cryptocurrency exchange Binance US. The report at the time indicated that Zhao had served four months in prison after pleading guilty and was seeking leniency from the Trump administration. Although Zhao denied the reports on the X platform, the contact between the Trump family and Binance has raised questions about a potential conflict of interest. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the Trump family's cryptocurrency business, which has been operating since the 2024 election, has generated $4.5 billion in revenue and has a partnership with the trading platform Binance, which is quietly managed. This pardon decision has therefore been viewed by outsiders as potentially involving a quid pro quo. Trump described his pardon decision as ending the Biden administration's \"political persecution\" of the crypto industry. However, this explanation cannot conceal the possible commercial ties between his family and Binance. The Rise and Fall of Changpeng Zhao: Changpeng Zhao's story is a microcosm of the cryptocurrency industry. Born in Jiangsu, China in 1977, Zhao Changpeng immigrated to Canada with his parents at the age of 10. During his teenage years, he worked at a Chevron gas station and McDonald's, and also served as a volleyball referee. At the age of 13, his father bought him an IBM-compatible 286 computer, an investment that helped him embark on a career in technology. He later earned a bachelor's degree in computer science from McGill University and subsequently developed systems for the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Bloomberg Futures Trading. In 2013, Zhao Changpeng first learned about cryptocurrency while playing poker. He subsequently sold his Shanghai apartment and invested approximately $1 million in cryptocurrency at $600 per coin. Even after his Shanghai property doubled in value while cryptocurrency prices halved, he remained bullish on the latter. In 2017, Zhao Changpeng founded Binance in Hong Kong. With the surge in cryptocurrency prices, Binance rapidly grew into the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. At the end of 2021, Changpeng Zhao topped the Forbes list of the richest Chinese people with a net worth of $90 billion. However, Binance's rapid expansion was accompanied by compliance risks. US regulators alleged that Binance failed to establish an effective anti-money laundering mechanism and violated US economic sanctions regulations. These issues ultimately led to his conflict with the US judicial system. The Legal and Political Realities Behind Pardons: The US president's power of pardon originates from Article II, Section 2 of the US Constitution, which, except in cases of impeachment, grants probation and pardons to those who violate federal laws. This virtually unlimited power allowed Trump to drop Zhao Changpeng's criminal conviction. This wasn't the first time Trump had used his pardon power. Before his term ended in January 2021, he pardoned dozens of people, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner's father and former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. At the time, some US media outlets even reported that Trump's allies and aides received fees from those seeking presidential pardons. For Zhao Changpeng, the actual legal value of the pardon may be limited, as he has already served his sentence. However, its symbolic significance is enormous‚Äîthe pardon erases his criminal record, paving the way for his return to the business and political arena. A New Chapter in Cryptocurrency Regulation Trump's decision to pardon Changpeng Zhao symbolizes a shift in US cryptocurrency policy. The White House explicitly stated that this move aims to end the Biden administration's stringent regulations on the cryptocurrency industry. In recent years, global regulation of cryptocurrencies has been continuously tightening. In 2023, with the bankruptcy of FTX, one of the world's top five cryptocurrency exchanges, regulations on cryptocurrencies became even stricter in various countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission also filed 13 charges against Binance. Chen Jia, a researcher at the International Monetary Institute of Renmin University of China, pointed out that for cryptocurrencies to achieve sustainable development in the future, they urgently need to address four key issues: compliance, security, risk control, and liquidity. These are also the four cornerstones of future US cryptocurrency exchanges. Trump's pardon of Changpeng Zhao sends a clear signal: his administration will adopt a more lenient regulatory stance towards the cryptocurrency industry. This policy shift may open the door for Binance to re-enter the US market. For Changpeng Zhao, the pardon signifies a new beginning. In a September interview with Caixin, Zhao mentioned focusing more on his venture capital firm, YZi Labs, and has been invited to serve as an official cryptocurrency industry advisor to several governments. Binance may also face significant changes. Although the settlement agreement required Binance to completely withdraw from the US and appoint a five-year oversight officer, Trump's pardon may create favorable conditions for Binance's return to the US market. Meanwhile, Changpeng Zhao is also expected to rejoin Binance's management. His previous sentence prohibited him from participating in Binance's management or decision-making activities for three years after his release, but the amnesty may lift this restriction. The market reacted positively to Zhao's return. Following the amnesty news, BNB rose 7%, returning above $1100, and Bitcoin also returned to $110,000. This market reaction shows that investors view Zhao's return as a positive development for the industry. Trump's amnesty has rewritten Zhao's fate, but the global cryptocurrency game has only just begun. As the Trump family's relationship with Binance deepens, and as Changpeng Zhao moves among political figures worldwide, the future of cryptocurrency will become inextricably linked to geopolitics. Zhao Changpeng's promise after his release to \"do everything in his power to help the United States become the cryptocurrency capital\" carries profound implications. Wherever he goes, the future of cryptocurrency will be reshaped in the clash between national interests and decentralized ideals.</span></p></div></div>",

            "title": "Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio: Gold is the safest currency",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Ray Dalio, Founder of Bridgewater Associates; Source: X, @RayDalio; Translated by: Shaw Jinse Finance</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Recently, I've received a lot of questions about gold, so I decided to answer them all and compile them into a compilation of frequently asked gold questions. I've also added this content to my \"digital avatar,\" Digital Ray, so that more people can discuss this topic in depth.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But I'd also like to briefly share what I believe are the most important points about gold, which is the purpose of this article.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>In my opinion, gold is a form of currency, and one with the least risk of devaluation and/or confiscation‚Äîthat's beyond question.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here are the reasons why I believe this is the case.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>For thousands of years, gold has been considered currency in almost every country, while all other currencies have disappeared.</strong> Its operation is as follows, and remains so today. Throughout history, all currencies (i.e., circulating currencies) have either been: 1) \"Gold-pegged/hard-asset-backed\" currencies, referring to currencies pegged to gold or similar globally recognized assets with limited supply (such as silver). These currencies are backed by government commitments allowing individuals or governments to exchange \"paper money\" for gold (or other \"hard assets,\" such as silver) at a fixed exchange rate. 2) \"Fiat\" currencies, referring to currencies not pegged to any asset/not backed by any asset, and therefore their supply is unlimited. Historically, when a monetary system is pegged to gold and the debt (i.e., the commitment to deliver gold money) is too high relative to the existing total amount of gold money, the monetary system collapses. This is because world leaders either: a) adhere to their commitment to gold-backed currencies, leading to debt defaults and deflationary depressions; or b) break their promise to deliver gold at the promised price, thereby creating a large amount of money and credit, which typically leads to currency devaluation, which in turn drives up inflation and gold prices. Before the advent of central banks (introduced in the US in 1913), economies generally followed a) a deflationary path; after the advent of central banks, they followed b) an inflationary path. Either way, this leads to a severe collapse/crisis of the debt/monetary system, reducing the debt-to-income ratio and ultimately fixing prices at a new, higher level. (This is why prices rise over time.) The two most recent collapses of gold-backed monetary systems occurred in 1933 and 1971. In 1971, we abandoned the gold-backed monetary system and adopted a fiat currency system. Because we are now in a fiat currency system, studying what happened in the past when fiat currency systems had excess debt relative to the funds needed to repay it is particularly relevant to the present. In those situations, central banks would invariably issue large amounts of money and credit, which typically led to higher inflation and rising gold prices. In all these cases, gold performed exceptionally well as an alternative to \"paper debt money.\" It is the strongest store of value in the long run. This is why it is now the second largest reserve currency held by central banks worldwide. However, this does not mean that other currencies are less effective at storing wealth than gold in the long run. This is because \"paper money\" generates interest, while gold does not. Therefore, when interest rates depreciate more rapidly relative to paper money, these paper currencies can generate higher returns. If one chooses to engage in market timing (which I advise against), then one should hold paper money when interest rates are high enough to offset the default and depreciation risks of holding paper debt. However, when interest rates are insufficient to compensate for the devaluation and default risks of paper currency debt, holding gold is the wise choice. Alternatively, one can choose not to try to time the market but instead hold a certain amount of gold. Like cash, gold has a low real yield of approximately 1.2% and is negatively correlated with cash. Therefore, in any environment requiring liquidity, gold and cash can be considered good options. Gold is also favored because it carries a lower risk of confiscation than other currencies and assets. This is because gold's value does not depend on payments from others, and it is more difficult for individuals or governments to confiscate it. Gold is the most difficult currency to seize because it can be safely held by individuals, unlike other currencies that require payments to acquire value. It is also not susceptible to theft in cyberattacks. Therefore, when there is a high risk of currency confiscation, such as: a) financial crises leading to high taxes and other confiscation policies; b) economic and currency wars between nations (e.g., sanctions), gold becomes the preferred asset. Therefore, during periods of currency/debt crisis and/or war, when the risk of foreclosure increases, the value of gold rises significantly (or more accurately, it is the only currency that does not depreciate). This is why gold has long been the most fundamental currency and, for a very long time, its value has kept pace with the cost of living, boasting the best track record. This is how the debt/currency/gold dynamic works, and it remains so today. This is especially true when debt is large relative to the amount of money needed to repay it, and when there is the risk of foreclosure. As an investment asset, I treat gold like any other asset when constructing a portfolio, examining its expected returns, risks, correlations with other assets, and liquidity to develop a strategic asset allocation plan. Then, I consider tactical adjustments to the portfolio based on market dynamics. Therefore, I believe that gold, as part of an investment portfolio, has certain characteristics, much like holding a certain amount of cash. This view is quite different from how most people view gold, who generally see it as a speculative market. Viewing gold as a base currency has been very helpful to me, and perhaps you should consider it too. If you disagree with my view, please let me know, and we can discuss the truth together to better address this issue. When I consider how much gold should be held in an investment portfolio, I first and foremost consider it as a strategic asset allocation, not a tactical/market timing decision. I believe that everyone should start investing by understanding and holding an investment portfolio that best suits them, unaffected by any market timing perspective. Adjustments to an existing portfolio should only be made when investors believe they have a greater ability to time the market and determine which investments are better. Most investors do not possess this ability, therefore they should stick to their established strategic asset allocation. Therefore, when investors ask me whether they should decide to buy or sell gold based on price fluctuations, I tell them it's a secondary strategic question. Their primary concern should be how much gold they should hold in their strategic asset allocation. Based on my own analysis, this percentage ranges from 5% to 15%, depending on the other assets in their portfolio and their risk appetite. As for tactically overweighting or underweighting gold in a portfolio based on market timing, as mentioned earlier, gold should be overweighted when the risk of monetary system collapse, currency confiscation, and economic/currency wars (such as sanctions) is high; and underweighted at other times, because gold has historically been a relatively poor-performing asset (like cash) because it is not a productive asset. In short, what I'm trying to say is that you should treat gold as a base currency and hold at least a certain percentage of it. However, most investors do not hold gold.</p></div></div>",

Policy: Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission Chairman: Proposed to provide guidance for digital asset treasuries and study the issue of listed companies purchasing Bitcoin. Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission Chairman Wong Tin-yau stated that Hong Kong currently has no regulations governing listed companies' participation in cryptocurrency investment. He added that the market situation will be monitored, and relevant guidance will be studied for the market. Wong Tin-yau added that Hong Kong currently lacks legislation to regulate listed companies' participation in virtual asset treasury arrangements. Regarding listed companies claiming to adopt Digital Asset Treasuries (DAT), Wong urged investors to carefully understand what DAT is and its underlying value. He also stated that he would study the issue of listed companies purchasing Bitcoin. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) recently completed its Digital Hong Kong Dollar pilot program. Chief Executive Eddie Yue stated that the work related to \"digital Hong Kong Dollar\" (e-HKD) and tokenization is part of a grand vision to establish a comprehensive digital currency framework that promotes the complementary coexistence of different forms of tokenized currencies, such as digital Hong Kong Dollars, tokenized deposits, and regulated stablecoins. Yue made the above statement in an article dated October 30, 2025. He revealed that Hong Kong's next phase of fintech development blueprint will be announced at the 10th Fintech Week in Hong Kong next week, ensuring that Hong Kong continues to be at the forefront of fintech. At the technical launch of the second phase report of the \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar\" pilot program held by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on October 28, the HKMA outlined Hong Kong's digital currency framework, dividing it into \"public currency\" and \"private currency.\" The digital Hong Kong dollar, issued by the HKMA, is a public currency; according to the issuer, tokenized deposits issued by commercial banks, electronic stored-value payment instruments such as WeChat Pay and Alipay issued by licensed institutions in Hong Kong, and regulated stablecoins are all classified as private currencies. <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>‚ñåQian Zhimin Pleads Guilty in UK Court; Police Report: Continued Cross-Border Fugitive Apprehension and Asset Recovery Cooperation</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On October 30, the Hedong Branch of the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau reported that on April 21, 2017, the Hedong Branch of the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau opened an investigation into Tianjin Lantian Gree Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for suspected illegal absorption of public deposits. The main suspect, Qian Zhimin, fled to the UK. The Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau has been conducting in-depth international cooperation with British law enforcement agencies through international law enforcement and judicial cooperation channels to pursue fugitives and recover assets. On September 29, 2025, the Southwark Court in London, UK, held a trial for Qian Zhimin's alleged money laundering crimes, and Qian Zhimin pleaded guilty in court. Currently, the public security organs are continuing cross-border cooperation with British law enforcement agencies to pursue fugitives and recover assets, making every effort to recover the losses of those who participated in the fundraising scheme. At the same time, those who participated in the fundraising scheme are reminded to cooperate with the public security organs in handling the case according to law, express their demands and report situations reasonably and legally, and not to believe or spread rumors.</p> ... The public security authorities have not entrusted any third-party institutions to provide legal guidance to investors intending to appear in court, nor have they entrusted any third-party institutions to conduct cross-border fugitive repatriation and asset recovery work. Investors are advised to be wary of so-called cross-border recovery agents to avoid being scammed. The European Central Bank (ECB) hopes to launch a digital euro pilot program in 2027. The ECB stated on Thursday that it may launch its digital currency pilot program in 2027 if it receives timely approval from legislators. The ECB believes the project is crucial to the financial autonomy of the eurozone. It sees it as a strategic alternative to US-dominated private payment methods such as credit cards and stablecoins. The ECB stated that this move is increasingly important in an era of escalating geopolitical tensions, as financial autonomy and resilience are considered key to maintaining European economic sovereignty. After four years of research and preparation, the ECB said it is currently considering a pilot program, meaning some digital euro transactions could begin as early as mid-2027, with a full rollout two years later. <hr/><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Blockchain Applications</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>‚ñåMetalpha Raises $12 Million in Strategic Investment from Gortune and Avenir Group</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">According to PR Newswire, Nasdaq-listed Metalalpha Technology Holding Ltd.

Xi Jinping pointed out that both teams should refine and finalize follow-up work as soon as possible, uphold and implement the consensus, and deliver tangible results to reassure both China and the US, as well as the world economy. The recent twists and turns in China-US economic and trade relations have also provided some insights for both sides. Economic and trade relations should continue to be the ballast and engine of China-US relations, not a stumbling block or point of conflict. Both sides should consider the bigger picture and focus on the long-term benefits of cooperation, rather than falling into a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation. Both teams can continue discussions based on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit, continuously narrowing the list of issues and expanding the list of collaborations. <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>‚ñåBessenter: A candidate for the next Fed Chair may be selected before Christmas</strong> U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessenter: A candidate for the next Fed Chair may be selected before Christmas.

Bessant said, \"The Fed is stuck in the past.

The House measures will save $10 billion in 2025 and $10 billion in 2026. The Federal Reserve will roll over all maturing Treasury principal starting in December. The Fed mentioned in its FOMC statement that starting December 1, it will roll over all maturing U.S. Treasury principal payments. This means the Fed will reinvest the principal of maturing Treasury bonds into new U.S. Treasury bonds, maintaining its asset size and ending balance sheet reduction. This move is generally seen as a signal of a shift towards looser monetary policy or at least the end of a tightening cycle. According to Jinse Finance, citing CME's \"FedWatch,\" the probability of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 25 basis points in December is 74.7%, while the probability of keeping rates unchanged is 25.3%. The probability of the Fed cumulatively cutting rates by 25 basis points by January next year is 57.7%, the probability of keeping rates unchanged is 16.6%, and the probability of a cumulative rate cut of 50 basis points is 25.6%. (Jinse Encyclopedia) Will Google's Willow quantum chip affect Bitcoin security? Google's Willow chip marks a new era of quantum performance, enabling complex calculations and having a significant impact on various industries, including cryptography. With Google's unveiling of its 105-qubit Willow chip, built on the company's Sycamore processor, quantum computing has reached a significant milestone. Willow nearly doubles the number of qubits in Sycamore, unlocking the ability to handle exponentially more complex computations. One of Willow's most notable advancements is its progress in quantum error correction, a crucial step towards scalable, fault-tolerant quantum systems. In benchmarks such as random circuit sampling (a test of a quantum computer's ability to solve complex problems), Willow completed tasks in minutes that would take conventional supercomputers billions of years to accomplish. Quantum computers using algorithms like Shor and Grover have the potential to solve complex problems exponentially faster, potentially breaking traditional cryptographic algorithms. The rollout of powerful quantum computers like Willow has raised concerns about its impact on cryptographic security, including the impact of the Willow chip on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and many other blockchain systems rely on cryptographic algorithms designed to resist classical attacks. However, the potential impact of quantum computing on cryptographic security has raised concerns. Google's Willow quantum chip currently poses no direct threat to Bitcoin's encryption system. Cracking Bitcoin's ECDSA or SHA-256 encryption requires at least 1,500-3,000 fault-tolerant logical qubits, far exceeding Willow's capabilities. The scalability of current quantum systems is insufficient to challenge Bitcoin's robust defenses. Bitcoin's layered encryption structure, combining ECDSA and SHA-256, ensures resistance to today's quantum technologies. This technological gap currently guarantees the security of Bitcoin's encryption measures.</div></div>",

            "title": "Being the chief trader is no longer enough; is Trump going to personally take charge?",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div>Trump is upgrading his influence in the financial markets from simply posting recommendations to directly entering the game. The US president, jokingly referred to as the \"chief trader,\" is now preparing to truly \"open the door\" through his company‚Äîentering the prediction market business. According to the latest media reports, Trump Media Technology Group announced on Tuesday that it will launch the prediction market service Truth Predict on its social platform Truth Social in partnership with Crypto.com. This service will allow users to bet on the outcomes of events such as sports, entertainment, politics, and economic trends, and plans to roll it out globally after meeting regulatory requirements. The timing of this move is quite delicate, as Trump and his family members have repeatedly faced scrutiny in recent years due to unusual stock price fluctuations and allegations of insider trading. From the stock price surge before family members joined the company to Trump's \"buy\" call before tariff policy changes, a series of events have made the market highly sensitive to the trading behavior of his camp. Prediction markets are becoming the hottest new arena on Wall Street. According to research platform Dune, prediction market trading volume hit a record high of over $2.3 billion last week. The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the NYSE, recently invested $2 billion in Polymarket, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plans to launch related contracts before the end of the year. The entry of traditional financial giants is pushing this market, once considered a \"digital casino,\" into the mainstream. Truth Predict: From \"Social Platform\" to \"Prediction Market\" Trump Media Technology Group's entry into the prediction market is a continuation of its strategy of deep integration with the cryptocurrency industry. The company will launch its prediction market service through the Truth Social social platform, the streaming platform Truth+, and the fintech brand Truth.Fi, in partnership with the cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com. The service will first undergo beta testing on Truth Social before a full rollout in the United States. Trump Media plans to launch the service globally once all necessary requirements are met. Prediction markets allow users to profit by predicting the outcomes of events such as sports, entertainment, political, and economic trends. Such event-based contract trading has seen strong momentum since last year's US presidential election. With increasing market attention, prediction markets are seen as a strong contender for wider acceptance in the financial world, with some experts believing they are more accurate than traditional polls in highly competitive scenarios. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek stated, \"Prediction markets have the potential to become a multi-billion dollar industry.\" This is not the first collaboration between the two companies. Earlier this year, Trump Media and Crypto.com reached an agreement with a blank check acquisition company to launch a new joint venture, employing a Treasury-like strategy to accumulate the cryptocurrency platform's native token, CRO, further deepening Trump's ties with the cryptocurrency industry. Kalshi and Polymarket, the world's two largest prediction market platforms, have attracted significant attention from venture capital firms and other investors in recent months, solidifying the prediction market's reach and engagement. The Shadow of the \"Chief Trader\": Insider Trading Suspicions Linger. As the Trump campaign ventures into prediction markets, questions surrounding unusual trading activity by his family members and affiliated companies have never ceased. In recent years, a series of companies associated with Trump and his inner circle have exhibited unusual trading activity before major personnel or policy announcements, raising suspicions of market manipulation and insider trading. One of the most notable events was the dramatic fluctuations in the US stock market due to the tariff policy. About four hours before announcing a suspension of tariffs, Trump posted in all caps on his Truth Social media platform: \"This is a great time to buy!!! DJT.\" Although DJT is also an abbreviation of his own name, it is also the stock ticker for Trump Media. That day, DJT's stock price closed up 22.67%, and the estimated value of Trump's shares increased by $415 million. Similar situations have occurred multiple times. Last November, drone manufacturer Unusual Machines saw its stock price nearly triple in the four weeks leading up to the announcement of hiring Donald Trump Jr., with daily trading volume surging from 93,000 shares to 290,000 shares. This February, Trump Tower-based fintech group Dominari Holdings saw its stock price soar by 580% in the six weeks prior to announcing the addition of Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump to its advisory board. These suspicions are not isolated incidents. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has close ties to Trump, and the family of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have also drawn attention for their precise \"timed\" trades. These events continue to escalate, fueling accusations that the Trump camp is using its informational advantage to influence the market. Prediction Markets Soar: From \"Digital Casinos\" to Wall Street's Darling Trump's entry into the market at this time comes as prediction markets have transformed from a niche concept into a Wall Street darling. Data from research platform Dune shows that global prediction market trading volume reached a record high of over $2 billion last week. The hype has directly translated into valuations, with emerging platforms Polymarket and Kalshi leading the charge. Polymarket, a cryptocurrency-based platform, reportedly has a valuation approaching $15 billion after receiving a $2 billion strategic investment from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. Kalshi, the first event trading exchange in the US regulated by the CFTC, gained social media fame for its real-time mayoral election odds display on New York streets, with its cultural influence even extending to the popular animated series \"South Park.\" Traditional financial giants have also entered the fray; the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest derivatives exchange, plans to launch financial contracts linked to sporting events and economic indicators by the end of the year. This move, along with ICE's investment in Polymarket and Nasdaq's exploration of asset tokenization, indicates that prediction markets and their underlying tokenization technology are moving from the periphery to the center of the financial system. Against this backdrop, Trump's \"Truth Predict\" is no longer merely a celebrity's commercial stunt, but a strategic move to position himself in a rapidly growing and increasingly mainstream financial arena. As Wall Street's \"regulars\" rush in, Trump, with his inherent star power and controversial appeal, clearly doesn't want to miss out on this feast.</div></div>",

            "title": "Why are billionaires, from Trump to CZ, betting on \"prediction markets\"?",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Blockchain Revelation</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Imagine a place where you can bet on anything: Who will be the next US president? Will the Federal Reserve cut interest rates next month? Even, will your favorite actor win this year's Oscar?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In 2025, this market experienced truly \"explosive growth.\" Just this past October, its trading volume surged by a staggering 91% compared to the previous month, reaching an astonishing $8.4 billion. Weekly trading volume even historically broke the $2 billion mark, and the entire market was burning hot. This wasn't a slow evolution; it was a sudden gold rush.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Behind this explosion are three powerful forces that cannot be ignored; when political leaders, Wall Street, and the crypto core all turn their attention and money to the same place, we must ask one question: What exactly do they see?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> The answer splits into two distinct yet equally compelling stories. Chapter One: Big Shots Enter the Game, the Rules Begin to Change. Character One: Trump's \"Truth Prediction\"‚ÄîSocial Media Meets Financial Betting. This week, Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG) announced its entry into the prediction market through the Truth Social platform, officially launching the \"Truth Predict\" service. An Evolution of Political Marketing: A Carefully Designed \"Social + Financial\" Hybrid. Imagine this scenario: You see a post on Truth Social about the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions, and with a few clicks, you can convert \"Truth gems\" rewarded by the platform into CRO tokens for betting. This is no longer the traditional \"first opinion, then bet\" model, but a completely new \"socialize, bet\" model. Truth Predict's ambitions extend far beyond this: User-oriented: The goal is to \"democratize information\" for its 6.3 million users. Betting scope: From political elections to sporting events, from commodities to Federal Reserve decisions. Viral spread: Every bet can become social media content, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of dissemination. More importantly, the platform uses a binary contract structure regulated by the CFTC, cleverly circumventing the legal definition of \"gambling.\" In this regulatory gray area, the Trump team's instincts remain as sharp as ever. *Truth Predict's Beta test will soon begin on Truth Social, targeting US users and supporting betting on events such as elections, economic indicators, sports, and commodity prices.* *Role Two: CZ's Decentralized Strategy: From Behind the Scenes to the Forefront* *Compared to Trump's high-profile approach, the strategy of CZ, a key figure in the crypto space, is more covert yet equally precise.* Through YZi Labs (formerly Binance Labs, founded in 2018), CZ invested in two key projects: Opinion Labs, which builds a decentralized \"truth oracle,\" and APRO Oracle, a \"decentralized oracle network specifically serving the Bitcoin ecosystem.\" CZ's statements on Twitter are intriguing: \"Prediction markets urgently need dedicated oracles,\" and \"Although we are only a few investors, we will do our best to help increase strategic value.\" This reveals an important signal: CZ is not only interested in the prediction market itself, but also in the data infrastructure behind it. In other words, when prediction markets become mainstream applications, the verification of data authenticity will undoubtedly have significant weight. Whoever controls the verification of data authenticity indirectly holds the power to influence the new ecosystem. Opinion Labs' mainnet launched on BNB Chain on October 16, 2025, and is currently in an invitation-only Beta phase, with a cumulative transaction volume exceeding $300 million (testnet + mainnet Beta). Meanwhile, the APRO Oracle Beta test began on October 28, initially targeting BNB Chain and Bitcoin Layer 2 developers, and AI validator node registration is now open. Role Three: Wall Street's Expectations: ICE's $2 Billion Bets Most shockingly, ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, invested $2 billion in Polymarket. This is more than just an investment; it's an \"official endorsement\" of prediction markets by traditional finance. $2 billion is not a small sum for Wall Street, especially for an institution known for its conservatism. ICE has always been drawn to \"hardcore finance\"‚Äîin 2013, it spent approximately $11 billion to acquire NYSE Euronext, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange; in 2018, it launched the crypto asset platform Bakkt with an initial investment of only $180 million. These figures, taken together, are enough to illustrate the point: ICE is betting on a completely different future. Why? Because prediction markets don't aggregate capital, but rather dispersed judgments. In an era dominated by algorithms, data is already saturated; what's truly scarce is human insight. When traders, programmers, professors, and gamblers all place bets on the same platform, they inadvertently produce an extremely valuable indicator‚Äîcollective expectation. This investment may mark a shift: when mainstream financial institutions begin to treat prediction markets as sources of information rather than toys, the coordinates of the financial world will subtly shift. Algorithmic trading, risk models, and investment strategies‚Äîall may be recalibrated because of these \"market-driven predictions.\" </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/29542-1761817771484.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>*CNBC, as a leading global financial media outlet, reports on this event primarily due to its significant financial and market impact</em></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Chapter Two: The Motives of Billionaires‚ÄîTwo Dramatic Stories</h2><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/29542-1761817794547.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Crypto Perspective: The Unexpected Holy Grail of DeFi?</h3> This first story perfectly addresses a long-standing and awkward dilemma in the crypto world: How can DeFi (Decentralized Finance) be made accessible to the masses? For years, the promise of \"DeFi democratization\" has been considered the holy grail of the crypto world. However, the reality is that complex wallets, difficult-to-understand private key management, and abstract yield logic have acted as a high wall, keeping 99% of ordinary people out. DeFi has always been an insider game for \"crypto natives.\" However, prediction markets may become that \"unexpected breakthrough.\" It may become the first DeFi product to achieve mass adoption because it completely revolutionizes the user experience: It's intuitive and fun, not mind-bending and complex: participation is similar to \"guessing,\" betting on your judgment of the real world, rather than requiring you to understand \"liquidity pools\" or \"impermanent loss.\" Predicting whether the next Marvel movie will gross over $1 billion is far more intuitive than calculating complex DeFi yields. It's strongly coupled with the real world, rather than being ethereal: prediction markets target verifiable events: presidential elections, sporting events, policies, and regulations. This directly links the abstract value of blockchain to real life, giving it an unprecedented sense of \"reality.\" It's becoming more user-friendly, not just for geeks: major platforms are striving to allow users to participate directly with credit cards and email addresses, completely hiding the complex blockchain technology behind the scenes. You don't even need to know what a wallet is to bet on the next Super Bowl. In this story, prediction markets are the \"Trojan horse\" that allows DeFi to penetrate the mainstream. Using the most human-friendly elements of \"guessing\" and \"gossip\" as a guise, it quietly brings blockchain technology to the fingertips of tens or even hundreds of millions of users. This is more than just growth; it could be a decisive step for the Web3 world from an \"on-chain economy\" to \"real-world participation.\" Political Perspective: The \"Secret Weapon\" of Democracy However, the other side of the coin is a story about power and public opinion. What is the core of politics? It's not just about winning votes, but about shaping voters' \"expectations.\" And prediction markets are precisely a perfect \"expectation-generating machine.\" Imagine that on the eve of an election, a candidate's chances of winning are boosted to 78% on the prediction market. This number itself is a highly impactful news story. The media will cite it (\"Market predicts XX will win overwhelmingly\"), social networks will spread it, and voters will see it. This \"guaranteed victory\" halo backed by money will spread like a virus, shaking centrists, demoralizing opponents, and even creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of \"everyone kicking someone when they're down.\" Even more frightening is that this provides power with a completely new and difficult-to-account-for tool for influence. In the past, politicians needed to influence public opinion through the media or direct speech; now, you might need a large enough sum of money and a \"suitable\" platform. By heavily betting in the market, politicians can \"buy\" a probability favorable to themselves in the short term, and then let the media and the public amplify that signal. When questioned, they can simply shrug and innocently declare, \"I didn't lie; I was just making a legitimate investment.\" When we see Donald Trump Jr. become an advisor to Polymarket, and when the capital associated with him pours tens of millions of dollars into the platform, we should be wary: is this really just a simple investment? In this story, prediction markets are no longer a \"crystal ball\" for gathering wisdom, but a \"secret weapon\" that can be used to shape public opinion. Conclusion: Power Restructuring in a Game of Probability. So, are prediction markets the \"unexpected holy grail\" of DeFi, or a \"secret weapon\" of democracy? The answer might be: both. It has the potential to become an unprecedented information aggregation tool, allowing the \"wisdom of the masses\" to shine with unprecedented efficiency; it could also degenerate into a battlefield of public opinion captured by huge amounts of capital and political power, allowing the \"biggest wallets\" to define what \"truth\" is. Currently, Kalshi and Polymarket hold the vast majority of the market share, with the former accounting for approximately 60-66% and the latter 34%. When platforms like Robinhood open event contract trading to their 20 million users, the market's influence will grow exponentially. The next 12-24 months will be crucial. Can prediction markets achieve mass adoption while maintaining their decentralized ideals? Can they remain innovative while accepting regulation? Can they uphold the public interest while achieving commercial success? The answers to these questions will determine whether prediction markets become tools for social progress or weapons that exacerbate inequality and manipulation. And each of us will be a participant and witness in this game of probability.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: insights4.vc Translator: Shan Ouba, Jinse Finance</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">ConsenSys was founded in October 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin. Lubin initially positioned the company as a \"startup studio,\" aiming to incubate dozens of Ethereum-related startups and projects. Between 2015 and 2018, ConsenSys expanded rapidly, at its peak establishing offices in New York, San Francisco, and other locations, with approximately 1,200 employees, and investing in and incubating numerous \"fork\" projects in areas such as wallets and decentralized applications. However, the cryptocurrency bear market at the end of 2018 forced the company to significantly shrink: laying off approximately 13% of its staff in December 2018, and another 14% in early 2020.</p> Strategic Focus Shift After 2020: In August 2020, Lubin spearheaded a major restructuring, splitting the company into two main business segments. Core products (MetaMask, Infura, Codefi fintech suite, etc.) were integrated into a new U.S. entity‚ÄîConsenSys Software Inc.; the original Swiss entity was renamed ConsenSys Mesh, focusing on venture capital and incubation. This move aimed to streamline operations and attract external capital, transforming ConsenSys from a loosely structured startup studio into a traditional software company focused on its core star products. Notably, following this restructuring, 27 early employees filed a lawsuit, claiming that the transfer of assets to the new entity diluted their committed equity, highlighting governance conflicts during the transformation process. Following the split, ConsenSys secured its first external financing. In November 2021, the company raised $200 million at a valuation of $3.2 billion, with investors including Animoca Brands, Coinbase Ventures, and HSBC. Just months later, in March 2022, the company raised another $450 million in a Series D funding round led by ParaFi Capital, raising its valuation to $7 billion. This funding coincided with the 2021 bull market for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), leading to a surge in ConsenSys product usage. However, as the market subsequently cooled, the company implemented cost-cutting measures again: laying off approximately 20% of its workforce at the end of 2022, and another 11% at the beginning of 2023 to control expenses. Key Acquisitions and Divestitures: Throughout its development, ConsenSys has improved its product portfolio through several strategic acquisitions. In 2020, the company acquired Quorum, an enterprise-grade Ethereum fork project from J.P. Morgan, strengthening its permissioned blockchain service capabilities. It also solidified its developer tool ecosystem by acquiring the popular smart contract development framework Truffle and integrating the Infura team, which had been incubated internally since 2016. In early 2022, ConsenSys acquired the Ethereum wallet interface MyCrypto and merged it with MetaMask to improve security and platform compatibility. Recently, the company acquired Web3Auth, a key management SDK provider, to optimize MetaMask's user registration process and security, while continuing to invest in complementary startups (such as DeFi financial tool provider SharpLink). Regarding asset divestitures, during the strategic adjustment period from 2019 to 2020, the company significantly divested or shut down non-core \"branch\" projects, some of which were incorporated into ConsenSys Mesh, while others were allowed to develop independently. By 2023, ConsenSys had completely transformed its positioning from a \"massive incubator\" to a \"product-oriented company focused on core Web3 infrastructure.\" <p></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Employee Size, Leadership, and Business Layout:</strong> As of the end of 2025, ConsenSys had approximately 600-700 employees worldwide, with a core office in the United States (officially headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas), and significant business operations in New York, London, and other locations. Lubin remained CEO and the largest shareholder. In August 2024, the company appointed former Disney and Improbable executive Dan Odell as CFO, highlighting its IPO intentions. The leadership team also includes MetaMask co-founders Dan Finlay and Aaron Davis, as well as product leaders from Infura and Linea; most members are seasoned professionals in the Ethereum ecosystem. ConsenSys's business covers consumer-facing products and enterprise consulting services. It participates in high-end projects such as the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pilot program using Quorum technology, while adhering to a \"developer-first\" philosophy. This dual nature of \"balancing decentralized technology and enterprise cooperation\" is a significant characteristic of the company's development. Product Matrix and Revenue Sources 1. MetaMask (Wallet Platform) Positioning and User Scale: MetaMask is the world's most widely used self-custodied cryptocurrency wallet, supporting both browser extensions and mobile applications. As an entry point to Ethereum and Web3, it allows users to store assets and seamlessly connect to decentralized applications. At its peak, MetaMask had over 30 million monthly active users (MAU), an explosive growth from 10 million in mid-2021. In 2025, MetaMask had approximately 143 million users globally, with about 30 million monthly active users, holding over 80% market share in the Web3 wallet market and almost becoming synonymous with \"accessing DeFi.\" As the default wallet for numerous Ethereum dApps, its distribution advantage has built a powerful network effect. Profit Model: Unlike most purely open-source wallets, MetaMask generates substantial revenue through built-in services, primarily from \"MetaMask Swaps\"‚Äîan in-wallet token exchange aggregation tool that charges a 0.875% service fee on transactions. During the 2021 bull market, this feature was highly profitable: exchange fee revenue grew by approximately 2300% throughout the year, soaring from about $1.8 million in January 2021 to $44 million in December alone. In 2022, transaction fees from MetaMask contributed the vast majority of ConsenSys' total revenue of $252 million. Other monetization features include: \"MetaMask Staking,\" launched in 2023, allowing users to stake ETH through service providers like Lido and Rocket Pool, with the platform likely earning referral fees; integrating fiat currency deposit channels, potentially generating a small revenue share from partners; and a \"MetaMask Institutional\" version for institutional clients, supporting compliance and custody integration, or adopting a SaaS licensing model. Furthermore, ConsenSys has revealed plans to launch a MetaMask token and a new reward mechanism, indicating a potential future strategy of using token economics to increase user activity and thus impact the monetization model. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"XNh8tG0AVMUJaAfOlGLLESLOyU42TDXMXYPjdWHc.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410232_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410232\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Security and Privacy Performance</strong>: Given MetaMask's popularity, its security track record is crucial. The wallet's self-custodial design means users hold their own keys, which largely protects it from direct hacking attacks; most asset losses stem from user-side phishing attacks. ConsenSys has integrated Blockaid security features (enabled by default from 2024), alerting users to malicious transactions and phishing attempts‚Äîhundreds of thousands of users have enabled this feature during the testing phase, preventing tens of thousands of malicious transactions. The wallet's codebase was once completely open source, but in 2020, to protect its business model, it switched to a stricter licensing agreement. This decision sparked differing opinions regarding \"security transparency.\" On the privacy front, in late 2022, ConsenSys disclosed that the default Infura connection recorded users' IP addresses and wallet addresses to comply with regulations, raising user concerns and regulatory scrutiny, but without resulting in specific penalties. Overall, MetaMask has a solid security reputation and continues to conduct phishing prevention education; however, its large user base makes it a primary target for scammers, thus continued security investment is crucial. Market Competition: MetaMask's established position faces competition from both emerging wallets and established exchanges. Ethereum and Web3 wallets such as Rainbow, Rabby, Zerion, and Phantom are vying for market share by optimizing UX or supporting multi-chain functionality; Coinbase Wallet leverages the Coinbase brand to attract retail users. Currently, despite overall market growth, MetaMask maintains its market share. However, user loyalty could be shaken if competitors launch products that are \"significantly more secure or simpler\" (such as wallets using smart contract accounts or those without mnemonic phrases). In the mobile arena, MetaMask also faces competition from rivals like Trust Wallet; in the institutional wallet market, MetaMask Institutional needs to contend with custody-centric solutions like Fireblocks and Copper. In summary, MetaMask's dominance is not insurmountable: its massive installation base and integration with almost all dApps form a \"moat,\" but to maintain growth and profitability, it needs to continuously optimize usability and security, and address app store policy risks (such as potential impacts from Apple or Google restricting cryptocurrency wallet applications). **Revenue Importance and Data Transparency:** MetaMask is likely ConsenSys's largest single source of revenue. Historically, transaction fees have accounted for the vast majority of MetaMask's total revenue. Although the company has not publicly disclosed detailed data, external estimates suggest that in early 2023, MetaMask's transaction revenue accounted for the majority of the company's $252 million annualized revenue (ARR). This revenue is highly sensitive to market trading volume: In 2022, cryptocurrency trading activity declined, leading to a significant drop in MetaMask's transaction volume and fee revenue. Wallet downloads in the first nine months of 2023 decreased by approximately 32% year-over-year. The effectiveness of new revenue streams such as staking and token incentives remains unproven, and user data transparency is also problematic‚Äîaside from the occasionally disclosed MAU, detailed data such as daily active users, retention rate, and revenue per user are not publicly available. Investors may need to indirectly assess MetaMask's performance through observable on-chain transaction volumes and industry benchmarks. Overall, MetaMask is ConsenSys's \"core asset,\" but given the regulatory scrutiny of its paid services, it has also become a focal point of risk. 2. Infura (Infrastructure / API Service) Service Content and Importance: Infura is a cloud-based API platform that allows developers and businesses to interact with Ethereum and other blockchains without running their own nodes. In fact, it is the \"technical backbone\" of countless dApps, providing reliable blockchain data reading and transaction broadcasting services. Not only does MetaMask connect to Infura by default, but well-known platforms such as Uniswap and OpenSea also manage their outsourced nodes through it. Infura's reliability was highlighted during the outage in November 2020: this interruption temporarily paralyzed Ethereum services, and some exchanges even suspended withdrawals, confirming its crucial role in the ecosystem. As of 2022, the Infura platform had over 430,000 developers as users, and its interface processed over $1 trillion in annualized on-chain transactions. Essentially, Infura is often likened to \"AWS of the Web3 world,\" providing scalable subscription-based blockchain infrastructure in a \"plug-and-play\" model. **Profit Model:** Infura employs a \"freemium\" SaaS model: developers can call a certain number of APIs for free; exceeding this limit or requiring commercial-grade reliability incurs a monthly fee. Public pricing shows a mid-range plan at approximately $50 per 200,000 requests per month, while enterprise customers can negotiate customized pricing for higher throughput and dedicated support. **Analysts estimate Infura's revenue using historical data:** For example, during the Ethereum boom of 2017, if Infura processed an average of 13 billion requests per day, at a combined rate of $45 per 200,000 requests, its annual revenue would be approximately $34 million. In 2022, Ethereum usage increased by approximately 83% compared to 2017, and Infura's annual revenue was projected to reach $60-65 million, becoming its second-largest revenue source after MetaMask. Furthermore, Infura's enterprise contracts (including SLAs and high-reliability zones) are likely to contribute stable recurring revenue. ConsenSys has revealed plans to decentralize the Infura architecture by collaborating with other cloud service providers and crypto companies to build a \"decentralized infrastructure network,\" but the revenue model will still be based on usage, potentially introducing a node provider market. Currently, there is limited publicly available data on Infura's profitability and profit margins, but given the nature of its software subscription model, its profit margin is likely high after deducting cloud hosting costs. Centralization Controversy: Infura's dominant position has also made it a focal point of the \"Ethereum decentralization debate.\" Critics point out that over 80% of Ethereum applications rely on Infura, which itself runs on traditional cloud servers (primarily AWS), posing a \"single point of failure\" and a potential bottleneck‚ÄîInfura has previously imposed service restrictions in certain regions to comply with sanctions. ConsenSys acknowledges this issue and continues to push for service decentralization. In late 2023, Infura announced an early access program for its \"Infrastructure Provider Consortium Network,\" with companies like Microsoft and Tencent joining, aiming to allow multiple independent operators to run Infura nodes and prevent a single company or cloud service provider from controlling the service. However, as of 2025, Infura remained primarily centralized, which critics argue could weaken Ethereum's resilience or subject Infura to regulatory requirements for \"reviewing specific protocols.\" The upcoming IPO may bring the question of \"how ConsenSys balances Infura's commercial success with community expectations of decentralization\" into focus‚Äîa delicate balancing act where full decentralization could introduce new competitors or weaken company control. Market Competition: Infura faces fierce competition in the blockchain infrastructure space. Its most direct competitor is Alchemy‚Äîa venture-backed API provider valued at over $10 billion during the 2021 bull market, attracting significant funding and key clients with its \"more developer-friendly experience\" and \"multi-chain support.\" Other competitors include QuickNode, Blockdaemon, Ankr, Moralis, and cloud giants like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cloudflare Ethereum Gateway. Furthermore, many Ethereum projects choose to self-host nodes or use smaller providers to enhance control. Infura's differentiating advantages lie in its \"convenience\" and \"first-mover advantage\"‚Äîdevelopers understand that \"Infura can support business expansion as it needs to operate stably.\" However, with the development of Web3, Infura needs to simultaneously contend with competition from \"well-funded centralized services\" and \"emerging decentralized solutions (such as Pocket Network, which incentivizes independent node operators to provide services).\" Price competition is also a significant factor; some competitors may vie for market share through low prices or customized solutions for specific chains. Currently, Infura remains the default infrastructure for Ethereum dApps, but after its IPO, investors will focus on its long-term competitiveness‚Äîespecially if developers prioritize decentralization. Notably, MetaMask (ConsenSys' core application) connects to Infura by default, which constitutes a certain competitive barrier. ConsenSys may emphasize Infura's progress in areas such as \"reliability improvements,\" \"multi-chain and Layer 2 (L2) network support expansion,\" and \"servicing its own Linea network\" to solidify its advantage. Revenue and Data Transparency: Based on an estimated $60 million in revenue in 2022, Infura likely contributes 20%-30% of ConsenSys's total revenue. Compared to MetaMask's transaction fees, its revenue is more stable and closer to a subscription model, but it is still correlated with overall blockchain activity‚ÄîInfura's revenue increases with dApp usage and on-chain transaction volume, and vice versa. Regarding data transparency, customer concentration is a key unknown: a few large clients (such as large NFT marketplaces or gaming projects) may account for a significant portion of usage. Investors will focus on the revenue contribution percentage from top clients and the likelihood of core clients churning (e.g., large exchanges or platforms deciding to run their own nodes). Furthermore, service availability commitments (e.g., uptime of 99.9%) and fault tolerance clauses will also be key areas of scrutiny‚ÄîInfura's service track record is generally good but not perfect. Overall, Infura offers a highly predictable revenue stream with profit margins approaching those of cloud services, potentially commanding a higher premium in ConsenSys's sum-of-the-parts valuation approach. While SaaS and infrastructure companies typically enjoy high revenue multiple valuations, Infura's valuation may be adjusted due to the risks inherent in the crypto industry. 3. Linea (Layer 2 Network) Overview and Architecture: Linea is an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution launched by ConsenSys, based on Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) Rollup technology‚Äîan EVM-compatible zero-knowledge Rollup. Announced in 2023, the project launched its mainnet alpha test version in mid-2023. It batch-processes off-chain transactions using zero-knowledge proofs and submits validity proofs to the Ethereum mainnet (L1), achieving higher throughput and lower transaction fees while inheriting Ethereum's security. Linea is designed to be \"fully EVM equivalent,\" allowing developers to deploy existing Ethereum smart contracts to Linea without significant code modifications. During the testnet phase, Linea processed tens of millions of transactions; by the time the mainnet launched, over 100 dApps and partners had already built an ecosystem with it. **Ordering Mechanism:** Initially, Linea transactions are processed by a centralized orderer operated by ConsenSys. This is common in new Rollup projects, ensuring rapid confirmation and guaranteeing network reliability in the early stages. However, in the short term, users need to trust ConsenSys to handle transaction ordering and censorship resistance. ConsenSys has released a decentralized roadmap, planning to eventually introduce multiple orderers and community governance (possibly through the Linea Association and token issuance). As the network matures, permissionless ordering is expected to be implemented by 2025. **Cross-Chain Bridges and Security:** Linea has an official cross-chain bridge to the Ethereum mainnet, supporting asset transfers between L1 and L2. Under the Rollup architecture, user assets at L2 are ultimately protected by the Ethereum mainnet‚Äîif Linea's proof is valid and cannot be forged, Ethereum will enforce the withdrawal. However, in the early stages of a network, systems typically retain some administrator privileges or upgradeability. For example, ConsenSys briefly paused block generation to verify the system; such operations are common safeguards for on-chain security. Since its launch, Linea has not reported any major security incidents, but like all new Layer 2 networks, its complex zero-knowledge circuits (zk circuits) and fraud-proof mechanisms still require vigilance against vulnerabilities. ConsenSys' strategy is to \"align Linea with the Ethereum philosophy,\" with the most significant measure being the payment of 20% of Linea's net transaction fees in ETH and its burning on L1‚Äîa move intended to respond to criticism that \"Layer 2 networks are taking away Ethereum's transaction fee revenue,\" aligning with the economic model following Ethereum EIP 1559 and strengthening support for the value of the Ethereum mainnet. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Token Issuance and Incentives:</strong> In September 2025, ConsenSys announced the launch of the long-awaited LINEA token and its initial allocation plan. OTC trading showed a fully diluted valuation of approximately $2.7 billion, with the price stabilizing at around $0.027 after opening (the initial opening price was higher). </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The token issuance (TGE) includes three key allocations: 10% is airdropped to early Linea users and developers; 75% is allocated to the ecosystem fund for the network's long-term development; and the remaining 15% is presumably allocated to the team, investors, and the treasury, indicating that ConsenSys largely promotes community shareholding, with a relatively low percentage held by internal personnel. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Possible use cases for the LINEA token include: staking for future sorter roles, upgrading governance voting, and fee rebates.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Prior to the token issuance, ConsenSys launched the \"Ignition Liquidity Mining Program\" from September to the end of October 2025, distributing 1 billion LINEA tokens (worth approximately $27 million at OTC prices) to users providing liquidity to designated Linea DeFi protocols. This program drove a surge in Linea usage, with total value locked (TVL) soaring from approximately $120 million in mid-2025 to a record high of $1.17 billion by the end of September. As of the end of October, even after the incentive program ended, TVL remained in the $1.1-1.2 billion range, indicating that its DeFi ecosystem had reached a certain scale (although some growth relied on short-term incentives). Revenue and Strategic Value: Linea currently generates negligible direct revenue. L2 transaction fees are designed to be very low, with the majority used to cover Ethereum data call costs and ETH burning. If ConsenSys retains a portion of the LINEA tokens, it might eventually generate value for ConsenSys itself, but given that 85% of the proceeds are used for ecosystem building and airdrops, this suggests that ConsenSys doesn't see Linea as a short-term profit center. Instead, Linea's value lies in its strategic significance. It positions ConsenSys in the scaling space, allowing it to attract users who may have migrated to other L2 platforms. It also hedges against platform risk. If Ethereum activity shifts to L2 platforms, ConsenSys now has a native foothold. MetaMask and Infura already serve other L2 platforms, but having Linea allows for deeper integration and the potential for future fee revenue, such as sequencer rewards. How ConsenSys will calculate the economics of Linea remains unclear. For example, if the Linea Association is established and the token is largely governed by it, ConsenSys may not integrate Linea metrics in the same way. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Enterprise and Other Products, Quorum, Codefi, etc.</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition to its flagship consumer and developer tools, ConsenSys also generates revenue through enterprise software and services. Its core product is ConsenSys Quorum, a private blockchain platform initially developed in partnership with JPMorgan Chase. Quorum is essentially an Ethereum-based ledger designed to meet enterprise needs, featuring access control, high throughput, and zero-knowledge privacy protection. Since acquiring Quorum from JPMorgan Chase in 2020, ConsenSys is now pushing it into the financial institutions and enterprise markets for applications such as interbank networks, asset tokenization, and central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilots. According to ConsenSys, Quorum is already used in approximately ten CBDC projects globally and has around 100 enterprise clients, including JPMorgan Chase for its JPM Coin network.</p> ... While each Quorum deployment may not generate recurring revenue like MetaMask or Infura, they typically bring in service contracts, support fees, or cloud hosting revenue. For example, ConsenSys might charge consulting fees for CBDC pilot projects or offer a quorum network hosted by the consortium on a subscription basis. Another important component is **Codefi**, a suite of fintech modules including payment, digital asset issuance, trading, and compliance tools, designed for institutions looking to leverage Ethereum. Codefi includes components such as Codefi Assets (for security or real estate tokenization), Codefi Payments, and Codefi Staking, the latter providing institutional-grade ETH2 staking services to clients. While these modules themselves aren't particularly noteworthy, they enable ConsenSys to offer full-stack solutions to enterprises that typically start with Quorum and then need to build applications on top of it. ConsenSys' professional services (consulting) also integrates these tools. For example, they helped a commodity exchange build a tokenized market using the Quorum ledger and Codefi Assets. Furthermore, ConsenSys also owns MetaMask Institutional (MMI), a service that connects its consumer and enterprise-level offerings. MMI enables institutions such as crypto funds or trading platforms to use MetaMask's interface and integrate it with custody solutions like Fireblocks, BitGo, or self-custody via multi-signature, allowing fund managers to access DeFi while meeting custody and compliance requirements. ConsenSys may generate revenue through enterprise licensing of MMI or partnerships with custody providers (where both parties may share customer access fees). This also facilitates cross-selling. Institutions using MMI to access DeFi may also use Infura's infrastructure and Quorum's private projects, further expanding ConsenSys's wallet share. Custody partnerships extend beyond MMI. For example, ConsenSys partners with fintech companies and banks to conduct institutional staking business, with ConsenSys providing the technology and the partners handling the custody. They also have a security auditing division, ConsenSys Diligence, which provides smart contract auditing services. This is a smaller but reputable division that generates service fees and allows ConsenSys to participate in emerging projects. Revenue and Importance: Revenue from enterprise-level products and other products is relatively opaque and may only account for a small portion of total revenue. Analysis indicates that ConsenSys has many other projects besides MetaMask and Infura, but only these two truly stand out in terms of scale. Nevertheless, the amounts involved in enterprise-level transactions can be substantial. For example, a large project, such as a central bank or a major bank using Quorum, could involve collaborations worth millions of dollars. Because this revenue comes from strategic IT budgets and long-term projects, it is likely to be more stable and less correlated with cryptocurrency market volatility. The $65 million raised by ConsenSys in 2021, primarily led by JPMorgan Chase, Mastercard, and UBS, demonstrates the company's close ties with financial institutions. These relationships could potentially translate into business ventures in the future (for example, Mastercard partnered with ConsenSys to develop a blockchain-based payment system). IPO Mechanism: ConsenSys's path to an IPO appears to be taking shape. A report in October 2025 stated that the company had hired JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs as lead advisors for its IPO. While many details remain undisclosed, we can outline the anticipated mechanisms and background for a ConsenSys IPO. Timing and Location: The involvement of top banks suggests that ConsenSys's targeted IPO could take place in 2026, provided market conditions remain stable. All indications suggest that ConsenSys is considering a US listing, potentially on Nasdaq (primarily for tech stocks) or the New York Stock Exchange, to access the US capital markets. The listing timeline may be subject to change. The cryptocurrency market rebounded in 2025 after a two-year bear market, and peers like Circle and Bullish reportedly went public in early 2025. However, market volatility is inherent, so ConsenSys and its bankers will closely monitor market timing. Filing a listing application in mid-2026 and listing later that year seems reasonable, but a filing earlier, at the end of 2025, is not impossible if market momentum is strong. A traditional IPO approach, including book-building and primary market financing, is most likely. A direct listing is less probable, as ConsenSys may want to raise new capital for growth and provide liquidity for long-term shareholders and employees. SPAC mergers were popular in 2021 but are no longer favored, and given ConsenSys' size and investor base, it doesn't need to take that route. **Use of Proceeds and Offering Size:** ConsenSys was valued at $7 billion in its last private placement, and based on its revenue growth trajectory, its IPO valuation could be similar or higher. If revenue reaches $200-300 million by 2025, a valuation of several billion dollars is reasonable. This IPO may issue approximately 10-15% of the company's shares, which is common in tech IPOs, meaning hundreds of millions of dollars in proceeds. For example, if the company's valuation reaches $5 billion or higher, the proceeds could reach $500 million or more. The proceeds will likely be used for further product development, particularly the growth of Linea and the development of MetaMask functionality, as well as strategic acquisitions. Other uses include regulatory compliance resources and international expansion. Founder Joseph Lubin may also use this liquidity event to diversify some of his holdings while maintaining a major shareholder position post-IPO. <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Related Comparisons</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">ConsenSys covers multiple areas, so it's necessary to use a sum-of-parts approach.</p><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Coinbase:</strong>Among cryptocurrency-native companies, Coinbase is the closest publicly known competitor to MetaMask. Coinbase is primarily an exchange, with revenue derived from transaction fees, but it also provides a benchmark for investors on how to assess a large cryptocurrency user base and trading revenue. Its price-to-sales ratio has fluctuated roughly between 3 and 10 times across various market cycles. Coinbase went public in 2021 via a direct listing, with a market capitalization approaching $80 billion at the time, which fell below $10 billion during the bear market before rebounding in 2025 as trading volume increased. Coinbase's profit margins and growth can serve as a reference for valuing MetaMask's transaction fees. It's important to note that Coinbase is subject to more direct regulation and has a more mature profit model, while MetaMask's profit model is still in its early stages, but with significant profit potential. Circle: The issuer of USDC. Circle reportedly went public in 2025. Its business model is unique, with revenue primarily derived from reserves and interest payments. As a high-profile crypto infrastructure company, Circle's products are regulatory compliant, and its price-to-earnings ratio could reach 5 to 8 times, depending on growth and interest rate dynamics. This sets a benchmark for infrastructure companies in the cryptocurrency space. Blockchain Infrastructure and Fintech: Developer platforms and cloud infrastructure are valuable references for components like Infura. Companies like Twilio, which are API-driven, or networks like Cloudflare, which rely on usage, typically have P/E ratios in the high single digits to low double digits when experiencing rapid growth. Broader fintech companies like Robinhood (HOOD) signal cryptocurrency access for retail users, with P/E ratios typically only a few times, reflecting slower growth and improving profitability. Other cryptocurrency companies, such as Galaxy Digital, Bakkt, and cryptocurrency miners, are less similar to Bullish and generally have lower P/E ratios due to factors like earnings cyclicality, balance sheet complexity, or SPAC equity dilution. If Bullish does go public in 2025, its valuation and trading performance will provide further insight, although Bullish's business focuses more on exchanges than infrastructure or wallets. </p></li></ul><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Strategic Narrative and Moat</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">ConsenSys' strategic narrative, the story it will tell investors, hinges on becoming an indispensable toolkit for Web3. It positions itself as an integrated platform with a strong competitive advantage, rather than a collection of decentralized crypto projects.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">MetaMask Distribution Flywheel</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">MetaMask's massive user base is at the heart of ConsenSys' moat. This distributed advantage has a self-reinforcing effect: because MetaMask is the default wallet for millions of users, developers optimize for it when launching new decentralized applications, which in turn makes MetaMask crucial for users. This provides ConsenSys with unparalleled insight and access to the Web3 user base. In fact, ConsenSys is able to identify emerging trends early and build related features or derivatives faster than its competitors.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"> MetaMask also acts as a conduit for other products. When users interact through MetaMask, they indirectly access Infura's default endpoint, driving traffic to Infura and creating cross-selling opportunities, such as driving advanced developers to upgrade to paid tiers or institutional users to use MMI. Network effects protect MetaMask, and cross-chain support further strengthens this moat. ConsenSys will emphasize that MetaMask is a platform, not just a wallet. Integrations such as exchange, staking, and other advanced features indicate that MetaMask is evolving into a full-service portal for Web3. If MetaMask becomes an app store or browser for decentralized applications (dApps), ConsenSys can profit from this central position by charging fees or establishing partnerships. The argument is that MetaMask's widespread adoption is difficult to replicate, giving ConsenSys a lasting competitive advantage similar to early internet browsers, making it an indispensable entry point for other applications. <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Infrastructure L2 Integration</h3></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">ConsenSys's advantage lies in its simultaneous control of the interface layer (wallet) and infrastructure layer (nodes and Layer 2 networks). This vertical integration provides flexibility and distribution advantages. Linea can be accessed with a single click within MetaMask, a feature not available from other Layer 2 network providers. Infura can be optimized to work seamlessly with Linea, providing developers with a seamless technology stack. Controlling both the client and infrastructure helps reduce latency and failure rates from wallet to node, something single-point solutions struggle to achieve. Furthermore, MetaMask's broad neutrality is a key factor in its success. ConsenSys may be able to maintain open support for multiple networks while offering subtle user experience advantages for its own network where appropriate. This is similar to Apple's approach of allowing other music apps to access the platform while integrating more deeply into its own app‚Äîa gentle guidance rather than a forced lock-in.</p> ... Platform Risk Mitigation A key narrative thread is reducing reliance on third-party platforms. The desktop version of MetaMask relies on browser extensions, while the mobile version depends on app stores and their rules. Infura has historically relied on cloud service providers. ConsenSys will emphasize resilience: availability across multiple browsers, providing standalone versions when necessary, and pushing Infura towards greater decentralization to avoid single points of failure. Investments in lightweight clients, hardware wallet integration, and diverse infrastructure providers support this. At the political and institutional level, ConsenSys has established a strong reputation among corporate and policy stakeholders. This position can be seen as a moat, making it more difficult for the platform or regulators to marginalize its product. Neutrality and Fee Extraction (Linea and Others) ConsenSys carefully balances neutrality with value extraction. Historically, it has tended to remain neutral: MetaMask supports multiple networks, Infura supports competitor chains, and Linea aligns with Ethereum's philosophy. As a business, ConsenSys will seek to monetize its position, such as by encouraging token swaps within MetaMask or, where appropriate, by profiting from Linea's usage. If it goes too far, advanced users might migrate to more decentralized alternatives. ConsenSys's message to investors might be: it has built a healthy moat, uses influence prudently, builds trust through neutrality, and users choose ConsenSys services based on the value of the service itself. MetaMask's support for Arbitrum and Optimism, and Linea, are prime examples. Trust and reputation are the true moats, and maintaining them is a strategic priority. <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Innovation and Developer Moat</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">ConsenSys will emphasize its role as an innovator and standard setter in the Ethereum space.</p> ... The company boasts a core development team that implements security practices through ConsenSys Diligence and contributes to critical projects such as staking infrastructure. This close connection to protocol evolution allows it to gain early insight and exert influence. If account abstraction becomes the standard, ConsenSys is fully capable of quickly adapting to MetaMask. For businesses and governments, long-term development and brand reputation are crucial, and ConsenSys' past performance demonstrates both. <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Conclusion</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Details of the ConsenSys IPO are being finalized: major banks have joined, the target listing date is 2026, the company plans to list in the US, and the valuation is expected to reach billions of dollars (referencing companies like Coinbase). A successful listing depends on ConsenSys demonstrating a clear financial position (especially in terms of revenue composition) and convincing investors that it possesses a solid competitive advantage and a prospect of continued growth, rather than being subject to the cyclical fluctuations of the cryptocurrency market.</p> The next key focus will be on the formal disclosure of listing documents and the resolution of regulatory issues that may affect the IPO. In summary, ConsenSys positions itself as a platform providing comprehensive support for Web3 construction, similar to having a browser (MetaMask), a cloud layer (Infura), and a scalable web (Linea). Its competitive advantage stems from its deep ecosystem embedding, high switching costs for users and developers, strong network effects, and a delicate balance between maintaining neutrality and achieving profitability. As the Web3 user base continues to expand, ConsenSys is expected to capture value at multiple levels while consolidating the open ecosystem that underpins its long-term success.</div></div>",
