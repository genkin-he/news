            "title": "Let's talk about MSTR's Q3 2025 financial report.",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Phyrex Source: X, @Phyrex_Ni</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Foreword: MSTR released its earnings report after the US stock market closed on Thursday. Earnings per share were $8.42, exceeding market expectations of $7.90. Third-quarter revenue was $128.7 million, exceeding market expectations of $118.3 million. MSTR's third-quarter earnings exceeded market expectations, and its after-hours price rose by more than 5%.</p> As of October 26, 2025, MSTR held a total of 640,808 $BTC, with a total cost of $47.44 billion, equivalent to a cost of $74,032 per Bitcoin. With the current BTC price at $107,300, this represents a paper profit of $21.333 billion. The net profit (paper profit) for the third quarter was $2.8 billion. What does this mean? American Express, ranked 67th globally by assets in the S&amp;P 500, reported a profit of $2.9 billion in the third quarter of 2025. Another well-known tech company, Oracle, also reported a GAAP net profit of $2.9 billion in the third quarter. This doesn't mean MSTR is particularly impressive. MSTR received a B- junk stock rating in the latest S&amp;P ratings, primarily due to the extreme volatility of Bitcoin's price. Therefore, I believe S&amp;P's rating of MSTR is essentially the same as its rating of BTC, just slightly higher due to the lack of leverage. Thus, MSTR's net profit (on paper) basically meets the standards of a top 100 global company, largely due to the influence of BTC's price. Crisis? As of September 30, 2025, MSTR held $54.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Does this mean it can only buy $54.3 million worth of Bitcoin? No, MSTR doesn't buy BTC with cash; it buys BTC through its capital structure. It converts fiat currency into BTC by issuing stocks, bonds, and structured credit. <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/4-1761881292210.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, the financial report for the third quarter of 2025 shows that as of October 26, 2025, MSTR's remaining issuance quota through multiple ATM programs totaled approximately $42.1 billion. In simpler terms, MSTR could buy up to $42.1 billion worth of Bitcoin.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">So why did MSTR slow down its BTC purchases in the third quarter?<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"> MSTR divides its Common Stock ATM Program (with approximately $15.9 billion remaining) into three tiers, determining the issuance intensity and purpose based on mNAV levels: A. mNAV Threshold &lt; 2.5x Tactically-Based Issuance: Paying Debt Interest, Funding Preferred Stock Dividends, and Other Corporate Favorable Circumstances (e.g., Small Cash Supplements). Limited Issuance Size to Avoid Excessive Dilutation at Low Premiums. B. mNAV Threshold 2.5x - 4.0x Opportunistically issued, primarily for purchasing Bitcoin. Balances funding with BTC yield, depending on market opportunities.\nC. mNAV Threshold &gt; 4.0x Actively issued, used extensively for purchasing Bitcoin. Accelerates during periods of high premium to maximize leverage. </h2></h2><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/4-1761881344336.jpg?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Currently, mNAV is 1.27x (below 2.5x), so MSTR may only be used for debt/dividend payments rather than large-scale BTC purchases. This explains the slowdown in purchases in the third quarter (only $2.2 billion).</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>What is the formula for calculating mNAV?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">MSTR's mNAV is a multiple of Enterprise Value (EV) divided by the net asset value of its Bitcoin holdings (Bitcoin NAV).</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Enterprise Value (EV): Total company value, including market capitalization + debt + nominal value of preferred stock - cash. Bitcoin NAV: Market capitalization of the company's Bitcoin holdings (currently approximately 640,000 BTC, worth over $70 billion). Will MSTR collapse? Short-term (2026) probability: Low: Unless BTC crashes by more than 50%, the company has $42.1 billion in ATM credit available for rapid financing, and its operating cash flow is stable. Long-term (2028) probability: Moderate: If BTC remains sluggish for an extended period, the pressure of debt maturities will be significant (the first large tranche is in 2028). Statistics show that unless $BTC falls below $16,500, the risk of bankruptcy is highest. Actually, the price of BTC is not the main reason why MSTR might go bankrupt. If MSTR really does go bankrupt, the core reason should be that MSTR can no longer print shares to exchange for BTC. As long as the market still accepts MSTR's approach and provides MSTR with financing channels, then the probability of MSTR going bankrupt will be very low. When is MSTR the safest? </p><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">BTC is in a fluctuating upward cycle</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Fed's liquidity is improving or interest rate cuts are expected</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The fiat capital market is willing to buy BTC exposure</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">US regulators are increasingly recognizing BTC</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">mNAV &gt; 2.5, companies can continue to strengthen their balance sheets</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Non-debt repayment period</p></li></ol><p style=\"text-align: left;\">From my personal point of view, firstly, there is no need to consider debt repayment before 2028, meaning that before 2028, the price of BTC is unlikely to cause a BTC crash.

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Article Author:</span></span><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Thejaswini M A¬†</span></span><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Article Compilation</span></span><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">ÔºöBlock unicorn</span></span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Foreword</span></span></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">The Facebook graph has trillions of edges. ... This number is like a milestone in Avery Ching's mind, a testament to what a properly designed distributed system can achieve. A trillion connections have been established between people, photos, posts, and locations. The entire analysis can be completed in four minutes using commercially available hardware from any company. Ching knew this because he had personally built the system that made it all possible. In 2007, Ching, fresh out of his PhD program at Northwestern University, co-founded Apache Giraph at Yahoo! What began as an experiment in distributed graph processing ultimately powered Facebook's graph search and fundamentally changed how tech companies analyze social networks at scale. However, Ching's shift to cryptocurrency wasn't due to the prevailing trend or the influx of venture capital into the field. He worked at Meta for ten years, building the infrastructure for Diem, part of the company's ambitious global digital currency plan. In 2021, Diem collapsed under regulatory pressure, but Ching and his team instead doubled down. A few months later, they founded Aptos Labs with a clear goal: to build a blockchain capable of truly handling global institutional financing. Today, Aptos processes transactions for companies like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Apollo. The blockchain currently holds over $1.2 billion in tokenized real-world assets. Ching initially focused on building systems to analyze how billions of people connect on social media, but later shifted his focus to building systems that could change the way trillions of dollars flow in the global economy. Avery Ching grew up in Honolulu, attending Punahou School from kindergarten through high school‚Äîthe same school that produced Barack Obama. He left Hawaii for Evanston, Illinois, to study computer engineering at Northwestern University. The transition from island life to the harsh Midwestern winter might have been difficult, but Ching found a sense of belonging in Northwestern's computer science labs. During his undergraduate studies, he focused on building systems capable of handling complex computations simultaneously across multiple machines. However, what truly laid the foundation for his career was the expertise he gained during his doctoral dissertation defense in October 2007. His doctoral dissertation specifically focused on supercomputing, parallel computing frameworks, and high-performance file systems. These are the foundations of every large system that underpins modern internet services. Ching's doctoral advisor, Professor Alok Choudhary, was researching a problem that companies like Google and Facebook were beginning to face: how to handle massive amounts of data when it's distributed across thousands of machines? The answer lay in designing systems that could coordinate their work across distributed infrastructure, avoiding bottlenecks or single points of failure. This insight, honed in the academic lab, became Ching's secret weapon after entering the industry. Building the System to Map the Facebook Universe In October 2007, the same month Ching defended his doctoral dissertation, he joined Yahoo as chief software engineer. At the time, Yahoo was still a leading technology company, struggling to handle the massive amounts of data generated by hundreds of millions of users. Ching saw an opportunity. Social networks generate a special data structure: a graph. Each user is a node. Every friendship, every message, every interaction is an edge connecting nodes. The question is, how do you analyze these graphs when they grow to billions of nodes and trillions of edges? His answer was Apache Giraph, an open-source distributed graph processing system. This project draws inspiration from Google's Pregel paper but makes the technology accessible to any company wanting to analyze graph data at scale. Instead of trying to load the entire graph into the memory of a single machine (which would be impossible at Facebook's scale), Giraph distributes the graph across multiple machines. Each machine processes its portion of the graph and then communicates with other machines to coordinate the results. The system worked. Facebook adopted Giraph and used it to power Graph Search, a feature that allows users to search for things like \"photos of my friends in Paris\" or \"restaurants my friends like in New York\" across social networks. More importantly, Giraph was able to analyze Facebook's entire social graph in four minutes using commercial hardware. Diem's ‚Äã‚ÄãWinding Path In 2011, Ching left Yahoo to join Facebook (later renamed Meta), where he spent the next decade building the underlying infrastructure that underpinned the company's analytics capabilities. His team was responsible for projects such as Apache Spark, Hadoop, distributed scheduling, and a unified programming model, technologies that enabled Meta engineers to analyze data across hundreds of thousands of machines. Subsequently, Meta announced plans for Libra, a digital currency project (later known as Diem). Its vision was to create a blockchain-based payment system serving billions of people globally, particularly those without access to traditional banking services. Meta would provide distribution channels through Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. Blockchain would provide the infrastructure for inexpensive, fast, and global payments. Ching was appointed as the technical lead for Meta's crypto platform, and his team was responsible for building the blockchain itself, wallet infrastructure, and ecosystem development strategy. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which sacrificed speed for decentralization, Diem was designed to process thousands of transactions per second while maintaining security and compliance. The team developed the Move programming language specifically for Diem, with built-in protection mechanisms designed to eliminate certain types of smart contract vulnerabilities. However, Diem faced problems that engineering could not solve. Regulators around the world were concerned about Facebook's power and influence. What would this mean for monetary policy if billions of people adopted a Facebook-backed currency? What would it mean for financial stability? What would it mean for privacy? Regulatory pressure became insurmountable. By early 2022, Meta disbanded the Diem project. With the company abandoning its cryptocurrency ambitions, years of effort went down the drain. Ching and his core team faced a choice: return to work on Meta's traditional infrastructure or launch what they had already built independently. They chose independence. Building Aptos: In December 2021, Avery Ching co-founded Aptos Labs with Mo Shaikh, who had previously been responsible for partnerships and strategy at Diem. Cryptocurrency prices were beginning a long decline, entering what would become the 2022 bear market. FTX hadn't collapsed yet‚Äînobody predicted it. Ching and Shaikh weren't concerned with market timing. They had built a blockchain they believed was technically superior to any other existing system. With the Move programming language, a parallel execution engine called BlockSTM, and a Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus mechanism, Aptos processes transactions faster than existing proof-of-stake systems. However, the real challenge lies in whether anyone will care about the quality of the technology when the entire cryptocurrency market is on the verge of collapse. In Aptos' early days, Ching and his team had to convince skeptical investors why the world needed another Layer-1 blockchain. Ethereum already existed, along with Solana, Avalanche, Cosmos, and numerous other competitors vying for developers and users. Ching's presentations differed from those of typical cryptocurrency founders. He didn't promise a decentralized utopia or revolutionary financial inclusion. He talked about what he understood: building scalable infrastructure. He explained, ‚ÄúAt Aptos, we believe that focusing on scalability is paramount. You can start with one journey and end up in a completely different place because you can continuously push the network forward.‚Äù This focus on scalability stems from the painful experience at Meta. Systems that cannot adapt eventually perish. The ability to improve infrastructure without breaking existing applications is crucial for long-term success. Aptos launched its mainnet in October 2022, at a time when the cryptocurrency bear market was deepening. The following month, FTX crashed, and the industry's credibility collapsed. While retail investors fled the cryptocurrency market, institutional investors became increasingly interested. The FTX incident exposed the consequences of inadequate cryptocurrency infrastructure. Companies like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton began seeking blockchain platforms that met institutional security, compliance, and reliability standards. Aptos's corporate background suddenly became an advantage. By 2023, Ching had significantly narrowed Aptos's business scope. Instead of trying to meet everyone's every need, he positioned blockchain as a \"global trading engine\" for tokenizing real-world assets. Traditional financial systems suffer from excessive friction. Settlement takes days. Cross-border transactions are costly. Transaction time is limited. Custody requires multiple intermediaries. Blockchain, on the other hand, can eliminate most of this friction. By placing real-world assets on the blockchain, you can trade 24/7, settle instantly, and significantly reduce custody costs. But tokenization requires more than just technology; it also requires partnerships with institutions that own the assets, have regulatory relationships, and capital to truly achieve tokenization. Ching has begun signing these partnership agreements. BlackRock brought its BUIDL fund to Aptos, investing $500 million in tokenized assets. Franklin Templeton launched a tokenized money market fund on the platform. Apollo began exploring tokenized credit products. By mid-2025, Aptos will have over $1.2 billion in tokenized real-world assets under custody. The South Korean market has become another key area of ‚Äã‚Äãfocus. South Korea boasts high trading volumes, a large retail investor base, and a high level of cultural acceptance of digital assets. Ching has partnered with Lotte Group, one of South Korea's largest retailers, which uses Aptos to issue mobile vouchers. In late 2024, Ching stated, ‚ÄúAs we begin working with major retailers and engaging with banks and large payment companies, we are seeing rapidly growing interest from the South Korean side. The new government seems very supportive of cryptocurrencies. I expect cryptocurrency to develop very quickly in South Korea.‚Äù This collaboration with South Korea validated Ching‚Äôs strategy: find real-world use cases where blockchain can deliver tangible benefits and then scale rapidly. In December 2024, Mo Shaikh resigned from his leadership role at Aptos. Ching, who had previously served as Chief Technology Officer, took over as CEO. As CTO, Ching was responsible for technology development. As CEO, he will be responsible for strategic direction and partnerships, which will determine Aptos‚Äô success or failure. Ching‚Äôs first nine months as CEO focused primarily on enhancing Aptos‚Äô market positioning. Instead of competing with other blockchain platforms for developers and retail users, he focused on building Aptos into an infrastructure for institutions to tokenize and trade real-world assets. However, Ching's focus extends beyond technology development. He also actively collaborates with regulators to help develop rules governing tokenized assets. In June 2025, he was appointed to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee. This role gives him a voice in shaping U.S. digital asset regulations. Aptos Labs, in announcing the appointment, stated, \"Avery will collaborate with other leaders from the web3 and financial services sectors to develop digital asset regulations.\" For Ching, this regulatory work is crucial. Institutional adoption of blockchain requires a clear regulatory framework. Without such a framework, institutions cannot commit capital on a large scale. Ching's Attitude Towards Crypto: Ching doesn't see decentralization as an ultimate goal. He hasn't promised to disrupt traditional finance or create a new economic system. Instead, he focuses on solving practical problems: speeding up transactions, reducing costs, improving security, and fostering new financial products. This pragmatism stems from his experience building infrastructure at Yahoo and Meta. These companies didn't pursue theoretical elegance but focused on building systems that could reliably operate for billions of users. Ching's focus on practical applications attracted institutions that wouldn't normally consider more ideologically driven crypto projects. For example, BlackRock and Franklin Templeton weren't interested in disrupting central banks or creating parallel financial systems. What they needed was infrastructure that could help them provide better products to their customers. Aptos provided that infrastructure. This is the engineer's belief: better tools lead to better results. Efficiency itself is ethical. Making something serve a billion people is itself a form of idealism. He is not trying to change human nature, but rather accepting it and building upon it. Ultimately, this may be the most radical stance.</span></span></p></div></div>",

This reflects its full-stack infrastructure vision, evolving from stablecoins to tokenized government bonds, and ultimately to tokenized securities. It's worth noting that Ondo's model focuses on primary market issuance rather than secondary market trading. 4. Distribution Channels Remain a Structural Weakness Despite product maturity, USDY's liquidity and trading volume remain limited, indicating low retail participation and an unclear target customer base. This highlights that distribution and channel development are Ondo's most pressing bottlenecks. 5. Token Unlocking Risk: A large-scale token unlocking event expected in early 2026 could bring selling pressure. Lacking sustainable cash flow, Ondo may become increasingly reliant on token sales to sustain operations. 6. Macroeconomic Yields: The ongoing global interest rate cut cycle is compressing risk-weighted asset yields, putting pressure on government-backed stablecoins. In the short to medium term, Ondo must leverage its Global Markets (GM) products to maintain growth momentum and offset declining fixed-income returns. Ondo's Business Lines, Model, and Revenue: Ondo operates multiple product lines, each targeting different tiers of the RWA value chain, evolving from highly liquid, low-risk assets to complex tokenized securities and financial infrastructure products. The roadmap follows a clear logic of expansion from \"liquidity to utility,\" proceeding sequentially from stablecoins ‚Üí tokenized government bonds ‚Üí tokenized stocks/ETFs ‚Üí multi-chain settlement infrastructure. The company views stablecoins as a proof-of-concept for the availability of on-chain assets, demonstrating that blockchain-based settlements can operate at scale. However, more complex financial instruments, such as government bonds, ETFs, and stocks, are expected to deliver more significant efficiency gains and improved user experience. Within this framework, stablecoins serve as an entry point for liquidity bootstrapping and user registration, while tokenized government bonds act as a bridge to fully on-chain securities. The next phase of development focuses on the tokenization of highly liquid stocks, directly connecting traditional market makers and brokers to the blockchain network. By enabling 24/7 issuance/redemption operations and 24/7 secondary market trading, Ondo aims to make stocks and ETFs composable components of the DeFi ecosystem, thereby significantly expanding the asset range and extending the trading hours of on-chain finance. To truly realize the usability of these securities, complementary financial protocols, such as lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, and collateral frameworks, must be developed in parallel. Ondo's lending platform, Flux Finance, has demonstrated that tokenized securities can serve as collateral in DeFi, enabling recyclable liquidity. As one of the pioneers in the RWA field, Ondo's multi-tiered product evolution model provides a representative blueprint for how real-world asset projects can expand across product verticals. Through this framework, investors can better understand Ondo's operating model, growth trajectory, and strategic differentiation advantages, thus gaining a replicable perspective to analyze the broader RWA market landscape. USDY ‚Äì A Yield Stablecoin USDY is a yield stablecoin backed by bank deposits and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds. While its primary issuance is limited to KYC-verified investors, secondary market trading is permissionless, ensuring its widespread adoption in the DeFi space. Ondo generates revenue through the yield of its underlying assets, distributing the majority of the yield to holders while retaining a small interest rate spread and charging a 20 basis point redemption fee as its primary source of income. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\"

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Liza Savenko, Source: Cointelegraph, Translated by: Shaw &amp; Jinse Finance</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Key Takeaways:</h2><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A sharp drop in Bitcoin often triggers systemic contagion, dragging down the prices of other cryptocurrencies through liquidity and confidence channels.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">During crises, markets tend to view cryptocurrencies as single risk assets rather than focusing on their individual utility, as demonstrated by the high correlation between BTC-ETH and BTC-XRP.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Correlation and Beta coefficient analysis is crucial for quantifying the dependence of Ethereum and XRP on Bitcoin's performance.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Monitoring correlation metrics, using derivatives, and holding stable or yield-generating assets can help hedge against shocks related to Bitcoin.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Monitoring correlation metrics, using derivatives, and holding stable or yield-generating assets can help hedge against shocks related to Bitcoin.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Bitcoin's dominance in the cryptocurrency market has always been a defining characteristic of cryptocurrency cycles. But what happens if Bitcoin's dominance weakens or its price plummets by 50%? In this scenario, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization‚ÄîEthereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP)‚Äîwill become key cases for examining how the market restructures. This article will explain how to assess Ethereum and XRP when Bitcoin is impacted, including measuring their dependence, assessing risks, and developing effective hedging strategies. Why Bitcoin's Dominance Matters So Much In traditional stock markets, when an industry giant suffers a setback, the chain reaction is immediate. Smaller companies often depreciate as a result because they rely on the ecosystem, investor confidence, supply chain connections, and reputation of the industry leader. The same principle applies to the cryptocurrency market: Bitcoin acts as an \"anchor asset.\" When Bitcoin's price falls, the entire market loses stability and direction. Historically, Bitcoin has accounted for a large share of the cryptocurrency market capitalization, a phenomenon known as the \"dominance\" metric. Most altcoins, including Ethereum and XRP, exhibit strong correlations with Bitcoin's price movements. For example, following the tariff announcement on October 10, 2025, the cryptocurrency market experienced a massive liquidation event, with Bitcoin's price plummeting. According to CoinMetrics data, over the next eight days, the correlation between BTC and ETH rose from 0.69 to 0.73, while the correlation between BTC and XRP also increased from 0.75 to 0.77. This significant convergence suggests that altcoins do not decouple due to their individual utility during liquidity crises triggered by macroeconomic panics. Metrics such as Ethereum's trading volume or XRP's institutional adoption offer little protection in such situations. Instead, a high positive correlation can serve as an empirical indicator of the sharing of systemic risk. This indicates that the market views the entire cryptocurrency industry as a single asset class. This amplifies the subsequent impact of a Bitcoin price crash on Ethereum and XRP. This means that if Bitcoin's market share declines or its price crashes, Ethereum and XRP are unlikely to fluctuate independently. They are likely to be affected by two factors: Liquidity/Structural Channels Market structures related to Bitcoin, including derivatives, trading flows, and investor behavior, are weakening. A significant Bitcoin crash can trigger massive liquidations, with margin calls and chain sell-offs being the primary causes. This typically leads to a massive outflow of funds, impacting all crypto assets regardless of their fundamentals. The reason for their decline is simple: they share the same risk basket. The collapse of decentralized assets shakes the core principles of the entire cryptocurrency industry, eroding investor confidence in the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies. As panic spreads, investors often turn to safer assets like fiat currencies or gold. The result is a prolonged bear market, further reducing investor enthusiasm for Ethereum and XRP. How to Measure Dependence on Bitcoin and Risk Step 1: Define the Impact Scenario The analysis begins by selecting a potentially high-impact Bitcoin event. This might include defining a specific price shock, such as Bitcoin falling 50% in 30 days, or a structural shift, such as Bitcoin's market share dropping from 60% to 40%. Step 2: Quantifying Dependency The next step is to calculate the current Pearson correlation coefficient between Ethereum, XRP, and Bitcoin. This statistic reflects the linear relationship between the daily returns of these assets, providing a benchmark for measuring their dependence. The closer the correlation coefficient is to +1, the stronger the correlation between the altcoin's performance and Bitcoin's. Step 3: Estimate Immediate Price Response Using correlation data, regression analysis is applied to calculate the Beta coefficient of each altcoin relative to Bitcoin. The Beta coefficient estimates the expected price change of the altcoin for every unit change in Bitcoin. This is similar to calculating the Beta coefficient of stocks relative to benchmark indices such as the S&amp;P 500 in traditional finance. For example, if Ethereum's Beta coefficient against Bitcoin is 1.1, and the defined scenario assumes Bitcoin drops by 50%, then the implied change in Ethereum would be -55% (1.1 √ó -50%). Step 4: Adjusting for Liquidity and Structural Risks The adjustment strategy needs to go beyond simple Beta coefficient calculations and incorporate key market structural risks. Order books from exchanges with lower trading volumes should be analyzed to assess liquidity risk. The structural risks and potential cascading liquidation risks of high-volume derivative open interest must also be assessed. For example, if the implied -55% drop in step 3 is exacerbated by insufficient liquidity, the actual loss could increase by another 10%, bringing the total drop to -65%. Furthermore, open interest and margin positions should be reviewed, as high leverage can accelerate a decline through cascading liquidations. What happens to Ethereum and XRP if Bitcoin suffers a major blow? In traditional finance, a crash in the S&amp;P 500 or the sudden collapse of a large brokerage firm often triggers rapid and indiscriminate risk aversion‚Äîan effect known as \"financial contagion.\" The cryptocurrency market exhibits similar dynamics, but at a faster pace and on a larger scale, typically triggered by shocks originating from Bitcoin. Data from past crises (including the FTX and Terra crashes) reveals a clear pattern: when Bitcoin falls, other cryptocurrencies typically follow suit. Bitcoin remains the primary risk indicator for the market. In such situations, liquidity often flows into stablecoins or exits the market entirely to hedge against the risks of volatile assets. While Ethereum benefits from its strong Layer-1 utility, it is not entirely immune; its correlation with Bitcoin typically strengthens during periods of market stress as institutional capital views both as risk assets. However, Ethereum's staking lock-up mechanism and extensive decentralized application ecosystem may provide a utility-driven support, helping it rebound more quickly after a crisis subsides. On the other hand, assets like XRP, facing higher regulatory and structural risks and lacking Ethereum's extensive and natural on-chain yield mechanisms, may suffer disproportionate shocks. Such shocks often trigger a vicious cycle where the loss of collective confidence outweighs the token's fundamental utility, leading to a correlated decline across the entire market. What if Bitcoin loses market dominance or its price falls? How to hedge your strategy? To hedge against a Bitcoin crash, basic diversification alone is insufficient. Systemic shocks demonstrate that extreme correlations often negate the benefits of diversification. Explore Derivatives During periods of extreme market panic, futures market prices can be significantly lower than spot prices. This provides experienced traders with opportunities for relatively low-risk, non-directional arbitrage. They leverage market inefficiencies to hedge volatility risk rather than taking on directional price risk. Diversify your portfolio with risk buffers Hold tokenized gold, real-world assets (RWA), or fiat-backed stablecoins to preserve and grow wealth. These assets serve as liquidity reserves when the cryptocurrency market crashes. Monitoring dominance and correlation ratios: Tracking the rolling short-term correlation between Ethereum and XRP and Bitcoin can serve as a real-time early warning signal that diversified investment returns are disappearing. It can identify when immediate hedging measures are needed. Rebalancing to yield-generating positions: Transferring some assets to staking, lending, or liquidity pools‚Äîassets that generate returns regardless of market movements. Stable returns help offset valuation losses and increase asset recovery potential.</p></li></ul></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Jake, Messari Analyst; Translation: xz@Jinse Finance</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">After the hype surrounding the release of the Ethereum Foundation's Kohaku wallet SDK subsided, I conducted some research and reflection on RAIL, which I summarize as follows:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>(1) In the past two weeks, RAIL has been fluctuating within a channel between $2.00 and $3.20.</strong> I currently hold a large position in RAIL, with an average cost of approximately $1.50. If the price breaks below the support level, I will start adding to my position. If you haven't entered the market yet, the price level near the lower edge of the channel is quite attractive.</p> ... <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Pda1RNdacXjNX9s0kapr4oWG89ujJubRkug1QLAe.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410359_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410359\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Ôºà2ÔºâThe core logic remains unchanged; only the market has changed</strong>. After the liquidation event on October 10, RAIL plummeted from approximately $5.00 to $2.20. Since then, its price movement has consistently been highly synchronized with the sideways trading pattern of BTC. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"VFBu2V84o6Wj8jANtYh5BFp0PFECVCBCTTnH38Ky.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410360_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410360\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Ôºà3ÔºâAccording to the quick calculation model of AJC, Corporate Research Manager at Messari</strong>: If 1% of ETH and stablecoins on Ethereum flow through the RAILGUN privacy collection, it will generate approximately $82.4 million in annualized revenue. This calculation is based on a 1.25% revenue capture rate (historical annualized capture rate is 4-10% of TVL) and a 1.0% potential market penetration rate (current market size is $450-500 billion in ETH and approximately $175 billion in stablecoins). At $2.30, its fully diluted valuation (FDV) is $132 million, meaning that in the baseline scenario, annual revenue is equivalent to 62% of its total FDV. Even under pessimistic assumptions (0.1% market penetration + 1.25% revenue capture), it still generates $8.2 million in annual revenue, representing 6.2% of its total FDV (while in a bull market scenario, 10% market penetration would generate $823 million in annualized revenue, equivalent to 624% of FDV). Furthermore, this is only one dimension for evaluating RAIL. Compared to similar valuations (Zcash ‚àí FDV $6.46 billion / Monero ‚àí FDV $5.95 billion), RAIL's current FDV is less than 3% of its competitors (considering Railgun's quantifiable cash flow potential, a reasonable valuation should be closer to 10-15% of its competitors). Not to mention, ZEC's continued strong performance will further boost the bullish logic for RAIL in the privacy sector. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"eYB6bZlHZpiV8ieefJ2BnQbaxa8LGpa0oTpMh5ik.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410361_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410361\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Ôºà4ÔºâPotential Catalyst: Continued Growth in Usage</strong>. Railgun processed $1.6 billion in privacy transactions this year, slightly less than half of the protocol's total transaction volume since 2021 ($4 billion). </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Railgun plans to demonstrate its wallet technology at the Devconnect conference in Argentina in two weeks.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Railgun plans to demonstrate its wallet technology at the Devconnect conference in Argentina in two weeks.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> The Ethereum ecosystem continues to increase its investment in privacy, especially Railgun‚Ä¶ The Ethereum Foundation continues to increase its investment in institutional-grade solutions, especially institutional-grade privacy solutions like Railgun‚Ä¶ (5) With the occurrence of market liquidation events, the window for short-term trading of RAIL has closed, but the window for long-term investment (with at least 3-5 times potential) is fully open.

            "title": "Bankless: The Next Frontier in On-Chain Lending",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Arnav Pagidyala, Source: Bankless, Translated by: Shaw Jinse Finance</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On-chain lending has become a pillar of decentralized finance (DeFi). However, despite its rapid development, its underlying architecture has remained virtually unchanged since Compound v2. Over 99% of DeFi still operates in some form of over-collateralized, floating-rate model pioneered a few years ago.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For the world to truly operate on-chain, lending must mature far beyond its current form.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">What began as a simple stablecoin lending mechanism is now evolving into a complete financial system. This article aims to highlight the latest breakthroughs in protocol design, credit architecture, and regulation that are driving on-chain lending to become the foundational layer of a programmable global economy.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> 1. DeFi as a New Financial Operating System Over the past cycle, DeFi has quietly evolved from a series of isolated applications into a **composable global financial operating system**. In 2018, protocols such as Aave, Compound, and Uniswap operated as independent applications, each with its own liquidity, governance mechanisms, and user base. By 2025, they had evolved into a \"financial kernel\": a programmable environment where liquidity, risk, and execution are abstracted into modular layers that other developers can combine, extend, or build into new financial systems. In traditional software, an operating system provides three functions: shared memory, standardized interfaces, and permissionless scalability. The same model is now appearing in the DeFi space. These new \"operating system protocols\" manage the shared state of funds, rather than the shared state of files. Liquidity acts as the memory layer, the interest rate curve and Automated Market Makers (AMMs) act as system calls, while oracles, treasuries, and governance mechanisms constitute the layer for coordinated execution. Several mainstream protocols already embody this design philosophy: Aave v4 is evolving into a hub-and-spoke liquidity operating system. At its core is a controlled kernel called the \"Liquidity Hub,\" surrounded by modular markets for RWAs, GHOs, and permissioned pools. Liquidity only needs to be provided once and can be deployed to all branches under controlled risk parameters, achieving unified capital efficiency rather than fragmented liquidity pools. This marks a significant step forward for Aave v4 from the isolated market architecture of Aave v3 to a fully shared liquidity layer. Morpho v1 and Euler v2 take a completely different approach: they employ a minimalist credit core, sharing only logic and not liquidity. Each vault is an independent micromarket, but all inherit the same underlying architecture‚Äîa unified accounting and clearing engine. Morpho v2 extends this by replacing static vaults with an intent-based Request for Quotation (RFQ) matching layer, allowing fixed-rate and floating-rate loans to coexist in a unified credit market. Fluid represents the most vertically integrated version, a unified liquidity operating system where lending, trading, and collateral all originate from a shared pool of funds. It is the first system to treat every dollar of idle capital, collateral, and borrowed funds as an interconnected resource. These architectures collectively mark the next stage in the development of DeFi. The era of isolated money markets is giving way to more interoperable financial systems that function more like operating environments than applications. Liquidity, risk, and governance are becoming shared infrastructure, not product features. Whether through modular hubs, minimalist kernels, or vertically integrated engines, the ultimate goal is the same: to build an open, programmable, and globally composable financial system. 2. Order Book-Based Lending Most DeFi lending still relies on the pool model, where all liquidity providers share risk and reward. This model offers simplicity and shared liquidity, but at the cost of insufficient precision. Furthermore, interest rates are not determined through negotiation but generated by algorithms or decentralized autonomous systems (DAOs), a stark contrast to the refined interest rates offered by traditional finance (TradFi). The next breakthrough in lending microstructure is the order book-based lending model, where lenders and borrowers post specific quotes, similar to a centrally limited order book (CLOB) in traditional finance. This structure allows for granular control over terms: fixed or floating interest rates, maturity dates, collateral requirements, and even custom risk parameters. Hybrid models are also emerging, combining pooling liquidity for increased depth with order book mechanisms for price discovery. Just as AMMs evolved into models with centralized liquidity, lending markets may also tend towards this more expressive design. However, the key difference is that lending markets are built for passive lenders, so the experience is largely the same for ordinary borrowers, but borrowers will have more choices. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"3kVrJDsZ9IRJ4j3gbq7q1K70ZsitwHF3IV55mPgE.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410340_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410340\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Order books can be used for both floating-rate and fixed-rate loans, but their basic mechanism is similar: lenders publish quotes, borrowers accept quotes, and the matching results generate credit positions on-chain. Most of the funding in these systems comes from passive lenders, typically deployed through custodians or vault managers who aggregate liquidity and manage parameters on behalf of passive lenders. Avon is pioneering a hybrid architecture that combines a centrally controlled order book with custom strategies (independent markets), allowing compatible orders to be atomically cleared while still meeting the needs of passive lenders.</p><br/><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">3. The Era of Convenience</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As mentioned above, the underlying lending protocol will be completely abstracted by a series of consumer-facing products. Examples include revolving lending, automated risk management, yield abstraction, and consumer agency.</p><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Revolving strategies</strong> are being abstracted into seamless, one-click operation products. Platforms like Contango and Loopscale have already automated the process, while lending marketplaces like Jupiter, Euler, and Silo are beginning to integrate these mechanisms directly into their front-end interfaces.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Yield Abstraction</strong>: For end users, lending will be simplified to a single \"net return\" figure. The underlying strategies will gradually fade from view, just as banks hide the operation of overnight repurchase agreements behind current account interest rates.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Yield Abstraction</strong> With direct integration between exchanges like Coinbase and protocols like Morpho, yield will become a basic user experience feature, rather than a complex financial operation. Consumer Agents: Smart agents will dynamically manage collateral ratios, refinance, and liquidation protection on behalf of users. These systems will rebalance positions across protocols in real time, optimize borrowing costs, and hedge volatility in real time, transforming active portfolio management into a back-office process. 4. Ratings, Benchmarking, and Compliance DeFi can only reach trillions of dollars if using it doesn't jeopardize the CFO's job. Any financial market needs standards, and the lending market is no exception. Credit ratings, transparent benchmarks, and compliance frameworks constitute the trust infrastructure that connects code-based markets with real-world capital. Ratings: Just as Moody's or S&amp;P assess corporate and sovereign credit, independent risk rating agencies will emerge to evaluate DeFi vaults, protocols, and on-chain credit portfolios. These ratings will quantify smart contract risk, collateral quality, counterparty risk exposure, and historical performance, allowing institutional risk frameworks to be clearly mapped to the underlying DeFi technology. While I believe S&amp;P and Moody's will likely remain dominant in this space, emerging agencies like Web3SOC and Credora are also appearing. Benchmarking: Standardized indices, such as \"DeFi LIBOR\" or \"on-chain SOFR,\" will enable borrowers, lenders, and vaults to price risk and compare yields across different protocols. This will lay the foundation for native on-chain building of derivatives, yield curves, and structured credit markets. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Compliance</strong>: With the addition of institutions, embedded KYC/AML will become a basic requirement. Protocols will increasingly divide liquidity into permissionless and compliant tiers, enabling regulated entities to access DeFi tracks while maintaining open access for all other users. For example, Morpho v2 vaults support customizable access controls designed to meet institutional compliance requirements. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">These elements together constitute the institutional interface for on-chain lending.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">5. Beyond Overcollateralization</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The current market is dominated by crypto asset overcollateralization and floating-rate lending, which, while practical, is essentially a narrow niche market. The future development of on-chain lending will go far beyond this model, unlocking the complete credit system that underpins traditional finance.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Fixed-Rate Loans: Predictable payments, clear maturity dates, and structured instruments are prerequisites for institutional adoption. Protocols like Morpho v2 are pioneering intent-based fixed-rate markets, while emerging designs like Term and Tenor are exploring auction-driven and order book mechanisms to price term risk directly on-chain. In effect, Morpho v2 may serve both ends of the market: a highly liquid, order book-based market on one end, and a highly customizable over-the-counter (OTC) market on the other, with custodians allocating liquidity vaults and lending divisions managing more targeted credit risk exposures. Low-Collateralized Loans: Protocols like 3Jane and Wildcat are pioneering frameworks for trust-minimized, low-collateralized lending, combining the guarantees enforced by smart contracts with real-world underwriting and trusteeship reputation. Alternative Credit Markets: Lending is also expanding into the long tail and non-traditional collateral areas, such as tokenized RWAs, alternative FX pairs, stablecoin arbitrage trading, and even credit lines guaranteed by credit. These markets introduce new dimensions of risk, including diversification, cross-border liquidity, and reflection of the complexities of global finance. The explosive growth of Midas is a prime example, highlighting the dynamics of two-way demand: traditional finance seeks to enhance on-chain liquidity through cyclical mechanisms, while crypto-native investors seek high-yield exposure to uncorrelated traditional financial instruments. These cutting-edge areas collectively signify DeFi's evolution from a collateral-constrained niche into a comprehensive, programmable credit system capable of collateralizing a wide range of financial products, from consumer loans to sovereign debt, with all transactions settled directly on-chain. Finally, when discussing the future of DeFi lending, I must mention the rise of custodians like Gauntlet, Re7, Steakhouse, and MEV Capital. These institutions actively manage liquidity, optimize returns, and adjust protocol parameters. They are evolving into on-chain versions of Millennium or Citadel, deploying quantitative strategies, risk models, and dynamic liquidity management across multiple protocols. In the past few years, custodians have earned modest performance fees and often subsidize users with incentives to attract deposits. But this is not a quick fix. They understand that custody itself will be one of the most scalable and profitable businesses of the next decade. Attracting deposits is merely a means of user acquisition; the ultimate goal is data distribution. As these companies grow in size and reputation, it's easy to imagine them becoming on-chain asset management firms managing over $10 billion in assets and holding a significant position across all major protocols. The competition for deposits will only intensify. There are many hedge funds, but only one Millennium, and every project manager in the DeFi space is vying to become its on-chain successor. Conclusion DeFi lending is no longer a collateral-based leverage experiment; it is evolving into the architecture of a programmable financial system. From order book-based credit markets and one-click revolving products to institutional-grade ratings and low-collateral frameworks, each layer of architecture is being rebuilt for scale, precision, and accessibility. Once lending truly becomes programmable, finance will no longer be confined to institutions but will exist within the network.</p></li></ul></div></div>",
