The investment is in current costs, betting on future prices. If the judgment is correct, time will make you money. This logic has been running for over a decade. Now, Wu Jihan is changing the target of this logic. The target has shifted from the price of cryptocurrency to the long-term price of computing power demand in the AI ​​climate. The means have changed from exchanging electricity for cryptocurrency to borrowing money to buy land. The object of arbitrage has changed, but the structure of arbitrage is gone. In the same week that he cleared out his Bitcoin holdings, BitDeer also completed the pricing of $325 million in new debt. According to Bitdeer's financial report, as of December 31, 2025, Bitdeer's outstanding principal loans were approximately $1 billion (excluding $500 million in derivative liabilities). Therefore, the total debt is approximately $1.3 billion. The Bitcoin crash is real, the debt is real, the land purchases are real, but the outcome of this tough battle may not be revealed until 2029. Bitdeer was founded in 2018, starting as a mining machine sharing platform. Currently, it is one of the world's largest listed mining companies, with a self-mining hashrate of 63.2 EH/s, ranking first among listed mining companies globally and accounting for approximately 6% of the entire Bitcoin network's hashrate. However, Wu Jihan no longer wants to sell hashrate; he wants to get involved in the power industry. </span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span leaf=\"\"><img alt=\"JvSeGeaJAVSKBs69FU5B6zME5ZGaBewAtaCSL1lw.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.com.cn/7436474_image3.png\" title=\"7436474\"/></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">Let's analyze BitDeer's financial report.

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Delphi Digital; Translator: @Jinse Finance xz</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the traditional financial sector, the vast majority of major tokenization pilot projects run on the same infrastructure. UBS, SWIFT, Mastercard, JPMorgan Chase, and Coinbase all use Chainlink. But can such adoption translate into real benefits?</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>1. Infrastructure</strong></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Equities Data Streams will expand to 24/7/5 coverage by 2026</strong>. This system aggregates price information from top data providers, verifies it through an oracle network, and provides sub-second updates. On-chain derivatives, prediction markets, and structured products can now reference real US stock prices.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"eXwctcJAduOyDbrMD9YI85MpUMEifBXEMA5Cw0tL.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.com.cn/7436460_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7436460\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Chainlink Runtime Environment is responsible for handling workflow execution.</strong> Developers can orchestrate workflows using modular components such as data feeds without having to manage node infrastructure themselves. This network is designed to ensure execution continues even if individual nodes fail. CRE natively supports the ISO 20022 standard and can be directly embedded into existing Swift infrastructure without additional conversion layers. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Confidential Compute will enter early access phase in early 2026, utilizing a trusted execution environment to process sensitive data without exposing it.</strong> Data enters in encrypted form, is processed in an isolated environment, and only the result is output. A proof mechanism verifies that the computation runs correctly within a true TEE. This means institutions can use public blockchains without exposing sensitive operations. CCIP connects over 60 blockchains through a layered security model. Independent networks are responsible for execution and monitoring, and can suspend transmissions if anomalies are detected. Coinbase chose it as the sole cross-chain bridge for all Coinbase Wrapped Assets. Over the past year, CCIP's cumulative transaction volume has increased approximately 7 times. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>2、</strong><strong>Chainlink's Current Status</strong></h2><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"x3Lg1fNMYwUH4Vx86mQC02ulxDZJmYpUeZFQytXQ.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.com.cn/7436461_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7436461\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Chainlink's persistent weakness lies in the fact that everyone relies on it, yet nobody pays much for it. However, since 2025, the team has introduced two mechanisms that could potentially change this situation. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Through a smart value recovery mechanism in partnership with Aave, MEVs are recovered during liquidation, capturing $16 million in nine months.</strong></p> Chainlink received 35%, approximately $5.6 million. This is significant as a proof of concept, but the mechanism needs to be expanded to other lending protocols for sustainable growth. The Chainlink Reserve converts enterprise payments into LINK purchases on the open market. Since its launch seven months ago, the reserve has accumulated 2.3 million LINK. This is still in its early stages, but enterprise payments are real. 3. Macro Landscape In terms of total locked value, Chainlink holds a 64% share of the oracle market. Protocols like Aave and Lido run their critical infrastructure through Chainlink, and switching vendors would mean contract rewriting, audits, governance voting, and real migration risks. Instead of leaving, Lido migrated its cross-chain infrastructure to CCIP, deepening its partnership with Chainlink. Maintaining a leading position means working on three fronts: launching Confidential Compute before institutions build their own privacy solutions; extending SVR beyond Aave to demonstrate the scalability of its revenue model; and convincing banks that public blockchain solutions are simpler than private ones. Chainlink's value hinges on the massive rollout of institutional tokenization. For those who believe tokenization is imminent, Chainlink is the infrastructure layer.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Source: ecoinometrics, Compiled by: Shaw &amp; Jinse Finance</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">We analyze the three most critical market signals affecting Bitcoin and macro assets every week, providing institutional-grade insights through data-driven charts and analysis.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Today we will introduce:</p><ol class=\"list-paddingleft-2\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Bitcoin's deep pullback needs time to recover</strong></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Gold ETF inflows have surpassed Bitcoin</strong></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>PCE data has not confirmed a decline in CPI.</strong></p></li></ol><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This week's three charts tell the same story from different perspectives.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Bitcoin remains in a rare downtrend, with funds flowing towards defensive rather than risky assets, and the inflation indicators closely watched by the Federal Reserve have not confirmed a resurgence of deflation. In other words, the overall economic environment has not seen substantial improvement. Let's take a look. Bitcoin's deep pullback will take time to recover. Severe declines can alter the rhythm of the market. Bitcoin is currently down about 52% from its peak. In the past decade, there have only been five instances of declines exceeding this. Once it reaches this level, prices rarely rebound overnight. The only recent exception was the market crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, which was a policy-driven shock followed by unconventional liquidity support measures from governments. However, this context does not apply to the current environment. Most deep pullbacks occur slowly. Market conditions are gradually deteriorating, the rebound has failed, and confidence needs to be rebuilt gradually, not overnight. In the current market depth, the key is not to predict the exact bottom, but to observe the overall changes in risk appetite and demand, changes that have historically been accompanied by sustained recovery. These signals often emerge gradually over time, meaning that once market signs improve, there is usually room to adjust investment exposure. For now, historical patterns suggest that we should remain patient, rather than rush into things. Bitcoin is experiencing one of its five most severe declines in nearly a decade. Historically, a rebound from such a deep level requires sustained improvement in macroeconomic and demand conditions, rather than a short-term price bounce. Gold ETF flows have surpassed Bitcoin flows. If we look at the cumulative flows since the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024, Bitcoin initially dominated, attracting a flood of funds. Even by 2025, when funds began flowing into gold, the growth trends of both had been synchronized. However, this trend has changed. Since November, Bitcoin ETFs have seen net outflows, while gold ETFs have experienced a continuous rise in inflows. Therefore, the cumulative net inflow into gold ETFs during the same period has exceeded that of Bitcoin. It's worth noting that gold is benefiting from the same market environment that is putting pressure on Bitcoin. When investors adopt a more conservative strategy, funds tend to flow into assets seen as stable safe havens. Despite being dubbed \"digital gold,\" Bitcoin has not received the same treatment in portfolios. In fact, Bitcoin trades more like a high-beta growth asset than gold. Fund flow data also confirms this: funds are flowing into defensive assets rather than highly leveraged risky assets. This is not about the narrative; the key is the actual allocation of funds. Since November, ETF fund flows have shown a clear divergence: gold continues to attract safe-haven funds, while Bitcoin faces continuous outflows, clearly indicating a contraction in risk appetite. PCE data does not confirm a decline in CPI. Recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) data shows inflation cooling again. However, the Federal Reserve's target is not the CPI, but the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (PCE). The PCE data reflects a completely different picture. The PCE year-on-year increase is approximately 2.9%. Core PCE is closer to 3.0%. Core services inflation remains above 3.4%. More importantly, this trend has been upward recently, unlike the decline seen in the CPI. The discrepancy between CPI and PCE data may partly reflect time factors and data bias. The government shutdown at the end of last year interrupted CPI data collection, resulting in missing data and biased estimates. This could temporarily exaggerate changes in either. Due to differences in data sources, weighting, and calculation methods, the PCE has not been affected to the same extent. In other words, the moderate CPI data likely exaggerates progress on inflation. This is noteworthy in terms of monetary policy. If the inflation indicators that the Fed focuses on do not decline significantly, then there is no urgency for interest rate cuts. Without more accommodative policies or improved liquidity conditions, risk appetite remains fragile. Bitcoin's trading style is more like a leveraged growth asset than gold, so it naturally faces difficulties in this environment. The key is to confirm the trend. Currently, PCE data has not confirmed the arrival of a new deflationary cycle. Although CPI has declined recently, the PCE, the inflation indicator preferred by the Federal Reserve, remains close to 3% and shows no further downward trend. This reduces the likelihood of a near-term rate cut and maintains a tight liquidity situation. In summary, this week's data did not show any urgency. Bitcoin is in a rare downtrend, funds are flowing into gold, inflation has not given the Fed room for easing, and market momentum remains severely weak. This background makes it difficult to foster a sustained recovery. Avoid forcing trades before the market landscape changes. Wait for market confirmation signals. Act when the market improves.</p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Source: Galaxy; Compiled by: Jinse Finance</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">After days of speculation, on-chain detective ZachXBT released a highly anticipated insider trading investigation report on Thursday. The target company is Axiom, a trading platform and one of the most profitable companies in the cryptocurrency space, with revenues of approximately $390 million to date.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The most famous anonymous detective in the cryptocurrency space released information three days ago, hinting at an investigation, but without revealing the target, which sparked a frenzy of speculation on cryptocurrency Twitter and prediction markets.</strong> Traders placed bets, speculating on which company was the target, with potential targets including Pump.fun, Meteora, World Liberty Financial, Wintertermute, Hyperliquid, Upbit, Jupiter, and others.</p> A dedicated prediction market on Polymarket saw trading volume surge to over $39 million. Around 1 a.m. Thursday, New York time, the probability of Axiom being suspected spiked to approximately 40%, a result confirmed by ZachXBT's revelation, which had been anticipated by insiders. ZachXBT published a detailed post accusing Broox Bauer, a business development employee at the star startup Y Combinator (Winter 2025 cohort), of abusing user privacy data for profit. Traders love the Axiom platform because of its fast execution speed and ability to quickly grab orders. The platform also offers perpetual futures trading. According to ZachXBT, the core of the scheme lies in the fact that Axiom's internal customer support control panel has virtually no controls or monitoring, making it accessible to internal employees. These tools can link wallet addresses to user identities, connected wallets, registration data, and transaction history. A user might trade using 10 different wallets and believe themselves to be anonymous, but Axiom's tools can link these 10 wallets, revealing their holders. This makes this incident different from typical on-chain snooping on transparent blockchains like Solana. Broox allegedly used this wealth of data to compile a Google Sheet containing the wallet addresses of targeted key opinion leaders (KOLs) and used it to preemptively intervene before Memecoin's \"shills\" could promote the token in their Telegram groups. The most shocking evidence is a private phone recording in which Broox claims he can “track any user” and “find out everything related to that user.” In the recording, he describes a strategy of starting with 10 to 20 wallets “so it won’t look suspicious,” and then gradually scaling up. He also boasts about using the same permissions to help a friend quickly earn $200,000. If ZachXBT’s allegations are true, this is not the first time a cryptocurrency industry employee has been arrested for trading with insider information. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) has a poor track record in handling such cases. May 2023: Ishan Washi was sentenced for leaking information about new coin listings on Coinbase to an accomplice. August 2023: Nathanial Chastain was sentenced for insider trading because he knew which NFTs would be displayed on OpenSea's homepage. April 2024: Avraham Eseinberg was convicted of manipulating the Mango market. ZachXBT points out that Broox's offices are located in New York City and believes the Axiom case \"is a great opportunity for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.\" This office is led by Jay Clayton, who served as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump's first term and is very familiar with the cryptocurrency market. Axiom responded that it was \"shocked and disappointed,\" promising to revoke employees' access to these tools and to continue investigating those suspected of wrongdoing. Meanwhile, Broox has reportedly deleted his LinkedIn account. ZachXBT delayed the release of this news for several days, leading people to believe it would reveal a shocking secret, enough to cause a huge market shock. However, when it was discovered that the whistleblower was merely an Axiom employee trading the relatively small-cap Meme coin, the story felt somewhat anticlimactic. This wasn't because the allegations were minor, but because such misconduct is almost commonplace in the Meme coin ecosystem, and the market began to suspect that a company of systemic importance to the cryptocurrency market might be behind it all. For Zack Pokorny of Polymarket and Galaxy Research, this is another victory. He has written extensively on the value of informational signals in predicting the market. Hours before ZachXBT released its research findings, Axiom YES's stock price surged, suggesting that insiders with inside information were pricing in the future. Bubblemaps subsequently discovered a potential link between Broox's wallet and a top Polymarket trader's wallet, noting that the latter also purchased Axiom YES shares, a common insider tactic. However, it remains unclear whether the two wallets belong to the same person. Observers speculate that the Axiom team may be profiting from the market, calling it \"insider trading using investigations into their own insider activities.\" It's worth noting that Polymarket currently estimates a 31% probability of Axiom issuing a token this year, but this figure is only for reference due to the market's relatively low trading volume. If a token issuance is planned, the reputational impact of this investigation will further complicate matters. More broadly, this story highlights systemic problems within the rapidly growing cryptocurrency trading platform landscape. Axiom developed a product with wallet tracking and analytics capabilities, then allowed employees unsupervised access to data containing vast amounts of user privacy information. The consequences were predictable. As platforms rapidly expand and generate huge revenues, internal controls often lag far behind.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Tz; Source: X, Tz_202</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2</p><p></p><blockquote><p style=\"text-align: left;\">OpenAI's $110 billion funding round has pushed the capital threshold of the AI ​​industry to the level of sovereign infrastructure. Just half a month ago, Anthropic broke its own record with $30 billion. This article dissects the revenue cross-prediction, the computing power war among cloud giants, the attack and defense of coded intelligent agents, the collapse of venture capital rules, and the entry of Middle Eastern sovereign capital behind this duopoly battle, asking a core question: As the AGI race enters the commercial validation phase, which will be the first to pass the ultimate judgment of an IPO: the \"ubiquitous empire\" or the \"enterprise fortress\"?</p><p> </p></blockquote><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"></h2><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Introduction: 2026, the Silicon Valley Melting Pot and the Arrival of the Duopoly Era</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In just a few weeks in February 2026, the global tech world witnessed a capital collision worthy of being recorded in business history. This not only broke venture capital records but also redefined the valuation boundaries of technology companies in the capital market.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On February 27, 2026, OpenAI released its ambitious strategic blueprint, \"Scaling AI for everyone,\" and simultaneously dropped a bombshell announcement that shook Wall Street: an additional $110 billion in funding, pushing its pre-money valuation to $730 billion.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"> Just two weeks prior, on February 12th, its strongest competitor, Anthropic, announced the completion of a $30 billion Series G funding round, valuing the company at $380 billion post-money. If we juxtapose these two deals, one fact is undeniable: the capital threshold for maintaining cutting-edge AI research has exceeded the limits of traditional venture capital, and its capital intensity is approaching the macro-era of \"national-level sovereign infrastructure construction.\" However, the underlying industrial currents behind these figures are far more noteworthy than the funding amounts themselves. These two almost simultaneous strategic statements mark the end of the Wild West era of generative AI, once defined by rapid trial and error and unstructured experiments. In its place stands a massive duopoly with extremely rigid hierarchies. The focus of competition has long since shifted from the geeky debate of \"whose model has larger parameters\" to a battle over the underlying architecture of digital civilization. Through the capital battles of February, we see a dramatic divergence between two drastically different paradigms of empire building: OpenAI, leveraging its unparalleled user base and aggressive capital leverage, is attempting to build a ubiquitous \"ubiquitous empire\" spanning both hardware and software; while Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI executives, deliberately avoids the noisy consumer market, building a solid \"corporate fortress\" in the deep waters of the business market through stringent security commitments and efficient capital operations. In this ultimate marathon towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the deciding factor is no longer simply the ability to generate intelligence. From the impending collision of revenue growth curves to the computing power dark web laid by cloud giants in the underlying infrastructure; from the complete collapse of the exclusive dogma of Silicon Valley venture capital to Middle Eastern sovereign wealth using AI as a bargaining chip in geopolitical games, the showdown between OpenAI and Anthropic is reshaping the underlying rules of the global technology industry. 1. The Crossroads of Growth: The Ultimate Reversal of Scale and Self-Generating Capacity In business history, few moments have allowed people to intuitively feel the power of compound annual growth rates as much as the AI ​​market in 2026. While OpenAI currently maintains a dominant position in terms of absolute total revenue, the underlying logic of market leadership is undergoing a dramatic paradigm shift. According to quantitative modeling analysis by the authoritative firm Epoch AI, since both companies surpassed the $1 billion annualized revenue (ARR) threshold, Anthropic has maintained a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 10x, while OpenAI, as the industry pioneer, has maintained an CAGR of approximately 3.4x. Extending these two drastically different growth curves forward, the predictive model strongly points to a clear and historically significant \"crossroads.\" If the current trend continues, Anthropic's total annualized revenue is highly likely to completely surpass OpenAI around August 2026, with an estimated annualized revenue of approximately $43 billion upon achieving this. Supporting this turnaround prediction is Anthropic's highly focused \"cash-generating machine.\" In its Series G funding announcement in February 2026, Anthropic disclosed that its annualized revenue growth rate had reached $14 billion. The expansion speed is astonishing—just two months prior, this figure was only $9 billion, and three years ago it was zero. This surge is entirely driven by highly sticky enterprise-level demand: in the past year, the number of customers spending over $100,000 annually on the Claude ecosystem has increased sevenfold, with over 500 leading companies exceeding $1 million in annualized spending. More importantly, Anthropic is painting a highly certain path to financial sustainability for Wall Street. The company predicts its cash burn rate will significantly narrow to one-third of revenue (approximately $4.6 billion) in 2026, further decreasing to 9% in 2027, and has set a hard target of achieving full profitability by 2028. To stabilize morale on the eve of a potential IPO, Anthropic even launched an internal secondary market stock sale program worth $5 billion to $6 billion, allowing employees to cash out at a discounted valuation of $350 billion. This restrained and mature financial operation demonstrates a level of financial sophistication disproportionate to its relatively short history. </h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Table 1: Comparison of Core Financial and Capitalization Indicators</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"dsGX3FXz6Q8NlgoctCsxtRqFeu5J8LMZQT0TSRkQ.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.com.cn/7436413_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7436413\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">When we turn our attention to OpenAI, we see a complex picture of scale and losses coexisting.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Undoubtedly, OpenAI possesses the largest user base of this era. As of the end of 2025, its ARR has exceeded $20 billion, ChatGPT has over 900 million weekly active users, and has accumulated over 50 million consumer subscriptions.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> However, converting massive consumer traffic into highly sticky business value has proven to be an expensive battle. OpenAI's current business model still heavily relies on huge infrastructure expenditures. According to internal documents, the enormous computing costs are expected to lead to a structural operating loss of up to $14 billion for OpenAI in 2026. On the road to break-even, OpenAI has set its sights on 2030, a full two years later than Anthropic's timeline. Faced with a massive annual loss of $14 billion and the distant expectation of 2030, OpenAI has had to use a pre-money valuation of $730 billion and a $110 billion funding plan to fund future expansion. Here, the ultimate divide in AI capital is revealed for the first time on financial statements: on one side is OpenAI's \"miracle-making through sheer force\" and intense thirst for capital, leveraging its scale advantage in the C-end market; on the other side is Anthropic's \"efficient compounding\" driven by pure B-end stickiness and its converging profit statements. In the AI ​​capital arena, growth rate is gravity—it determines who has the ability to pull their competitors into their orbit. 2. The Opposition of Business Landscapes: Horizontal Ubiquitous Ecosystem vs. Vertical Enterprise Fortresses Before declaring who the ultimate winner in the enterprise AI market is, we must first understand the true flow of current IT budgets. The current market structure is less a stable state of duopoly and more a period of fluid observation driven by collective customer anxiety. The data reveals a thought-provoking reality: a staggering 79% of companies paying for Anthropic are also paying for OpenAI. This exorbitant \"double-spending\" phenomenon profoundly demonstrates that global CIOs are still strategically hedging in the face of this technological tsunami; no one dares to prematurely stake their company's digital lifeline on a single vendor. When 79% of customers are paying for two companies simultaneously, there are no winners in this market—only two different kinds of irreplaceability. To break this procurement deadlock, OpenAI's solution is \"ubiquitousness.\" As its manifesto, \"Scaling AI for everyone,\" reveals, OpenAI is building a ubiquitous empire that spans the software and physical worlds, attempting to penetrate every pore. On the enterprise side, OpenAI recognizes its weakness in complex system integration, and thus chooses to leverage the power of traditional business centers. In early 2026, OpenAI announced the formation of the \"OpenAI Frontier Alliance,\" deeply partnering with leading consulting giant McKinsey. Its strategic intent is clear: leveraging McKinsey's vast global political and business network to help companies restructure their internal workflows, directly embedding OpenAI's \"digital employees\" deep within the organizational structures of traditional giants. However, OpenAI's ambitions extend far beyond B2B software. At the consumer level, it is undertaking a radical cross-industry offensive—acquiring io Products, founded by former Apple chief designer Jony Ive, for $6.5 billion, and secretly developing native AI-powered smart hardware. Through this device, which may integrate vision and environmental perception capabilities, OpenAI attempts to bypass the gatekeeper monopoly of Apple and Google in mobile operating systems, positioning itself as the \"first entry point\" for next-generation human-computer interaction. Coupled with its aggressive expansion into vertical sectors such as healthcare (acquiring Torch) and finance (integrating LSEG data), OpenAI aims to become the foundational \"water, electricity, and gas\" of the digital age. Faced with the vast ocean of horizontal expansion by OpenAI, Anthropic chose to dig its own well, building a highly secure \"enterprise fortress.\" This company, founded by security fundamentalists, exhibits an almost obsessive business restraint: it not only completely abandoned the bustling consumer hardware market but even spent heavily on advertising during the Super Bowl, simply to pledge to the public that its model would be \"ad-free forever.\" Anthropic firmly anchors its destiny to a pure SaaS and API-based paid model. Anthropic understands that the most lucrative profits in the enterprise market do not lie in generic chatbots but in deeply penetrating complex, high-value cognitive workflows. This strategy has yielded significant returns—its AI-driven coding tool, Claude Code, alone has achieved an annualized revenue run rate (ARR) exceeding $2.5 billion. This tool runs directly within the developer's local integrated development environment (IDE), becoming an indispensable efficiency multiplier for millions of software engineers through highly autonomous background task management. Coupled with dedicated capability packages for compliant industries (such as healthcare and life sciences) and a data residency control principle promising never to use customer-proprietary data to train models, Anthropic precisely targets the vulnerabilities of Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) in various countries. In the highly compliant and complex waters disturbed by OpenAI's aggressive approach, Anthropic has quietly built a highly sticky moat. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Table 2: Comparison of Market Entry (GTM) Strategy Dimensions</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"QTd7r3ITfNhzCAeeNlNerrKVOTXqD6psgcisF9H4.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.com.cn/7436415_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7436415\"/></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"></h2><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">3. The Hidden Battle of Technology: From Ultimate Computing Power Tax Collectors to the Orchestration Rights of Intelligent Agents</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If the commercial landscape at the application layer is the visible positional battle, then deep within the cloud infrastructure, beyond the sight of the public, a hidden battle that will determine the flow of AI profits over the next decade has already begun.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"3jJGt4OqLwRdrbTEvcwBnxt91ykG3lJEEG8dyDFN.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.com.cn/7436418_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7436418\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, OpenAI did not sit idly by while Anthropic dominated the coding race. Just before the February funding storm discussed in this article, OpenAI launched GPT-5.3-Codex on February 5th—its most powerful coding agent model to date. Unlike previous versions that focused solely on code generation, GPT-5.3-Codex is designed as a general-purpose agent performing \"full-spectrum computer work\": it not only writes and reviews code but also drives the entire software engineering process, including testing, debugging, and deployment.</p> ... OpenAI claims that GPT-5.3-Codex participated in its development—early versions were used for debugging and production deployment. Coupled with the concurrently released native macOS Codex desktop application, developers can manage AI agents in parallel across multiple project threads, review differences, and transfer them to the editor with a single click, much like managing an engineering team. Even more significant is the GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark variant released a week later (February 12th). This is OpenAI's first model that doesn't rely on NVIDIA GPUs—it features Cerebras' Wafer Scale Engine 3, achieving ultra-low latency output of over 1000 tokens per second, pushing coding interaction towards a near-instantaneous response experience. This move not only directly challenges Anthropic's coding dominance but also suggests that OpenAI is actively developing a heterogeneous computing ecosystem beyond NVIDIA. Currently, the coding agent field presents a clear \"two-horse race.\" Claude Code, with its million-level token context window and deep reasoning capabilities for complex legacy codebases, plays the role of a \"senior architect\"; while GPT-5.3-Codex, known for its speed and automated pipeline, is more like a \"highly productive engineering team.\" In fact, many enterprise engineering teams have begun to deploy both simultaneously—handling routine coding to Codex and leaving complex architectural decisions to Claude Code. This battle in the coding field may be the closest thing to a zero-sum game between OpenAI and Anthropic. When code becomes the most expensive consumer product of AI, coding agents are the money-printing machines of this era. And on the ultimate paradigm of human-computer interaction—\"how to let AI control computers\"—the philosophical differences between the two have reached their peak. OpenAI offers a highly managed \"Operator\" mechanism. This is a browser-based web agent that emphasizes plug-and-play functionality with \"zero technical barriers\" for consumers, but at the cost of an extremely restricted and closed environment, unable to access local files or underlying software. Conversely, Anthropic adheres to a geeky and deep \"Computer Use\" approach. It allows the Claude model to calculate screen coordinates like a human, directly take over the mouse and keyboard, and natively interact with any legacy desktop operating system or local proprietary database. While this approach currently requires a high level of developer configuration, it perfectly aligns with Anthropic's initial intention to design for complex backend enterprise automation. OpenAI aims for one-click cloud-based management, while Anthropic seeks complete control over the underlying infrastructure. This divergence in approaches is drawing a dividing line for the architectural standards of enterprise AI in the next decade. 4. New Rules of Capital: The Failure of Exclusivity in Venture Capital and the Game of Sovereignty In the traditional dogma of Silicon Valley venture capital (VC), there is a sacred and inviolable bottom line: the principle of exclusivity. Top institutions would never simultaneously invest in direct competitors in two different sectors, as this would not only compromise board confidentiality but also be seen as a betrayal of loyalty to the entrepreneur. However, by 2026, facing AGI, possibly the largest “Total Addressable Market (TAM)” in human history, this orthodox concept completely collapsed. A new term was born on Wall Street – the “Mega-round Exception.” When single-round funding soared to tens of billions of dollars and company valuations approached the trillion-dollar mark, moral purity gave way to the fear of survival. It has been revealed that at least twelve prominent venture capital entities, including Founders Fund co-founded by Peter Thiel and the enigmatic ICONIQ, known for managing the wealth of Silicon Valley tech giants' families, are simultaneously providing substantial funding to OpenAI and Anthropic. For these top-tier investors, the risk of missing out on future opportunities due to \"choosing the wrong target\" far outweighs the so-called conflict of interest. However, absorbing such a massive wave of capital inevitably requires companies to compromise on their fundamental core principles. To overcome institutional hurdles in securing $100 billion in funding, OpenAI completed a complex capital restructuring in October 2025. It explicitly spun off its non-profit entity, the OpenAI Foundation (whose equity value was anchored at approximately $130 billion), while completely reshaping its core business engine into the for-profit OpenAI Group PBC (Public Interest Corporation). This move sent the clearest signal to global capital markets: the laboratory once driven by geek idealism has transformed into a commercial machine that can be precisely priced and traded by Wall Street. However, if Silicon Valley VCs merely broke the rules, the strong entry of Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds fundamentally rewrote the rules of the game. In Anthropic's $30 billion Series G funding round, MGX, a technology investment vehicle backed by the UAE, was prominently listed as a co-lead investor. Meanwhile, MGX is even deeply involved in negotiations for OpenAI's $110 billion funding round, and Saudi sovereign wealth funds like Humain are also making moves everywhere. The massive influx of sovereign capital reveals the fundamental difference between this AI boom and any previous internet bubble: what they want is not simply financial returns (ROI). For Abu Dhabi or Riyadh, hundreds of billions of dollars are merely a stepping stone. They use capital as leverage to exchange for \"technological sovereignty\" in the great power game. These sovereign wealth funds, through massive injections, are forcing Western AI giants to localize the construction of advanced computing infrastructure (such as Saudi Arabia's planned 500-megawatt data center), using this as hard currency to break through geopolitical blockades and obtain import quotas for tens of thousands of top-tier AI chips (such as the 35,000 advanced chips approved for purchase by the UAE). At this point, cutting-edge AI has completely shed its commercial software guise and risen to the level of a strategic asset in the great power game. In this capital network woven by Wall Street hedge funds, Silicon Valley rebels, and Middle Eastern oil tycoons, no one talks about the simplicity of technology anymore; everyone is vying for the highest position in the coming digital new world. 5. The Endgame: Welcoming the 2026-2027 IPO Frenzy With the exponential leap in model capabilities, the ideological and ethical frameworks guiding the deployment of these superintelligent systems are undergoing unprecedented stress tests. OpenAI and Anthropic have shown irreconcilable differences in how to handle relations with state apparatuses, especially military and defense entities. In February 2026, a high-profile political-business conflict will make this difference fully public. At the time, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) demanded full, unrestricted access to Anthropic's Claude model and ordered the removal of all safety guardrails to allow the military to use AI in a wide range of unspecified areas—potentially involving large-scale domestic surveillance or lethal autonomous weapons systems. Faced with the Pentagon's ultimatum—that non-compliance would result in the cancellation of a $200 million contract and potential designation as a \"supply chain risk\" entity with significant financial implications—Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei responded strongly. He publicly stated that the company was \"in good conscience\" resolutely refusing to remove the security measures, thus upholding its \"constitutional AI\" principles based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. From Wall Street's perspective, this was not merely a declaration of values, but also a shrewd business positioning. While this rejection directly resulted in a short-term loss of $200 million in government revenue, it significantly solidified Anthropic's brand equity among privacy-conscious European companies, heavily regulated financial institutions, and ESG-focused institutional investors. This further deepened Anthropic's moat as a \"highly secure, resilient alternative.\" In contrast, OpenAI has adopted a drastically different public stance in its pursuit of a \"ubiquitous empire.\" To maintain its vast ecosystem, OpenAI has continuously relaxed restrictions on its collaborations with military contractors, deepened its integration with Microsoft, which has a large defense business, and even advanced the development of hardware devices with facial recognition surveillance capabilities. OpenAI prefers a pragmatic philosophy of \"iterative deployment\"—trial and error in real, complex environments, thus tolerating potential dual-use risks. Behind these drastically different ethical principles and business empires lies a shared countdown to the end. The window of opportunity for the private equity market to burn money without restraint is closing irrevocably. Whether it's Anthropic's $380 billion valuation backed by a clear 2028 profit commitment and massive secondary market employee stock option cashing out, or OpenAI's $730 billion pre-money valuation and the subsequent $35 billion investment from Amazon tied to its IPO trigger clause, both are sending the same clear signal: massive amounts of capital are no longer paying for mere laboratory research; they demand a clear exit strategy. The race towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has moved beyond the parameter race stage and fully entered the commercial validation phase. OpenAI's \"ubiquitous empire\"—attempting to encompass everything from underlying cloud computing power to edge smart hardware, feeding an omnipotent super brain with endless traffic—and Anthropic's \"enterprise fortress\"—abandoning all the glitz and glamour of the consumer market, attempting to become the secure foundation of the global digital economy with restrained security commitments and deep, code-level workflows. These two vastly different systems will ultimately converge in the largest wave of tech IPOs in human history between 2026 and 2027. At that time, what will determine who reigns supreme in the digital age will no longer be the benchmark tests self-directed by individual laboratories, but rather the investors who vote with their hard-earned money in the public market.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Su Yang</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On February 27th, OpenAI announced the completion of a new $110 billion funding round, valuing the company at $730 billion pre-money.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is OpenAI's second record-breaking fundraising round, following its $41 billion funding round last year, and is the largest private technology company funding round to date.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This round of funding was led by strategic investors, with Amazon investing $50 billion, and SoftBank and Nvidia each investing $30 billion.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Following this round of financing, OpenAI's cash reserves have increased to approximately $150 billion. OpenAI stated that the funds will primarily be used to expand its computing infrastructure to meet rapidly growing user demand. Amazon to Invest $50 Billion in Phases As the most generous investor in this round of financing, Amazon's committed $50 billion investment will be implemented in two phases: the first phase of $15 billion has been confirmed, and the remaining $35 billion will be available after OpenAI completes its IPO or achieves AGI. Therefore, Altman quickly stated that he is open to going public at the appropriate time. Regarding AGI, according to the previous contract between OpenAI and Microsoft, AGI refers to \"a highly autonomous system capable of surpassing humans in the most economically valuable work.\" OpenAI's charter includes a special clause: once AGI is achieved, Microsoft will lose access to its technology. But Amazon isn't just providing financial support; the two companies have also signed a comprehensive technology cooperation agreement—Amazon will exchange its own chips and cloud services for OpenAI's models and technology. The core clause of this cooperation is the purchase of computing power. OpenAI will pay AWS an additional $100 billion in computing power over the next eight years, on top of its existing $38 billion contract. A significant portion of this $100 billion will be used on Amazon's self-developed Trainium chips. OpenAI has committed to purchasing approximately 2 gigawatts of Trainium computing power, including the upcoming Trainium 3 and the Trainium 4, launching in 2027. Amazon CEO Andy Garcetti specifically mentioned that Trainium chips offer 30% to 40% better performance than comparable GPUs, and \"now both of our leading AI labs are using them.\" Another company is Anthropic, which has recently been embroiled in a dispute with the US government. OpenAI's other collaboration with Amazon is at the product level; the two companies will jointly develop a \"Stateful Runtime Environment\" to run on Amazon Bedrock. This environment allows developers to maintain context, remember previous work, and collaborate across tools when calling OpenAI models. AWS has also secured exclusive third-party distribution rights for OpenAI's enterprise platform, Frontier. There's also a more direct layer of collaboration: Amazon will use OpenAI models to optimize its consumer applications. The two companies will jointly develop custom models for use by Amazon's internal teams, covering product lines from e-commerce to smart hardware. Nvidia's $30 Billion Investment: Shareholder + Supplier The collaboration between Nvidia and OpenAI was once rumored to have fallen through, especially after Jensen Huang's statement that investing $100 billion in OpenAI was never a promise. However, the investment was ultimately finalized, albeit at a significantly lower amount than the rumored $100 billion, with only $30 billion to be paid in three installments. According to the announcement, the two companies finalized a new computing power partnership: Nvidia will provide OpenAI with 3 gigawatts of dedicated inference computing power and 2 gigawatts of training computing power for the Vera Rubin system—on top of the Hopper and Blackwell systems already running on Microsoft, Oracle Cloud, and CoreWeave. If we convert this to computing power, 1GW corresponds to $50 billion. Nvidia's support for OpenAI is worth far more than the rumored $100 billion. From this perspective, Nvidia is not only a shareholder of OpenAI and its largest chip supplier, but it's also using its own money to help OpenAI buy its own chips. Most of the $30 billion in funding will ultimately return to Nvidia in the form of purchasing computing power. In short, it's still the same \"circular financing\" narrative. SoftBank's $30 billion investment: IPO is more important than anything else. Like Nvidia, SoftBank's $30 billion investment commitment will also be disbursed in three installments. Masayoshi Son's thinking is relatively simple: OpenAI is currently the most likely candidate for an IPO in the AI ​​sector, and SoftBank needs an IPO to boost the performance of its Vision Fund. Sources say this round of financing is seen as a crucial step before OpenAI's IPO, which could begin as early as the end of this year. Compared to the other two investors, SoftBank's other role is that of a matchmaker. According to sources, OpenAI is expected to secure approximately $10 billion in primary equity financing, with commitments finalized within the next month. Investors include sovereign wealth funds and investment firms. It is speculated that these investors may have entered through SoftBank. Microsoft: No Funding This Round, But Position Remains Unchanged. In response to Amazon's entry into the market, Microsoft and OpenAI issued a joint statement today, emphasizing that their partnership remains unaffected. The statement says that Microsoft remains the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI's stateless API for its models. All API calls to OpenAI models that are stateless (without retaining context) are hosted on Azure. This is currently the most common way to call OpenAI models. Meanwhile, OpenAI's own products (including the newly released Frontier) will continue to be hosted on Azure. Frontier is OpenAI's newly launched enterprise platform, enabling enterprises to deploy their own AI agents. The intellectual property licensing and revenue-sharing arrangements between Microsoft and OpenAI remain unchanged. However, OpenAI has the right to purchase computing power from elsewhere, including large-scale infrastructure projects like Stargate. The “Recurring Financing” Narrative: A Copy-Paste Approach Looking at the investments and returns of the aforementioned investors together, as mentioned earlier, it still follows the “recurring financing” narrative: Amazon invested $50 billion in exchange for OpenAI’s model technology licensing and a $100 billion cloud service order. Nvidia invested $30 billion in exchange for OpenAI’s chip procurement commitment. SoftBank invested $30 billion, betting on an IPO exit opportunity. Microsoft didn’t invest in this round, but retained its API exclusivity; Microsoft will receive a share of every API call OpenAI sells in the future. Following this round of financing, OpenAI has an additional $110 billion in its accounts and holds the computing power resources of three tech giants. The **cost** is that it has pre-locked future technology licensing and cloud service procurement to its shareholders. Moreover, Amazon and SoftBank have made an OpenAI IPO a key condition for fulfilling their investment commitments. Now, OpenAI's shareholder list includes Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, and SoftBank—four giants with overlapping and conflicting businesses. Balancing the interests of these shareholders will be a major challenge for Sam Altman. ChatGPT has over 900 million weekly active users. Returning to the business level, OpenAI certainly needs this money right now. OpenAI already had approximately $40 billion in cash on hand, and with this round of financing, its available funds have increased to approximately $150 billion. The company expects to achieve positive free cash flow for the first time by 2030. Until then, most of the funds will be invested in data center operations, chip procurement, and cloud service expenditures. Financial data cited by the Financial Times, based on sources familiar with the matter, is telling: Revenue is projected to be approximately $13 billion in 2025, reaching $30 billion this year, with a target of over $60 billion in 2027 and over $280 billion in 2030. The growth curve is steep, but costs are increasing even faster. Regarding user data: According to official data released by OpenAI, ChatGPT currently has over 900 million weekly active users, over 50 million consumer subscribers, and over 9 million paying business users. Codex, a programming tool launched this year, has seen its weekly active users triple since the beginning of the year, reaching 1.6 million. While this data growth is impressive, competitors are not idle. Google's Gemini is making steady progress in the consumer market, while Anthropic has already taken the lead in the enterprise market. OpenAI executives stated that by the end of this year, half of their revenue will come from enterprise customers, up from the current 40%. This means that in the coming quarters, OpenAI must directly compete with Anthropic to achieve a 10% increase. Another detail worth noting is the change in the equity structure. Following this round of financing, the value of the for-profit business shares held by the OpenAI Foundation, a non-profit organization spun off from OpenAI, will rise to over $180 billion by 2025. Sources familiar with the matter say that if investor demand is strong, the foundation may sell up to $10 billion in stock for charitable expenditures and recruitment. In other words, after this round of 110 billion yuan in financing, there may still be another wave of OpenAI stocks available for purchase in the private equity secondary market.</p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Matt Crosby, Head of Research and Analysis, Bitcoin Magazine Pro; Translated by: Shaw &amp; Jinse Finance</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On-chain metrics and technical analysis alone cannot fully understand Bitcoin's price movements. External macroeconomic factors have a significant impact on Bitcoin's cyclical behavior. To understand Bitcoin, these external factors need to be combined with other key indicators to gain a comprehensive market perspective.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Monetary Policy</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Bitcoin and the S&amp;P 500 index exhibit a very strong positive correlation, meaning they typically move in tandem. When the stock market rises, Bitcoin tends to rise as well; when the stock market falls, Bitcoin typically falls as well. This correlation indicates that understanding the factors influencing the stock market is crucial for Bitcoin analysis.</strong> The Federal Reserve's balance sheet provides key information about monetary conditions. During periods of quantitative tightening, balance sheets shrink, and liquidity constraints suppress speculative desires, typically limiting Bitcoin's upside potential. Conversely, during periods of quantitative easing, balance sheets expand rapidly, and ample liquidity encourages risk-taking, which usually aligns with Bitcoin's bullish performance. Figure 1: Relationship between the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet and Bitcoin Price. Global M2 Money Supply Global broad money supply (M2) represents the total amount of money circulating globally, including cash equivalents and short-term deposits. While many analysts focus on the absolute value of the M2 supply, **examining the year-on-year growth rate of M2 provides a deeper understanding of Bitcoin price dynamics.** Year-on-year growth reflects the acceleration or deceleration of monetary expansion, rather than the absolute value of a natural upward trend over decades. Figure 2: Analyzing global M2 money supply using year-on-year growth rate to illustrate its correlation with BTC. The year-on-year growth rate of global M2 money supply almost perfectly coincides with Bitcoin's expansion and severe bear market periods. This indicator is crucial because Bitcoin is a global asset, not limited to US investors. Global monetary policy, not just the Federal Reserve's policy, is the main driver of Bitcoin's macroeconomic landscape. Institutional Fund Flows The introduction of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in recent years has fundamentally changed the dynamics of Bitcoin fund flows, making it easy for institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals to accumulate Bitcoin. **ETF cumulative fund flows can reflect institutional holdings in real time.** Large inflows into ETFs typically coincide with periods of rising Bitcoin prices, as institutions invest significant amounts. Conversely, large outflows from ETFs usually occur before or simultaneously with falling Bitcoin prices, as institutions reduce their holdings. Figure 3: Growth of Bitcoin ETFs. The Relative Strength Index (DXY) measures the relative purchasing power of the US dollar against a basket of other fiat currencies. Examining the year-over-year change in DXY provides deeper insights than the absolute value. Bitcoin is negatively correlated with DXY. A weakening DXY year-over-year suggests a favorable trend for Bitcoin. A weaker dollar makes hard assets like Bitcoin more attractive as dollar holders seek to preserve value. However, **when the DXY (US Dollar Index) strengthens year-over-year, it indicates that Bitcoin will face headwinds.** Figure 4: The inverse relationship between the US Dollar Index and Bitcoin prices. <br/></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Treasury Companies Accumulate</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Digital asset treasury reserves have rapidly incorporated Bitcoin into their corporate strategies, with the top 20 Bitcoin treasury companies currently holding approximately 1 million Bitcoins. More than 100 publicly listed treasury companies globally are actively adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This represents a significant reduction in the supply of Bitcoin, as held Bitcoin typically remains illiquid for extended periods rather than being frequently traded.</p> Figure 5: Bitcoin Treasury Tracker shows the BTC accumulation of the top 10 listed treasury companies. From a purely supply and demand economics perspective, these institutions removing 1 million Bitcoins from the liquid supply is equivalent to building structural support. Any asset that can attract hundreds of billions of dollars in inflows represents genuine confidence and optimistic market sentiment. Conclusion A true understanding of Bitcoin requires combining on-chain metrics, technical analysis, and macroeconomic factors. The maturation of Bitcoin necessitates a complex, multi-faceted analysis.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div>On February 26, 2026, Block, Inc. notified its global employees that more than 4,000 employees had been laid off or entered a consultation period, reducing the company's total global workforce from 2025. The number of employees plummeted from 10,205 at the end of the year to less than 6,000, representing a layoff rate of nearly 40% to 50%. This is one of the largest single institutional layoffs in the technology and fintech sector since 2026, and several mainstream media outlets such as Reuters, CNBC, and Bloomberg have called it a landmark event driving layoffs through AI. <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span mpa-font-=\"\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Layoff Decision Amid Strong Financial Report</span></span></span></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span mpa-font-=\"\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span leaf=\"\">Block</span></span><span leaf=\"\">This is not a troubled company.</span></span></p><span leaf=\"\">Block is not a troubled company.</span><span leaf=\"\"> This company, formerly known as Square, was led by Jack Dorsey and its business covered merchant payments, mobile finance, and installment payments, including Cash App and Afterpay. In the fintech sector, it is not on the verge of recession; on the contrary, it has just delivered a solid growth report. In the fourth quarter of 2025, Block's gross profit reached $2.87 billion, a year-on-year increase of 24%. Cash App's gross profit was $1.83 billion, a year-on-year increase of 33%; Square's gross profit was $993 million, a year-on-year increase of 7%. Adjusted operating income was $588 million, with a profit margin of 20% and earnings per share of $0.65. The full-year figures were also impressive. Gross profit totaled $10.36 billion in 2025, representing a 17% year-over-year increase. Guidance for 2026 has been further revised upwards, with gross profit projected at $12.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share increasing by 54%. Looking only at the financial statements, it's hard to imagine this company laying off employees at this time. Layoffs Lead to Stock Price Surge: Why Did the Market Buy It? In the past, layoffs often meant declining demand or operational pressure, but Block's market reaction was completely the opposite. As news of layoffs and financial reports were released simultaneously, the company's stock price surged by over 23% in after-hours trading, reaching a high of nearly $69, increasing its market capitalization by approximately $70 billion to $80 billion in a single day. The following day, in pre-market trading, the increase remained around 20%. The capital market's judgment is quite direct. In the past, the company's growth relied on personnel expansion. Increased revenue was often accompanied by rising costs, resulting in slow profit margin improvements. Now, investors are beginning to believe that a different model is emerging. If 6,000 employees, combined with intelligent systems, can achieve the output of 10,000 or even more people in the past, then business growth will no longer follow the old path of linear increases in labor and costs. </span><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span mpa-font-=\"\"><span leaf=\"\"><img alt=\"NsVohBibBC52aWXfqFwF24Gu3ZaT7m8HK0RyhwTx.jpeg\"

Meta Platforms or Google, which indirectly adjust their workforce size through slowing hiring, natural attrition, or structural optimization, Block opted to cut nearly half of its employees in one go. While similar signals have emerged in the industry—for example, IBM and SAP have publicly mentioned the efficiency restructuring brought about by AI—the magnitude of these developments is far less aggressive than that of Block. It is becoming increasingly clear which jobs are most easily replaced. Routine data analysis, report generation, basic coding, customer service Q&amp;A, and initial risk screening are all efficiently covered by automated models. What remains relatively irreplaceable are high-level strategic judgment, complex negotiations, ethical decision-making, original creativity, and genuine interpersonal leadership skills. Consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company predicts that by 2030, AI may automate nearly 45% of global work, while Gartner... The author leans more towards the \"enhancement\" theory, believing that AI will reshape jobs rather than simply eliminate them. The author clearly stands on the more radical side. However, dissenting voices also exist. Some analysts point out that this action also carries the characteristics of \"COVID-19 over-hiring adjustments\": the company's headcount surged from 3,900 in 2019 to 12,500 in 2022, with a significant increase in the proportion of international employees, which had previously begun to shrink slightly. Some employees anonymously reported that \"AI is an excuse, and performance pressure has long existed.\" AI as a Core Variable in Organizational Restructuring Technological revolutions have never merely changed tools, but rather the way organizations are organized. The Industrial Revolution eliminated artisans but gave rise to modern manufacturing; the internet diminished traditional media jobs while simultaneously creating the digital economy. Every leap in efficiency is accompanied by structural growing pains. This round of layoffs may signify that AI is beginning to truly enter the core of enterprise organizations, rather than just being a functional upgrade at the product level. The question is no longer whether AI will change the company, but rather the speed at which that change occurs. On February 26, 2026, what the fintech industry saw was not just a company's layoff announcement, but the nascent form of a new company model. According to a Challenger report, over 55,000 layoffs directly related to AI occurred in 2025. This trend accelerated into 2026. The technology industry is bearing the brunt. Highly digitized sectors such as fintech, software, and e-commerce are more likely to be restructured. Laying off ordinary jobs and hiring AI engineers and model training experts has become the new hiring logic. A \"talent war\" for AI is brewing. A deeper impact lies on the demand side. If automation leads to job losses and decreased consumer spending, business growth may conversely be suppressed. Some social media comments have raised this cyclical question: when companies increase profits through AI, but weaken customer revenue streams, how long can this growth be sustained? The tension between efficiency and employment is becoming a new macroeconomic variable. The divergent reactions of the capital market and public sentiment are evident. Investors and analysts are generally positive. Forbes called it a watershed moment in the AI ​​era, while Seeking Alpha argued that the company's aggressive actions would significantly increase operating leverage. Management emphasized that this was positioned for long-term growth. Public discussion, however, was more complex. Some believe that AI can free humans from repetitive labor, allowing them to focus more on creation and judgment; others worry that if automation outpaces re-employment, it could create a cycle of job contraction and declining demand. A relatively neutral viewpoint points out that technology often creates new jobs, but only if society invests in a sufficiently large-scale reskilling training system. Dorsey's assessment is straightforward: most companies will follow suit within a year. He even feels he's moving too slowly. If this assessment holds true, it means the tech industry will shift from a logic of scale expansion to a logic of intelligent leverage. The size of a company is no longer determined by the number of employees, but by the density of intelligent systems. Over the past year, the capabilities of generative AI and automation tools have seen near-exponential growth. Model update frequency has decreased, costs have fallen, and inference capabilities have improved. Tasks that previously required ten people to complete, such as report analysis, marketing material creation, or customer service triage, may now require only one person and one system. Rising stock prices have reinforced this expectation—the market rewards not only cost reductions, but also new production functions. Meanwhile, public sentiment remained somber. Some comments bluntly stated, \"Profitable companies cut 40% of their workforce,\" while others sarcastically remarked, \"The market treats humanity as a liability.\" Some departing employees described the process as \"decent but burdensome,\" noting that while compensation was acknowledged, the reality of unemployment remained severe. Policy discussions are rapidly approaching a practical level. In Europe, the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) came into effect in 2024, covering high-risk employment-related AI systems such as recruitment, performance evaluation, and task assignment. These systems are expected to be fully implemented around 2026. The EU has also passed the Digital Europe Programme and... The InvestAI plan invests hundreds of billions of euros in retraining, skills subsidies, and the development of a lifelong learning system in an attempt to mitigate the impact of AI transformation on the employment structure. In the United States, the job displacement caused by AI has gradually become a public issue. Businesses and policymakers are increasing their investment in retraining, and technology companies are launching AI skills training programs for workers. At the same time, universal basic income (UBI) has re-entered mainstream discussion, with figures such as Elon Musk and Andrew Yang arguing for the need for new social safety net mechanisms to avoid the structural risk that automation could increase efficiency while weakening consumer spending. The layoffs at Block have transcended personnel adjustments within a single company; they are more like a public signal: AI is no longer just an auxiliary tool, but is becoming a core variable determining organizational structure. The way we measure company size is changing—from expanding headcount to increasing intelligence density. This transformation means higher productivity and profit potential, but it inevitably comes with structural growing pains. Transparent communication and relatively generous compensation can buffer the impact, but they cannot mitigate the sharpness of this era's turning point itself. 2026 may be seen as a turning point—when companies begin to systematically rebuild themselves around AI, the labor market must also be restructured in tandem. The question has changed. It's no longer whether AI will change employment, but how human society can find a new balance between growth and stability amidst the leap in efficiency. </p></div></div>",

OpenAI's funding includes $30 billion from SoftBank, $30 billion from Nvidia (NVDA.O), and $50 billion from Amazon. OpenAI and Amazon (AMZN.O) will develop custom models. OpenAI will utilize 2 gigawatts of Trainium chip computing power through Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. SoftBank's cumulative investment in OpenAI is estimated at $64.6 billion, giving it approximately a 13% stake in OpenAI after the transaction.</p> Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published an article on the X platform outlining Ethereum's scaling plan, covering short-term Gas optimization and long-term phased deployment of ZK-EVM. In the short term, the Glamsterdam upgrade will introduce a block-level access list for parallel verification, ePBS will allow for a larger proportion of time slots to be used for block verification, and Gas repricing will ensure that operational costs are aligned with actual execution time. A multi-dimensional Gas mechanism will be implemented in phases. First, in Glamsterdam, the cost of \"state creation\" will be separated from the cost of \"execution and calldata,\" with state creation Gas not included in the approximately 16 million transaction Gas cap. At the EVM level, a \"reservoir\" dimension mechanism will be introduced, prioritizing the consumption of dedicated dimension Gas by default, and consuming from the reservoir when insufficient. Later, a multi-dimensional pricing mechanism will be implemented, with different dimensions having different floating Gas prices. Long-term scaling includes two parts: ZK-EVM and blob. Regarding blob, the plan is to continuously iterate PeerDAS, aiming to achieve a data processing capacity of approximately 8MB per second. In the future, Ethereum block data will directly enter the blob. ZK-EVM will be implemented in phases: in 2026, validator clients supporting ZK-EVM will be available, allowing approximately 5% of the network to rely on it; in 2027, this will expand to a larger proportion of a minority of nodes, while simultaneously advancing formal verification; once conditions are ripe, it will transition to a three-out-of-five mandatory proof mechanism, ultimately continuously improving the security and formal verification level of ZK-EVM, and involving VM changes such as RISC-V. As of press time, according to CoinGecko data: BTC price is $65,865.85, a 24-hour change of -2.5%; ETH price is $1,930.04, a 24-hour change of -5.0%; BNB price is $614.11, a 24-hour change of -2.0%.

Policy: ▌SEC Chairman Paul Atkins: Missed Crypto Opportunities During Gensler's Tenure, Accelerating the Reshaping of the Regulatory Framework. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins stated that the SEC is attempting to regain momentum in crypto regulation and make up for previous \"significant misses.\" At a University of Texas event, he criticized the SEC for failing to adapt to innovation during Gary Gensler's tenure. Atkins pointed out that since the Donald Trump administration took office, the SEC's stance has become more industry-friendly, establishing a crypto task force, dropping several enforcement cases, and launching \"Project Crypto\" to modernize regulatory rules. He emphasized that while the price of individual cryptocurrencies may fluctuate, he is more optimistic about the potential of distributed ledger technology in payment clearing and settlement systems. This week, the SEC approved WisdomTree's digital currency market fund to enable 24/7 trading and instant settlement. Atkins also stated that tokenized bank deposit products will be launched in the future. <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>▌Coinbase Litigation Head: Some US States \"Mislead\" the Public on Prediction Markets</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Coinbase's Vice President of Legal Affairs and Head of Global Litigation, Ryan VanGrack, stated that some US state governments have \"misled\" the public on prediction markets, attempting to rewrite the scope of Congress's authorization for derivatives regulation.</p> Previously, after launching a prediction market in partnership with Kalshi, Coinbase had filed lawsuits in Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, and Nevada. Some state regulators issued stop-loss orders or public warnings, stating that sports event contracts constitute illegal gambling. VanGrack stated that these actions pose a \"real and imminent\" risk to customers, forcing the company to seek clarification on regulatory jurisdiction in federal court. Senator Warren and OCC Chief Discuss WLFI-Related Crypto Bank Application Senator Warren called the application \"the most despicable\" presidential corruption scandal, pointing to investment institutions related to UAE National Security Advisor Sheikh Tahnoonbin Zayed Al Nahyan investing $500 million in WLFI four days before Trump's inauguration, acquiring a 49% stake, of which approximately $187 million went to Trump family entities. Warren urged Gould to reject or suspend the review of the application, stating that approval would make it \"an accomplice to corruption.\" Gould refused to intervene, stating that he would process the application according to standard procedures, and countered that the only political pressure he felt came from Warren. Forty-one House Democrats had previously written to the Treasury Secretary, warning that approving the license could threaten \"the legitimacy of the U.S. banking system and its independence from foreign actors.\" <hr/><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Blockchain Applications</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>▌Barclays is evaluating the construction of a blockchain platform to process payments and deposits</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Barclays has sent requests for information to some potential technology vendors to evaluate how to build a blockchain platform to process banking services such as payments. Its applications may include stablecoins and tokenized deposits, with the goal of finalizing vendor selection as early as April. The application of stablecoins in the payment field is expanding; Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that annual stablecoin payment transaction volume could exceed $50 trillion by 2030. Meta has also previously tested integrating stablecoin payments into its applications.</p> Several banks have already begun deploying blockchain systems. JPMorgan previously launched JPM Coin, a deposit token for institutional clients, for payments. HSBC plans to expand its tokenized deposit service to corporate clients in the US and UAE in the first half of this year. OpenAI Executive: ChatGPT Daily Active Users Exceed 900 Million, Paid Subscribers Reach 50 Million. OpenAI executive Nick Turley stated that ChatGPT's daily active users have exceeded 900 million, and paid subscribers have reached 50 million. Cryptocurrency ▌JPMorgan Chase: Market to Boost if Crypto Market Structure Bill Passes JPMorgan Chase states that even with current market sentiment remaining weak, the crypto market could see a significant boost in the second half of the year if the US legislature passes a comprehensive crypto market structure bill before mid-year. In a research report, the bank noted, \"If the bill passes, it will reshape the market structure by clarifying regulatory rules, ending 'enforcement instead of regulation,' promoting asset tokenization, and encouraging greater institutional participation.\" ▌Tether's Secondary Market Valuation Could Reach $375 Billion, Largest Shareholder's Wealth Could Surpass Buffett According to Forbes, stablecoin issuer Tether's valuation could reach $375 billion, placing its owners among the world's richest people. Industry sources say Tether's trading price on the secondary market ranges from $350 billion to $375 billion. Based on conversations with cryptocurrency investors and executives, Forbes currently values ​​Tether at approximately $200 billion, still significantly higher than the $50 billion valuation a year ago. At a $200 billion valuation, CFO Giancarlo Devasini, holding approximately 44-45% of the shares, would have a net worth of approximately $89 billion; CEO Paolo Ardoino and former CEO Jean-Louis van der Velde, each holding approximately 19%, would have a combined net worth of approximately $38 billion; and General Counsel Stuart Hoegner, holding approximately 12%, would have a net worth of nearly $25 billion. If we use the lower end of the secondary market valuation of $350 billion, Devasini's stake would be worth over $156 billion, enough to place him among the world's top ten richest people, surpassing Warren Buffett's current net worth of $147.8 billion. Former Mt. Gox CEO Proposes Bitcoin Hard Fork to Recover $5.2 Billion in Stolen Assets Mark Karpelès, former CEO of the defunct exchange Mt. Gox, recently proposed a Bitcoin hard fork to recover approximately 79,956 BTC stolen in the 2011 hack, worth about $5.2 billion at current prices. The proposal targets a wallet address associated with the 2011 Mt. Gox system breach, which received nearly 80,000 Bitcoins after the attack and has remained untouched for over 15 years. Under current Bitcoin rules, these funds can only be transferred if the corresponding private key is held. According to the proposal, the new rules would allow the unspent outputs in an Mt. Gox recovery address to be controlled via signatures, thereby bringing the funds into the existing judicial oversight and compensation process to repay Mt. Gox creditors. Karpelès stated that this proposal is only a starting point for discussion, intending to limit the rule change to a single address and activate it at a specific block height in the future. However, the proposal also acknowledges that this plan requires a coordinated upgrade across the entire network, and if some community members refuse to support it, it could lead to a blockchain split risk. It should be noted that these approximately 80,000 BTC are not currently part of the assets allocated to Mt. Gox creditors, nor are they controlled by the bankruptcy trustee. According to market news, Block, Inc., the payment company owned by Jack Dorsey, just disclosed that it added 340 BTC to its holdings in the fourth quarter of 2025, worth $22 million. Liquid Capital (formerly LD Capital) founder Yi Lihua responded to rumors of a \"Jane Street sell-off\" on social media, stating that he is currently waiting for confirmation of the bottom before buying. He clarified that he is not engaging in conspiracy theories; the trend is downward, and he is currently waiting for confirmation of the bottom before buying. Amundi purchased 3.77 million shares of MSTR, bringing its total holdings to $641 million. According to market news, Amundi, a French asset management company with $2.8 trillion in assets under management, disclosed that it purchased 3.77 million shares of MSTR, bringing its total holdings to 4.79 million shares, worth $641 million. This represents a 373% increase in its MSTR holdings. **▌Bitcoin Mining Company Mara Holdings Increases Holdings by 572 Bitcoins** According to market news, publicly traded Bitcoin mining company Mara Holdings (stock code $MARA) has increased its holdings by 572 Bitcoins, bringing its total holdings to 53,822. **▌US 2-Year Treasury Yield Falls to Lowest Level Since 2022** The yield on the US 2-year Treasury note has fallen to its lowest level since 2022. **▌Trump: Fed Chair Powell Will Soon Leave the Fed** US President Trump stated that Federal Reserve Chair Powell will soon leave the Federal Reserve. <hr/><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Golden Encyclopedia</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>▌What is the value of BTC?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">BTC is often compared to \"digital gold,\" but its core value is actually the \"promise of immutable scarcity.\" First, BTC has monetary properties, but it is not a currency because it lacks a stable unit of account. It is a pure \"monetary property,\" that is, a consensus game among humans regarding \"what can serve as a store of value.\" Gold also has this core value, but gold's scarcity depends on the physical constraints of geology, while BTC's scarcity depends on mathematics and game theory—it's a scarcity at the information level.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But what makes BTC truly unique is not the coin itself, nor the \"digital gold\" narrative, but rather that blockchain is the first permissionless, unclosable value settlement layer in human history. This is a completely new category of infrastructure. No sovereign entity can unilaterally prevent the final settlement of a BTC transaction.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> This attribute may be underestimated in peacetime, but it will be repriced during periods of geopolitical conflict and escalating capital controls. BTC is a systemic hedge. It doesn't hedge against inflation, nor does it hedge against the US dollar. It hedges against the structural degradation of institutional trust. In other words, BTC's value is not endogenous, but reflexive: the more people believe it has value, the more valuable it becomes, and vice versa. Therefore, BTC is the financialized expression of humanity's distrust of its own institutional capabilities. Its ceiling depends on the depth and breadth of this distrust, and its floor depends on the existence of a superior alternative.</p></div></div>",
