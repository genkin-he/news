            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Jake, Messari Analyst; Translation: xz@Jinse Finance</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">After the hype surrounding the release of the Ethereum Foundation's Kohaku wallet SDK subsided, I conducted some research and reflection on RAIL, which I summarize as follows:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>(1) In the past two weeks, RAIL has been fluctuating within a channel between $2.00 and $3.20.</strong> I currently hold a large position in RAIL, with an average cost of approximately $1.50. If the price breaks below the support level, I will start adding to my position. If you haven't entered the market yet, the price level near the lower edge of the channel is quite attractive.</p> ... <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Pda1RNdacXjNX9s0kapr4oWG89ujJubRkug1QLAe.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410359_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410359\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>（2）The core logic remains unchanged; only the market has changed</strong>. After the liquidation event on October 10, RAIL plummeted from approximately $5.00 to $2.20. Since then, its price movement has consistently been highly synchronized with the sideways trading pattern of BTC. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"VFBu2V84o6Wj8jANtYh5BFp0PFECVCBCTTnH38Ky.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410360_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410360\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>（3）According to the quick calculation model of AJC, Corporate Research Manager at Messari</strong>: If 1% of ETH and stablecoins on Ethereum flow through the RAILGUN privacy collection, it will generate approximately $82.4 million in annualized revenue. This calculation is based on a 1.25% revenue capture rate (historical annualized capture rate is 4-10% of TVL) and a 1.0% potential market penetration rate (current market size is $450-500 billion in ETH and approximately $175 billion in stablecoins). At $2.30, its fully diluted valuation (FDV) is $132 million, meaning that in the baseline scenario, annual revenue is equivalent to 62% of its total FDV. Even under pessimistic assumptions (0.1% market penetration + 1.25% revenue capture), it still generates $8.2 million in annual revenue, representing 6.2% of its total FDV (while in a bull market scenario, 10% market penetration would generate $823 million in annualized revenue, equivalent to 624% of FDV). Furthermore, this is only one dimension for evaluating RAIL. Compared to similar valuations (Zcash − FDV $6.46 billion / Monero − FDV $5.95 billion), RAIL's current FDV is less than 3% of its competitors (considering Railgun's quantifiable cash flow potential, a reasonable valuation should be closer to 10-15% of its competitors). Not to mention, ZEC's continued strong performance will further boost the bullish logic for RAIL in the privacy sector. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"eYB6bZlHZpiV8ieefJ2BnQbaxa8LGpa0oTpMh5ik.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410361_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410361\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>（4）Potential Catalyst: Continued Growth in Usage</strong>. Railgun processed $1.6 billion in privacy transactions this year, slightly less than half of the protocol's total transaction volume since 2021 ($4 billion). </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Railgun plans to demonstrate its wallet technology at the Devconnect conference in Argentina in two weeks.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Railgun plans to demonstrate its wallet technology at the Devconnect conference in Argentina in two weeks.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> The Ethereum ecosystem continues to increase its investment in privacy, especially Railgun… The Ethereum Foundation continues to increase its investment in institutional-grade solutions, especially institutional-grade privacy solutions like Railgun… (5) With the occurrence of market liquidation events, the window for short-term trading of RAIL has closed, but the window for long-term investment (with at least 3-5 times potential) is fully open. Summary: Hold RAIL firmly.</p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Arnav Pagidyala, Source: Bankless, Translated by: Shaw Jinse Finance</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On-chain lending has become a pillar of decentralized finance (DeFi). However, despite its rapid development, its underlying architecture has remained virtually unchanged since Compound v2. Over 99% of DeFi still operates in some form of over-collateralized, floating-rate model pioneered a few years ago.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For the world to truly operate on-chain, lending must mature far beyond its current form.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">What began as a simple stablecoin lending mechanism is now evolving into a complete financial system. This article aims to highlight the latest breakthroughs in protocol design, credit architecture, and regulation that are driving on-chain lending to become the foundational layer of a programmable global economy.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> 1. DeFi as a New Financial Operating System Over the past cycle, DeFi has quietly evolved from a series of isolated applications into a **composable global financial operating system**. In 2018, protocols such as Aave, Compound, and Uniswap operated as independent applications, each with its own liquidity, governance mechanisms, and user base. By 2025, they had evolved into a \"financial kernel\": a programmable environment where liquidity, risk, and execution are abstracted into modular layers that other developers can combine, extend, or build into new financial systems. In traditional software, an operating system provides three functions: shared memory, standardized interfaces, and permissionless scalability. The same model is now appearing in the DeFi space. These new \"operating system protocols\" manage the shared state of funds, rather than the shared state of files. Liquidity acts as the memory layer, the interest rate curve and Automated Market Makers (AMMs) act as system calls, while oracles, treasuries, and governance mechanisms constitute the layer for coordinated execution. Several mainstream protocols already embody this design philosophy: Aave v4 is evolving into a hub-and-spoke liquidity operating system. At its core is a controlled kernel called the \"Liquidity Hub,\" surrounded by modular markets for RWAs, GHOs, and permissioned pools. Liquidity only needs to be provided once and can be deployed to all branches under controlled risk parameters, achieving unified capital efficiency rather than fragmented liquidity pools. This marks a significant step forward for Aave v4 from the isolated market architecture of Aave v3 to a fully shared liquidity layer. Morpho v1 and Euler v2 take a completely different approach: they employ a minimalist credit core, sharing only logic and not liquidity. Each vault is an independent micromarket, but all inherit the same underlying architecture—a unified accounting and clearing engine. Morpho v2 extends this by replacing static vaults with an intent-based Request for Quotation (RFQ) matching layer, allowing fixed-rate and floating-rate loans to coexist in a unified credit market. Fluid represents the most vertically integrated version, a unified liquidity operating system where lending, trading, and collateral all originate from a shared pool of funds. It is the first system to treat every dollar of idle capital, collateral, and borrowed funds as an interconnected resource. These architectures collectively mark the next stage in the development of DeFi. The era of isolated money markets is giving way to more interoperable financial systems that function more like operating environments than applications. Liquidity, risk, and governance are becoming shared infrastructure, not product features. Whether through modular hubs, minimalist kernels, or vertically integrated engines, the ultimate goal is the same: to build an open, programmable, and globally composable financial system. 2. Order Book-Based Lending Most DeFi lending still relies on the pool model, where all liquidity providers share risk and reward. This model offers simplicity and shared liquidity, but at the cost of insufficient precision. Furthermore, interest rates are not determined through negotiation but generated by algorithms or decentralized autonomous systems (DAOs), a stark contrast to the refined interest rates offered by traditional finance (TradFi). The next breakthrough in lending microstructure is the order book-based lending model, where lenders and borrowers post specific quotes, similar to a centrally limited order book (CLOB) in traditional finance. This structure allows for granular control over terms: fixed or floating interest rates, maturity dates, collateral requirements, and even custom risk parameters. Hybrid models are also emerging, combining pooling liquidity for increased depth with order book mechanisms for price discovery. Just as AMMs evolved into models with centralized liquidity, lending markets may also tend towards this more expressive design. However, the key difference is that lending markets are built for passive lenders, so the experience is largely the same for ordinary borrowers, but borrowers will have more choices. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"3kVrJDsZ9IRJ4j3gbq7q1K70ZsitwHF3IV55mPgE.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410340_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410340\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Order books can be used for both floating-rate and fixed-rate loans, but their basic mechanism is similar: lenders publish quotes, borrowers accept quotes, and the matching results generate credit positions on-chain. Most of the funding in these systems comes from passive lenders, typically deployed through custodians or vault managers who aggregate liquidity and manage parameters on behalf of passive lenders. Avon is pioneering a hybrid architecture that combines a centrally controlled order book with custom strategies (independent markets), allowing compatible orders to be atomically cleared while still meeting the needs of passive lenders.</p><br/><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">3. The Era of Convenience</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As mentioned above, the underlying lending protocol will be completely abstracted by a series of consumer-facing products. Examples include revolving lending, automated risk management, yield abstraction, and consumer agency.</p><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Revolving strategies</strong> are being abstracted into seamless, one-click operation products. Platforms like Contango and Loopscale have already automated the process, while lending marketplaces like Jupiter, Euler, and Silo are beginning to integrate these mechanisms directly into their front-end interfaces.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Yield Abstraction</strong>: For end users, lending will be simplified to a single \"net return\" figure. The underlying strategies will gradually fade from view, just as banks hide the operation of overnight repurchase agreements behind current account interest rates.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Yield Abstraction</strong> With direct integration between exchanges like Coinbase and protocols like Morpho, yield will become a basic user experience feature, rather than a complex financial operation. Consumer Agents: Smart agents will dynamically manage collateral ratios, refinance, and liquidation protection on behalf of users. These systems will rebalance positions across protocols in real time, optimize borrowing costs, and hedge volatility in real time, transforming active portfolio management into a back-office process. 4. Ratings, Benchmarking, and Compliance DeFi can only reach trillions of dollars if using it doesn't jeopardize the CFO's job. Any financial market needs standards, and the lending market is no exception. Credit ratings, transparent benchmarks, and compliance frameworks constitute the trust infrastructure that connects code-based markets with real-world capital. Ratings: Just as Moody's or S&amp;P assess corporate and sovereign credit, independent risk rating agencies will emerge to evaluate DeFi vaults, protocols, and on-chain credit portfolios. These ratings will quantify smart contract risk, collateral quality, counterparty risk exposure, and historical performance, allowing institutional risk frameworks to be clearly mapped to the underlying DeFi technology. While I believe S&amp;P and Moody's will likely remain dominant in this space, emerging agencies like Web3SOC and Credora are also appearing. Benchmarking: Standardized indices, such as \"DeFi LIBOR\" or \"on-chain SOFR,\" will enable borrowers, lenders, and vaults to price risk and compare yields across different protocols. This will lay the foundation for native on-chain building of derivatives, yield curves, and structured credit markets. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Compliance</strong>: With the addition of institutions, embedded KYC/AML will become a basic requirement. Protocols will increasingly divide liquidity into permissionless and compliant tiers, enabling regulated entities to access DeFi tracks while maintaining open access for all other users. For example, Morpho v2 vaults support customizable access controls designed to meet institutional compliance requirements. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">These elements together constitute the institutional interface for on-chain lending.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">5. Beyond Overcollateralization</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The current market is dominated by crypto asset overcollateralization and floating-rate lending, which, while practical, is essentially a narrow niche market. The future development of on-chain lending will go far beyond this model, unlocking the complete credit system that underpins traditional finance.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Fixed-Rate Loans: Predictable payments, clear maturity dates, and structured instruments are prerequisites for institutional adoption. Protocols like Morpho v2 are pioneering intent-based fixed-rate markets, while emerging designs like Term and Tenor are exploring auction-driven and order book mechanisms to price term risk directly on-chain. In effect, Morpho v2 may serve both ends of the market: a highly liquid, order book-based market on one end, and a highly customizable over-the-counter (OTC) market on the other, with custodians allocating liquidity vaults and lending divisions managing more targeted credit risk exposures. Low-Collateralized Loans: Protocols like 3Jane and Wildcat are pioneering frameworks for trust-minimized, low-collateralized lending, combining the guarantees enforced by smart contracts with real-world underwriting and trusteeship reputation. Alternative Credit Markets: Lending is also expanding into the long tail and non-traditional collateral areas, such as tokenized RWAs, alternative FX pairs, stablecoin arbitrage trading, and even credit lines guaranteed by credit. These markets introduce new dimensions of risk, including diversification, cross-border liquidity, and reflection of the complexities of global finance. The explosive growth of Midas is a prime example, highlighting the dynamics of two-way demand: traditional finance seeks to enhance on-chain liquidity through cyclical mechanisms, while crypto-native investors seek high-yield exposure to uncorrelated traditional financial instruments. These cutting-edge areas collectively signify DeFi's evolution from a collateral-constrained niche into a comprehensive, programmable credit system capable of collateralizing a wide range of financial products, from consumer loans to sovereign debt, with all transactions settled directly on-chain. Finally, when discussing the future of DeFi lending, I must mention the rise of custodians like Gauntlet, Re7, Steakhouse, and MEV Capital. These institutions actively manage liquidity, optimize returns, and adjust protocol parameters. They are evolving into on-chain versions of Millennium or Citadel, deploying quantitative strategies, risk models, and dynamic liquidity management across multiple protocols. In the past few years, custodians have earned modest performance fees and often subsidize users with incentives to attract deposits. But this is not a quick fix. They understand that custody itself will be one of the most scalable and profitable businesses of the next decade. Attracting deposits is merely a means of user acquisition; the ultimate goal is data distribution. As these companies grow in size and reputation, it's easy to imagine them becoming on-chain asset management firms managing over $10 billion in assets and holding a significant position across all major protocols. The competition for deposits will only intensify. There are many hedge funds, but only one Millennium, and every project manager in the DeFi space is vying to become its on-chain successor. Conclusion DeFi lending is no longer a collateral-based leverage experiment; it is evolving into the architecture of a programmable financial system. From order book-based credit markets and one-click revolving products to institutional-grade ratings and low-collateral frameworks, each layer of architecture is being rebuilt for scale, precision, and accessibility. Once lending truly becomes programmable, finance will no longer be confined to institutions but will exist within the network.</p></li></ul></div></div>",

            "title": "Current Status of the X402 Track",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Haotian; Source: X, @tmel0211</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Let's talk about the current situation of the x402 track and give a brief commentary, for reference only</strong>:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>1) The phrase \"change of leadership\" should actually be in quotation marks, but looking back, it's \"leading player\" that should be in quotation marks.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">PING attracted a lot of attention and made the track popular, but it failed to show its kingly dominance. It's all about timing and fate. It's not even close to the GOAT of the past. Who can blame them when the liquidity is dry?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">PAYAI's name, Pay, played a big role. Facilitator did play a significant role in the technical architecture of x402, but the overall technical threshold of the x402 track is not high, so most people are still rushing in with the mentality of speculating on MEME.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Therefore, regarding the current track, I tend to think that it's too early to talk about the \"top two\" players, at least it's not stable yet, but fortunately the track's popularity hasn't waned, waiting for the next turning point; 2) Many people complain that CEXs aren't supporting the x402 track. Yes, I'd also like to know why. But the fact is, the resurgence of on-chain innovation has gone from providing valuable assets for exchanges to the awkward situation of stealing CEXs' attention. This is the fundamental motivation for me to keep advocating for on-chain innovation; once on-chain innovation is passive, more innovation will be stifled. However, we can also see the clues of exchanges' strategies. I wrote a suggestion to Star Xu, and he should have taken it to heart by looking at XLayer's recent actions. In addition, OKX's listing of Virtuals also expresses its attitude; they need to find certainty amidst the chaos. Therefore, it is expected that many more \"regulars\" in the x402 track will receive offers from OKX. Interestingly, Bybit reacted particularly quickly, quietly launching PAYAI's Alpha when PING was trending, and Mantle is also making a series of moves related to the x402 track. This shows that CEXs are not completely indifferent; the rise of the x402 track is an opportunity for them to break the unfair competition among their peers, and a key juncture for them to pull the industry back from the hype and infighting surrounding MEME to the main theme of technology. Caution indicates they are taking it seriously, which can be seen as a positive sign; 3) Many pessimists compare the x402 track to the early days of inscription and the later AI Agent craze, believing that the hype is only temporary and will eventually end in chaos. I acknowledge the existence of a bubble, and that most projects will inevitably fail, but I am optimistic about its long-term intrinsic value. I've analyzed the reasons for this in previous articles. In short, Inscription is an asset issuance game where inscriptions are merely decorative carvings on gold. x402's current focus is on AI Pay infrastructure services; Launchpad's numerous appearances haven't truly taken off yet, and it's not purely based on operational logic. As for the AI ​​Agent craze, I believe the x402 sector's current popularity is a continuation of the previous AI Agent wave, evolving from meaningless scenarios where AI Agents only chatted to AI Agents participating in payments. This transformation is significant and difficult to disprove. That's all. In short, don't be discouraged. To sum it up in one sentence: The x402 track currently lacks a true main driving force, and many Dev teams are likely preparing new innovative products, gameplay, and mechanics... CEX teams are also quietly preparing their strategies... Be patient, maintain your confidence, and let the dust settle.</p></div></div>",

Market access and information access have never been so convenient. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"qUnp1lsQ7a41ZbDuR7tE7olMILmh8hQqgz8bMiNl.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410297_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410297\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: JPMorgan Chase</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>However, despite improvements in market and information access, sufficient infrastructure has not been provided to effectively analyze and utilize data. The complex market environment and higher volatility have increased the burden on retail investors.</strong> Investors must monitor massive amounts of data from multiple services to invest in various assets, including national stock markets and cryptocurrencies. Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange plan to emulate the cryptocurrency market model and establish 24-hour trading systems. The investment environment will undergo more dramatic changes. Retail investors lack sufficient infrastructure to cope with this complexity. Since investing is not their primary profession, they lack the time and resources to systematically analyze massive amounts of data. Complex financial data places a huge cognitive burden on understanding and utilizing it. Many retail investors, while having access to a wealth of information, fail to use it effectively and in a timely manner. They rely on social media, fragmented news, apps, or homemade spreadsheets to make investment decisions. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"WQtWYR4JvDKIV4gLll8ckkak4i5pW1mFCOfxfbZK.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410298_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410298\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Bloomberg Terminal</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Institutional investors typically use professional systems like the Bloomberg Terminal to manage this complexity. Ultra-high-net-worth individuals access personalized portfolio management and customized investment strategies through private bankers. The Bloomberg Terminal costs tens of thousands of dollars annually and requires professional training. Private banking services require a minimum of several billion Korean won in assets.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Most retail investors cannot access these professional tools.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> However, retail investors face the same market environment as institutional investors. Increased market participation forces retail investors to make quick and accurate decisions in complex and volatile markets. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have opened up new possibilities for bridging this information gap. Today, services can analyze massive amounts of data in real time, like the Bloomberg Terminal, while also providing personalized investment insights to retail investors like private bankers. Edgen is a leading example of this possibility. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Edgen: An AI-powered Bloomberg Terminal for All Investors</h2><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"1SxFyIBEWZlFCjQhBb9qdknJgqE8ognnhKTlBL7Y.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410299_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410299\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Edgen is an AI-driven financial intelligence platform designed to be \"an AI-powered Bloomberg terminal for everyone.\" The platform enables retail investors to seamlessly monitor and analyze the stock and cryptocurrency markets from a single interface.</p> ... <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"l1XAEBX5keGrTt9Y6FpEeWfAqy1HdvsQf1VyBCiB.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410300_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410300\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Tiger Research</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Edgen's capabilities go far beyond simple data aggregation. The platform transforms fragmented data into actionable insights. Traditional financial information platforms provide raw data such as news, charts, and financial statements, while Edgen analyzes this data and delivers investment insights in multiple formats: conversational answers, visual charts, comprehensive reports, and quantitative scores tailored to each investor.</p> Edgen goes a step further, building personalized analytics tailored to each investor's investment style and goals. The platform presents optimized, personalized insights, rather than showing the same data to all users. This approach is similar to personalized social media feeds. Just as Facebook and Instagram show different content to each user, Edgen provides different dashboards for each investor. For example, in the same Bitcoin market, long-term investors might receive a personalized pivot point alert saying \"Bottomed out, consider adding to your position,\" while short-term traders might see a personalized pivot point alert saying \"Short-term oversold zone, watch for potential rebound.\" <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"9i0KGmTXg3NlwAJrD55HH91XmrNTFl94TNoiDLu1.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410301_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410301\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Efficient Decision Guidance Model (EDGM) supports this function.</strong>. EDGM coordinates various specialized agents and tools through a multi-agent system, rather than operating as a single holistic model. Unlike general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that only process language and words, this inference model interprets user queries and assigns them to appropriate professional agents based on a specialized investment framework (macroeconomic analysis, technical analysis, fundamental analysis) and real-time market data. Each agent utilizes a guidance model and a knowledge model to collect the necessary data. This process integrates real-time market data, individual investor search history, portfolio composition, and trading patterns. The system also references data from investors with similar investment characteristics. Subsequently, market tools and the Large Language Model (LLM) process and synthesize the collected data, presenting the results in the form of conversational responses, charts, or reports. This solution combines the comprehensive market analysis of the Bloomberg Terminal with the personalized strategy development of private banks on a single platform. Now, retail investors can also access financial information previously only available to institutional investors and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">3. How Edgen Supports the Entire Investment Process</h2><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">3.1 Market Discovery: Uncovering Investment Opportunities</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In today's complex markets, even experienced investors struggle to find valuable investment opportunities. Investors must sift through and analyze massive amounts of data: countless news reports, charts, financial statements, and social media signals. Edgen simplifies this process through a variety of methods.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"jkSbWJ2LqY7A0iabZIBHGk3vReykSo4JDOdxjHfK.gif\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410302\" title=\"7410302\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Edgen's search function allows investors to explore the market in a conversational manner without directly analyzing complex financial data. For example, when an investor asks, \"Why has Tesla's stock price recently fallen?\", Edgen analyzes the company's news, financial situation, technical indicators, and market sentiment simultaneously, providing a comprehensive answer. Personalization also plays a role here. Edgen learns from users' search history, identifies the themes, industries, and indicators that each investor values, and then progressively tailors search results and investment recommendations to that user. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"7eRGIA6x6zqymYTdHiRdGQlEFq5AMxtBRPhF4GHc.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410303_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410303\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Investment Philosophy: Systematically uncover noteworthy market opportunities through thematic sections. \"Hot Stocks\" and \"Hot Cryptocurrencies\" highlight assets with strong market momentum. \"Stock Screener\" and \"Cryptocurrency Screener\" allow investors to create custom asset lists by setting criteria such as market capitalization, trading volume, and price action. The \"Cryptocurrency Attention &amp; Funding\" section captures signals unique to the cryptocurrency market.</p> ... “Cryptocurrency Attention” tracks tokens that are rapidly gaining popularity on social media in real time using X’s (formerly Twitter) “Hotness Index.” “Latest Funding” provides information on recently funded projects, including funding size and participating investors. “Decentralized Exchange Tracker” analyzes on-chain transactions to reveal the flow of funds from professional investors. <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">3.2. Intelligent Portfolio Management: Asset Valuation and Management</h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"G8U0sMCSkrVQm4i4lHMJfz1LzdxTewGiijCGOZU2.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410304_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410304\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">After identifying investment opportunities, investors need tools to deeply analyze assets and continuously monitor their trends. 360° reports can automatically generate comprehensive analyses for individual assets.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> The system evaluates stocks from four perspectives: valuation, growth, profitability, and momentum, and cryptocurrencies from three perspectives: fundamentals, token economic models, and momentum. Edgen's professional analysts analyze each category and assign ratings from A+ to D-. The platform transparently displays the analysis process so investors can verify the basis of each analyst's judgment. In addition to analyzing individual assets, investors must also manage multiple assets holistically. Edgen offers intelligent portfolio management features. Investors can manage their portfolio of stocks and cryptocurrencies on a single screen. The portfolio offers three views: a \"Market View\" displaying real-time prices and asset ratings; a \"360° Report View\" summarizing in-depth analysis of each asset; and a \"News View\" filtering and providing news relevant to the portfolio. Edgen plans to further advance its Smart Portfolio functionality. The platform will offer a comprehensive portfolio score that goes beyond single asset ratings, along with specific action plans to help investors achieve higher ratings. 3.3 Customization Tools: Building Your Own Investment Strategy Edgen provides a Smart Assistant Store for investors who require more specialized analysis. This store offers a range of AI assistants focused on specific investment areas. Investors can directly select and deploy smart assistants that match their investment style and goals. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"zBIOMD0gLCHJN3yR9GK4pvGAW12sIJVnj8cTSoUt.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410306_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410306\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For example, the technical signal broker automatically calculates indicators such as RSI, MACD, and moving averages, and then gives a \"bullish\" or \"bearish\" judgment, providing a comprehensive three-star rating. The pivot point alert broker detects when assets are approaching local highs or lows, helping investors optimize trading timing at key inflection points. Other brokers offer various functions, including on-chain activity analysis and TGE pre-opportunity discovery. Investors can choose and deploy the brokers they need based on their own goals. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"l2PCL8BDfSVB84B3RyfQHgR5BxBG3NUoBiiklfHR.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410307_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410307\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition, Edgen is about to launch an intelligent trade execution function, which can automatically execute investors' trade requests. For stock trading, the Edgen platform can interface with platforms such as Robinhood and XStocks; for cryptocurrency trading, Edgen can integrate with protocols such as Hyperliquid and Pendle. The AI ​​assistant can understand the investor's intent and execute trades directly. With this function, Edgen is moving from an intelligent platform to a comprehensive investment operation platform.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"x0S74xd0t7RA0V5zmKE6yePMQrtHo6L2jkoB5f1H.jpeg\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410308_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410308\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Source: Edgen</span><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Users earn Aura Points by publishing market analysis or insights on the platform or sharing such content on social media. 30% of the reward pool is used for distribution activities, and 70% is used for AI training contributions. The platform evaluates all contributions through AI scoring, community assessment, and expert verification. Users can view their Aura Points through the platform's leaderboards and on X (formerly Twitter) via browser extensions. The system divides points into three levels: Aura, Super Aura, and Ultra Aura.</p> ... The platform publicly records the provider of each analysis and its submission time. User-provided insights are used to train artificial intelligence. User contributions improve AI, which in turn provides users with better analysis, creating a virtuous cycle. Through this participatory structure, Edgen has gradually evolved into a platform that learns and progresses together with the community. 5. From Wall Street to Every Street Bloomberg Terminal and private banking services have long served only institutional investors and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. These institutions maintain an overwhelming competitive advantage in the market thanks to their unique information channels and analytical tools. Meanwhile, retail investors can only make investment decisions with incomplete information, fragmented data, and limited tools. The increasing complexity of the market further widens this gap. The variables that investors must consider are growing exponentially: on-chain data analysis, social media signal tracking, global market trend identification, and so on. In such a massive deluge of information, it's nearly impossible for individual investors to uncover meaningful insights and make timely investment decisions. Edgen bridges this information gap. The platform automates complex analytical tasks through a multi-agent system and integrates stocks and cryptocurrencies into a unified interface. Investors can now easily access institutional-grade analytics tools without having to collect and cross-reference information across multiple platforms. Edgen takes a further step in personalized financial intelligence. The platform provides optimized analysis and strategies tailored to each investor's style, risk tolerance, and goals. This approach goes beyond simply providing institutional tools to retail investors. Edgen essentially provides each investor with their own personal banker. Retail investing is rapidly diversifying. Edgen, through artificial intelligence, transforms \"Wall Street privilege\" into \"opportunity for everyone.\" Financial information once accessible only to a select few is now available to all investors. The investment landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation. </div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Author: Shen En</span></p><blockquote style=\"text-align: left;\"><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">With a single stroke of Trump's pen, the king of cryptocurrencies regained his innocence, but the political deal behind it is far more intriguing than the pardon itself.</span></p></blockquote><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">On October 23, when President Trump signed the pardon for Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, his tortuous fate once again became the focus of global attention. White House Press Secretary Levitt stated bluntly in a statement: \"The Biden administration's war on cryptocurrencies is over.\"</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">Four months ago, Changpeng Zhao was still serving time in Seattle federal prison, sentenced to four months in prison for failing to establish an effective anti-money laundering mechanism and violating US economic sanctions regulations.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"> Now, he has not only regained his freedom but also received a presidential pardon, a turn of events that has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. From imprisonment to presidential pardon, Zhao Changpeng's fall was as rapid as his rise. In November 2023, this entrepreneur, who once topped the list of the richest Chinese people with a net worth of $94.1 billion, admitted to violating US anti-money laundering regulations, and Binance paid a record-breaking $4.3 billion fine. He also resigned as CEO. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland stated at the time, \"Binance became the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange partly because of the crimes it committed.\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen further criticized Binance for \"ignoring\" its legal obligations in its pursuit of profits, allowing funds to flow through its platform to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers. In April 2024, a Seattle federal court sentenced Changpeng Zhao to four months in prison, far less than the three-year sentence initially sought by prosecutors. The judge told Zhao, \"No one is immune from prosecution or above U.S. law, regardless of wealth, power, or status.\" Now, Trump's pardon has erased Zhao's criminal record, clearing the way for his return to the cryptocurrency arena. The Political Deal Behind the Pardon Trump's decision to pardon Changpeng Zhao was not without precedent. In March 2025, the Wall Street Journal reported that representatives of the Trump family had negotiated a stake in the cryptocurrency exchange Binance US. The report at the time indicated that Zhao had served four months in prison after pleading guilty and was seeking leniency from the Trump administration. Although Zhao denied the reports on the X platform, the contact between the Trump family and Binance has raised questions about a potential conflict of interest. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the Trump family's cryptocurrency business, which has been operating since the 2024 election, has generated $4.5 billion in revenue and has a partnership with the trading platform Binance, which is quietly managed. This pardon decision has therefore been viewed by outsiders as potentially involving a quid pro quo. Trump described his pardon decision as ending the Biden administration's \"political persecution\" of the crypto industry. However, this explanation cannot conceal the possible commercial ties between his family and Binance. The Rise and Fall of Changpeng Zhao: Changpeng Zhao's story is a microcosm of the cryptocurrency industry. Born in Jiangsu, China in 1977, Zhao Changpeng immigrated to Canada with his parents at the age of 10. During his teenage years, he worked at a Chevron gas station and McDonald's, and also served as a volleyball referee. At the age of 13, his father bought him an IBM-compatible 286 computer, an investment that helped him embark on a career in technology. He later earned a bachelor's degree in computer science from McGill University and subsequently developed systems for the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Bloomberg Futures Trading. In 2013, Zhao Changpeng first learned about cryptocurrency while playing poker. He subsequently sold his Shanghai apartment and invested approximately $1 million in cryptocurrency at $600 per coin. Even after his Shanghai property doubled in value while cryptocurrency prices halved, he remained bullish on the latter. In 2017, Zhao Changpeng founded Binance in Hong Kong. With the surge in cryptocurrency prices, Binance rapidly grew into the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. At the end of 2021, Changpeng Zhao topped the Forbes list of the richest Chinese people with a net worth of $90 billion. However, Binance's rapid expansion was accompanied by compliance risks. US regulators alleged that Binance failed to establish an effective anti-money laundering mechanism and violated US economic sanctions regulations. These issues ultimately led to his conflict with the US judicial system. The Legal and Political Realities Behind Pardons: The US president's power of pardon originates from Article II, Section 2 of the US Constitution, which, except in cases of impeachment, grants probation and pardons to those who violate federal laws. This virtually unlimited power allowed Trump to drop Zhao Changpeng's criminal conviction. This wasn't the first time Trump had used his pardon power. Before his term ended in January 2021, he pardoned dozens of people, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner's father and former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. At the time, some US media outlets even reported that Trump's allies and aides received fees from those seeking presidential pardons. For Zhao Changpeng, the actual legal value of the pardon may be limited, as he has already served his sentence. However, its symbolic significance is enormous—the pardon erases his criminal record, paving the way for his return to the business and political arena. A New Chapter in Cryptocurrency Regulation Trump's decision to pardon Changpeng Zhao symbolizes a shift in US cryptocurrency policy. The White House explicitly stated that this move aims to end the Biden administration's stringent regulations on the cryptocurrency industry. In recent years, global regulation of cryptocurrencies has been continuously tightening. In 2023, with the bankruptcy of FTX, one of the world's top five cryptocurrency exchanges, regulations on cryptocurrencies became even stricter in various countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission also filed 13 charges against Binance. Chen Jia, a researcher at the International Monetary Institute of Renmin University of China, pointed out that for cryptocurrencies to achieve sustainable development in the future, they urgently need to address four key issues: compliance, security, risk control, and liquidity. These are also the four cornerstones of future US cryptocurrency exchanges. Trump's pardon of Changpeng Zhao sends a clear signal: his administration will adopt a more lenient regulatory stance towards the cryptocurrency industry. This policy shift may open the door for Binance to re-enter the US market. For Changpeng Zhao, the pardon signifies a new beginning. In a September interview with Caixin, Zhao mentioned focusing more on his venture capital firm, YZi Labs, and has been invited to serve as an official cryptocurrency industry advisor to several governments. Binance may also face significant changes. Although the settlement agreement required Binance to completely withdraw from the US and appoint a five-year oversight officer, Trump's pardon may create favorable conditions for Binance's return to the US market. Meanwhile, Changpeng Zhao is also expected to rejoin Binance's management. His previous sentence prohibited him from participating in Binance's management or decision-making activities for three years after his release, but the amnesty may lift this restriction. The market reacted positively to Zhao's return. Following the amnesty news, BNB rose 7%, returning above $1100, and Bitcoin also returned to $110,000. This market reaction shows that investors view Zhao's return as a positive development for the industry. Trump's amnesty has rewritten Zhao's fate, but the global cryptocurrency game has only just begun. As the Trump family's relationship with Binance deepens, and as Changpeng Zhao moves among political figures worldwide, the future of cryptocurrency will become inextricably linked to geopolitics. Zhao Changpeng's promise after his release to \"do everything in his power to help the United States become the cryptocurrency capital\" carries profound implications. Wherever he goes, the future of cryptocurrency will be reshaped in the clash between national interests and decentralized ideals.</span></p></div></div>",

            "title": "Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio: Gold is the safest currency",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Ray Dalio, Founder of Bridgewater Associates; Source: X, @RayDalio; Translated by: Shaw Jinse Finance</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Recently, I've received a lot of questions about gold, so I decided to answer them all and compile them into a compilation of frequently asked gold questions. I've also added this content to my \"digital avatar,\" Digital Ray, so that more people can discuss this topic in depth.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But I'd also like to briefly share what I believe are the most important points about gold, which is the purpose of this article.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>In my opinion, gold is a form of currency, and one with the least risk of devaluation and/or confiscation—that's beyond question.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here are the reasons why I believe this is the case.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>For thousands of years, gold has been considered currency in almost every country, while all other currencies have disappeared.</strong> Its operation is as follows, and remains so today. Throughout history, all currencies (i.e., circulating currencies) have either been: 1) \"Gold-pegged/hard-asset-backed\" currencies, referring to currencies pegged to gold or similar globally recognized assets with limited supply (such as silver). These currencies are backed by government commitments allowing individuals or governments to exchange \"paper money\" for gold (or other \"hard assets,\" such as silver) at a fixed exchange rate. 2) \"Fiat\" currencies, referring to currencies not pegged to any asset/not backed by any asset, and therefore their supply is unlimited. Historically, when a monetary system is pegged to gold and the debt (i.e., the commitment to deliver gold money) is too high relative to the existing total amount of gold money, the monetary system collapses. This is because world leaders either: a) adhere to their commitment to gold-backed currencies, leading to debt defaults and deflationary depressions; or b) break their promise to deliver gold at the promised price, thereby creating a large amount of money and credit, which typically leads to currency devaluation, which in turn drives up inflation and gold prices. Before the advent of central banks (introduced in the US in 1913), economies generally followed a) a deflationary path; after the advent of central banks, they followed b) an inflationary path. Either way, this leads to a severe collapse/crisis of the debt/monetary system, reducing the debt-to-income ratio and ultimately fixing prices at a new, higher level. (This is why prices rise over time.) The two most recent collapses of gold-backed monetary systems occurred in 1933 and 1971. In 1971, we abandoned the gold-backed monetary system and adopted a fiat currency system. Because we are now in a fiat currency system, studying what happened in the past when fiat currency systems had excess debt relative to the funds needed to repay it is particularly relevant to the present. In those situations, central banks would invariably issue large amounts of money and credit, which typically led to higher inflation and rising gold prices. In all these cases, gold performed exceptionally well as an alternative to \"paper debt money.\" It is the strongest store of value in the long run. This is why it is now the second largest reserve currency held by central banks worldwide. However, this does not mean that other currencies are less effective at storing wealth than gold in the long run. This is because \"paper money\" generates interest, while gold does not. Therefore, when interest rates depreciate more rapidly relative to paper money, these paper currencies can generate higher returns. If one chooses to engage in market timing (which I advise against), then one should hold paper money when interest rates are high enough to offset the default and depreciation risks of holding paper debt. However, when interest rates are insufficient to compensate for the devaluation and default risks of paper currency debt, holding gold is the wise choice. Alternatively, one can choose not to try to time the market but instead hold a certain amount of gold. Like cash, gold has a low real yield of approximately 1.2% and is negatively correlated with cash. Therefore, in any environment requiring liquidity, gold and cash can be considered good options. Gold is also favored because it carries a lower risk of confiscation than other currencies and assets. This is because gold's value does not depend on payments from others, and it is more difficult for individuals or governments to confiscate it. Gold is the most difficult currency to seize because it can be safely held by individuals, unlike other currencies that require payments to acquire value. It is also not susceptible to theft in cyberattacks. Therefore, when there is a high risk of currency confiscation, such as: a) financial crises leading to high taxes and other confiscation policies; b) economic and currency wars between nations (e.g., sanctions), gold becomes the preferred asset. Therefore, during periods of currency/debt crisis and/or war, when the risk of foreclosure increases, the value of gold rises significantly (or more accurately, it is the only currency that does not depreciate). This is why gold has long been the most fundamental currency and, for a very long time, its value has kept pace with the cost of living, boasting the best track record. This is how the debt/currency/gold dynamic works, and it remains so today. This is especially true when debt is large relative to the amount of money needed to repay it, and when there is the risk of foreclosure. As an investment asset, I treat gold like any other asset when constructing a portfolio, examining its expected returns, risks, correlations with other assets, and liquidity to develop a strategic asset allocation plan. Then, I consider tactical adjustments to the portfolio based on market dynamics. Therefore, I believe that gold, as part of an investment portfolio, has certain characteristics, much like holding a certain amount of cash. This view is quite different from how most people view gold, who generally see it as a speculative market. Viewing gold as a base currency has been very helpful to me, and perhaps you should consider it too. If you disagree with my view, please let me know, and we can discuss the truth together to better address this issue. When I consider how much gold should be held in an investment portfolio, I first and foremost consider it as a strategic asset allocation, not a tactical/market timing decision. I believe that everyone should start investing by understanding and holding an investment portfolio that best suits them, unaffected by any market timing perspective. Adjustments to an existing portfolio should only be made when investors believe they have a greater ability to time the market and determine which investments are better. Most investors do not possess this ability, therefore they should stick to their established strategic asset allocation. Therefore, when investors ask me whether they should decide to buy or sell gold based on price fluctuations, I tell them it's a secondary strategic question. Their primary concern should be how much gold they should hold in their strategic asset allocation. Based on my own analysis, this percentage ranges from 5% to 15%, depending on the other assets in their portfolio and their risk appetite. As for tactically overweighting or underweighting gold in a portfolio based on market timing, as mentioned earlier, gold should be overweighted when the risk of monetary system collapse, currency confiscation, and economic/currency wars (such as sanctions) is high; and underweighted at other times, because gold has historically been a relatively poor-performing asset (like cash) because it is not a productive asset.

Policy: Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission Chairman: Proposed to provide guidance for digital asset treasuries and study the issue of listed companies purchasing Bitcoin. Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission Chairman Wong Tin-yau stated that Hong Kong currently has no regulations governing listed companies' participation in cryptocurrency investment. He added that the market situation will be monitored, and relevant guidance will be studied for the market. Wong Tin-yau added that Hong Kong currently lacks legislation to regulate listed companies' participation in virtual asset treasury arrangements. Regarding listed companies claiming to adopt Digital Asset Treasuries (DAT), Wong urged investors to carefully understand what DAT is and its underlying value. He also stated that he would study the issue of listed companies purchasing Bitcoin. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) recently completed its Digital Hong Kong Dollar pilot program. Chief Executive Eddie Yue stated that the work related to \"digital Hong Kong Dollar\" (e-HKD) and tokenization is part of a grand vision to establish a comprehensive digital currency framework that promotes the complementary coexistence of different forms of tokenized currencies, such as digital Hong Kong Dollars, tokenized deposits, and regulated stablecoins. Yue made the above statement in an article dated October 30, 2025. He revealed that Hong Kong's next phase of fintech development blueprint will be announced at the 10th Fintech Week in Hong Kong next week, ensuring that Hong Kong continues to be at the forefront of fintech. At the technical launch of the second phase report of the \"Digital Hong Kong Dollar\" pilot program held by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on October 28, the HKMA outlined Hong Kong's digital currency framework, dividing it into \"public currency\" and \"private currency.\" The digital Hong Kong dollar, issued by the HKMA, is a public currency; according to the issuer, tokenized deposits issued by commercial banks, electronic stored-value payment instruments such as WeChat Pay and Alipay issued by licensed institutions in Hong Kong, and regulated stablecoins are all classified as private currencies. <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>▌Qian Zhimin Pleads Guilty in UK Court; Police Report: Continued Cross-Border Fugitive Apprehension and Asset Recovery Cooperation</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">On October 30, the Hedong Branch of the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau reported that on April 21, 2017, the Hedong Branch of the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau opened an investigation into Tianjin Lantian Gree Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for suspected illegal absorption of public deposits. The main suspect, Qian Zhimin, fled to the UK. The Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau has been conducting in-depth international cooperation with British law enforcement agencies through international law enforcement and judicial cooperation channels to pursue fugitives and recover assets. On September 29, 2025, the Southwark Court in London, UK, held a trial for Qian Zhimin's alleged money laundering crimes, and Qian Zhimin pleaded guilty in court. Currently, the public security organs are continuing cross-border cooperation with British law enforcement agencies to pursue fugitives and recover assets, making every effort to recover the losses of those who participated in the fundraising scheme. At the same time, those who participated in the fundraising scheme are reminded to cooperate with the public security organs in handling the case according to law, express their demands and report situations reasonably and legally, and not to believe or spread rumors.</p> ... The public security authorities have not entrusted any third-party institutions to provide legal guidance to investors intending to appear in court, nor have they entrusted any third-party institutions to conduct cross-border fugitive repatriation and asset recovery work. Investors are advised to be wary of so-called cross-border recovery agents to avoid being scammed. The European Central Bank (ECB) hopes to launch a digital euro pilot program in 2027. The ECB stated on Thursday that it may launch its digital currency pilot program in 2027 if it receives timely approval from legislators. The ECB believes the project is crucial to the financial autonomy of the eurozone. It sees it as a strategic alternative to US-dominated private payment methods such as credit cards and stablecoins. The ECB stated that this move is increasingly important in an era of escalating geopolitical tensions, as financial autonomy and resilience are considered key to maintaining European economic sovereignty. After four years of research and preparation, the ECB said it is currently considering a pilot program, meaning some digital euro transactions could begin as early as mid-2027, with a full rollout two years later. <hr/><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Blockchain Applications</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>▌Metalpha Raises $12 Million in Strategic Investment from Gortune and Avenir Group</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">According to PR Newswire, Nasdaq-listed Metalalpha Technology Holding Ltd.

Xi Jinping pointed out that both teams should refine and finalize follow-up work as soon as possible, uphold and implement the consensus, and deliver tangible results to reassure both China and the US, as well as the world economy. The recent twists and turns in China-US economic and trade relations have also provided some insights for both sides. Economic and trade relations should continue to be the ballast and engine of China-US relations, not a stumbling block or point of conflict. Both sides should consider the bigger picture and focus on the long-term benefits of cooperation, rather than falling into a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation. Both teams can continue discussions based on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit, continuously narrowing the list of issues and expanding the list of collaborations. <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>▌Bessenter: A candidate for the next Fed Chair may be selected before Christmas</strong> U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessenter: A candidate for the next Fed Chair may be selected before Christmas.

The House measures will save $10 billion in 2025 and $10 billion in 2026. The Federal Reserve will roll over all maturing Treasury principal starting in December. The Fed mentioned in its FOMC statement that starting December 1, it will roll over all maturing U.S. Treasury principal payments. This means the Fed will reinvest the principal of maturing Treasury bonds into new U.S. Treasury bonds, maintaining its asset size and ending balance sheet reduction. This move is generally seen as a signal of a shift towards looser monetary policy or at least the end of a tightening cycle.

(Jinse Encyclopedia) Will Google's Willow quantum chip affect Bitcoin security? Google's Willow chip marks a new era of quantum performance, enabling complex calculations and having a significant impact on various industries, including cryptography. With Google's unveiling of its 105-qubit Willow chip, built on the company's Sycamore processor, quantum computing has reached a significant milestone. Willow nearly doubles the number of qubits in Sycamore, unlocking the ability to handle exponentially more complex computations. One of Willow's most notable advancements is its progress in quantum error correction, a crucial step towards scalable, fault-tolerant quantum systems. In benchmarks such as random circuit sampling (a test of a quantum computer's ability to solve complex problems), Willow completed tasks in minutes that would take conventional supercomputers billions of years to accomplish. Quantum computers using algorithms like Shor and Grover have the potential to solve complex problems exponentially faster, potentially breaking traditional cryptographic algorithms. The rollout of powerful quantum computers like Willow has raised concerns about its impact on cryptographic security, including the impact of the Willow chip on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and many other blockchain systems rely on cryptographic algorithms designed to resist classical attacks. However, the potential impact of quantum computing on cryptographic security has raised concerns. Google's Willow quantum chip currently poses no direct threat to Bitcoin's encryption system. Cracking Bitcoin's ECDSA or SHA-256 encryption requires at least 1,500-3,000 fault-tolerant logical qubits, far exceeding Willow's capabilities. The scalability of current quantum systems is insufficient to challenge Bitcoin's robust defenses. Bitcoin's layered encryption structure, combining ECDSA and SHA-256, ensures resistance to today's quantum technologies. This technological gap currently guarantees the security of Bitcoin's encryption measures.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div>Trump is upgrading his influence in the financial markets from simply posting recommendations to directly entering the game. The US president, jokingly referred to as the \"chief trader,\" is now preparing to truly \"open the door\" through his company—entering the prediction market business. According to the latest media reports, Trump Media Technology Group announced on Tuesday that it will launch the prediction market service Truth Predict on its social platform Truth Social in partnership with Crypto.com. This service will allow users to bet on the outcomes of events such as sports, entertainment, politics, and economic trends, and plans to roll it out globally after meeting regulatory requirements. The timing of this move is quite delicate, as Trump and his family members have repeatedly faced scrutiny in recent years due to unusual stock price fluctuations and allegations of insider trading. From the stock price surge before family members joined the company to Trump's \"buy\" call before tariff policy changes, a series of events have made the market highly sensitive to the trading behavior of his camp. Prediction markets are becoming the hottest new arena on Wall Street. According to research platform Dune, prediction market trading volume hit a record high of over $2.3 billion last week. The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the NYSE, recently invested $2 billion in Polymarket, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plans to launch related contracts before the end of the year. The entry of traditional financial giants is pushing this market, once considered a \"digital casino,\" into the mainstream. Truth Predict: From \"Social Platform\" to \"Prediction Market\" Trump Media Technology Group's entry into the prediction market is a continuation of its strategy of deep integration with the cryptocurrency industry. The company will launch its prediction market service through the Truth Social social platform, the streaming platform Truth+, and the fintech brand Truth.Fi, in partnership with the cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com. The service will first undergo beta testing on Truth Social before a full rollout in the United States. Trump Media plans to launch the service globally once all necessary requirements are met. Prediction markets allow users to profit by predicting the outcomes of events such as sports, entertainment, political, and economic trends. Such event-based contract trading has seen strong momentum since last year's US presidential election. With increasing market attention, prediction markets are seen as a strong contender for wider acceptance in the financial world, with some experts believing they are more accurate than traditional polls in highly competitive scenarios. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek stated, \"Prediction markets have the potential to become a multi-billion dollar industry.\" This is not the first collaboration between the two companies. Earlier this year, Trump Media and Crypto.com reached an agreement with a blank check acquisition company to launch a new joint venture, employing a Treasury-like strategy to accumulate the cryptocurrency platform's native token, CRO, further deepening Trump's ties with the cryptocurrency industry. Kalshi and Polymarket, the world's two largest prediction market platforms, have attracted significant attention from venture capital firms and other investors in recent months, solidifying the prediction market's reach and engagement. The Shadow of the \"Chief Trader\": Insider Trading Suspicions Linger. As the Trump campaign ventures into prediction markets, questions surrounding unusual trading activity by his family members and affiliated companies have never ceased. In recent years, a series of companies associated with Trump and his inner circle have exhibited unusual trading activity before major personnel or policy announcements, raising suspicions of market manipulation and insider trading. One of the most notable events was the dramatic fluctuations in the US stock market due to the tariff policy. About four hours before announcing a suspension of tariffs, Trump posted in all caps on his Truth Social media platform: \"This is a great time to buy!!! DJT.\" Although DJT is also an abbreviation of his own name, it is also the stock ticker for Trump Media. That day, DJT's stock price closed up 22.67%, and the estimated value of Trump's shares increased by $415 million. Similar situations have occurred multiple times. Last November, drone manufacturer Unusual Machines saw its stock price nearly triple in the four weeks leading up to the announcement of hiring Donald Trump Jr., with daily trading volume surging from 93,000 shares to 290,000 shares. This February, Trump Tower-based fintech group Dominari Holdings saw its stock price soar by 580% in the six weeks prior to announcing the addition of Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump to its advisory board. These suspicions are not isolated incidents. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has close ties to Trump, and the family of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have also drawn attention for their precise \"timed\" trades. These events continue to escalate, fueling accusations that the Trump camp is using its informational advantage to influence the market. Prediction Markets Soar: From \"Digital Casinos\" to Wall Street's Darling Trump's entry into the market at this time comes as prediction markets have transformed from a niche concept into a Wall Street darling. Data from research platform Dune shows that global prediction market trading volume reached a record high of over $2 billion last week. The hype has directly translated into valuations, with emerging platforms Polymarket and Kalshi leading the charge. Polymarket, a cryptocurrency-based platform, reportedly has a valuation approaching $15 billion after receiving a $2 billion strategic investment from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. Kalshi, the first event trading exchange in the US regulated by the CFTC, gained social media fame for its real-time mayoral election odds display on New York streets, with its cultural influence even extending to the popular animated series \"South Park.\" Traditional financial giants have also entered the fray; the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest derivatives exchange, plans to launch financial contracts linked to sporting events and economic indicators by the end of the year. This move, along with ICE's investment in Polymarket and Nasdaq's exploration of asset tokenization, indicates that prediction markets and their underlying tokenization technology are moving from the periphery to the center of the financial system. Against this backdrop, Trump's \"Truth Predict\" is no longer merely a celebrity's commercial stunt, but a strategic move to position himself in a rapidly growing and increasingly mainstream financial arena. As Wall Street's \"regulars\" rush in, Trump, with his inherent star power and controversial appeal, clearly doesn't want to miss out on this feast.</div></div>",

More importantly, the platform uses a binary contract structure regulated by the CFTC, cleverly circumventing the legal definition of \"gambling.\" In this regulatory gray area, the Trump team's instincts remain as sharp as ever. *Truth Predict's Beta test will soon begin on Truth Social, targeting US users and supporting betting on events such as elections, economic indicators, sports, and commodity prices.* *Role Two: CZ's Decentralized Strategy: From Behind the Scenes to the Forefront* *Compared to Trump's high-profile approach, the strategy of CZ, a key figure in the crypto space, is more covert yet equally precise.* Through YZi Labs (formerly Binance Labs, founded in 2018), CZ invested in two key projects: Opinion Labs, which builds a decentralized \"truth oracle,\" and APRO Oracle, a \"decentralized oracle network specifically serving the Bitcoin ecosystem.\" CZ's statements on Twitter are intriguing: \"Prediction markets urgently need dedicated oracles,\" and \"Although we are only a few investors, we will do our best to help increase strategic value.\" This reveals an important signal: CZ is not only interested in the prediction market itself, but also in the data infrastructure behind it. In other words, when prediction markets become mainstream applications, the verification of data authenticity will undoubtedly have significant weight. Whoever controls the verification of data authenticity indirectly holds the power to influence the new ecosystem. Opinion Labs' mainnet launched on BNB Chain on October 16, 2025, and is currently in an invitation-only Beta phase, with a cumulative transaction volume exceeding $300 million (testnet + mainnet Beta). Meanwhile, the APRO Oracle Beta test began on October 28, initially targeting BNB Chain and Bitcoin Layer 2 developers, and AI validator node registration is now open. Role Three: Wall Street's Expectations: ICE's $2 Billion Bets Most shockingly, ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, invested $2 billion in Polymarket. This is more than just an investment; it's an \"official endorsement\" of prediction markets by traditional finance. $2 billion is not a small sum for Wall Street, especially for an institution known for its conservatism. ICE has always been drawn to \"hardcore finance\"—in 2013, it spent approximately $11 billion to acquire NYSE Euronext, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange; in 2018, it launched the crypto asset platform Bakkt with an initial investment of only $180 million. These figures, taken together, are enough to illustrate the point: ICE is betting on a completely different future. Why? Because prediction markets don't aggregate capital, but rather dispersed judgments. In an era dominated by algorithms, data is already saturated; what's truly scarce is human insight. When traders, programmers, professors, and gamblers all place bets on the same platform, they inadvertently produce an extremely valuable indicator—collective expectation. This investment may mark a shift: when mainstream financial institutions begin to treat prediction markets as sources of information rather than toys, the coordinates of the financial world will subtly shift. Algorithmic trading, risk models, and investment strategies—all may be recalibrated because of these \"market-driven predictions.\" </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/29542-1761817771484.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>*CNBC, as a leading global financial media outlet, reports on this event primarily due to its significant financial and market impact</em></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Chapter Two: The Motives of Billionaires—Two Dramatic Stories</h2><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/29542-1761817794547.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Crypto Perspective: The Unexpected Holy Grail of DeFi?</h3> This first story perfectly addresses a long-standing and awkward dilemma in the crypto world: How can DeFi (Decentralized Finance) be made accessible to the masses? For years, the promise of \"DeFi democratization\" has been considered the holy grail of the crypto world. However, the reality is that complex wallets, difficult-to-understand private key management, and abstract yield logic have acted as a high wall, keeping 99% of ordinary people out. DeFi has always been an insider game for \"crypto natives.\" However, prediction markets may become that \"unexpected breakthrough.\" It may become the first DeFi product to achieve mass adoption because it completely revolutionizes the user experience: It's intuitive and fun, not mind-bending and complex: participation is similar to \"guessing,\" betting on your judgment of the real world, rather than requiring you to understand \"liquidity pools\" or \"impermanent loss.\" Predicting whether the next Marvel movie will gross over $1 billion is far more intuitive than calculating complex DeFi yields. It's strongly coupled with the real world, rather than being ethereal: prediction markets target verifiable events: presidential elections, sporting events, policies, and regulations. This directly links the abstract value of blockchain to real life, giving it an unprecedented sense of \"reality.\" It's becoming more user-friendly, not just for geeks: major platforms are striving to allow users to participate directly with credit cards and email addresses, completely hiding the complex blockchain technology behind the scenes. You don't even need to know what a wallet is to bet on the next Super Bowl. In this story, prediction markets are the \"Trojan horse\" that allows DeFi to penetrate the mainstream. Using the most human-friendly elements of \"guessing\" and \"gossip\" as a guise, it quietly brings blockchain technology to the fingertips of tens or even hundreds of millions of users. This is more than just growth; it could be a decisive step for the Web3 world from an \"on-chain economy\" to \"real-world participation.\" Political Perspective: The \"Secret Weapon\" of Democracy However, the other side of the coin is a story about power and public opinion. What is the core of politics? It's not just about winning votes, but about shaping voters' \"expectations.\" And prediction markets are precisely a perfect \"expectation-generating machine.\" Imagine that on the eve of an election, a candidate's chances of winning are boosted to 78% on the prediction market. This number itself is a highly impactful news story. The media will cite it (\"Market predicts XX will win overwhelmingly\"), social networks will spread it, and voters will see it. This \"guaranteed victory\" halo backed by money will spread like a virus, shaking centrists, demoralizing opponents, and even creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of \"everyone kicking someone when they're down.\" Even more frightening is that this provides power with a completely new and difficult-to-account-for tool for influence. In the past, politicians needed to influence public opinion through the media or direct speech; now, you might need a large enough sum of money and a \"suitable\" platform. By heavily betting in the market, politicians can \"buy\" a probability favorable to themselves in the short term, and then let the media and the public amplify that signal. When questioned, they can simply shrug and innocently declare, \"I didn't lie; I was just making a legitimate investment.\" When we see Donald Trump Jr. become an advisor to Polymarket, and when the capital associated with him pours tens of millions of dollars into the platform, we should be wary: is this really just a simple investment? In this story, prediction markets are no longer a \"crystal ball\" for gathering wisdom, but a \"secret weapon\" that can be used to shape public opinion. Conclusion: Power Restructuring in a Game of Probability. So, are prediction markets the \"unexpected holy grail\" of DeFi, or a \"secret weapon\" of democracy? The answer might be: both. It has the potential to become an unprecedented information aggregation tool, allowing the \"wisdom of the masses\" to shine with unprecedented efficiency; it could also degenerate into a battlefield of public opinion captured by huge amounts of capital and political power, allowing the \"biggest wallets\" to define what \"truth\" is. Currently, Kalshi and Polymarket hold the vast majority of the market share, with the former accounting for approximately 60-66% and the latter 34%. When platforms like Robinhood open event contract trading to their 20 million users, the market's influence will grow exponentially. The next 12-24 months will be crucial. Can prediction markets achieve mass adoption while maintaining their decentralized ideals? Can they remain innovative while accepting regulation? Can they uphold the public interest while achieving commercial success? The answers to these questions will determine whether prediction markets become tools for social progress or weapons that exacerbate inequality and manipulation. And each of us will be a participant and witness in this game of probability.</div></div>",
