Lubin initially positioned the company as a \"startup studio,\" aiming to incubate dozens of Ethereum-related startups and projects. Between 2015 and 2018, ConsenSys expanded rapidly, at its peak establishing offices in New York, San Francisco, and other locations, with approximately 1,200 employees, and investing in and incubating numerous \"fork\" projects in areas such as wallets and decentralized applications. However, the cryptocurrency bear market at the end of 2018 forced the company to significantly shrink: laying off approximately 13% of its staff in December 2018, and another 14% in early 2020.</p> Strategic Focus Shift After 2020: In August 2020, Lubin spearheaded a major restructuring, splitting the company into two main business segments. Core products (MetaMask, Infura, Codefi fintech suite, etc.) were integrated into a new U.S. entity—ConsenSys Software Inc.; the original Swiss entity was renamed ConsenSys Mesh, focusing on venture capital and incubation. This move aimed to streamline operations and attract external capital, transforming ConsenSys from a loosely structured startup studio into a traditional software company focused on its core star products. Notably, following this restructuring, 27 early employees filed a lawsuit, claiming that the transfer of assets to the new entity diluted their committed equity, highlighting governance conflicts during the transformation process. Following the split, ConsenSys secured its first external financing. In November 2021, the company raised $200 million at a valuation of $3.2 billion, with investors including Animoca Brands, Coinbase Ventures, and HSBC. Just months later, in March 2022, the company raised another $450 million in a Series D funding round led by ParaFi Capital, raising its valuation to $7 billion. This funding coincided with the 2021 bull market for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), leading to a surge in ConsenSys product usage. However, as the market subsequently cooled, the company implemented cost-cutting measures again: laying off approximately 20% of its workforce at the end of 2022, and another 11% at the beginning of 2023 to control expenses. Key Acquisitions and Divestitures: Throughout its development, ConsenSys has improved its product portfolio through several strategic acquisitions. In 2020, the company acquired Quorum, an enterprise-grade Ethereum fork project from J.P. Morgan, strengthening its permissioned blockchain service capabilities. It also solidified its developer tool ecosystem by acquiring the popular smart contract development framework Truffle and integrating the Infura team, which had been incubated internally since 2016. In early 2022, ConsenSys acquired the Ethereum wallet interface MyCrypto and merged it with MetaMask to improve security and platform compatibility. Recently, the company acquired Web3Auth, a key management SDK provider, to optimize MetaMask's user registration process and security, while continuing to invest in complementary startups (such as DeFi financial tool provider SharpLink). Regarding asset divestitures, during the strategic adjustment period from 2019 to 2020, the company significantly divested or shut down non-core \"branch\" projects, some of which were incorporated into ConsenSys Mesh, while others were allowed to develop independently. By 2023, ConsenSys had completely transformed its positioning from a \"massive incubator\" to a \"product-oriented company focused on core Web3 infrastructure.\" <p></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Employee Size, Leadership, and Business Layout:</strong> As of the end of 2025, ConsenSys had approximately 600-700 employees worldwide, with a core office in the United States (officially headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas), and significant business operations in New York, London, and other locations. Lubin remained CEO and the largest shareholder. In August 2024, the company appointed former Disney and Improbable executive Dan Odell as CFO, highlighting its IPO intentions. The leadership team also includes MetaMask co-founders Dan Finlay and Aaron Davis, as well as product leaders from Infura and Linea; most members are seasoned professionals in the Ethereum ecosystem. ConsenSys's business covers consumer-facing products and enterprise consulting services. It participates in high-end projects such as the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pilot program using Quorum technology, while adhering to a \"developer-first\" philosophy. This dual nature of \"balancing decentralized technology and enterprise cooperation\" is a significant characteristic of the company's development. Product Matrix and Revenue Sources 1. MetaMask (Wallet Platform) Positioning and User Scale: MetaMask is the world's most widely used self-custodied cryptocurrency wallet, supporting both browser extensions and mobile applications. As an entry point to Ethereum and Web3, it allows users to store assets and seamlessly connect to decentralized applications. At its peak, MetaMask had over 30 million monthly active users (MAU), an explosive growth from 10 million in mid-2021. In 2025, MetaMask had approximately 143 million users globally, with about 30 million monthly active users, holding over 80% market share in the Web3 wallet market and almost becoming synonymous with \"accessing DeFi.\" As the default wallet for numerous Ethereum dApps, its distribution advantage has built a powerful network effect. Profit Model: Unlike most purely open-source wallets, MetaMask generates substantial revenue through built-in services, primarily from \"MetaMask Swaps\"—an in-wallet token exchange aggregation tool that charges a 0.875% service fee on transactions. During the 2021 bull market, this feature was highly profitable: exchange fee revenue grew by approximately 2300% throughout the year, soaring from about $1.8 million in January 2021 to $44 million in December alone. In 2022, transaction fees from MetaMask contributed the vast majority of ConsenSys' total revenue of $252 million. Other monetization features include: \"MetaMask Staking,\" launched in 2023, allowing users to stake ETH through service providers like Lido and Rocket Pool, with the platform likely earning referral fees; integrating fiat currency deposit channels, potentially generating a small revenue share from partners; and a \"MetaMask Institutional\" version for institutional clients, supporting compliance and custody integration, or adopting a SaaS licensing model. Furthermore, ConsenSys has revealed plans to launch a MetaMask token and a new reward mechanism, indicating a potential future strategy of using token economics to increase user activity and thus impact the monetization model. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"XNh8tG0AVMUJaAfOlGLLESLOyU42TDXMXYPjdWHc.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410232_watermarknone.png\" title=\"7410232\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Security and Privacy Performance</strong>: Given MetaMask's popularity, its security track record is crucial. The wallet's self-custodial design means users hold their own keys, which largely protects it from direct hacking attacks; most asset losses stem from user-side phishing attacks. ConsenSys has integrated Blockaid security features (enabled by default from 2024), alerting users to malicious transactions and phishing attempts—hundreds of thousands of users have enabled this feature during the testing phase, preventing tens of thousands of malicious transactions. The wallet's codebase was once completely open source, but in 2020, to protect its business model, it switched to a stricter licensing agreement. This decision sparked differing opinions regarding \"security transparency.\" On the privacy front, in late 2022, ConsenSys disclosed that the default Infura connection recorded users' IP addresses and wallet addresses to comply with regulations, raising user concerns and regulatory scrutiny, but without resulting in specific penalties. Overall, MetaMask has a solid security reputation and continues to conduct phishing prevention education; however, its large user base makes it a primary target for scammers, thus continued security investment is crucial. Market Competition: MetaMask's established position faces competition from both emerging wallets and established exchanges. Ethereum and Web3 wallets such as Rainbow, Rabby, Zerion, and Phantom are vying for market share by optimizing UX or supporting multi-chain functionality; Coinbase Wallet leverages the Coinbase brand to attract retail users. Currently, despite overall market growth, MetaMask maintains its market share. However, user loyalty could be shaken if competitors launch products that are \"significantly more secure or simpler\" (such as wallets using smart contract accounts or those without mnemonic phrases). In the mobile arena, MetaMask also faces competition from rivals like Trust Wallet; in the institutional wallet market, MetaMask Institutional needs to contend with custody-centric solutions like Fireblocks and Copper. In summary, MetaMask's dominance is not insurmountable: its massive installation base and integration with almost all dApps form a \"moat,\" but to maintain growth and profitability, it needs to continuously optimize usability and security, and address app store policy risks (such as potential impacts from Apple or Google restricting cryptocurrency wallet applications). **Revenue Importance and Data Transparency:** MetaMask is likely ConsenSys's largest single source of revenue. Historically, transaction fees have accounted for the vast majority of MetaMask's total revenue. Although the company has not publicly disclosed detailed data, external estimates suggest that in early 2023, MetaMask's transaction revenue accounted for the majority of the company's $252 million annualized revenue (ARR). This revenue is highly sensitive to market trading volume: In 2022, cryptocurrency trading activity declined, leading to a significant drop in MetaMask's transaction volume and fee revenue. Wallet downloads in the first nine months of 2023 decreased by approximately 32% year-over-year. The effectiveness of new revenue streams such as staking and token incentives remains unproven, and user data transparency is also problematic—aside from the occasionally disclosed MAU, detailed data such as daily active users, retention rate, and revenue per user are not publicly available. Investors may need to indirectly assess MetaMask's performance through observable on-chain transaction volumes and industry benchmarks. Overall, MetaMask is ConsenSys's \"core asset,\" but given the regulatory scrutiny of its paid services, it has also become a focal point of risk. 2. Infura (Infrastructure / API Service) Service Content and Importance: Infura is a cloud-based API platform that allows developers and businesses to interact with Ethereum and other blockchains without running their own nodes. In fact, it is the \"technical backbone\" of countless dApps, providing reliable blockchain data reading and transaction broadcasting services. Not only does MetaMask connect to Infura by default, but well-known platforms such as Uniswap and OpenSea also manage their outsourced nodes through it. Infura's reliability was highlighted during the outage in November 2020: this interruption temporarily paralyzed Ethereum services, and some exchanges even suspended withdrawals, confirming its crucial role in the ecosystem. As of 2022, the Infura platform had over 430,000 developers as users, and its interface processed over $1 trillion in annualized on-chain transactions. Essentially, Infura is often likened to \"AWS of the Web3 world,\" providing scalable subscription-based blockchain infrastructure in a \"plug-and-play\" model. **Profit Model:** Infura employs a \"freemium\" SaaS model: developers can call a certain number of APIs for free; exceeding this limit or requiring commercial-grade reliability incurs a monthly fee. Public pricing shows a mid-range plan at approximately $50 per 200,000 requests per month, while enterprise customers can negotiate customized pricing for higher throughput and dedicated support. **Analysts estimate Infura's revenue using historical data:** For example, during the Ethereum boom of 2017, if Infura processed an average of 13 billion requests per day, at a combined rate of $45 per 200,000 requests, its annual revenue would be approximately $34 million. In 2022, Ethereum usage increased by approximately 83% compared to 2017, and Infura's annual revenue was projected to reach $60-65 million, becoming its second-largest revenue source after MetaMask. Furthermore, Infura's enterprise contracts (including SLAs and high-reliability zones) are likely to contribute stable recurring revenue. ConsenSys has revealed plans to decentralize the Infura architecture by collaborating with other cloud service providers and crypto companies to build a \"decentralized infrastructure network,\" but the revenue model will still be based on usage, potentially introducing a node provider market. Currently, there is limited publicly available data on Infura's profitability and profit margins, but given the nature of its software subscription model, its profit margin is likely high after deducting cloud hosting costs. Centralization Controversy: Infura's dominant position has also made it a focal point of the \"Ethereum decentralization debate.\" Critics point out that over 80% of Ethereum applications rely on Infura, which itself runs on traditional cloud servers (primarily AWS), posing a \"single point of failure\" and a potential bottleneck—Infura has previously imposed service restrictions in certain regions to comply with sanctions. ConsenSys acknowledges this issue and continues to push for service decentralization. In late 2023, Infura announced an early access program for its \"Infrastructure Provider Consortium Network,\" with companies like Microsoft and Tencent joining, aiming to allow multiple independent operators to run Infura nodes and prevent a single company or cloud service provider from controlling the service. However, as of 2025, Infura remained primarily centralized, which critics argue could weaken Ethereum's resilience or subject Infura to regulatory requirements for \"reviewing specific protocols.\" The upcoming IPO may bring the question of \"how ConsenSys balances Infura's commercial success with community expectations of decentralization\" into focus—a delicate balancing act where full decentralization could introduce new competitors or weaken company control. Market Competition: Infura faces fierce competition in the blockchain infrastructure space. Its most direct competitor is Alchemy—a venture-backed API provider valued at over $10 billion during the 2021 bull market, attracting significant funding and key clients with its \"more developer-friendly experience\" and \"multi-chain support.\" Other competitors include QuickNode, Blockdaemon, Ankr, Moralis, and cloud giants like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cloudflare Ethereum Gateway. Furthermore, many Ethereum projects choose to self-host nodes or use smaller providers to enhance control. Infura's differentiating advantages lie in its \"convenience\" and \"first-mover advantage\"—developers understand that \"Infura can support business expansion as it needs to operate stably.\" However, with the development of Web3, Infura needs to simultaneously contend with competition from \"well-funded centralized services\" and \"emerging decentralized solutions (such as Pocket Network, which incentivizes independent node operators to provide services).\" Price competition is also a significant factor; some competitors may vie for market share through low prices or customized solutions for specific chains. Currently, Infura remains the default infrastructure for Ethereum dApps, but after its IPO, investors will focus on its long-term competitiveness—especially if developers prioritize decentralization. Notably, MetaMask (ConsenSys' core application) connects to Infura by default, which constitutes a certain competitive barrier. ConsenSys may emphasize Infura's progress in areas such as \"reliability improvements,\" \"multi-chain and Layer 2 (L2) network support expansion,\" and \"servicing its own Linea network\" to solidify its advantage. Revenue and Data Transparency: Based on an estimated $60 million in revenue in 2022, Infura likely contributes 20%-30% of ConsenSys's total revenue. Compared to MetaMask's transaction fees, its revenue is more stable and closer to a subscription model, but it is still correlated with overall blockchain activity—Infura's revenue increases with dApp usage and on-chain transaction volume, and vice versa. Regarding data transparency, customer concentration is a key unknown: a few large clients (such as large NFT marketplaces or gaming projects) may account for a significant portion of usage. Investors will focus on the revenue contribution percentage from top clients and the likelihood of core clients churning (e.g., large exchanges or platforms deciding to run their own nodes). Furthermore, service availability commitments (e.g., uptime of 99.9%) and fault tolerance clauses will also be key areas of scrutiny—Infura's service track record is generally good but not perfect. Overall, Infura offers a highly predictable revenue stream with profit margins approaching those of cloud services, potentially commanding a higher premium in ConsenSys's sum-of-the-parts valuation approach. While SaaS and infrastructure companies typically enjoy high revenue multiple valuations, Infura's valuation may be adjusted due to the risks inherent in the crypto industry. 3. Linea (Layer 2 Network) Overview and Architecture: Linea is an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution launched by ConsenSys, based on Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) Rollup technology—an EVM-compatible zero-knowledge Rollup. Announced in 2023, the project launched its mainnet alpha test version in mid-2023. It batch-processes off-chain transactions using zero-knowledge proofs and submits validity proofs to the Ethereum mainnet (L1), achieving higher throughput and lower transaction fees while inheriting Ethereum's security. Linea is designed to be \"fully EVM equivalent,\" allowing developers to deploy existing Ethereum smart contracts to Linea without significant code modifications. During the testnet phase, Linea processed tens of millions of transactions; by the time the mainnet launched, over 100 dApps and partners had already built an ecosystem with it. **Ordering Mechanism:** Initially, Linea transactions are processed by a centralized orderer operated by ConsenSys. This is common in new Rollup projects, ensuring rapid confirmation and guaranteeing network reliability in the early stages. However, in the short term, users need to trust ConsenSys to handle transaction ordering and censorship resistance. ConsenSys has released a decentralized roadmap, planning to eventually introduce multiple orderers and community governance (possibly through the Linea Association and token issuance). As the network matures, permissionless ordering is expected to be implemented by 2025. **Cross-Chain Bridges and Security:** Linea has an official cross-chain bridge to the Ethereum mainnet, supporting asset transfers between L1 and L2. Under the Rollup architecture, user assets at L2 are ultimately protected by the Ethereum mainnet—if Linea's proof is valid and cannot be forged, Ethereum will enforce the withdrawal. However, in the early stages of a network, systems typically retain some administrator privileges or upgradeability. For example, ConsenSys briefly paused block generation to verify the system; such operations are common safeguards for on-chain security. Since its launch, Linea has not reported any major security incidents, but like all new Layer 2 networks, its complex zero-knowledge circuits (zk circuits) and fraud-proof mechanisms still require vigilance against vulnerabilities. ConsenSys' strategy is to \"align Linea with the Ethereum philosophy,\" with the most significant measure being the payment of 20% of Linea's net transaction fees in ETH and its burning on L1—a move intended to respond to criticism that \"Layer 2 networks are taking away Ethereum's transaction fee revenue,\" aligning with the economic model following Ethereum EIP 1559 and strengthening support for the value of the Ethereum mainnet. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Token Issuance and Incentives:</strong> In September 2025, ConsenSys announced the launch of the long-awaited LINEA token and its initial allocation plan. OTC trading showed a fully diluted valuation of approximately $2.7 billion, with the price stabilizing at around $0.027 after opening (the initial opening price was higher). </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The token issuance (TGE) includes three key allocations: 10% is airdropped to early Linea users and developers; 75% is allocated to the ecosystem fund for the network's long-term development; and the remaining 15% is presumably allocated to the team, investors, and the treasury, indicating that ConsenSys largely promotes community shareholding, with a relatively low percentage held by internal personnel. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Possible use cases for the LINEA token include: staking for future sorter roles, upgrading governance voting, and fee rebates.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> Prior to the token issuance, ConsenSys launched the \"Ignition Liquidity Mining Program\" from September to the end of October 2025, distributing 1 billion LINEA tokens (worth approximately $27 million at OTC prices) to users providing liquidity to designated Linea DeFi protocols. This program drove a surge in Linea usage, with total value locked (TVL) soaring from approximately $120 million in mid-2025 to a record high of $1.17 billion by the end of September. As of the end of October, even after the incentive program ended, TVL remained in the $1.1-1.2 billion range, indicating that its DeFi ecosystem had reached a certain scale (although some growth relied on short-term incentives). Revenue and Strategic Value: Linea currently generates negligible direct revenue. L2 transaction fees are designed to be very low, with the majority used to cover Ethereum data call costs and ETH burning. If ConsenSys retains a portion of the LINEA tokens, it might eventually generate value for ConsenSys itself, but given that 85% of the proceeds are used for ecosystem building and airdrops, this suggests that ConsenSys doesn't see Linea as a short-term profit center. Instead, Linea's value lies in its strategic significance. It positions ConsenSys in the scaling space, allowing it to attract users who may have migrated to other L2 platforms. It also hedges against platform risk. If Ethereum activity shifts to L2 platforms, ConsenSys now has a native foothold. MetaMask and Infura already serve other L2 platforms, but having Linea allows for deeper integration and the potential for future fee revenue, such as sequencer rewards. How ConsenSys will calculate the economics of Linea remains unclear. For example, if the Linea Association is established and the token is largely governed by it, ConsenSys may not integrate Linea metrics in the same way. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Enterprise and Other Products, Quorum, Codefi, etc.</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition to its flagship consumer and developer tools, ConsenSys also generates revenue through enterprise software and services. Its core product is ConsenSys Quorum, a private blockchain platform initially developed in partnership with JPMorgan Chase. Quorum is essentially an Ethereum-based ledger designed to meet enterprise needs, featuring access control, high throughput, and zero-knowledge privacy protection. Since acquiring Quorum from JPMorgan Chase in 2020, ConsenSys is now pushing it into the financial institutions and enterprise markets for applications such as interbank networks, asset tokenization, and central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilots. According to ConsenSys, Quorum is already used in approximately ten CBDC projects globally and has around 100 enterprise clients, including JPMorgan Chase for its JPM Coin network.</p> ... While each Quorum deployment may not generate recurring revenue like MetaMask or Infura, they typically bring in service contracts, support fees, or cloud hosting revenue. For example, ConsenSys might charge consulting fees for CBDC pilot projects or offer a quorum network hosted by the consortium on a subscription basis. Another important component is **Codefi**, a suite of fintech modules including payment, digital asset issuance, trading, and compliance tools, designed for institutions looking to leverage Ethereum. Codefi includes components such as Codefi Assets (for security or real estate tokenization), Codefi Payments, and Codefi Staking, the latter providing institutional-grade ETH2 staking services to clients. While these modules themselves aren't particularly noteworthy, they enable ConsenSys to offer full-stack solutions to enterprises that typically start with Quorum and then need to build applications on top of it. ConsenSys' professional services (consulting) also integrates these tools. For example, they helped a commodity exchange build a tokenized market using the Quorum ledger and Codefi Assets. Furthermore, ConsenSys also owns MetaMask Institutional (MMI), a service that connects its consumer and enterprise-level offerings. MMI enables institutions such as crypto funds or trading platforms to use MetaMask's interface and integrate it with custody solutions like Fireblocks, BitGo, or self-custody via multi-signature, allowing fund managers to access DeFi while meeting custody and compliance requirements. ConsenSys may generate revenue through enterprise licensing of MMI or partnerships with custody providers (where both parties may share customer access fees). This also facilitates cross-selling. Institutions using MMI to access DeFi may also use Infura's infrastructure and Quorum's private projects, further expanding ConsenSys's wallet share. Custody partnerships extend beyond MMI. For example, ConsenSys partners with fintech companies and banks to conduct institutional staking business, with ConsenSys providing the technology and the partners handling the custody. They also have a security auditing division, ConsenSys Diligence, which provides smart contract auditing services. This is a smaller but reputable division that generates service fees and allows ConsenSys to participate in emerging projects. Revenue and Importance: Revenue from enterprise-level products and other products is relatively opaque and may only account for a small portion of total revenue. Analysis indicates that ConsenSys has many other projects besides MetaMask and Infura, but only these two truly stand out in terms of scale. Nevertheless, the amounts involved in enterprise-level transactions can be substantial. For example, a large project, such as a central bank or a major bank using Quorum, could involve collaborations worth millions of dollars. Because this revenue comes from strategic IT budgets and long-term projects, it is likely to be more stable and less correlated with cryptocurrency market volatility. The $65 million raised by ConsenSys in 2021, primarily led by JPMorgan Chase, Mastercard, and UBS, demonstrates the company's close ties with financial institutions. These relationships could potentially translate into business ventures in the future (for example, Mastercard partnered with ConsenSys to develop a blockchain-based payment system). IPO Mechanism: ConsenSys's path to an IPO appears to be taking shape. A report in October 2025 stated that the company had hired JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs as lead advisors for its IPO. While many details remain undisclosed, we can outline the anticipated mechanisms and background for a ConsenSys IPO. Timing and Location: The involvement of top banks suggests that ConsenSys's targeted IPO could take place in 2026, provided market conditions remain stable. All indications suggest that ConsenSys is considering a US listing, potentially on Nasdaq (primarily for tech stocks) or the New York Stock Exchange, to access the US capital markets. The listing timeline may be subject to change. The cryptocurrency market rebounded in 2025 after a two-year bear market, and peers like Circle and Bullish reportedly went public in early 2025. However, market volatility is inherent, so ConsenSys and its bankers will closely monitor market timing. Filing a listing application in mid-2026 and listing later that year seems reasonable, but a filing earlier, at the end of 2025, is not impossible if market momentum is strong. A traditional IPO approach, including book-building and primary market financing, is most likely. A direct listing is less probable, as ConsenSys may want to raise new capital for growth and provide liquidity for long-term shareholders and employees. SPAC mergers were popular in 2021 but are no longer favored, and given ConsenSys' size and investor base, it doesn't need to take that route. **Use of Proceeds and Offering Size:** ConsenSys was valued at $7 billion in its last private placement, and based on its revenue growth trajectory, its IPO valuation could be similar or higher. If revenue reaches $200-300 million by 2025, a valuation of several billion dollars is reasonable. This IPO may issue approximately 10-15% of the company's shares, which is common in tech IPOs, meaning hundreds of millions of dollars in proceeds. For example, if the company's valuation reaches $5 billion or higher, the proceeds could reach $500 million or more. The proceeds will likely be used for further product development, particularly the growth of Linea and the development of MetaMask functionality, as well as strategic acquisitions. Other uses include regulatory compliance resources and international expansion. Founder Joseph Lubin may also use this liquidity event to diversify some of his holdings while maintaining a major shareholder position post-IPO. <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Related Comparisons</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">ConsenSys covers multiple areas, so it's necessary to use a sum-of-parts approach.</p><ul class=\"list-paddingleft-2\"><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Coinbase:</strong>Among cryptocurrency-native companies, Coinbase is the closest publicly known competitor to MetaMask. Coinbase is primarily an exchange, with revenue derived from transaction fees, but it also provides a benchmark for investors on how to assess a large cryptocurrency user base and trading revenue. Its price-to-sales ratio has fluctuated roughly between 3 and 10 times across various market cycles. Coinbase went public in 2021 via a direct listing, with a market capitalization approaching $80 billion at the time, which fell below $10 billion during the bear market before rebounding in 2025 as trading volume increased. Coinbase's profit margins and growth can serve as a reference for valuing MetaMask's transaction fees. It's important to note that Coinbase is subject to more direct regulation and has a more mature profit model, while MetaMask's profit model is still in its early stages, but with significant profit potential. Circle: The issuer of USDC. Circle reportedly went public in 2025. Its business model is unique, with revenue primarily derived from reserves and interest payments. As a high-profile crypto infrastructure company, Circle's products are regulatory compliant, and its price-to-earnings ratio could reach 5 to 8 times, depending on growth and interest rate dynamics. This sets a benchmark for infrastructure companies in the cryptocurrency space. Blockchain Infrastructure and Fintech: Developer platforms and cloud infrastructure are valuable references for components like Infura. Companies like Twilio, which are API-driven, or networks like Cloudflare, which rely on usage, typically have P/E ratios in the high single digits to low double digits when experiencing rapid growth. Broader fintech companies like Robinhood (HOOD) signal cryptocurrency access for retail users, with P/E ratios typically only a few times, reflecting slower growth and improving profitability. Other cryptocurrency companies, such as Galaxy Digital, Bakkt, and cryptocurrency miners, are less similar to Bullish and generally have lower P/E ratios due to factors like earnings cyclicality, balance sheet complexity, or SPAC equity dilution. If Bullish does go public in 2025, its valuation and trading performance will provide further insight, although Bullish's business focuses more on exchanges than infrastructure or wallets. </p></li></ul><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Strategic Narrative and Moat</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">ConsenSys' strategic narrative, the story it will tell investors, hinges on becoming an indispensable toolkit for Web3. It positions itself as an integrated platform with a strong competitive advantage, rather than a collection of decentralized crypto projects.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">MetaMask Distribution Flywheel</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">MetaMask's massive user base is at the heart of ConsenSys' moat. This distributed advantage has a self-reinforcing effect: because MetaMask is the default wallet for millions of users, developers optimize for it when launching new decentralized applications, which in turn makes MetaMask crucial for users. This provides ConsenSys with unparalleled insight and access to the Web3 user base. In fact, ConsenSys is able to identify emerging trends early and build related features or derivatives faster than its competitors.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"> MetaMask also acts as a conduit for other products. When users interact through MetaMask, they indirectly access Infura's default endpoint, driving traffic to Infura and creating cross-selling opportunities, such as driving advanced developers to upgrade to paid tiers or institutional users to use MMI. Network effects protect MetaMask, and cross-chain support further strengthens this moat. ConsenSys will emphasize that MetaMask is a platform, not just a wallet. Integrations such as exchange, staking, and other advanced features indicate that MetaMask is evolving into a full-service portal for Web3. If MetaMask becomes an app store or browser for decentralized applications (dApps), ConsenSys can profit from this central position by charging fees or establishing partnerships. The argument is that MetaMask's widespread adoption is difficult to replicate, giving ConsenSys a lasting competitive advantage similar to early internet browsers, making it an indispensable entry point for other applications. <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Infrastructure L2 Integration</h3></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">ConsenSys's advantage lies in its simultaneous control of the interface layer (wallet) and infrastructure layer (nodes and Layer 2 networks). This vertical integration provides flexibility and distribution advantages. Linea can be accessed with a single click within MetaMask, a feature not available from other Layer 2 network providers. Infura can be optimized to work seamlessly with Linea, providing developers with a seamless technology stack. Controlling both the client and infrastructure helps reduce latency and failure rates from wallet to node, something single-point solutions struggle to achieve. Furthermore, MetaMask's broad neutrality is a key factor in its success. ConsenSys may be able to maintain open support for multiple networks while offering subtle user experience advantages for its own network where appropriate. This is similar to Apple's approach of allowing other music apps to access the platform while integrating more deeply into its own app—a gentle guidance rather than a forced lock-in.</p> ... Platform Risk Mitigation A key narrative thread is reducing reliance on third-party platforms. The desktop version of MetaMask relies on browser extensions, while the mobile version depends on app stores and their rules. Infura has historically relied on cloud service providers. ConsenSys will emphasize resilience: availability across multiple browsers, providing standalone versions when necessary, and pushing Infura towards greater decentralization to avoid single points of failure. Investments in lightweight clients, hardware wallet integration, and diverse infrastructure providers support this. At the political and institutional level, ConsenSys has established a strong reputation among corporate and policy stakeholders. This position can be seen as a moat, making it more difficult for the platform or regulators to marginalize its product. Neutrality and Fee Extraction (Linea and Others) ConsenSys carefully balances neutrality with value extraction. Historically, it has tended to remain neutral: MetaMask supports multiple networks, Infura supports competitor chains, and Linea aligns with Ethereum's philosophy. As a business, ConsenSys will seek to monetize its position, such as by encouraging token swaps within MetaMask or, where appropriate, by profiting from Linea's usage. If it goes too far, advanced users might migrate to more decentralized alternatives. ConsenSys's message to investors might be: it has built a healthy moat, uses influence prudently, builds trust through neutrality, and users choose ConsenSys services based on the value of the service itself. MetaMask's support for Arbitrum and Optimism, and Linea, are prime examples. Trust and reputation are the true moats, and maintaining them is a strategic priority. <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Innovation and Developer Moat</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">ConsenSys will emphasize its role as an innovator and standard setter in the Ethereum space.</p> ... The company boasts a core development team that implements security practices through ConsenSys Diligence and contributes to critical projects such as staking infrastructure. This close connection to protocol evolution allows it to gain early insight and exert influence. If account abstraction becomes the standard, ConsenSys is fully capable of quickly adapting to MetaMask. For businesses and governments, long-term development and brand reputation are crucial, and ConsenSys' past performance demonstrates both. <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Conclusion</h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Details of the ConsenSys IPO are being finalized: major banks have joined, the target listing date is 2026, the company plans to list in the US, and the valuation is expected to reach billions of dollars (referencing companies like Coinbase). A successful listing depends on ConsenSys demonstrating a clear financial position (especially in terms of revenue composition) and convincing investors that it possesses a solid competitive advantage and a prospect of continued growth, rather than being subject to the cyclical fluctuations of the cryptocurrency market.</p> The next key focus will be on the formal disclosure of listing documents and the resolution of regulatory issues that may affect the IPO. In summary, ConsenSys positions itself as a platform providing comprehensive support for Web3 construction, similar to having a browser (MetaMask), a cloud layer (Infura), and a scalable web (Linea). Its competitive advantage stems from its deep ecosystem embedding, high switching costs for users and developers, strong network effects, and a delicate balance between maintaining neutrality and achieving profitability. As the Web3 user base continues to expand, ConsenSys is expected to capture value at multiple levels while consolidating the open ecosystem that underpins its long-term success.</div></div>",

            "title": "Behind the Tax Investigation of Hundreds of Binance Users",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Recently, Indian tax authorities are investigating over 400 high-net-worth individuals trading on Binance, suspected of evading substantial taxes levied on cryptocurrency transactions between 2022-23 and 2024-25. India imposes a 1% withholding tax and a 30% profit tax on cryptocurrency traders, with an effective tax rate potentially as high as 42.7%, which may be one of the motivations for this group to evade taxes. This investigation stems from a series of Binance activities in India: after paying a $2.25 million fine and registering as a \"reporting entity\" with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), Binance re-entered the Indian market in August 2024. This allows Binance to share information on suspected tax evaders with the Indian government. Furthermore, the investigation also covers peer-to-peer (P2P) payments settled through Indian domestic bank accounts or Google Pay.</p> According to local sources, tax authorities in various cities have been required to report on their investigations by October 17, 2025. This investigation, initiated by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) of India, examines the transaction records, settlement details, and wallet flows of certain Binance users during the 2022-2023 and 2024-2025 fiscal years, as well as settlements made through Indian local bank accounts or third-party payment applications in Binance P2P transactions. If these traders are found to have failed to fulfill necessary reporting obligations, a reassessment process may be triggered, potentially leading to penalties under Section 270A of the Indian Income Tax Act. Failure to properly disclose cryptocurrency acquired from foreign platforms or wallets may result in penalties under the Indian Black Money Act. As for how the Binance user's tax evasion that triggered the investigation occurred and how it was discovered, we need to look at India's crypto tax system and regulatory framework. The high cryptocurrency tax rate, stringent tax reporting requirements, and flawed crypto regulatory system in India have created motivation and space for users to evade taxes, while increasingly convenient transaction information sharing channels have greatly facilitated the Indian tax authorities in tracking these tax evasion activities. 1. Overview of India's Crypto Tax System\n1.1 Introduction\nSince 2022, India has classified cryptocurrencies as Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) under its Income Tax Act, implementing a strict tax system: Source Deduction (TDS) and crypto tax are the main taxes related to cryptocurrencies. A 1% TDS applies to each cryptocurrency transfer, and a fixed 30% tax rate applies to crypto capital gains, plus additional taxes and fees. After comprehensive calculation, the actual tax rate borne by high-net-worth individuals can be as high as 42%. 1.2 Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) According to the Indian Income Tax Act, for the transfer of cryptocurrencies, traders are required to pay a 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS). If the transfer transaction takes place on an Indian exchange, the TDS will be deducted by the exchange and paid to the tax authorities; if the transaction occurs on a P2P platform or an overseas exchange, the buyer is obligated to deduct the TDS. If the transaction is a cryptocurrency swap, a 1% TDS will be levied on both the buyer and seller. In addition, some transfers are exempt from TDS, such as transferring cryptocurrency between one's own wallets, receiving cryptocurrency gifts worth less than RS50,000, or receiving cryptocurrency gifts of any amount from immediate family members. 1.3 Crypto Tax In addition to source deductions, India levies a 30% crypto tax on profits earned from cryptocurrency trading, allowing no deductions beyond costs or loss offsets (Income Tax Act §115BBH). Specific transaction scenarios covered by the crypto tax include: selling cryptocurrency for Indian RS or other fiat currencies; using cryptocurrency for crypto transactions, including stablecoins; using cryptocurrency to pay for goods and services; etc. However, in some cases, cryptocurrency trading profits may be treated as other income by the tax authorities and levied as personal income tax rather than the crypto tax, such as receiving cryptocurrency gifts, cryptocurrency mining, paying wages in cryptocurrency, staking rewards, airdrops, etc. If these cryptocurrencies are subsequently sold, traded, or used, the resulting profits may be subject to the 30% crypto tax. 2. Dynamics of Crypto Tax Regulation in India\n2.1 Regulatory Agencies\nCurrently, India does not have a dedicated regulatory body for crypto regulation. Instead, it relies on the existing institutional framework, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEBI), the Tax Authority under the Ministry of Finance, and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) implementing regulation within their respective jurisdictions. The RBI and SEBI focus on cryptocurrencies in the payment system and security tokens, respectively. The FIU is primarily responsible for anti-money laundering and reporting obligations, while the Tax Authority (mainly the Central Committee for Direct Taxes, CBDT) is responsible for cryptocurrency-related taxes.\n2.2 Regulatory Trends and Dynamics\nIn recent years, India's crypto tax regulation has evolved from strict restrictions to gradual adjustments. Initially, the RBI adopted a highly cautious approach to cryptocurrencies, issuing a warning about speculative risks in 2013. In 2018, the RBI banned banks from transacting with crypto companies, attempting to restrict market development through financial means. However, this ban was strongly opposed by industry institutions and market participants, and was ultimately ruled unconstitutional by the Indian Supreme Court in 2020. In 2022, India's fiscal budget for the first time included cryptocurrencies and other virtual assets within the scope of legal regulation, establishing a series of crypto tax policies, including the aforementioned TDS and crypto tax. This initial establishment of a tax system provided a compliance basis for the industry. In 2025, the new fiscal budget further strengthened the regulation of crypto tax reporting and information disclosure. While it did not fundamentally reform the existing tax system, it imposed new requirements on crypto market participants. The new budget introduces Section 285BAA in the Income Tax Act, further expanding the scope of regulation and requiring certain entities to report crypto transactions within specified timeframes. It also broadens the definition of VDAs to include all blockchain-based crypto assets in the tax framework and imposes stricter penalties on undeclared VDAs, classifying them as \"undeclared income\" and imposing fines of up to 70%, without any exemptions or reductions. In short, the 2025 tax reform continues the existing VDA tax system and further strengthens cross-entity information sharing. These regulations will officially take effect in April 2026. In addition to tax policy adjustments, the Indian government is also gradually improving its rules within the framework of anti-money laundering laws, allowing global cryptocurrency exchanges to operate locally after registration and placing them under the constraints of anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) regulations. On March 7, 2023, the Indian Ministry of Finance issued a notice clarifying that activities related to VDA exchange, transfer, issuance, or sale were now subject to the Anti-Money Laundering Act (PMLA, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002). Under this act, service providers (VDA SPs) operating in India (both offshore and onshore) engaged in cryptocurrency business must register as reporting entities with the Financial Information Unit (FIU) and comply with a series of legal obligations under the PMLA, including reporting and record keeping. In late 2023, Binance, along with eight other exchanges, was banned from operating in India due to FIU accusations of non-compliance with the PMLA. After paying a $2.25 million fine and registering as a reporting entity with the FIU, Binance re-entered the Indian market in August 2024. 3. Summary of the Event: High Tax Burden May Be a Motivation for Tax Evasion Under India's current crypto tax system, cryptocurrency traders may need to pay a 1% TDS and a 30% crypto tax (plus surcharges and additional fees) for crypto asset transactions and transfers. This high tax rate forces many high-net-worth traders to turn to offshore platforms like Binance, attempting to exploit regulatory loopholes to conceal cryptocurrency profits and evade taxes. However, this large-scale investigation by the Indian tax authorities reveals that such tax evasion opportunities will gradually shrink in the future. In fact, as early as June 2025, the Indian tax authorities sent reminder emails to thousands of violators engaged in crypto transactions who failed to file tax returns, requiring them to correct their tax returns promptly. Furthermore, Binance's registration with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) in India facilitates oversight by tax authorities: Based on PMLA requirements, Binance, as a FIU reporting entity, is required to establish customer due diligence and record-keeping processes, improve internal controls, fulfill its obligation to report suspicious transactions, and share information about suspected tax evaders with the tax authorities. However, on the other hand, information sharing from Binance opens the door for Indian tax authorities to track previously hidden wallets and transactions, enabling them to effectively track and combat tax evasion activities. This also means that amidst the wave of compliance among crypto companies, represented by leading exchanges, issues such as crypto asset tax evasion and even money laundering will face greater exposure risks. How to protect one's crypto wealth in a compliant manner may become a focus of attention for investors for a long time to come.</div></div>",

            "title": "Besides memes, what other projects should x402 pay attention to?",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div>To understand x402, we need to start with a \"legacy feature\" that has been shelved for nearly thirty years. As early as 1997, the HTTP protocol reserved the status code 402, representing \"payment required.\" However, due to the lack of feasible payment methods, it was abandoned. Now, with the maturity of crypto-native stablecoins, L2 cryptocurrencies reducing payment costs, and the rise of AI agents creating real demand for micropayments, Coinbase has leveraged this \"long-dormant button\" to launch the x402 protocol: allowing anyone or AI to complete on-chain payments when accessing paid content without registering an account or being redirected to another page. What appears to be a simple \"automatic payment\" system actually involves a completely rebuilt ecosystem. From protocol standards to infrastructure and upper-layer applications, x402 has the potential to reshape the payment logic of the internet. This article will delve into this emerging x402 ecosystem to examine what protocols, chains, infrastructure, and applications, besides Meme, are actually functioning. <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410208_image3.png\" type=\"block\"/></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong mpa-from-tpl=\"t\"><span color:=\"\" css-1jxf684=\"\" font-size:=\"\" leaf=\"\" line-height:=\"\" margin-bottom:=\"\" margin-top:=\"\" padding-left:=\"\" padding-right:=\"\" r-1ttztb7=\"\" r-bcqeeo=\"\" r-qvutc0=\"\">Protocol Layer: Enabling AI Agents to Make Payments</span></strong></h2><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">The x402 protocol layer is not a single standard, but a set of modular combinations that solve three key problems: AI Agents How to communicate, how to make payments, and how to establish identity and trust. The core of this is the x402 protocol itself. Based on the HTTP 402 status code design, it allows AI to automatically receive payment requests when accessing paid content or APIs, and complete on-chain transfers using stablecoins such as USDC. The entire process requires no registration and no redirection. To enable collaboration between AIs, Google proposed the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol to standardize communication and task handover between agents. Anthropic also launched the MCP protocol to provide AI with access tools and contextual data interfaces. Building upon MCP, Google further released the AP2 payment protocol, enabling AI Agents to invoke services on demand and complete automatic payments, while remaining compatible with traditional payments and x402. The key to the implementation of these protocols is Ethereum's EIP-3009 extension. It allows users to authorize token transfers via signatures without paying gas fees, solving the payment problem of \"no ETH in the AI ​​wallet.\" Complementing this is the ERC-8004, currently under development. This system establishes an on-chain identity and reputation system for AI agents, recording execution records and trust scores to help service providers determine the reliability of agents. In summary, the x402 protocol layer is gradually building a \"language + currency + trust\" system for AI, enabling AI agents to complete transactions, collaborations, and payments without human intervention. This is the first step towards the successful operation of the entire ecosystem. The x402 protocol defines the solution, but what truly makes it work is a whole infrastructure layer responsible for verifying requests, completing payments, coordinating services, and linking AI with the blockchain. First up is Cloudflare (@Cloudflare). As a global cloud platform, it co-founded the x402 Foundation with Coinbase and integrated its protocol into its CDN nodes and development tools. Cloudflare not only provides a global distribution network but also supports a \"use resources first, pay later\" deferred payment mechanism, helping AI Agents smoothly acquire content and complete settlements. Next is the x402 Facilitator, a payment aggregator (comprising multiple projects), responsible for helping the AI ​​agent complete a series of on-chain processes including payment processing, settlement, and broadcasting. Users or the AI ​​only need to initiate an HTTP 402 request, and the Facilitator will pay the gas, package the transaction, and complete the on-chain broadcast. The settlement process uses the EIP-3009 standard, allowing for one-time authorization of USDC deductions. The entire process does not require the AI ​​to hold tokens or manually sign, greatly simplifying on-chain interaction. According to the data in the chart below, Coinbase (@coinbase) remains the largest facilitator, processing over 1.35 million transactions and covering 80,000 buyers; PayAI (@PayAINetwork) ranks second, active on chains such as Solana and Base, with a cumulative transaction volume of $280,000 and even more users than Coinbase. Others such as X402rs, Thirdweb (@thirdweb), and Open X402 (@openx402) are also vying for market share. In addition to Facilitator, a \"native settlement blockchain\" has emerged, specifically built for x402. A representative project is Kite AI (@GoKiteAI), one of the first Layer 1 blockchains to fully embed the x402 payment primitives into the underlying layer, and it has received support from institutions such as Coinbase Ventures and PayPal Ventures. It does not directly handle payment verification (not a facilitator), but rather provides an execution and settlement environment for x402 transactions, supporting agents to automatically initiate, receive, and reconcile on-chain payments through standardized authorization instructions. At the execution level, besides Kite AI, a native chain designed for AI payments, Peaq (@peaq) in the DePIN space is also playing a key role. Peaq is a public chain focused on the machine economy and natively supports the x402 protocol, enabling automatic payments and settlements between devices and between agents. The representative project of the x402 collaboration layer is Questflow (@questflow). Developers can publish proxy tasks on it, set prices, and complete on-chain settlement directly through x402. It has already cooperated with Virtuals, Gate, etc. In addition, there are AurraCloud (@AurraCloud) and Meridian (@mrdn_finance), which provide multi-chain settlement and custody services using the x402 protocol. In summary, the x402 infrastructure layer is being built around three core issues: how to send requests, how to securely receive payments, and how to quickly deploy payments across different chains. These factors determine whether the entire payment system can truly function. Application Layer: What applications actually use x402? </span><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">The x402 protocol and infrastructure are set up, but we still need to see if the application layer is active.

Firecrawl (@firecrawl_dev): A web scraping and cleaning API that converts websites into LLM-compatible data, using x402 for pay-per-use. Overall, x402's application layer is still being explored, and its functional platform is just starting out. It hasn't yet achieved economies of scale, and it remains to be seen who can first create a truly usable, payable, and reusable product. </span></span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong mpa-from-tpl=\"t\"><span color:=\"\" css-1jxf684=\"\" font-size:=\"\" leaf=\"\" line-height:=\"\" margin-bottom:=\"\" margin-top:=\"\" padding-left:=\"\" padding-right:=\"\" r-1ttztb7=\"\" r-bcqeeo=\"\" r-qvutc0=\"\">Meme: Price and popularity fluctuate greatly</span></strong></h2><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">As the popularity of x402-related concepts rises, a number of native meme projects that \"piggyback\" on the narrative have quickly emerged in the market. The most representative of these is PING, issued on the Base chain.</span></span><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\"> On its launch day, its market capitalization quickly surpassed ten million US dollars. Besides PING, tokens like \"PENG\" and \"x402\" have also emerged in the community. These meme tokens do not currently constitute the core of the protocol, but they can provide attention, buzz, and early-stage liquidity. What challenges does x402 still face after the protocol's implementation? While the x402 concept is eye-catching, its practical implementation faces several challenges. First, there's a lack of truly usable products. Most projects are currently in the testnet or proof-of-concept phase, resulting in a rough user experience. Second, the technology stack is complex and integration costs are high. x402 involves a new protocol integrating multiple modules such as payment, signature transfers, and proxy communication, posing a significant barrier to entry for developers. Third, there are compliance risks. While its main selling point is \"account-free, no-redirect payment,\" and it boasts high efficiency, it bypasses the KYC/AML requirements of traditional payment systems, potentially raising regulatory concerns in some regions. Fourth, the network effect has not yet been formed. The core of payment protocols lies in ecosystem collaboration, but currently, few services and platforms have integrated x402, and the ecosystem has not yet formed a self-sustaining cycle. In summary, x402 is still some distance from \"large-scale use,\" and several hurdles need to be overcome from technology to real-world implementation. From a participation perspective, the long-term opportunities for x402 lie more in the deployment of infrastructure and key platforms. First, there's the base chain and infrastructure. x402's core relies on Ethereum ecosystem standards such as EIP-3009 and ERC-8004, while Base is currently the most important blockchain for implementation, boasting a strong stablecoin closed loop and a friendly development environment, and is expected to incubate leading products first. Solana also has advantages in high-frequency payments, making it suitable for agent microtransaction scenarios. Secondly, there's the native settlement blockchain Kite AI, and payment aggregators and service platforms such as PayAI, Meridian, and AurraCloud. These are responsible for verifying payments, handling gas, and connecting to APIs; once a universal entry point is established, their value will rapidly amplify. As for the token side, caution is advised. Currently, x402-related tokens have small market capitalization and high volatility, and many meme tokens are still in the narrative-driven stage. Projects with genuine payment implementation or platform value are more worthy of attention. </span></span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong mpa-from-tpl=\"t\"><span color:=\"\" css-1jxf684=\"\" font-size:=\"\" leaf=\"\" line-height:=\"\" margin-bottom:=\"\" margin-top:=\"\" padding-left:=\"\" padding-right:=\"\" r-1ttztb7=\"\" r-bcqeeo=\"\" r-qvutc0=\"\">KOL Perspective</span></strong></h2><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">In the current climate of divergent market opinions, the views of many leading Builders and KOLs on the x402 ecosystem are also worth noting.</span></span></p></li></ul></span></p></div></div>",

            "title": "Tether's path to mainstream payments begins with digital asset \"tipping\".",
            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Tether seems to have never been content with being just a \"stablecoin company.\" Recently, it announced with video platform Rumble that it will launch a digital asset tipping feature for its 51 million monthly active users this December—users can tip content creators through Rumble Wallet. At first glance, this seems like just a product feature, but in reality, it marks a crucial step for Tether towards \"mainstream payments.\"</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For a long time, the influence of digital assets has primarily existed at the exchange and over-the-counter settlement levels, rather than in the daily consumption of end users. Now, through a platform like Rumble, which possesses strong creator economy attributes, Tether has gained a unique \"entry point,\" allowing tens of millions of ordinary users to directly access and use digital assets.</p> Rumble's user base is primarily in North America. While these users aren't typical crypto enthusiasts, they have a strong interest in \"independent speech\" and \"anti-censorship\" content, creating a natural resonance for crypto payments. For Rumble, this mechanism incentivizes creators, allowing the platform to move beyond traditional advertising and subscription revenue structures. For Tether, it means it's no longer reliant on transaction-driven liquidity but is beginning to embed its stablecoin into the fundamental activities of the internet economy. Paolo Ardoino stated in an interview that Tether hopes to use the Rumble platform to bring stablecoins and Bitcoin to mainstream American users, ultimately making its compliant stablecoin, USAT, a digital payment tool for 100 million Americans. In fact, as early as 2024, Tether invested $775 million in Rumble, with some funds used for stock buybacks and others for content and cloud business expansion. This means that Tether is not simply buying an external payment channel, but rather building an ecosystem fulcrum—using capital, technology, and content to jointly promote the \"usability\" of stablecoins. Unlike earlier attempts by content platforms, this innovation does not involve building a completely new internal points system, but rather allows existing mainstream digital assets to directly participate in the content economy. In the past, projects like Steemit proposed the concept of \"content as mining,\" but because their incentive assets were disconnected from the real-world payment system, users found it difficult to use their earnings for actual consumption. The partnership between Rumble and Tether is closer to real-world economic logic: allowing creators to directly receive widely circulated digital assets, truly realizing \"creation equals income, income equals usability.\" Meanwhile, traditional tech companies are also exploring similar paths. For example, Meta was reportedly researching embedding stablecoin payment functionality into the Facebook and WhatsApp ecosystems, hoping to support user-to-user transfers and creator payments through its own wallet. Although these attempts are still in their early stages, the direction is consistent—to move digital assets away from exchange scenarios and into real-world value transfers between people. This is precisely the key significance of the Tether and Rumble partnership: giving stablecoin payments a social function, rather than just being a financial tool. Unlike other payment systems, Tether's integration at the technology and ecosystem levels is more thorough. It didn't wait for external regulation or payment system support; instead, it proactively created its own scenarios. Through the Rumble wallet, it controls both payment channels and user relationships; through the Rumble content ecosystem, it transforms USDT from a settlement asset into a \"creator economy payment medium\"; and through USAT, it provides a potential compliant vehicle for this model. For Tether, this is not just business expansion, but a reshaping of its position—it aims to grow from a \"shadow of the dollar\" into a \"bridge for digital payments.\" This strategy is crucial because Tether has long been considered the \"behind-the-scenes bank\" of the global digital asset market, yet has consistently lacked a user-facing \"front-end product.\" The launch of Rumble wallet will change this. If users can use Rumble wallet daily for small donations, content payments, or creator settlements, Tether's position will shift from infrastructure to an application-layer payment brand—similar to PayPal's role in the e-commerce ecosystem. Regardless of whether Meta's payment experiment succeeds, or whether exchanges like Binance and OKX attempt to attract users to Web3 wallets with social or content modules, one thing is certain: the future of digital assets lies not in trading, but in payments. Tether's advantage lies in its robust financial reserves and asset structure. According to Tether's transparency report in September of this year, over 85% of its reserves are short-term US Treasury bonds and cash equivalents, with total assets exceeding $117 billion. This size is sufficient to support large-scale expansion of payments and settlements, meaning it possesses liquidity and resilience far exceeding its competitors. For Tether, the outcome of this game is no longer about competing for stablecoin market share, but rather who can be the first to control the \"gateway to crypto payments.\" In this new era of content and payment convergence, Tether is attempting to become that gateway itself.</div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\">A funny thing is that this afternoon, the most frequent questions I received weren't about the US-China negotiations, but about this news from a certain financial media outlet:</span><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Starting December 1st, all principal payments on maturing US Treasury bonds will be rolled over.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span leaf=\"\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410214_image3.png\" type=\"block\"/></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">1. What does this mean?</span></span></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Answer: It means stopping the quantitative tightening. The FOMC announced this this morning. No new information.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\"> This is a minor translation error. The original text is \"beginning in December 2025, to roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities.\" In Chinese, \"rollover\" can refer to both a creditor's proactive renewal of maturing loans (continuing to lend money to the debtor after maturity) and a debtor's debt restructuring or extension of repayment periods. The two meanings are completely opposite. Here, \"rollover\" refers to the former. Because the Federal Reserve's balance sheet reduction method is \"not renewing maturing Treasury securities,\" not reducing the balance sheet means the Federal Reserve \"automatically renewing maturing Treasury securities.\" 2. How does the Federal Reserve actually \"stop reducing its balance sheet\"? For US Treasury bonds, this means re-auctioning upon maturity. In practice, the Federal Reserve will repurchase the equivalent principal amount of maturing US Treasury bonds in this month's Treasury bond auction using a non-competitive method; this is called \"add-on.\" Regarding Agency MBS, Powell clearly stated today that the proceeds from maturing MBS will be reinvested in short-term debt (Tbills). The ultimate goals are: 1) The Federal Reserve will only hold US Treasury bonds and not MBS; 2) The average duration of the US Treasury bonds held by the Federal Reserve (approximately 9 years) will gradually converge with the average duration of the outstanding US Treasury bonds in the market (approximately 6 years). 3. What asset implications does stopping balance sheet reduction have? For major asset classes, it's negligible. Those who truly need to care about the pace of balance sheet reduction are money market and derivatives market players, such as money market fund managers or traders doing FF-SOFR spreads or swap spreads. For 99% of investors, whether the Fed stops reducing its balance sheet, and where it stops, is purely redundant information. This is because the pace of balance sheet reduction primarily affects overnight interbank lending rates; even in the event of a brief liquidity crunch, its impact on major asset prices is almost zero. A case in point is the liquidity crunch of September 17, 2019. SOFR rates surged to around 5%, but US stocks and bonds showed almost no reaction. </span></span></p></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"share___SVvtl\"><div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Author: Becca Bratcher, Forbes &amp; Translation: Saoirse, Foresight News</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">From multi-billion dollar hacks to a presidential-level Meme coin launch, 2025 has been a year of thorny entanglements with politics and power, both fraught with anxiety and highly revealing for the cryptocurrency space. As the fourth quarter of 2025 unfolds, five moments stand out—profoundly demonstrating how the cryptocurrency industry continues to test the boundaries of public trust and regulatory tolerance.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/842-1761792989918?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Bitcoin hit a new all-time high in 2025, but the industry remains deeply mired in controversy.</em></p> (Image illustration: Miguel Candela / SOPA Images/LightRocket, courtesy of Getty Images) January: Trump's Meme Coin Makes its Debut At the start of 2025, an unexpected move by the US president-elect drew attention. Just hours before his inauguration, Donald Trump launched his official Meme coin, TRUMP. The token initially sold for around $1, briefly surging to over $70 before plummeting. Shortly after, First Lady Melania Trump launched her own token, MELANIA, whose price fluctuations mirrored those of TRUMP. Currently, TRUMP is trading around $7, while MELANIA hovers around $0.13. These tokens were marketed as \"celebrated digital collectibles,\" but their launch immediately sparked questions about their ethics and legality. Previously dismissive of cryptocurrencies, Trump has now repositioned himself as an industry \"supporter\"—actively courting the growing voter base in the cryptocurrency space and promising to make the US a global digital asset hub. Meanwhile, his family business, World Liberty Financial, has expanded its cryptocurrency operations. Within hours, the combined market capitalization of these two Meme coins approached $11 billion, turning what was initially a simple political branding campaign into the first major controversy in the cryptocurrency industry in 2025. February: The Largest Financial Theft in History. Just one month later, public trust in the security of cryptocurrencies suffered a severe blow. Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit disclosed that hackers stole approximately $1.5 billion worth of ETH from one of its offline cold wallets. This unprecedented security breach panicked investors, and blockchain analytics firm Elliptic subsequently confirmed that it was the largest single theft on record in both digital and traditional finance. Subsequent investigations revealed that the data breach was linked to a hacking group supported by the North Korean government. This discovery instantly added geopolitical seriousness to what might have been categorized as a \"regular exchange security vulnerability.\" In May: US President Rewards Top TRUMP Meme Coin Buyers. In May, news triggered a \"small but significant\" surge in TRUMP Meme coin trading volume—President Trump announced that he would only invite top holders of TRUMP tokens to a formal dinner at his private golf club. This \"exclusive paid participation\" model effectively turned the token into a \"bidding tool\": anyone holding a sufficient number of tokens could gain the opportunity for private contact with the president. Among the dinner attendees was Tron founder Justin Sun, who had previously invested over $18 million in TRUMP tokens and faced charges from the US SEC (later suspended). This event sparked a double controversy: protesters rallied outside the venue, while inside it was under close scrutiny from the US Congress. Although the White House insisted that Trump's assets were under \"blind trust management\" (i.e., assets were managed by a third party without his direct intervention), on-chain blockchain analysis showed that entities associated with Trump controlled approximately 80% of the remaining supply of the token and had earned over $320 million in transaction fees through token trading. US Representatives Adam Smith and Sean Casten, along with 35 other House Democrats, wrote to the Department of Justice requesting an investigation into Trump's actions: whether offering \"dinner\" opportunities to top Trump token investors constituted bribery or violated the \"Foreign Remuneration Clause\" of the US Constitution (which prohibits federal officials from accepting unauthorized remuneration from foreign governments or individuals). In their letter, they pointed out that this incident \"opened the door for foreign interference in U.S. policy decisions, could constitute corruption, and is suspected of violating pay clauses. This is just the latest example of President Trump's disregard for ethical standards, exacerbation of conflicts of interest, and abuse of power for personal gain.\" October: The \"10/11\" Incident Fast forward to October: Blockchain analysts discovered that an anonymous trader suddenly shorted Bitcoin and Ethereum minutes before President Trump announced new tariffs on China. Trump's tariff announcement directly triggered the largest \"liquidation waterfall\" in cryptocurrency history (i.e., a large number of leveraged positions were forcibly liquidated due to a price crash, further exacerbating the price decline). It was reported that before the market stabilized, this anonymous trader had already profited $160 million. Observers, including the commentary firm The Kobeissi Letter, publicly questioned: \"Did someone have prior knowledge of the tax increase?\" While there is currently no direct evidence of an \"insider information leak,\" this incident has once again raised public concerns about the digital asset market—the problem of information asymmetry and the interference of political influence in the market may be far more serious than imagined. October: A \"Profitable\" Pardon Just weeks later, another controversy erupted: President Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. Zhao had pleaded guilty to \"anti-money laundering violations\" in 2023 and served four months in prison; Binance itself also paid over $4 billion in fines for this. <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.foresightnews.pro/202510/842-1761792999208?x-oss-process=style/scale70\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>On April 30, 2024, Changpeng Zhao, former CEO of Binance, left the U.S. Federal Court in Seattle, Washington. Zhao, the founder and former CEO of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, was sentenced to four months in prison that day for pleading guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws. (Photo: Jason Redmond / AFP, courtesy of Getty Images)</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This pardon not only erased Zhao's criminal record but also cleared the way for his return to the cryptocurrency industry. The White House explained that this move was to correct \"the problem of excessive regulation during the Biden administration.\"</p> However, a BBC report further fueled the controversy: Zhao Changpeng's company had previously collaborated with \"enterprises related to the Trump family's cryptocurrency projects.\" This connection significantly heightened public suspicion that \"there was a quid pro quo behind the pardon.\" Objectively speaking, this pardon further solidified the \"alliance\" between the current US government and the digital asset industry, while also raising deeper questions: To what extent does political influence ultimately dictate regulatory outcomes? Conclusion: Another \"Ordinary Year\" for the Cryptocurrency Sector These five events collectively made 2025 another \"headline year\" for the cryptocurrency industry. Despite ongoing controversy, compared to historical records, this year is far from the industry's \"worst period.\" The debut of Meme Coin in January blurred the lines between \"hype\" and \"governance\"; the Bybit hack in February exposed vulnerabilities even in the most trusted systems; the dinner in May transformed \"token holding\" into \"political leverage\"; the trading scandal in October revealed the power of \"speculation\" and \"timing\" to manipulate the entire market; and the presidential pardon in the same month made 2025 a year in which the \"legality and ethical boundaries of the cryptocurrency industry were repeatedly challenged.\" Every year in the cryptocurrency field is accompanied by new innovations, challenges, breakthroughs, and controversies—2025 is no exception.</div></div>",

This round was led by YZi Labs, with participation from Baidu Ventures, Jinqiu Fund, Amino Capital, BridgeOne Capital, and several well-known investors.</span></span></p> This is also the first AI product company invested in by YZi Labs. Founder Kai Zhao stated that VideoTutor received recognition and support from Changpeng Zhao and the YZi Labs investment team, with YZi Labs ultimately leading this round of financing. They received more than 10 term sheets (TS) and ultimately selected these few. The first version of their product was launched on May 14th (first appearance on the Founder Park product marketplace), gaining market recognition and PMF validation. In less than five months, they completed this $11 million seed round of financing. According to Kai, the core reason they were able to secure this funding is that, given the correct direction, the \"Little Genius Team\" solved the pain points of US college entrance exam preparation in the K-12 education sector using a visual learning approach. \"This field is well-suited for young people, especially those with strong engineering skills, insightful leadership, and experience, coupled with rapid execution.\" It's not just them; Cursor, Mercor, Pika, GPTZero, and other Silicon Valley students are redefining our understanding of AI entrepreneurship with their record-breaking funding AI products. Starting a business in the AI ​​era is truly different. We talked with the young people at VideoTutor to find out why they were able to secure this seed round funding, what changes are happening in Silicon Valley startups today, and why they are so keen to recruit employees from major Chinese companies. The following is the interview content, edited and compiled by Founder Park. Founder Park: So many institutions are optimistic about you. In your opinion, what is the core point that impressed them? Kai: I think the first thing is that the direction is correct. The AI ​​education sector has great potential and prospects. We've entered the education field of the US college entrance exams, SAT and AP. Our target user group is K-12 high school students. The gap between us and this user group is very small, basically no generation gap. We've gone through the entire test preparation and learning cycle, we know where the pain points of the exam and test preparation are, and we can create a product that truly solves the pain points of this group. Secondly, the team is excellent. James comes from Gemini and was a core engineer in AI engineering and algorithms at Google. I myself have three educational startup experiences. I started an educational software business in my freshman year of college, and in my sophomore year, I participated in the creation of MathGPTPro, a project that was selected for the Miracle Innovation Forum, etc. I have experience in successfully creating educational products. Thirdly, in the AI ​​education field we work on, the core is the animation engine, and we are the core developers of VideoTutor. We are the team that best understands the core technology and can achieve highly accurate rendering of the animation engine. The team itself has a very strong marketing background and knows how to promote the product. VideoTutor perfectly aligns with a consensus among mainstream US VCs: a \"young genius team.\" This refers to a field well-suited for young people, coupled with strong engineering skills, a founder with excellent insight and experience, and rapid execution. I think this is a consensus reason why all investors are optimistic about it. <p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p><section><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"P3pa0F2bwEWwFLUhH7KV2kkE5sXcXLkPgULiMrTH.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410151_image3.png\" title=\"7410151\"/></p></section><p></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">VideoTutor listed on the NYSE at YZi Labs EASY Residency Demo Day</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Founder Park: What core problem in the education industry does your product aim to solve?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Kai:</strong>Currently, learning products on the market can be categorized into two types: active learning products and passive learning products.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Kai:</strong> Passive learning products, such as ByteDance's Gauth, Chegg, and AnswersAi, cover what we call \"homework help,\" with a very short learning path; students primarily pay for homework assistance. VideoTutor, on the other hand, covers active learning scenarios. We don't need to consider students' learning motivation because they have to study and take exams, such as the SAT and AP exams in the US. In this scenario, there are numerous pain points related to visualization; 80% of the content in the SAT involves functions, calculus, and other knowledge requiring complex image rendering. VideoTutor's animation engine can solve this problem very well. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p><section><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"PaaJnnbtS6BXe6FyjS4skg0Y7HsPfNnGNNrXkFAN.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410152_image3.png\" title=\"7410152\"/></p></section><p></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Moreover, the average order value in this field is very high. In the US, an average of 2.6 million students take the SAT exam each year, creating a huge demand for paid services. Offline SAT courses are expensive, charged by the hour, not by package, starting at an average of $150 per hour, with most costing around $230. Many students and parents pay for these courses. However, VideoTutor can effectively transfer or even replace teacher training because, currently, AI-generated videos are almost indistinguishable from teacher training content.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> This way, students can have their own AI-powered personalized test preparation tutor at the lowest possible cost. Founder Park: What prompted you to create this product? Kai: Actually, before us, a team at Stanford had already done it, called Gatekeep AI. They also wanted to do visual learning. I had already realized the impact of this direction. In my previous startups, the educational products we made were basically just connecting to the GPT API, similar to a ChatGPT wrapper product. But we found that these products, based solely on text-based question and answer, have a ceiling. We can see that the business of companies like Chegg and Gauth is declining, with a large portion of their scenarios being replaced by ChatGPT, because students can solve many homework problems by paying $20 to use ChatGPT. Products based on API wrappers and optimizations have reached their limit. However, multimodal visual generation has a very promising future because there are many visualization learning scenarios in the US college entrance exam field. Unfortunately, Gatekeep made a good start but didn't continue because it launched a bit too early; the basic model programming capabilities weren't mature at the time, and GPT-4 hadn't been released yet. Furthermore, mathematical animation engines involve rendering and algorithms, which they couldn't overcome. But our team mastered all the core development of the animation engine, solved this problem, and made video rendering very accurate. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><span ace-line=\"\" ai=\"\" answersai=\"\" api=\"\" chatgpt=\"\" day=\"\" demo=\"\" easy=\"\" founder=\"\" gap=\"\" gatekeep=\"\" gauth=\"\" gpt=\"\" gpt-4=\"\" h2=\"\" heading-2=\"\" homework=\"\" img=\"\" insight=\"\" james=\"\" k12=\"\" labs=\"\" leaf=\"\" line-height:=\"\" margin-bottom:=\"\" marketing=\"\" mathgptpro=\"\" nodeleaf=\"\" p=\"\" residency=\"\" sat=\"\" span=\"\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410145_image3.png\" strong=\"\" text=\"\" vc=\"\" videotutor=\"\" wrapper=\"\" yzi=\"\">PMF: Strong User Willingness to Pay</span></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Founder Park: After your product launched, you also reached cooperation with several schools. In your opinion, when or which feature made you feel, \"I've done the right thing with this product, and I've found the right pain point,\" and you felt that you had found PMF?</span></span></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Kai:</span></span></strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">It can be explained from three dimensions.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">First, from the revenue metric, VideoTutor has received API requests from 1,000 companies so far, including all the well-known large educational institutions in the United States, and even institutions in China. In addition, many schools want to purchase the service.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\"> Consumer-facing (C-end) users have a more direct intention. One parent, who is also an investor, tried the product and then gave it to all his friends and family to try, and everyone was willing to pay. Then, somehow, he got my phone number and texted me wanting to invest in us. C-end users have a very strong willingness to pay. Secondly, from the perspective of user needs. Why is offline one-on-one tutoring so essential in the US? Because parents feel that one-on-one teaching is effective and are willing to pay for it. Now, multimodal AI technology can achieve a human-like one-on-one teaching effect, answering questions directly. Moreover, the video lessons recorded by online one-on-one tutors in the US are practically indistinguishable from AI-generated videos. This is what I mean by \"demand transfer.\" Students pay a lot of money for pre-recorded courses, which are indistinguishable from AI-generated ones, so why not use AI? Lower costs and better teaching results. We've received a lot of very positive feedback from students, and many teachers are also willing to spread the word about the product. The initial completion rate and usage time were particularly good. The 200 seed users we've selected are all from our early accumulation. The third point is about the product's taste and feel. When you continuously work backward from the progress of the entire education industry, to the core needs of students and parents who want to pay, and then to the evolution of the product itself, the whole logic is a closed loop. So, from these three dimensions, you'll feel that PMF is sufficient. The most crucial point is that the willingness to pay is extremely strong. </span></span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410146_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">We've partnered with FIZZ</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Founder Park: Many users are proactively willing to pay, and some have even contacted you wanting to invest.</span></span></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Kai:</span></span></strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Yes. In the SAT and AP fields, the willingness to pay is inherently strong. The average order value in this field starts at $100 to $200, and offline classes are even more expensive, possibly reaching $800.</span></span></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410146_image3.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\"> In the US, 2.6 million students take the SAT, and 37% of them actively pay for it. This is a market with very strong willingness and demand. Our product can achieve a very good transfer of demand. Founder Park: In the SAT arena, for test takers, would they trust AI over a human tutor? Kai: Currently, AI rarely makes factual errors when answering questions at the level of the US college entrance exams SAT and AP. In this case, why is it better than an offline tutor? One advantage is its affordability, and the other is that students can ask any questions they have without worrying about teachers being annoyed or impatient with their questions. They can learn anytime, anywhere, 24/7. Moreover, this market is transferable. After completing the US market, we can expand to A-Level exams in Canada and the UK, etc., where there is huge demand for paid services. Founder Park: What are your current plans regarding paid services? Kai: We offer monthly subscriptions, and we also offer pay-per-learning options. I think AI can already achieve pay-per-results now. We might offer a package where, for example, you pay $799 and we guarantee your child a perfect score on the SAT Math. Founder Park: But doesn't paying based on exam results also depend on the student's individual motivation? Kai: This might not be possible with the Chinese college entrance exam (Gaokao) because it covers thousands of topics. However, the American SAT only has 62 topics, 50 of which are standard and most students have no problem with them. The remaining 12 are generally mastered as well. Unless a student has a genuine problem with logic, there's virtually no chance they won't learn it. Furthermore, the efficiency improvement effect of AI is very significant. Actually, many online tutors in the US also offer this service. You pay a tutor $1800, and the tutor's success rate is basically 100% because the SAT test points are fixed. As long as the student's IQ is normal, there's basically no problem. But the Chinese college entrance exam (Gaokao) is different; you can't improve your Gaokao score in a short period. Moreover, the Chinese Gaokao requires a wide score gap, which presents challenging questions, but the American SAT doesn't have absolutely difficult questions because it tests your mastery of the knowledge points. Pay-per-result is a model that tutors have already used, and it has this prerequisite. Founder Park: In your pricing, is model cost a concern? Does it account for a large proportion? Kai: Our average order value in this field is very high, starting at $69 per month. Model costs are currently very low, so it's not a problem. The education industry isn't like the coding field, where everyone is competing on price because coding requires supporting very long contexts. Founder Park: I remember you said last time that your first prototype only took about two months. How did you consider the entire development cycle, such as the division of labor, deciding which features to include and which not to include? Kai: Our team's consensus is that iteration must be fast, because speed is crucial for getting early user feedback. The first version caused a huge stir on Twitter, attracting a large number of users. However, many of these users were programmers, investors, or tech enthusiasts—what we can collectively call \"early adopters.\" At that stage, the feedback from them was scattered and not very valuable. We needed to filter out the truly core seed users from this broad user base—high-quality high school students—and then obtain useful feedback through consultation. The core feedback we received was that video rendering accuracy must reach 100%, which was the most important area for optimization. Features like UI aesthetics or support for different TTS audio-visual selections were cut. Returning to the core of the product: we're working on knowledge learning for science-related scenarios, so the accuracy of graphics rendering is paramount. Founder Park: How was the generation time initially determined? Kai: At that time, the peak generation time was about 6 minutes. The main consideration was that explanations of ordinary questions and key concepts shouldn't exceed 6 minutes. However, in subsequent feedback, we found that some students with weaker learning abilities wanted the content explained more slowly and in greater depth. We realized that the time shouldn't be limited, but rather depend more on the user's learning ability. Founder Park: What's the longest you can go now? Kai: The longest should be under an hour, allowing for continuous questioning. It generates data in real-time during the interaction, but this feature is recent; it wasn't available in the initial version. Founder Park: Were there any features you initially considered but later decided against because they weren't considered important? Kai: For example, an app. We initially thought we should quickly develop an app, but then we discovered that most students in the US primarily use laptops or iPads for learning. Most K-12 schools in the US provide students with a Chromebook computer; computers are highly prevalent, and students complete their assignments on computers. High school students almost universally own a computer, and mobile phones account for less than 5% of learning scenarios—a very low percentage. Founder Park: So, if it's a product primarily targeting education or students, a web version is the first thing to develop; an app isn't as important. Kai: Yes, I already knew this data at the time, having studied in the US for many years. Later, we conducted research on 100 students from our initial tens of thousands of users. Over 90 of these students had computers, which further solidified our belief. Founder Park: When you launched your first version, were you also targeting the K-12 demographic? Kai: Yes, we've been targeting that group ever since. We're not exactly competitors with Gauth; we focus more on test preparation. Many high school students in the US already choose either offline tutoring or online learning platforms, and VideoTutor has effectively bridged this need. Founder Park: Will K-12 be your core user group for at least a year? Kai: It should be a core metric for at least two years. </span></span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span ace-line=\"\" app=\"\" chromebook=\"\" founder=\"\" gauth=\"\" h2=\"\"

experiences before, what were they mostly about?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Kai:</strong>I'm a junior in college now. In my freshman year, I started an educational product with James and received $200,000 in angel investment. Although that venture failed, I learned valuable lessons: you can't get caught up in homogeneous competition. At the time, our app had many similar products on the market, forcing us into early-stage competition for user acquisition, making monetization difficult.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">My second startup was MathGPTPro, where I joined as a co-founder for a few months. During that period, I learned how to analyze product metrics, how to build a product, and how to expand your user base.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> It was around that time that I came to a conclusion: Text-based, answer-oriented educational products had reached their limit. Because they were no different from ChatGPT, and the structured knowledge question banks that companies like Zuoyebang had invested heavily in were being replaced by large-scale model editing capabilities. Therefore, for my third venture, I knew that visualization was an inevitable trend. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p><section><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"F28nGF3IQzBCkOHQIxvcsORdYOaUJMSWifhdBnoA.png\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410155_image3.png\" title=\"7410155\"/></p></section><p></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A photo of Zhao Kai with Sam Altman at Harvard University</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Founder Park: Besides making you realize the limitations of text-based products, how have your past two experiences helped you in your current work on VideoTutor, in terms of teamwork or other aspects?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Kai:</strong>Very helpful.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">First, it helped me better judge the direction and whether the product had a future.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"> I judge the overall product evolution direction by looking at competitors' website traffic and revenue. Secondly, in terms of product development, I can better judge the product development pace, including product design, front-end and back-end integration, and which metrics to look at. Thirdly, team management and organizational culture capabilities. I established a more complete management system, including the division of labor for each team member, rewards, and stock option issuance. Also, I learned how to raise funds. We completed this round of $10 million in funding within 20 days. Founder Park: How many people are on your team now? Kai: Six people, we all live together. Founder Park: How was the team initially built? Kai: James and I have already started two businesses. We both graduated from the same university, and we made an app together in our freshman year. In our sophomore year, I started a business with two other people, and we all knew each other. When we realized that this technology could bring a very big product vision, we contacted each other to form a team to develop this product. We were all alumni, including another partner on the team, Nick, who was also my college roommate. Founder Park: You are also planning to expand your recruitment now. What kind of people are you looking to hire? Kai: We are mainly recruiting backend, frontend, large language model, and UI/UX professionals, preferably with experience. Because we have now moved beyond the trial and error stage and entered the stage of rapid product building, we need experienced people to help us grow. Founder Park: We need experienced engineers, product managers, and growth leaders to grow the product from 1 to 10, or even from 10 to 100. Kai: Yes, that's the stage. We expect to expand the team to 9 to 10 people, with a primary focus on recruiting engineers. This recruitment will likely be based in China, so it will be a mix of in-person and remote hiring. Founder Park: What kind of person are you looking for? Kai: We prefer someone with experience at large companies like ByteDance or Meituan. ByteDance has a fast-paced, dynamic organizational culture and values ​​young people. Those trained at ByteDance possess strong methodologies and skills, and joining us allows them to bring their successful experiences and integrate them into our learning. We're looking for individuals with proven track records in major Chinese tech companies and experience in rapid iteration. We've moved beyond the student startup phase and don't need to hire complete novices anymore; we need more experienced individuals who aren't absolute industry veterans. Industry veterans might have family responsibilities and can't be as focused. Therefore, we prefer young, focused individuals at a middle level. We're willing to offer substantial stock options to outstanding talent. Although we've raised $11 million, why haven't we hired engineers in the US? Because we believe that China's product development and engineering capabilities are truly exceptional. This wave will almost certainly see Chinese-run teams creating great products that will succeed internationally. Many AI applications are currently being developed by Chinese; China's engineering capabilities are truly impressive. This is also our advantage—we leverage the strengths of both China and the US. </p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span ace-line=\"\" ai=\"\" altman=\"\" build=\"\" founder=\"\" h2=\"\" heading-2=\"\" img=\"\" in-person=\"\" james=\"\" leaf=\"\" line-height:=\"\" margin-bottom:=\"\" nick=\"\" nodeleaf=\"\" p=\"\" pitch=\"\" sam=\"\" span=\"\" src=\"https://img.jinse.cn/7410147_image3.png\" strong=\"\" text=\"\" ux=\"\" videotutor=\"\">College students in Silicon Valley,</span></strong><strong>are all starting AI businesses</strong></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span leaf=\"\"><span text=\"\">Founder Park: Especially in Silicon Valley, the trend of college student entrepreneurship is particularly evident. What kind of situation are you observing? Kai: Let's look at a fact: take the companies with valuations in the recent round of funding, for example: Mercor, which focuses on AI recruitment, has completed a new round of funding of over $300 million, and its valuation is already in the tens of billions of dollars; while Cursor is already a sure thing for a $10 billion valuation. There are also companies like GPTZero and Pika, etc. These are all college student startups, especially since the founders of Cursor and Mercor were both college dropouts. This wave of young entrepreneurs all share a common characteristic: highly differentiated competition. They focus on doing things in extremely narrow fields, not creating anything generic. For example, Mercor initially focused on recruiting Indian programmers for its AI program. The second point is the environment. The entire Silicon Valley capital environment and underlying innovation, such as Stanford, Y Combinator, and Peter Thiel's fund, support student entrepreneurship in its earliest stages, regardless of whether your ideas are fully developed, and are willing to support you and provide a strong network of connections. The third point, I think, is the quality of these university students. Whether it's us or these Silicon Valley graduates, they all possess a very courageous spirit of adventure and extremely strong learning abilities. This adventurous spirit is something many students in China may not possess. Because in Silicon Valley, there are many successful examples of peers around you inspiring you, and the capital environment is willing to believe in young people. For me, I also compared the costs and benefits at the time. If I chose to finish university and then find a job, I might not be able to repay my family's tuition fees, nor would I necessarily see a significant return. But if I chose to start a business, I could study intensely while I was young, and my life would have unlimited possibilities. I've wanted to create a great company since I was a child. Founder Park: Why is it that today's generation of college graduates can build companies worth billions of dollars, while in the past, selling for ten or twenty million dollars was considered a great achievement? Is there any hype or bubble factor involved in this? Kai: I don't think it's entirely a bubble. Cursor has a real revenue of $450 million, which is very reliable. Behind this is the crucial methodology and cognitive insight of this generation of young teams. Look at these teams, their backgrounds are all quite excellent, and they have very good learning abilities. Early on, Cursor relied on the university student programmers around them, who had a high acceptance of AI and provided strong feedback. The founder himself is also a gifted engineer who deeply understands users and has strong engineering iteration capabilities. In the early days, only four people were needed to get the product up and running. After they iterated the product well, they built a good reputation among users, generated revenue, and investors, fearing they might miss out on the next Mark Zuckerberg, poured in more capital. The most fundamental condition is that many technologies in this wave of AI are new, and young people learn quickly, are pragmatic, reliable, and daring. Therefore, they have an exceptional understanding of users and an incredibly fast iteration speed to defeat traditional products. For example, before Cursor, GitHub Copilot was quite good, but why didn't it beat Cursor? It's because of user experience and execution speed. Founder Park: Could we say that because AI is a new technology, many product perceptions also need to be viewed from a new perspective? Kai: Yes, the younger generation of entrepreneurs has deeper insights and understanding than the previous generation, and they are closer to users. The mainstream AI users now are mostly Gen Z, and their learning and feedback iteration speed and tolerance are much faster than the previous generation of entrepreneurs. Therefore, the speed of cognitive iteration is key. In the mobile internet era, technological iteration was measured in years or quarters, but in the AI ​​era, it may be measured in days. As a founder, you must learn quickly, and young people are more likely to stay up late and have more drive. Founder Park: Some media outlets have reported that many founders in Silicon Valley have started working 996 (9am-9pm, 6 days a week). What's your take on that? Kai: Some of my white entrepreneur friends have raised a lot of money and are also working 996. They, like us, rent a large house where everyone lives and works together. I think 996 is more of an environmental necessity. Silicon Valley is like a gold rush now; nobody wants to fall behind, so the only competition is product iteration speed, which requires working late into the night for rapid iteration. It's an environment that forces people to do this. Founder Park: What are the trends in the choice of business tracks among college student entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley? Kai: I think whether we're in education or others, there's a general trend: starting a business within one's comfort zone. A comfort zone refers to having sufficient understanding of the field and its users. The founder of Cursor has a deep understanding of coding, and we in education do so because we understand the target audience well. Young people today are more likely to start businesses within their existing comfort zones, rather than rashly jumping into unfamiliar areas. This ensures that the user feedback they receive is quick and accurate. There's also the issue of knowledge accumulation. We've been in education three times, and my understanding has been constantly evolving. These college students aren't likely to rashly do things they've never done before; they're always thinking about how to do it better. They have a new generation of mindset, constantly iterating within their own cognitive circles and daring to create opportunities. Another point is their adventurous spirit; they're not easily swayed by others' criticism, possessing an attitude of \"I don't care what you think about me,\" very confident. Behind this is a culture of \"high-speed experimentation.\" I know my product isn't ready yet, but I don't care; I launch quickly, iterate quickly, and get feedback quickly. Founder Park: When did this trend start? Kai: I think it's a kind of consensus-based success. When people see projects like GPTZero grow from dorm rooms, iterate continuously, and then gain capital support and user recognition, and there are many such successful cases of rapid trial and error and rapid growth, a consensus is formed. In short, \"Better done than perfect,\" completion is more important than perfection. Moreover, people aren't too worried about competition. Many founders in Silicon Valley are willing to share their product ideas, unafraid of being copied; they just want to iterate quickly. I think this wave of young people also has a very good storytelling ability. This storytelling isn't empty rhetoric, but rather based on pragmatism and truthfulness, plus their vision for the future. Founder Park: First, market yourself. Kai: Yes. I think the underlying concept is a spirit of adventure and extreme self-confidence. Driven by this, they constantly and bravely try and fail, unafraid to say the wrong thing. They boldly express their product ideas, boldly execute them, and if they make a mistake, they can always correct it. This culture of not being afraid to try and fail has contributed to this wave of college student entrepreneurship and its success. VCs in the US also look at college student projects; Y Combinator regularly invests in some college student projects each round. Fundraising is the last thing VideoTutor needs to worry about right now. Founder Park: If you could go back to when you first started VideoTutor, what advice would you give yourself? What could you have done better? Kai: I think it would have been to move at a faster pace. Also, team composition. The VideoTutor team has gone through multiple rounds of refinement. If I had known earlier, I would have better assemble a team based on the skill profiles required for the product. I think that in the end, organizational ability is crucial for startups. I will spend more time on organizational capabilities: selecting people, identifying people, and utilizing people effectively. The current team is suited for growth from 0 to 1, but to make VideoTutor bigger, we need more experienced people to join, bringing their excellent experience and abilities to the team and helping the whole team grow together. Founder Park: What kind of product or technical challenges do you think VideoTutor might encounter in the next six months? Kai: I think one is rendering; to achieve true zero latency, we still need engineering breakthroughs. The second point is about growth, which I think is about the product's \"taste.\" This encompasses many things, such as whether the UI and interaction design are smooth and perfect, whether the functional interactions are bug-free, and whether the visual layout is aesthetically pleasing. These are all challenges for us. James: I think initially, our positioning for VideoTutor was to provide visual teaching and tutoring for all subjects, but later we became very vertical, focusing solely on mathematics, because that's what we excel at. Our mathematical rendering engine is the most professional. The key breakthrough we need to make next is probably horizontal expansion. For example, how do we bring the advantages of visualization to humanities scenarios? For example, explaining \"Hoeing the fields at noon, sweat drips onto the soil.\" This is a point we need to consider technically next. Founder Park: Will the founder's background cause any problems in subsequent expansion? Kai: Not really. Actually, many large VCs have approached us, like a16z. They don't invest too early; they only help when the team shows signs of success, so they know their investment won't fail. We maintain very good relationships with many large VCs. Fundraising is the least of VideoTutor's worries; their biggest concerns are the user ecosystem and the product itself.</span></span></strong></p></strong></h2></div></div>",

The crypto exchange has integrated Bubblemaps’ blockchain analytics tools into its Web3 Wallet, allowing millions of users to visualize token distribution, wallet clusters, and insider trading patterns directly from their interface.</p><p></p><p>At its core, Bubblemaps transforms complex blockchain data into interactive bubble networks — where each bubble represents a wallet and its links to others. This mapping makes it easy to spot abnormal token concentrations, coordinated wallet behavior, or suspicious transaction flows — all of which can hint at insider trading or market manipulation.</p><p></p><p>The tool has already proven effective in uncovering questionable activity. In April, Bubblemaps traced $30 million in undisclosed token sales linked to the team behind Melania Trump’s MELANIA memecoin, showing how insider-controlled wallets quietly offloaded community funds.</p><p></p><div class=\"media-wrap image-wrap\"><img src=\"https://image.coinlive.com/cryptotwits-static/88ada8f07832e97c41f131abf11ea7fb.png\"/></div><p></p><p>By embedding Bubblemaps directly into its non-custodial wallet, Binance gives users access to the same kind of forensic data normally reserved for onchain analysts, effectively democratizing transparency.</p><p></p><p>“As more activity moves onchain, accessible blockchain data becomes essential,” said Winson Liu, lead at Binance Wallet. “Integrating Bubblemaps helps users see token ownership patterns and market dynamics clearly, supporting more informed and confident trading decisions.”</p><p></p><div class=\"media-wrap embed-wrap\"><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">This man just made history.<br/><br/>First person ever convicted of crypto insider trading.<br/><br/>His \"foolproof\" scheme at Coinbase generated $1.1 million in 10 months.<br/><br/>Until ONE tweet exposed the whole operation.<br/><br/>Here's how it all unraveled:🧵 <a href=\"https://t.co/yrqes6gnjR\">pic.twitter.com/yrqes6gnjR</a></p>— Insider Trackers (@InsiderTrackers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InsiderTrackers/status/1957049832381857939?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 17, 2025</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></div></div><p></p><p>The collaboration adds a new layer of clarity to the Binance ecosystem — especially as insider trading, wallet clustering, and token manipulation continue to undermine trust across decentralized markets.</p><p></p><p>Bubblemaps’ CEO Nicolas Vaiman described the partnership as a key milestone for the broader transparency movement:</p><blockquote>“Our mission is to make blockchain data understandable for every trader. This integration brings us one step closer to that goal.”</blockquote><p></p><h1>Fighting Manipulation, Building Trust</h1><p>Bubblemaps recently launched a tool called Time Travel, allowing users to replay token movements chronologically to detect suspicious prelaunch allocations or coordinated insider behavior — a feature that may prove critical as memecoin speculation surges.</p><p></p><div class=\"media-wrap embed-wrap\"><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-media-max-width=\"560\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">what if I told you — now you can rewind time and dive deep into the initial token launch? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BMT&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$BMT</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bubblemaps?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@bubblemaps</a> Time Travel feature<br/>🕵️‍♂️ See how tokens were or iginally distributed<br/>📅 Analyze contracts and wallets from Day 1<br/>🧠 Understand insider allocations before the hype <a href=\"https://t.co/s0QkNUUsoO\">pic.twitter.com/s0QkNUUsoO</a></p>— Crypto 4 Light (@vladi4light) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vladi4light/status/1933545395667263927?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 13, 2025</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></div></div><p></p><p>For Binance, the partnership is more than a tech upgrade; it’s a strategic trust move. By giving retail users visibility into how tokens move and who controls them, the company is betting on data transparency as a foundation for safer, fairer onchain trading.</p></div></div>",
