The bank also raised the target stock price by nearly 90%, from $18 to $34. Following this announcement, Core Scientific's stock rose by 4.5% in early trading, reaching approximately $21.7.\n\nAnalysts Paul Golding and Marni Lysaght noted in their report that previous reports and proxy suggestions indicated shareholder opposition to the merger between Core Scientific and CoreWeave, making the merger's failure unsurprising. The analysts view this outcome positively, as it allows Core Scientific greater flexibility to lease its short-term power capacity to AI tenants.",
