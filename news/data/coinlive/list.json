            "description": "Rekt Capital analysis indicates that BTC price encountered resistance at the $68,000 trendline and weakened momentum after breaking below $70,000. TradingView data shows that BTC/USD fell by more than 1% on the day, having previously touched the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) and the all-time high of 2021 at $70,040, but failed to hold. Rekt Capital states that the 200-week EMA has now become a resistance level, and historical data shows that if Bitcoin continues to fall below this level, the price tends to decline further. The liquidity ladder below $69,000 has been exhausted, and the momentum has been lost. Yesterday's rally pushed the price to the previous cycle high and the 12-hour trendline before being retraced. The trend remains clear, and caution is advised. Rekt Capital further points out that the shortest Bitcoin bear market lasted 365 days, and it has currently entered its 140th day, meaning it is not yet time to exit the bear market. Historically, bear markets typically see declines of around 80%, and BTC's largest retracement from its October 2025 high of $126,200 to its 15-month low in February was approximately 53%.
