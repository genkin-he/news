            "description": "YZi Labs posted a new article on X, demanding immediate SEC disclosures, alleging that undisclosed warrant exercises may have pushed 10X Capital’s ownership above 5%, raising concerns about transparency, potential reporting violations, and the existence of an undisclosed insider “group.” YZi Labs cited company filings suggesting that 10X Capital Asset Management LLC and affiliates beneficially own more than 5% of CEA Industries Inc. shares, and criticizes the lack of a required Schedule 13D filing by 10X and board member Hans Thomas.The firm argues that 10X’s silence following public calls for clarification raises concerns that mandatory SEC reporting requirements may have been deliberately avoided, limiting shareholder transparency.Company filings show that 2,376,236 warrants were exercised during the relevant period, closely matching the number of shares underlying warrants held by 10X-affiliated entities.YZi Labs confirms it did not exercise its warrants, reinforcing the inference that the exercised warrants were attributable to 10X-related entities.Based on 44,062,938 shares outstanding as of December 12, 2025, the exercised warrants alone would represent approximately 5.39% ownership, suggesting 10X may have exceeded the SEC reporting threshold.YZi Labs contends that overlapping affiliations and aligned ownership among 10X-linked entities and company insiders warrant scrutiny as possible concerted action requiring disclosure under Section 13(d)(3).",

            "description": "Crypto KOL Murphy posted on X that recent data from URPD indicates a significant shift in Bitcoin trading patterns. Over the past week, 1.71 million BTC changed hands in the $63,000 to $68,000 range, up from 1.53 million BTC, suggesting that bulls have acquired 180,000 BTC in this period. This activity contrasts with the accumulation of 1.89 million BTC in the $87,000 to $92,000 range, creating a unique 'U-shaped' structure with a gap in the $71,000 to $80,000 range. This gap indicates that during the last price surge in October 2024, Bitcoin quickly surpassed this range without significant trading, and similarly, it dropped rapidly during the recent decline.\n\nThe $63,000 to $68,000 range is becoming increasingly robust, indicating that some investors see value in Bitcoin at these prices, potentially providing support. As long-term holders reduce their selling, there is potential to challenge the aforementioned gap again.\n\nBelow $63,000, the only significant accumulation is at $16,000, where 391,000 BTC remain untouched since the last bear market bottom. It is unlikely that Bitcoin will return to $16,000 in this cycle. If the $63,000 to $68,000 range is breached, predicting the next support level is challenging. It will depend on where bulls establish a new defense, potentially forming a 'W-shaped' structure with the current accumulation zone, which would be a remarkable phenomenon.",
