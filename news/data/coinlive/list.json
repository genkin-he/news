            "description": "Hong Kong's Financial Secretary, Paul Chan, has stated that while direct trade and investment between Hong Kong and Iran are limited, the ongoing conflict has introduced significant global uncertainty. According to RTHK, Chan mentioned in a television program that financial markets are expected to experience considerable volatility, with rapid shifts in capital flows. He noted that local funds might seek safe havens in Hong Kong, prompting the Special Administrative Region government to prepare and carefully manage financial risks, with contingency plans already in place.\n\nThe conflict may also temporarily impact gold prices, oil prices, and international trade transportation costs, with authorities continuously assessing these risks. Additionally, the budget proposal includes a plan to allocate a total of HKD 150 billion from the Exchange Fund over two years to support the Northern Metropolis and other infrastructure projects. Chan highlighted that the Northern Metropolis covers a large area, accounting for one-third of Hong Kong's land, and includes residential units and commercial land, requiring substantial infrastructure investment. The Exchange Fund generates annual profits, allowing for a shift from financial investment to future-oriented investments.\n\nChan anticipates that returns from the Northern Metropolis will become evident in approximately four to five years, emphasizing that financial returns should not be the sole focus. The Northern Metropolis is expected to foster future economic growth and serve as a vital residential area for citizens. He stressed that resources should not be concentrated solely on the Northern Metropolis, but also allocated to finance and trade sectors.\n\nRegarding support measures, commonly referred to as \"sweeteners,\" Chan stated that three factors must be considered: necessity, the prevailing economic and social conditions, and public finances.",

            "description": "On March 1, the cryptocurrency market experienced a significant rebound during early Asian trading hours following reports of Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei's death in a U.S.-Israeli military operation. According to BlockBeats, Bitcoin surged by 2.21% to reach $68,196 before settling around $67,300, after a previous day's decline of 3.8%. Ethereum also saw a rise of 4.58%, surpassing the $2,000 mark.Data indicates that after losing approximately $128 billion in market value the previous day, the crypto market recovered about $32 billion by Sunday morning. Analysts suggest that due to the 24/7 trading nature of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin acted as a 'liquidity pressure valve' during the weekend's geopolitical conflict escalation, absorbing selling pressure that might have otherwise spread to stock, bond, and commodity markets.Despite the rebound, uncertainty remains as Iran has retaliated against multiple locations, including Israel, Qatar, UAE, and Bahrain, and has threatened further strikes on U.S.-related bases. Some traders believe that true price discovery may occur once U.S. stock markets and Bitcoin ETFs resume trading on Monday.The derivatives market also experienced significant volatility. Analysis shows that Bitcoin derivatives saw a surge in sell-off volume of approximately $1.8 billion in a single hour last Saturday, indicating a rise in short-term risk aversion. Meanwhile, tokenized commodity contracts linked to oil, gold, and silver on decentralized trading platform Hyperliquid also saw price increases.",
