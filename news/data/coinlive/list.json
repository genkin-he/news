Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu continued to publicly lobby the US to strike Iran, considering it Israel's \"mortal enemy.\" Under combined pressure, Trump ordered a massive airstrike against the Iranian leadership and military. Despite US intelligence assessments suggesting that Iranian forces are unlikely to pose a direct threat to the US mainland within the next decade, the attack still occurred. (Washington Post)",

Kaszycki believes that companies with actual operational businesses (such as blockchain validator services or public/private lending products) have better cash flow and are better positioned to acquire companies that only hold crypto assets but lack operating revenue. Furthermore, he mentioned that the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), especially the on-chaining of public and private lending assets, may see significant growth in the next 24 months and could become a potential revenue source for treasury companies. He also mentioned that Strategy, the world's largest Bitcoin treasury company, offers investors credit-like and fixed-income instruments, using this as a key argument for inclusion in the MSCI index.

In terms of security philosophy, OpenAI adopts a \"layered approach,\" which includes building a security technology stack, deploying Frontier Deployment Engineers (FDEs), involving security researchers in the project, delivering through cloud deployment, and cooperating directly with the U.S. Department of War. Compared to setting specific prohibitions in the contract, Anthropic seems to focus more on explicit restrictions at the contractual level, while OpenAI tends to rely more on the applicable legal framework and use technical security protection measures as the core guarantee. However, other companies may have different positions on this. Anthropic may hope to gain more operational control in the collaboration, which may also be one of the reasons for the divergence in their approaches.",
