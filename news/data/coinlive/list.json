            "description": "According to on-chain data platform Arkham Intelligence, SpaceX currently holds approximately 8,285 bitcoins in its Coinbase Prime escrow account, worth about $545 million at the latest price, a decrease of about $235 million from its valuation of about $780 million three months ago. The company has not reduced its holdings during this period. SpaceX is planning to file a confidential IPO application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as early as March, aiming for a June listing with a valuation potentially exceeding $1.75 trillion and a maximum fundraising scale of $50 billion. If successful, this would break the record of $29 billion set by Saudi Aramco in 2019. Data shows that the company's bitcoin holdings have remained relatively stable at around 8,300 bitcoins since the beginning of 2026, but the book value has fluctuated significantly due to the BTC price correction. At the end of 2021, SpaceX's BTC holdings peaked at nearly $2 billion, before declining during the 2022 bear market, fluctuating between $400 million and $800 million over the past two years. Market analysts point out that once SpaceX submits its S-1 filing, it will be required to disclose its relevant cryptocurrency exposure, and future financial reports may reflect the book profit and loss risks caused by Bitcoin price fluctuations. Tesla has previously attracted market attention multiple times due to similar book fluctuations. However, on-chain data does not show any active trading by SpaceX. Compared to Tesla's past buying and selling activities, SpaceX seems to prefer a long-term holding strategy. (CoinDesk)",
