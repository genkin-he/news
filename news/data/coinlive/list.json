            "description": "According to official news, on October 31st, Fractal Bitcoin officially launched two native staking pools: Triple Gem and Whale, with a total staking limit of 2.5 million FB. The newly launched \"Triple Gem Pool\" and \"Whale Pool\" are designed to cater to different user needs based on the existing tiered yield model. The Triple Gem Pool technically enables concurrent use of multiple yield acceleration modes, allowing users to simultaneously enable three yield acceleration modes, raising the usage limit by one level compared to the conventional solution. This pool has a time limit and will close on November 5th. The Whale Pool is primarily for large-scale staking needs, increasing the staking limit per address to 200,000 FB. This iteration of Fractal Bitcoin's activities continues its technical approach based on the Taproot protocol, further improving the diversity of the yield structure while maintaining user asset self-custody. It is understood that the opening of the staking pool also introduced opportunities to obtain its bonus acceleration tools. Users can access the event page to obtain additional bonus tools and strategically use them in staking to gain extra returns, thereby achieving a maximum annualized return of 49.8%. This staking scheme has no lock-up period and supports full or partial release of staking at any time.",
