            "description": "According to Foresight News, a report by CoinDesk highlights that analysts from Citizens Bank in the United States have observed an acceleration in the acquisition race for blockchain infrastructure. The analysts emphasize that the complex technology of the digital asset industry, coupled with a shortage of skilled professionals and stringent compliance requirements, makes acquisitions the most viable strategy for existing companies.\n\nThe report further notes that digital-native companies can benefit from joining larger financial networks, gaining scale, customer reach, and regulatory credibility. Tokenization is identified as a key driver of this activity.\n\nThe bank forecasts that as stablecoins and tokenized assets become mainstream in the financial sector, services related to transactions, custody, and data could generate nearly $100 billion in annual revenue by 2030.",
