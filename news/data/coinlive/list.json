According to Jin10, the ITC determined that three of GoPro's asserted invention patents (Nos. 10,015,413, 10,958,840, and 10,529,052) do not infringe on the accused products and that the patent claims are invalid or partially invalid. Additionally, one of GoPro's invention patents (No. 10,574,894) was found not to be infringed upon, and another patent (No. 11,336,832) was deemed invalid.\n\nThe company noted that only a portion of its products exported to the U.S. fell under the protection of one of GoPro's design patents (No. D789,435). However, Ying Shi Innovation's new design scheme has been recognized by the ITC as not infringing on this patent. The previous generation of products, which fell under GoPro's design patent protection, is no longer exported to the U.S., and current products have been replaced with the new design.\n\nThe 337 investigation involving the company has concluded, and the investigation did not have a substantial impact on the company's production or operations. Ying Shi Innovation will continue to import and sell its existing products in the U.S. without restrictions.",
