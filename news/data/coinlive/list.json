            "description": "Bernstein points out that Circle is no longer seen as a mere \"proxy investment\" for crypto assets, but has transformed into a fintech infrastructure service provider, reflecting a profound shift in the company's business positioning. According to Circle's Q4 2025 financial report, the company achieved significant revenue growth—total revenue for the fourth quarter reached approximately $770 million, a surge of 77% year-over-year. CEO Jeremy Allaire stated in the earnings call that the company is currently in the early stages of a fundamental transformation in how the global economic system operates, with the future economy becoming more internet-connected and highly automated. Bernstein's analyst team believes Circle will play a key role in this evolution and reaffirmed its \"Outperform\" rating and $190 price target in its latest research report, suggesting significant upside potential for the company's stock. Analyst Gautum Chhugani and his colleagues noted in their report that Circle's Q4 performance clearly diverged from the overall crypto market trend, emphasizing that the company is moving towards becoming a core internet infrastructure provider, rather than simply a stablecoin or crypto token business.

            "description": "Bitcoin retreated after a strong surge to $70,000 in the US session on Wednesday, trading around $68,600 in the Asian session on Thursday, failing to hold above the key psychological level. Since the end of February, BTC has maintained a range-bound trading structure, having dipped to $62,500 this month and reached $71,100 on February 15th. Market analysts point out that Bitcoin broke out of a similar trading range in January, but subsequently fell rapidly from $98,000 to $60,000, forming lower highs in this downward cycle, making some traders cautious about the sustainability of the current breakout. Derivatives data shows that the total open interest (OI) in the crypto futures market increased by over 6.6%, approaching $100 billion, a higher increase than the overall market capitalization growth, indicating new capital inflows. In the options market, Deribit data shows that the Bitcoin rebound boosted demand for call options with strike prices between $85,000 and $90,000. However, the overall options structure still leans towards put protection, with $60,000 put options currently the most popular position, boasting a notional open interest exceeding $1.4 billion, indicating that the market remains wary of downside risks.

            "title": "XRP Price News: Is a 20% March Rally Taking Shape After Months of Losses?",
            "description": "XRP may be approaching a pivotal turning point after months of sustained downside pressure. Technical signals and improving onchain data suggest the token could be setting up for a 20% rebound in March, provided key resistance levels are cleared.XRP is currently down more than 50% since October 2025 and has posted five consecutive red monthly candles. March could mark the first meaningful attempt to break that bearish streak.Key TakeawaysXRP is forming a double-bottom pattern, targeting a potential 20% upside move.Whale selling pressure has eased sharply, while large-holder balances are rising.A breakout above $1.50 is critical to confirm the bullish scenario.Failure at resistance could reopen downside risk toward $1.00.Double-Bottom Pattern Signals Potential 20% XRP UpsideXRP has twice defended the $1.30–$1.35 support zone in February, forming what appears to be a classic double-bottom reversal pattern on the daily chart.A double bottom typically signals trend exhaustion after a prolonged decline. The pattern confirms when price breaks above the neckline, which for XRP sits near $1.50.If XRP achieves a decisive close above this level, the technical target projects toward $1.68–$1.70, representing a gain of roughly 20% from current prices.This level would also place XRP back into a mid-range zone last seen before the sharp leg lower earlier this year.Whale Behavior Turns Supportive as Distribution FadesOnchain data shows a notable shift in large-holder behavior, strengthening the bullish case.According to CryptoQuant data:XRP whale net flows (90-day moving average) have improved to around -3.3 million XRP, down from -33.5 million XRP in December.This sharp reduction in outflows suggests that distribution has largely cooled, even as price fell another ~25% over the same period.At the same time, Glassnode data shows that wallets holding at least 1,000 XRP have resumed accumulation, indicating that larger holders may be positioning near local lows.A similar slowdown in whale selling occurred in April 2025, which preceded a 50%+ XRP rally in the months that followed.A clean flip of whale flows back into positive territory would further reinforce the probability of a March breakout.Resistance Levels That Could Stall the RallyDespite improving signals, XRP still faces important technical hurdles.The $1.68–$1.70 target zone sits above the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) — a level XRP has repeatedly failed to reclaim throughout February.A rejection at the 50-day EMA could invalidate the double-bottom setup and shift the structure into a bear pennant, with downside risk extending toward $1.00, or roughly 30% lower from current levels.Macro Risks Remain a Key VariableEven with constructive technical and onchain signals, macro conditions remain a wildcard.Potential headwinds include:A renewed risk-off rotation driven by AI-sector volatilityGeopolitical tensions, particularly involving the US and IranBroader liquidity tightening impacting high-beta altcoinsThese factors could cap upside or delay confirmation, even if XRP’s chart structure continues to improve.Bottom LineXRP is showing its strongest bullish setup in months, supported by a double-bottom pattern and easing whale distribution. A confirmed breakout above $1.50 would significantly increase the odds of a 20% rally toward $1.68–$1.70 in March.However, failure to reclaim key resistance — or renewed macro stress — could quickly invalidate the setup. For now, XRP sits at a technical inflection point where March may finally determine whether the downtrend breaks or extends, according to Cointelegraph.",

            "description": "US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $506.5 million in net inflows on Wednesday, marking the strongest single-day intake since early February as Bitcoin climbed back above $68,000.The renewed demand has pushed weekly ETF inflows to $560.4 million, putting funds on track for their first positive week after five consecutive weeks of net outflows totaling $3.8 billion, according to data from SoSoValue.The rebound follows a sharp February sell-off that erased roughly $20 billion in net ETF assets, suggesting institutional positioning may be stabilizing.BlackRock’s IBIT Leads Inflows as Trading Volumes SurgeThe largest inflows were seen in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which attracted $297.4 million in a single session, according to data from Farside.Other notable inflows included:Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB): $39.4 millionFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC): $30.1 millionETF trading activity also rebounded sharply, with total daily volumes surpassing $4.3 billion, the highest level since Feb. 9.The resurgence in flows coincided with Bitcoin reclaiming key technical levels above $68,000, reinforcing the perception of renewed institutional engagement.Market Structure Debate IntensifiesThe rebound in ETF inflows comes amid ongoing debate about Bitcoin price discovery and the role of authorized participants (APs) and major trading firms such as Jane Street.Speculation intensified following a lawsuit tied to the 2022 collapse of Terraform Labs’ TerraUSD stablecoin. Online discussions have questioned whether derivatives exposure and ETF-related mechanics could influence Bitcoin’s price structure.Bitwise adviser Jeff Park addressed the topic on social media, emphasizing that while no authorized participant explicitly suppresses Bitcoin’s price, ETF market structure can impact how price discovery unfolds.He noted that concerns about “paper Bitcoin” — trading exposure without acquiring underlying BTC — reflect broader questions about transparency rather than direct manipulation.ETF Recovery After Prolonged PressureDespite two strong inflow days, broader sentiment remains cautious. Bitcoin has faced persistent selling pressure since October 2025, and ETF assets under management remain well below recent peaks.However, the combination of:Consecutive daily inflowsRebounding ETF trading volumesBitcoin reclaiming $68,000A potential weekly net inflow after five negative weekssuggests that institutional demand may be returning incrementally.If inflows continue and BTC holds above key support levels, ETFs could play a pivotal role in stabilizing market structure following February’s volatility.For now, the ETF market appears to be regaining momentum — but sustained buying will be necessary to confirm a broader trend reversal.",
