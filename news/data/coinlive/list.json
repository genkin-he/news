            "description": "ZKsync has announced that it will officially deprecate ZKsync Lite on May 4th, at which time block production will cease and the network's final state will be permanently frozen. ZKsync Lite was launched in June 2020 under the name ZKsync 1.0 and was considered Ethereum's first zero-knowledge proof rollup, but it did not support smart contract functionality. Matter Labs ceased development of Lite in March 2023 after launching zkEVM ZKsync Era, which supports arbitrary smart contracts. The team stated that this deprecation will not affect Era or other chains built on the ZK Stack framework. A read-only API will be retained for at least one year after the shutdown to support data access. Users are advised to withdraw their assets before May 4th; any unwithdrawn funds can still be claimed afterward. According to L2BEAT data, approximately $33.9 million in assets remain on ZKsync Lite via canonical bridging, including approximately $24.9 million in stablecoins, approximately $8.4 million in ETH and derivatives, approximately $313,000 in BTC and derivatives, and approximately $231,000 in other assets.",

The class-action lawsuit will continue to be heard in open court. The judge held that Binance's 2019 arbitration clause does not apply to these claims because Binance failed to provide adequate notice to users when unilaterally amending the 2017 version of its Terms of Service, and the 2017 version did not contain any arbitration or class-action exemption clauses. The judge noted that Binance relied solely on general terms changes and the posting of the updated 2019 terms on its website, and there is no evidence that the exchange provided any personal notices or formal announcements to users. The judge also ruled that the 2019 arbitration clause cannot be retroactively applied to claims prior to its effective date. The case, Williams v. Binance, was filed by five U.S. investors from California, Nevada, and Texas, accusing Binance and its founder CZ of illegally selling unregistered securities and operating as an unregistered broker-dealer. Binance responded that all claims arising on or after February 20, 2019, have been voluntarily withdrawn by the plaintiff, and Binance will actively defend against the remaining claims.
