            "description": "According to Foresight News, Professor Ian Miers, an expert in security and applied cryptography, recently shared insights on Twitter regarding the role of cryptography in data security. Miers emphasized that cryptography is a subset of the security field rather than a theoretical branch. He cautioned against the centralized storage of highly sensitive data, even when using advanced cryptographic techniques like MPC (Multi-Party Computation) or FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption), citing examples such as global AML (Anti-Money Laundering) KYC (Know Your Customer) processes or content moderation strategies.\n\nVitalik Buterin, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency community, responded to Miers' comments by highlighting that content itself is often in plaintext. He suggested that anonymous posting combined with blocking features could be achieved through ZK (Zero-Knowledge) proofs, and AI-driven content moderation could utilize ZK proof algorithms with delayed publication.\n\nIn the context of encrypted message content moderation, such as chat control, Miers pointed out that neither TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) nor cryptography can securely handle servers viewing all messages. Buterin agreed with this assessment and proposed that client-side scanning could be a compliant method. He suggested that users could opt for local AI maintained by different organizations or choose to disable it entirely, eliminating the need for complex cryptographic solutions.",
