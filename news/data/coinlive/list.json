            "description": "According to BlockBeats, recent data from Coinglass indicates a shift in the crypto market sentiment, with participants showing increased bearishness towards altcoins following a period of decline. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's funding rate has returned to a neutral range.\n\nFunding rates are fees set by cryptocurrency trading platforms to maintain balance between contract prices and the prices of underlying assets, typically applied to perpetual contracts. This mechanism facilitates the exchange of funds between long and short traders, without the platform charging this fee, to adjust the cost or profit of holding contracts, ensuring contract prices remain close to asset prices.\n\nA funding rate of 0.01% signifies a baseline rate. When the rate exceeds 0.01%, it indicates a general bullish sentiment in the market. Conversely, a rate below 0.005% suggests a prevailing bearish outlook.",

The newly launched \"Triple Gem Pool\" and \"Whale Pool\" are designed to cater to different user needs based on the existing tiered yield model. The Triple Gem Pool technically enables concurrent use of multiple yield acceleration modes, allowing users to simultaneously enable three yield acceleration modes, raising the usage limit by one level compared to the conventional solution. This pool has a time limit and will close on November 5th. The Whale Pool is primarily for large-scale staking needs, increasing the staking limit per address to 200,000 FB. This iteration of Fractal Bitcoin's activities continues its technical approach based on the Taproot protocol, further improving the diversity of the yield structure while maintaining user asset self-custody. It is understood that the opening of the staking pool also introduced opportunities to obtain its bonus acceleration tools. Users can access the event page to obtain additional bonus tools and strategically use them in staking to gain extra returns, thereby achieving a maximum annualized return of 49.8%. This staking scheme has no lock-up period and supports full or partial release of staking at any time.",
