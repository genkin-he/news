            "description": "According to PANews, the week began with potential risks that were mitigated through concerted efforts, leading to a temporary positive shift in market sentiment. The Federal Reserve's hawkish outlook has bolstered the U.S. dollar, pushing the dollar index to a two-month high. Major U.S. tech companies reported positive earnings and outlooks, fueling the ongoing artificial intelligence boom.\n\nKey events this week include the final October S&P Global Manufacturing PMI for the U.S. on Monday at 22:45 (UTC+8), followed by a speech from 2027 FOMC voting member and San Francisco Fed President Daly on Tuesday at 01:00 (UTC+8). On Tuesday at 23:00 (UTC+8), the U.S. September JOLTs job openings data will be released.\n\nWednesday will see the release of the U.S. October ADP employment numbers at 21:15 (UTC+8). On Thursday at 21:30 (UTC+8), the initial jobless claims for the week ending November 1 will be announced.\n\nFriday features several speeches: FOMC permanent voting member and New York Fed President Williams at 00:00 (UTC+8), 2026 FOMC voting member and Cleveland Fed President Harker at the New York Economic Club at 01:00 (UTC+8), 2026 FOMC voting member and Philadelphia Fed President Paulson at 05:30 (UTC+8), and 2025 FOMC voting member and St. Louis Fed President Mussailem discussing monetary policy at 06:30 (UTC+8). Williams will also speak at the European Central Bank's monetary market conference at 16:00 (UTC+8).\n\nNext week, a significant amount of U.S. private sector data will be released. The typically overlooked JOLTS job openings and Challenger layoff data will receive attention, but the focus will primarily be on the ISM surveys and the ADP employment report. A series of weak data releases next week could reignite market expectations for a rate cut in December.",
