            "description": "Coinbase reported a net income of $433 million in the third quarter, with total revenue increasing 25% quarter-over-quarter to $1.9 billion. During the quarter, Coinbase added $299 million to its Bitcoin holdings through weekly dollar-cost averaging, bringing its total holdings to 14,548 Bitcoins. As of September 30, the fair market value of Coinbase's investment-grade crypto assets reached $2.6 billion (of which $1.6 billion was Bitcoin), with an additional $1 billion in crypto assets held as collateral, bringing Coinbase's total available resources (including crypto assets) to $15.5 billion. Notably, Coinbase's transaction revenue this quarter was $1 billion, a 37% increase quarter-over-quarter, but still significantly lower than the peak in the same period last year (Q4 2024 transaction revenue was $1.6 billion, and Q1 2025 was $1.3 billion). This trend indicates that despite rising Bitcoin prices and increased market activity, trading volume is still insufficient to significantly drive Coinbase's revenue growth. (Forbes)",

The company also stated that it expects total expenditure growth in 2026 to be significantly higher than in 2025, primarily due to rising infrastructure costs, including increased cloud computing spending and higher depreciation expenses.
