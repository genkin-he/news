The company stated that the final vote result will be disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday. Under the previously announced acquisition terms, CoreWeave plans to acquire Core Scientific at a valuation of approximately $9 billion, with shareholders receiving shares at a ratio of 0.1235 CoreWeave Class A ordinary shares for every Core Scientific share. However, several shareholders have questioned the valuation of the deal, arguing that the acquisition price significantly undervalues ​​the company. Two Seas Capital, the largest active shareholder, stated in August that the deal “seriously undervalues ​​the company and exposes shareholders to unnecessary financial risks.” Following the announcement, Core Scientific's stock price fell more than 5% on Thursday. This deal, which has garnered significant attention since last year, is seen as a landmark event in the increasing convergence of the Bitcoin mining industry and the field of artificial intelligence.

Yi Lihua recounted his experience with Ethereum (ETH), noting that when ETH fell to $1,800, he began buying, but the price continued to drop to $1,350, causing concern. The subsequent rebound to $1,450 prompted further analysis and reports at $1,750. When ETH reached $2,700, a Middle Eastern geopolitical event led to a correction down to $2,100, resulting in widespread criticism. Yi Lihua mentioned that he reduced leverage too early when ETH surpassed $3,000 and sold holdings around $4,500 instead of waiting for $4,900. He emphasized that while no one can be entirely accurate, following the correct trend can prevent fatal mistakes. He concluded by stating that buying is ultimately for selling, and selling is for buying.",
