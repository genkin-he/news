            "description": "Wojciech Kaszycki, Chief Strategy Officer of BTCS, stated that consolidation may occur among crypto treasury companies in 2026 amidst a continued market downturn. He pointed out that some companies are currently trading at a discount, with their share prices below the net asset value (NAV) of their crypto assets. Kaszycki believes that companies with actual operational businesses (such as blockchain validator services or public/private lending products) have better cash flow and are better positioned to acquire companies that only hold crypto assets but lack operating revenue. Furthermore, he mentioned that the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), especially the on-chaining of public and private lending assets, may see significant growth in the next 24 months and could become a potential revenue source for treasury companies. He also mentioned that Strategy, the world's largest Bitcoin treasury company, offers investors credit-like and fixed-income instruments, using this as a key argument for inclusion in the MSCI index.

The divergence stemmed from Anthropic's preference for explicit operational control through contract clauses, contrasting with OpenAI's focus on layered technical safety measures and legal frameworks. This emphasis on safety technology over restrictive contractual clauses may have played a role in the Department's decision to collaborate with OpenAI.",

He disclosed that Anthropic and the U.S. Department of War were once \"very close to reaching an agreement,\" and both sides had a strong desire to cooperate for most of the negotiations. However, the highly tense negotiation environment could quickly deteriorate, which may be one of the important reasons why the deal ultimately failed to materialize. In terms of security philosophy, OpenAI adopts a \"layered approach,\" which includes building a security technology stack, deploying Frontier Deployment Engineers (FDEs), involving security researchers in the project, delivering through cloud deployment, and cooperating directly with the U.S. Department of War. Compared to setting specific prohibitions in the contract, Anthropic seems to focus more on explicit restrictions at the contractual level, while OpenAI tends to rely more on the applicable legal framework and use technical security protection measures as the core guarantee. However, other companies may have different positions on this. Anthropic may hope to gain more operational control in the collaboration, which may also be one of the reasons for the divergence in their approaches.",
