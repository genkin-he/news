In fact, it is far from it.\" This goes beyond their usual disclaimer that \"policy does not follow a predetermined path,\" and is clearly an effort to regain some policy flexibility to avoid being forced to take a specific action. What if there is no government data to help clarify the economic situation? Powell pointed out that this means there is a \"very high level of uncertainty, which could be a reason for cautious action.\" (Jinshi)",
