The truth is, it's not as rosy as it seems. When ETH fell to $1800, we started buying. We panicked when it dropped to $1350. Later, we started calling for buying when it rebounded to $1450 and issued research reports at $1750. When it reached $2700, the Middle East black swan event caused a pullback to $2100, which led to us being ridiculed online as 'E Lihua.' Then, we prematurely unleveraged at over $3000 and liquidated our positions around $4500 instead of $4900. No one is 100% correct, but in the right trend, fatal mistakes are less likely. Buying is for selling, and selling is for buying.\"",
