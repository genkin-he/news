This approach involves utilizing multi-signature wallets, hardware wallets, and distributed key management to prevent losses due to physical coercion.\n\nThe experts stress the importance of digital hygiene practices, such as wallet segregation and the use of hardware security keys, to enhance security. Additionally, they recommend implementing physical security measures to further mitigate risks.
