Today, the Iranian people are proud of everything they have done to prevent war. Now is the time to defend our homeland and resist the enemy's military aggression. While preparing for negotiations, we are also ready to defend ourselves at any time. The Iranian armed forces will respond to the aggressors with overwhelming force. The Iranian armed forces will utilize all capabilities and resources to resist this heinous aggression and eliminate the enemy's threat.\" (Jin Shi)",
