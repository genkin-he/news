According to PANews, after a previous liquidation, the trader deposited approximately $250,000 to establish an ETH long position. Over three days, the position was expanded to $13.5 million through continuous rolling of positions. Currently, the trader holds a 25x leveraged ETH long position with an average price of $1,945, showing an unrealized profit of about $430,000, with a liquidation price around $1,938.\n\nRecent trading activity from this address shows a pattern of building positions with hundreds of thousands of dollars and increasing the scale and average price through rolling positions. However, these attempts often end in liquidation due to high average prices and market pullbacks. After liquidation, the trader typically deposits more funds to restart the process, possibly aiming for a significant rebound or the start of a bull market. Since October last year, the address has attempted long positions on various cryptocurrencies 162 times, including 18 attempts on ETH, with a total net deposit of approximately $15.68 million to Hyperliquid. Almost every deposit has resulted in a loss.",
