            "description": "A New York court has granted a request for interim relief from Circle, the Singapore-based liquidator representing the Multichain Foundation, ordering the company to continue freezing three wallet addresses involved in the hacking attack until further notice. This measure will prevent the transfer of USDC from these wallets. According to court documents, Circle implemented the freeze by adding the relevant addresses to a blacklist mechanism within the USDC smart contract. Multichain suffered a $210 million cross-chain bridge attack in July 2023, which included the theft of approximately $63 million in USDC. Earlier this year, Multichain entered liquidation proceedings in Singapore to recover the stolen assets. The court believes this interim relief is an effective mechanism for maintaining asset security in cross-border bankruptcy cases and helps promote judicial cooperation between the US and foreign courts. Previously, the US Department of Justice had requested Circle to freeze the addresses involved but withdrew the seizure order due to its inability to confirm the hacker's identity. Separately, a group of US investors have filed a class-action lawsuit against Circle regarding the same batch of stolen USDC, and both parties have agreed to maintain the account freeze during the litigation process.
