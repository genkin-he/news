            "description": "US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $506.5 million in net inflows on Wednesday, marking the strongest single-day intake since early February as Bitcoin climbed back above $68,000.The renewed demand has pushed weekly ETF inflows to $560.4 million, putting funds on track for their first positive week after five consecutive weeks of net outflows totaling $3.8 billion, according to data from SoSoValue.The rebound follows a sharp February sell-off that erased roughly $20 billion in net ETF assets, suggesting institutional positioning may be stabilizing.BlackRock’s IBIT Leads Inflows as Trading Volumes SurgeThe largest inflows were seen in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which attracted $297.4 million in a single session, according to data from Farside.Other notable inflows included:Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB): $39.4 millionFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC): $30.1 millionETF trading activity also rebounded sharply, with total daily volumes surpassing $4.3 billion, the highest level since Feb. 9.The resurgence in flows coincided with Bitcoin reclaiming key technical levels above $68,000, reinforcing the perception of renewed institutional engagement.Market Structure Debate IntensifiesThe rebound in ETF inflows comes amid ongoing debate about Bitcoin price discovery and the role of authorized participants (APs) and major trading firms such as Jane Street.Speculation intensified following a lawsuit tied to the 2022 collapse of Terraform Labs’ TerraUSD stablecoin. Online discussions have questioned whether derivatives exposure and ETF-related mechanics could influence Bitcoin’s price structure.Bitwise adviser Jeff Park addressed the topic on social media, emphasizing that while no authorized participant explicitly suppresses Bitcoin’s price, ETF market structure can impact how price discovery unfolds.He noted that concerns about “paper Bitcoin” — trading exposure without acquiring underlying BTC — reflect broader questions about transparency rather than direct manipulation.ETF Recovery After Prolonged PressureDespite two strong inflow days, broader sentiment remains cautious. Bitcoin has faced persistent selling pressure since October 2025, and ETF assets under management remain well below recent peaks.However, the combination of:Consecutive daily inflowsRebounding ETF trading volumesBitcoin reclaiming $68,000A potential weekly net inflow after five negative weekssuggests that institutional demand may be returning incrementally.If inflows continue and BTC holds above key support levels, ETFs could play a pivotal role in stabilizing market structure following February’s volatility.For now, the ETF market appears to be regaining momentum — but sustained buying will be necessary to confirm a broader trend reversal.",

The legislation now awaits final approval from Mike Braun, Indiana’s governor.House Bill 1042, formally titled “Regulation and Investment of Cryptocurrency,” received bicameral approval on Wednesday after the Indiana House concurred with amendments passed by the Senate. The bill was introduced by state Representative Kyle Pierce.Crypto Access for Public Retirement and Savings PlansHB 1042 requires several state-administered retirement and savings plans to offer participants a self-directed brokerage account that includes at least one cryptocurrency investment option.Plans covered under the bill include:The legislators’ defined contribution planThe Hoosier START college savings programDesignated plans under the Public Employees’ Retirement FundDesignated plans under the Teachers’ Retirement FundThe measure is designed to broaden investment choice while allowing participants to decide their own risk exposure, rather than mandating direct crypto allocation by the state.Legal Protections for Individual Crypto UseBeyond investment access, HB 1042 includes explicit protections for individual digital asset activity. The bill prevents most public agencies—excluding the Department of Financial Institutions—from enforcing rules that restrict the lawful use of cryptocurrencies.Under the bill:Individuals cannot be barred from accepting crypto as payment for legal goods and servicesResidents retain the right to hold digital assets in self-custodied or hardware walletsThe state is prohibited from imposing special or discriminatory taxes on crypto transactions that do not apply to other financial activitiesEffective Date and National ContextIf signed into law, HB 1042 will take effect on July 1, 2026.The legislation reflects a broader national shift toward integrating Bitcoin and digital assets into traditional financial frameworks while preserving user autonomy. At the federal level, Donald Trump signed an executive order in August allowing 401(k) retirement plans to include cryptocurrency investments, signaling growing acceptance of digital assets within regulated retirement systems.With final approval now resting on the governor’s desk, Indiana is positioned to become one of the more crypto-forward U.S. states in both retirement policy and individual digital asset rights, according to The Block.",
