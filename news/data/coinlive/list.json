            "description": "Willy Woo posted on the X platform that investor selling pressure has weakened, and prices have stabilized briefly. Prices could consolidate sideways for about a month, possibly even rebounding to the mid-$70 range before a pullback. This is because the overall market is strongly bearish, with both spot and futures liquidity deteriorating. He hasn't seen BTC rise when liquidity is consistently bearish. If we were to speculate, Q4 might be the end of the bearish trend, with a possible rebound in bullish momentum in the first or second quarter of 2027. Around $45,000 could be a typical bear market bottom. BTC has been in a long-term global macro bull market from 2009 to 2026. If the global macro environment deteriorates, $30,000 could become a support level for a pullback, and $16,000 might be the ultimate floor for maintaining the BTC bull market trend.",
