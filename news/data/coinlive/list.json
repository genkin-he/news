Since the Trump administration, the SEC has become more receptive, establishing a crypto task force, retracting certain enforcement actions, and initiating Project Crypto to update the regulatory framework. Recent developments include the approval of WisdomTree's crypto market fund for 24/7 trading with instant settlement, alongside plans to investigate tokenized bank deposit products.",

Under this architecture, PYUSD, issued by Paxos Trust, serves as the underlying reserve asset, while the branded stablecoin is issued by MoonPay Digital Assets. The latter recently obtained a New York State trust license, enabling it to act as a stablecoin issuer. Developers can launch custom stablecoins without having to build their own underlying technology and operational systems.
