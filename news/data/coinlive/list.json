According to BlockBeats, the growth includes $16.9 million from its newly launched HPC leasing business. Despite the revenue increase, the company reported a net loss of $661.4 million for the year, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $23.1 million.\n\nTeraWulf has labeled 2025 as a 'turning point year,' having secured long-term data center leases covering 522 megawatts of critical IT load. These contracts are expected to generate over $12.8 billion in customer revenue, supported by $6.5 billion in financing for its HPC platform development. In the fourth quarter, the company's digital asset revenue declined to $26.1 million due to decreased Bitcoin production and prices, while HPC leasing revenue rose to $9.7 million.\n\nThe company's strategy is increasingly focused on AI and cloud computing clients, with key operations centered in the Lake Mariner campus in New York and the Abernathy HPC campus in Texas. Earlier this month, TeraWulf acquired brownfield infrastructure in Kentucky and Maryland, adding approximately 1.5 GW of capacity.",
