According to ChainCatcher, as of Friday evening, the proposal had a narrow lead with 52% support, and the voting is set to conclude on Saturday.\n\nThe proposal has sparked debate due to Aave Labs' initial plan to limit the development of version 3 (v3) and force users to migrate to the yet-to-be-launched version 4 (v4). This plan faced strong opposition, leading the main contractor, Bored Ghosts Developing, to announce it would not renew its contract, criticizing the proposal as nearly absurd. In response, Aave Labs has made concessions, promising not to enforce the migration and to continue supporting v3.\n\nCritics, represented by Marc Zeller, argue that the requested funds are excessive, accounting for 31% of the DAO's reserves, and have called for the proposal to be split into multiple separate votes. However, Aave Labs is pushing for a single comprehensive vote. Currently, Aave v3 holds deposits exceeding $26.3 billion, representing over 97% of the protocol's total deposits.",
