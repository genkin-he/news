On the zCloak.Money multi-signature platform, the AI ​​agent can act as an independent signer, autonomously initiating USDC payment requests based on the x402 protocol. After the AI ​​completes the signature conforming to the EIP-3009 specification on the server side, the transaction, carrying the \"x402\" identifier, is pushed to the pending list of human collaborators. After manual review and secondary signature, the payment process is complete. In the future, AI can assist in handling various on-chain stablecoin payment scenarios, including computing resource procurement, API call settlement, and data service payments, improving enterprise resource allocation efficiency and automation levels. zCloak.Money is a fully on-chain self-custodied enterprise multisignature wallet built by zCloak Network, dedicated to providing institutional users with secure, transparent, and auditable on-chain asset management solutions.",
