            "description": "According to Foresight News, analysis by Glassnode indicates that Bitcoin long-term holders have maintained a consistent selling pressure since mid-July, keeping the market below $126,000. Data shows that the daily average selling by long-term holders increased from approximately $1 billion in mid-July to $2-3 billion by early October. Unlike previous high-selling phases in this bull market, the current distribution pattern is gradual and sustained rather than characterized by sharp, short-term sell-offs.\n\nFurther analysis by holding period reveals that investors holding Bitcoin for 6-12 months have contributed to over 50% of the recent selling pressure, particularly noticeable during the later stages of price peaks. Near Bitcoin's all-time high of $126,000, this group’s daily average selling reached $648 million, a more than fivefold increase from early 2025 baseline levels. The data also shows that these investors accumulated significant amounts of Bitcoin between October 2024 (during the U.S. election period) and April 2025, with a cost basis ranging from $70,000 to $96,000, averaging around $93,000. Analysts note that if Bitcoin's price falls below the $93,000-$96,000 range, this group would face the greatest loss pressure.",
