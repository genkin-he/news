According to Jin10, this price level was the peak during the 12-day conflict in Iran last June. Jackson cautioned that if the conflict continues to affect supply, oil prices could jump to around $100 per barrel, potentially increasing global inflation rates by 0.6 to 0.7 percentage points.\n\nIn a 'doomsday scenario,' where the Strait of Hormuz is completely blocked for 2–4 weeks due to an escalation in conflict, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have set a target price of $150–200 per barrel. This could trigger a global energy crisis, leading major economies into stagflation or recession.
