            "description": "According to Odaily, the Ether.Fi community has proposed a plan to allocate treasury funds for an ETHFI token buyback initiative. The proposal seeks to authorize the foundation to use treasury funds to repurchase ETHFI tokens when their market price falls below $3, with a total buyback amount capped at $50 million. The objective is to accumulate ETHFI tokens when prices are low and to increase the proportion of protocol revenue allocated for buybacks.\n\nThe buyback will commence immediately following DAO approval and will continue until one of the following conditions is met: the maximum amount is reached, the foundation deems the plan complete, or subsequent governance votes modify or terminate the plan.\n\nThe next step involves a four-day voting period on Snapshot. Once approved, the buyback plan will be activated as soon as the price conditions are met.",

He addressed inquiries about the accuracy of timing market bottoms and tops, explaining that the process is not as flawless as it may seem. Yi Lihua recounted his experience with Ethereum (ETH), noting that when ETH fell to $1,800, he began buying, but the price continued to drop to $1,350, causing concern. The subsequent rebound to $1,450 prompted further analysis and reports at $1,750. When ETH reached $2,700, a Middle Eastern geopolitical event led to a correction down to $2,100, resulting in widespread criticism. Yi Lihua mentioned that he reduced leverage too early when ETH surpassed $3,000 and sold holdings around $4,500 instead of waiting for $4,900. He emphasized that while no one can be entirely accurate, following the correct trend can prevent fatal mistakes. He concluded by stating that buying is ultimately for selling, and selling is for buying.",

Miers emphasized that cryptography is a subset of the security field rather than a theoretical branch. He cautioned against the centralized storage of highly sensitive data, even when using advanced cryptographic techniques like MPC (Multi-Party Computation) or FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption), citing examples such as global AML (Anti-Money Laundering) KYC (Know Your Customer) processes or content moderation strategies.\n\nVitalik Buterin, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency community, responded to Miers' comments by highlighting that content itself is often in plaintext. He suggested that anonymous posting combined with blocking features could be achieved through ZK (Zero-Knowledge) proofs, and AI-driven content moderation could utilize ZK proof algorithms with delayed publication.\n\nIn the context of encrypted message content moderation, such as chat control, Miers pointed out that neither TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) nor cryptography can securely handle servers viewing all messages. Buterin agreed with this assessment and proposed that client-side scanning could be a compliant method. He suggested that users could opt for local AI maintained by different organizations or choose to disable it entirely, eliminating the need for complex cryptographic solutions.",
