This indicates that the holdings structure is rapidly tightening, and after the energy accumulates, a potentially large fluctuation is imminent. On September 30th, the concentration of BTC holdings within 5% of the spot price rose to 15%, and shortly afterward, BTC experienced a strong rebound that broke through its all-time high. Looking at the performance of this data over the past two years, there have been eight instances where the concentration exceeded 13%, and BTC experienced varying degrees of volatility afterward each time. However, volatility measures price amplitude, not direction; price movements are unpredictable and lack any discernible pattern. What is relatively certain is that significant volatility is imminent.",
