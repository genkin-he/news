Bloomberg posted on X, highlighting concerns about the potential impact on the local housing market. As the operations wind down, there is growing apprehension among residents about the availability and affordability of rental properties.\n\nLocal authorities and housing advocates are worried that the conclusion of ICE activities could lead to increased pressure on the rental market, exacerbating existing issues of housing scarcity and rising costs. The situation has prompted calls for policy interventions to address the needs of renters who may be affected by these developments.\n\nThe Minneapolis housing market has been under strain for some time, with demand outpacing supply and rental prices climbing steadily. The end of ICE operations could further complicate the landscape, as displaced individuals and families seek new accommodations, potentially driving up competition for available units.\n\nEfforts to mitigate the impact on renters are underway, with community organizations and local government officials exploring strategies to ensure housing stability. These include initiatives to increase the availability of affordable housing and support services for those affected by the changes.\n\nAs Minneapolis navigates this transition, the focus remains on balancing the needs of renters with broader economic and social considerations.

            "description": "On February 23, Minnesota Representative Erin Koegel introduced HF 3642, a bill that proposes banning the placement or operation of cryptocurrency self-service terminals anywhere in the state. The Minnesota Department of Commerce has expressed strong support for the bill. The bill would repeal the regulatory framework established in 2024, replacing it with a blanket ban. According to data from the Minnesota Department of Commerce, the state received 70 complaints related to cryptocurrency terminals last year, reporting total losses of approximately $540,000. The state currently has about 350 licensed terminals, operated by 8 to 10 companies. Previous protections implemented in 2024 included a $2,000 daily transaction limit for new customers, mandatory fraud warnings, and a 14-day refund window, but regulators have deemed these measures inadequate. A January 3 report from the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center revealed over 12,000 complaints involving Bitcoin ATMs between January and November 2025, with total losses exceeding $333.5 million. The majority of reported losses came from individuals aged 60 and over. On February 3, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell accused cryptocurrency ATM operator Bitcoin Depot of \"willfully aiding and abetting a cryptocurrency scam,\" alleging that over half of the funds handled by the company at its Massachusetts terminals between August 2023 and January 2025 were related to fraud. The global cryptocurrency ATM market is currently valued at $356.7 million in 2025, with the United States possessing over 30,000 machines, accounting for approximately 88% of the global total. If HF 3642 passes, Minnesota will become one of the first states in the U.S. to completely eliminate physical cryptocurrency terminals.",
