Pirro stated that her office will pursue legal action to recover the funds and return them to victims as much as possible. Deddy Lavid, CEO of blockchain analytics platform Cyvers, told Decrypt that while the $580 million seizure is significant, it represents only a small fraction of global cryptocurrency fraud activity. Cyvers has identified approximately 27,000 active criminal groups with a total fraud exposure of about $27.5 billion.
