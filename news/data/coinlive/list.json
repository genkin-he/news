Bessant stated that he will conduct a second round of interviews with candidates for Fed chair in early December to replace Powell, allowing Trump to make an appointment before Christmas. Bessant said, \"The current Fed is stuck in the past. Their inflation forecasts this year have been very poor, and their models have failed.\" (Jinshi)",

Data shows that the daily average selling by long-term holders increased from approximately $1 billion in mid-July to $2-3 billion by early October. Unlike previous high-selling phases in this bull market, the current distribution pattern is gradual and sustained rather than characterized by sharp, short-term sell-offs.\n\nFurther analysis by holding period reveals that investors holding Bitcoin for 6-12 months have contributed to over 50% of the recent selling pressure, particularly noticeable during the later stages of price peaks. Near Bitcoin's all-time high of $126,000, this group’s daily average selling reached $648 million, a more than fivefold increase from early 2025 baseline levels. The data also shows that these investors accumulated significant amounts of Bitcoin between October 2024 (during the U.S. election period) and April 2025, with a cost basis ranging from $70,000 to $96,000, averaging around $93,000. Analysts note that if Bitcoin's price falls below the $93,000-$96,000 range, this group would face the greatest loss pressure.",
