The plan will launch several proof-of-concept (POC) and pilot projects through the Digital Asset Innovation Hub (DAIH), established earlier this year. A core component of the roadmap is the establishment of the Asset Tokenization Industry Working Group (IWG), jointly led by the central bank and the Securities Commission (SC), to drive industry exploration, knowledge sharing, and regulatory coordination. The initial pilots will focus on application scenarios with clear economic value, such as supply chain finance to expand credit access for SMEs, tokenized liquidity management to improve settlement efficiency, and compliant applications that can automate Islamic financial transactions. BNM also plans to study RM100-denominated tokenized deposits and stablecoin solutions to ensure monetary consistency and improve digital settlement efficiency, and will explore integration with wholesale central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This project aims to modernize financial infrastructure in tandem with Asian regulators such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).
