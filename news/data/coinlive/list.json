            "description": "Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase released their previews of the Federal Reserve meeting, including: 1. Bank of America's view on Powell and the Fed meeting: Due to limited official data and the mismatch between labor market and consumer data, Powell is unlikely to provide further economic guidance after this meeting. The statement may indicate a \"robust\" rebound in economic activity. Possible objections: hawkish objections from Milan (suggesting a 50 basis point rate cut) or Goolsby/Schmid. Quantitative tightening will end immediately. Powell's press conference may focus on the discrepancy between consumer and labor market data, and market reaction will depend on his interpretation of the strong consumer performance. Expected future rate cuts: October, June, September, and December 2026. 2. Goldman Sachs' comment on the Federal Open Market Committee: The market's focus may be on how close the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is to its own policy, with quantitative tightening (QT) being crucial. This meeting is very likely to end quantitative tightening. Future rate cut plan: 25 basis point cuts each in October and December, followed by two more cuts in 2026, with a target interest rate range of 3% to 3.25%. 3. JPMorgan Chase on the Federal Open Market Committee: The market widely expects a rate cut, and even hawkish Fed officials have not disputed market expectations. The statement is expected to remain largely unchanged—economic activity remains robust, but job growth is slowing and inflation remains high. Milan may oppose a 50 basis point rate cut; quantitative tightening will end immediately. Powell will define the easing policy as risk management and will not provide guidance on the policy direction in December. Future rate cut plan: 25 basis point cuts each in October, December, and January.",

            "description": "According to Cointelegraph, the United Kingdom has recently allowed retail investors access to crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs), a market previously restricted to professional traders. This move has ignited fierce competition among issuers, with several Bitcoin ETN providers significantly reducing their fees to attract investors. The Financial Times reports that some issuers have lowered fees to as little as 0.05%, while others continue to charge up to 2.5% annually. This competitive landscape emerged following the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) decision to lift its 2021 ban on retail access to crypto-linked funds, effective from October 8.\n\nThe policy change has been welcomed by industry figures such as Ian Taylor, board adviser at CryptoUK, who expressed satisfaction with the reversal and noted the progress made towards a more balanced approach to consumer risk. Among the newly accessible ETNs are 21Shares’ Core Bitcoin and Ethereum Core Staking ETPs, which have reduced their fees to 0.1%, Fidelity’s Physical Bitcoin ETP at 0.25%, and CoinShares’ Physical Staked Ethereum ETP, which currently has no management fee.\n\nThis regulatory shift is part of a broader initiative to bolster the United Kingdom's position in global crypto adoption, which has been lagging. A significant point of contention has been the treatment of stablecoins, with industry participants opposing the Bank of England’s (BoE) proposals for stringent corporate holding limits. Bloomberg reports that the BoE is reconsidering its stance due to concerns that the United States is advancing with the GENIUS Act, designed to establish clearer rules for stablecoin issuers.\n\nBoE Governor Andrew Bailey has recently softened his approach, moving away from previous warnings about the potential risks of private stablecoins to financial stability. He now acknowledges the innovative potential of the technology and its increasing significance in the financial system. This shift in regulatory attitude reflects a growing recognition of the need to adapt to the evolving digital asset landscape, ensuring the UK remains competitive in the global market.",

Tokenization is identified as a key driver of this activity.\n\nThe bank forecasts that as stablecoins and tokenized assets become mainstream in the financial sector, services related to transactions, custody, and data could generate nearly $100 billion in annual revenue by 2030.",
