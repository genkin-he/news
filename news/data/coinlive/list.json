            "description": "Citi Research has upgraded CK Asset Holdings (01113.HK) from neutral to buy, citing a positive outlook on the company's sale of minority stakes in UK railway projects and UK Power Networks (UKPN). According to Jin10, Citi views these transactions as a demonstration of CK Asset's ability to profit from investments and suggests a potential shift in capital reallocation priorities.\n\nCiti also noted a 5% price increase in the latest price list for the Blue Coast project, reflecting improved market conditions. The delayed launch of the Victoria Blossom project appears to align with these favorable conditions, potentially indicating an upward margin potential for development projects after CK Asset's HKD 2.3 billion provision for Wong Chuk Hang and Kai Tak projects.\n\nPotential catalysts for CK Asset include reinvestment in Hong Kong development properties, which Citi deems timely, and enhanced shareholder returns through dividends or share buybacks, possibly funded by the sale of UKPN shares. Consequently, Citi has raised the target price for CK Asset from HKD 39 to HKD 54.55.",

Prices could consolidate sideways for about a month, possibly even rebounding to the mid-$70 range before a pullback. This is because the overall market is strongly bearish, with both spot and futures liquidity deteriorating. He hasn't seen BTC rise when liquidity is consistently bearish. If we were to speculate, Q4 might be the end of the bearish trend, with a possible rebound in bullish momentum in the first or second quarter of 2027. Around $45,000 could be a typical bear market bottom. BTC has been in a long-term global macro bull market from 2009 to 2026.
