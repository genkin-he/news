I do not see the need for a rate cut this week. Without clear evidence that inflation will decrease faster than expected or that the labor market will cool more quickly, I would find it difficult to support another rate cut in December.'\n\nAlthough Logan does not have voting rights on the Fed's policy-making committee this year, she emphasized that data from the private sector, state unemployment claims, and the Fed's own business and community networks provide the central bank with a comprehensive view of the economy, which she described as 'far from concerning.'",
