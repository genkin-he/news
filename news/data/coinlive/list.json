            "description": "Circle's stock price recently climbed above $90, reaching a new high since last year, before settling around $87. According to ChainCatcher, this surge followed the company's fourth-quarter results, which exceeded market expectations, leading to a cumulative increase of about 30% in the stock price post-earnings announcement. Bernstein analysts have maintained an 'outperform' rating for Circle, setting a target price of $190, citing the company's performance as distinctly different from the broader crypto market.\n\nThe report highlights Circle's expansion in infrastructure, which is generating new revenue streams with higher profit margins, beyond just stablecoin reserve income. Analysts noted that Circle's transaction-related income continues to grow, including blockchain rewards earned as a super validator on the Canton network. Additionally, the proportion of USDC directly hosted on Circle's platform has risen to 17% of the total supply, up from 14% in the previous quarter. The company anticipates that USDC circulation will maintain an annual growth rate of about 40% and projects that revenue from non-reserve sources will reach approximately $170 million by 2026, up from about $110 million in 2025.\n\nBernstein is also optimistic about Circle's expansion into new product areas, such as the Arc platform, Circle Payments Network, and 'automated payment' capabilities for AI agents. Meanwhile, Mizuho analysts pointed out that as stablecoins find new applications in prediction markets and other scenarios, such as the Polymarket platform, Circle's revenue structure is expected to diversify further. Overall, the market's focus is gradually shifting towards whether Circle can establish a more balanced revenue structure amid the expansion of the stablecoin ecosystem.",

            "description": "US lawmakers have recently reignited discussions about stablecoin yield mechanisms, with some concerned that the yields offered by stablecoins could lead to an outflow of bank deposits and blur the lines between crypto products and traditional bank deposits. At a Senate Banking Committee hearing, Senator Angela Alsobrooks stated that while she supports financial innovation, stablecoin yield mechanisms could create products similar to bank deposits, lacking corresponding regulatory and protective measures, potentially triggering future deposit outflows. The issue of stablecoin yields has been a core topic in crypto market legislative negotiations. The GENIUS Stablecoin Act, passed in 2025, prohibits stablecoin issuers from directly paying interest to holders, but does not prohibit third-party platforms like Coinbase from offering rewards to users for holding stablecoins. Bankers believe that allowing stablecoins to offer yields would weaken the deposit base of the traditional banking system. A previous study by the Independent Community Bankers Association estimated that if stablecoin yield mechanisms were fully implemented, bank deposits could decrease by approximately $1.3 trillion, leading to a decrease of approximately $850 billion in community bank lending. The crypto industry counters that restricting stablecoin yields would stifle innovation. Some industry insiders say there is currently no evidence to suggest a significant link between the adoption of stablecoins and the outflow of bank deposits. Senator Thom Tillis stated that he will request regulators to conduct an independent assessment of the potential deposit outflow risks posed by stablecoins. Meanwhile, the White House has recently organized several meetings between banks and crypto companies, hoping to reach a solution to the stablecoin yield issue by the end of this month.",
