This morning, on the eve of Nowruz and the tenth day of Ramadan, the United States and Israel blatantly violated Iran's territorial integrity and national sovereignty, attacking defensive targets and demilitarized facilities in various cities of our country. This renewed military aggression by the United States and Israel occurred while Iran and the United States were in the midst of diplomatic negotiations. Although we are convinced of the United States and Israel's intention to carry out this renewed military aggression, in order to demonstrate our position to the international community and all countries of the world, we have once again engaged in negotiations to prove the justice of the Iranian people and expose the illegitimacy of any pretext for aggression. Today, the Iranian people are proud of everything they have done to prevent war. Now is the time to defend our homeland and resist the enemy's military aggression. While preparing for negotiations, we are also ready to defend ourselves at any time. The Iranian armed forces will respond to the aggressors with overwhelming force. The Iranian armed forces will utilize all capabilities and resources to resist this heinous aggression and eliminate the enemy's threat.\" (Jin Shi)",
