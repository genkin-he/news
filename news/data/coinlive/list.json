            "description": "In February 2026, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sold approximately 19,326 ETH, surpassing his initially announced amount by about 2,942 ETH. According to Foresight News, this move comes as the cryptocurrency market continues to experience a downturn, with Ethereum facing a six-month consecutive decline, reaching a monthly drop of nearly 30%.\n\nButerin had previously announced his plan to withdraw 16,384 ETH from his personal wallet on January 30, aiming to gradually liquidate the assets. This decision was made in response to the Ethereum Foundation's (EF) shift towards a 'moderate tightening' phase, intending to reduce annual spending from 15% to 5% of the treasury over five years, focusing more on core protocol development.\n\nThe funds from the sale are intended to support open-source projects and public goods, including privacy technologies, secure hardware, verifiable computing, encrypted communication, local-first software, open-source operating systems, biotechnology, and public health tools. These areas are considered crucial yet peripheral under EF's tightened focus, and Buterin emphasized his personal commitment to sharing the responsibility of EF's financial adjustments.\n\nThe entire sale process was transparent, utilizing on-chain tools for tracking. Buterin executed the sales through a single address and protocol, CoW Swap, in small batches to minimize market impact.\n\nDespite the transparency, the actual sale exceeded the initially announced amount. The sales began on February 3, paused for about ten days, and resumed on February 22, with significant acceleration in the last two days. Notably, 4,211.5 ETH were sold on February 5, 2,283 ETH on February 25, and 6,297 ETH on February 26.\n\nButerin has not provided further clarification on the discrepancy between the announced and actual sale amounts. He has previously stated that since 2018, he has not sold ETH for personal wealth accumulation, with proceeds primarily directed towards donations, open-source projects, or charitable causes.\n\nWhile Buterin's transparent approach contrasts with some projects that discreetly offload assets, potentially leading to market crashes or trust issues, his actions might still impact community and investor confidence. With the market already fragile, Buterin's sales could amplify fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), potentially exacerbating the bearish market pressure and affecting Ethereum's rebound and ecosystem stability.",
