            "description": "On Thursday, a New York judge temporarily extended a freeze order on wallets holding approximately $63 million worth of stolen USDC stablecoins, supporting a request from the liquidators of the defunct cryptocurrency cross-chain bridge Multichain in Singapore. Judge David S. Jones ordered Circle to keep three Ethereum wallets frozen and to retain the dollar reserves backing the stolen USDC. The liquidators warned that lifting the freeze order in the state court would cause “irreparable harm.” The order also suspended another class-action lawsuit filed by a group of U.S. investors attempting to gain control of the funds. The case was transferred to the Southern District of New York federal court last Friday after Circle invoked the Fair Class Action Act. Under Section 1519 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the order is temporary, and the court will review whether the Singapore liquidation proceedings meet the criteria for “foreign principal proceedings” to regulate cross-border bankruptcy cooperation.

            "description": "According to BlockBeats, DBS Bank analyst Ma Tieying has commented on the possibility of the Bank of Japan raising its policy rate by 25 basis points in December.\n\nThe senior economist anticipates that Japanese labor unions will set their wage negotiation targets for 2026 around November to December. She noted that the Japanese Trade Union Confederation has already indicated a wage growth target of 5% for 2026, consistent with this year's target.\n\nFurthermore, the economist mentioned that if the Federal Reserve delays its rate cut during the December meeting, the likelihood of a rate hike by the Bank of Japan in December could increase, providing a window of opportunity for action.",
