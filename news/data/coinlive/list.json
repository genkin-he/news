Key findings highlight a duopoly, with USDT and USDC commanding an 89% market share. Despite over 172 million global wallet addresses, emerging stablecoins like USDS and USD0 see over 90% of their supply concentrated in the top 10 wallets. In January, stablecoin transfers exceeded $10.3 trillion, with USDC's transaction volume nearly five times that of USDT, indicating its role as a highly active trading medium.
