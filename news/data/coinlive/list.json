            "description": "According to PANews, the Federal Reserve announced in its latest FOMC statement that starting December 1, 2024, it will roll over all maturing U.S. Treasury principal. This means that instead of withdrawing cash upon maturity, the funds will be reinvested in newly issued Treasury securities, maintaining the size of the balance sheet. This move marks the official end of a two-year balance sheet reduction process and is seen by the market as a significant signal of a shift in monetary policy from tightening to a more neutral or even accommodative stance.",

The registration and verification process on Binance TR is open from 2025-10-30, requiring users to complete identity verification (KYC) before the deadline.\n\nUsers without a verified Binance TR account are encouraged to register and verify their accounts through the official Binance TR website or mobile app. Once verification is completed, eligible users will regain access to TRY trading pairs. Those who already have a verified Binance TR account or are qualified TRY Fiat liquidity providers can continue trading TRY pairs without further action.\n\nFor users ineligible to open a Binance TR account, such as non-Turkish citizens, alternative options like the Convert feature will remain available for managing TRY balances. This update is specific to TRY Spot trading. Users who do not complete verification or are ineligible to open a Binance TR account will lose the ability to place TRY Spot orders or access TRY trading pairs on Binance.com after 2025-11-13 00:00 (UTC). However, they will still be able to view and cancel their open orders on the Spot trading page.\n\nUsers are reminded to complete verification or manage their open orders before 2025-11-27 to avoid disruptions.
