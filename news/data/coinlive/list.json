Bloomberg posted on X, highlighting the challenges posed by environmental concerns and legislative hurdles that could impede access to these valuable resources. The potential for copper extraction in Argentina is significant, yet the path to tapping into these riches is fraught with difficulties. The icy rock formations present physical barriers, while the legislative environment demands careful navigation to ensure compliance with environmental standards. As Argentina seeks to capitalize on its copper potential, the balance between economic interests and environmental preservation remains a critical consideration.",

            "description": "Data from on-chain derivatives platform Derive shows that Bitcoin options traders are building positions for a rebound to $90,000, early signs that the market may be attempting to bottom out. Sean Dawson, Head of Research at Derive, points out that Bitcoin volatility has fallen back to the 50% range, a level historically associated with consolidation rather than panic selling. The 25-delta skew indicator has rebounded from around -15% in late February to around -7%, suggesting traders are shifting from aggressive defensiveness to a more balanced outlook. Bitcoin options expiring on March 27th currently hold the largest open interest, with significant accumulation of call options at strike prices of $80,000 and $90,000, indicating bulls are positioning for a recovery towards the $85,000 to $95,000 range over the next month. However, there is still significant open interest in put options at strike prices of $60,000 and $55,000. Bitcoin is currently priced at around $84,000, down 3.2% in the past 24 hours. US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which had seen net outflows for four consecutive months, have recorded net inflows exceeding $1 billion in the past three days, including a $254.4 million net inflow on Thursday. BlackRock's IBIT and Bitwise's BITB contributed $275.8 million and $69 million respectively. Binance Research points out that hedging in the options market has reached its most extreme level since the FTX crash, and recent price movements in the crypto market are highly correlated with high-beta tech stocks. Bybit's Chief Market Analyst, Han Tan, stated that the psychological level of $70,000 has continued to suppress bullish sentiment this month, and Bitcoin may record its fifth consecutive month of decline.

Arena simulates real-world scenarios in enterprise workflows, including incomplete information, verbose context, ambiguous instructions, and conflicting sources, and records complete inference paths to help engineering teams pinpoint failures. The first challenge focuses on document reasoning, requiring AI agents to reason and compute on complex, unstructured data. Julian Love, Managing Partner of Franklin Templeton Digital Assets, stated that structured environments like Arena will help the industry distinguish between \"potential ideas\" and \"truly production-ready capabilities.\" Himanshu Tyagi, co-founder of Sentient, said that enterprises need to validate the stability and repeatability of agent inference in production environments.

            "description": "U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted $1.1 billion in net inflows over three consecutive trading days, putting funds on track for their strongest weekly performance in six weeks as Bitcoin consolidates near $66,000.The rebound marks a sharp reversal after five straight weeks of net outflows and signals renewed U.S. institutional demand.$1.1 Billion Inflows Snap Multi-Week Outflow StreakAccording to data from SoSoValue, U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $1.1 billion in net inflows across three trading sessions.After accounting for Monday’s outflows, the funds remain approximately $815 million net positive for the week, positioning them for their largest weekly gain since mid-January, when ETFs added $1.4 billion.This reversal follows five consecutive weeks of withdrawals totaling $3.8 billion.BlackRock’s IBIT Leads the SurgeThe majority of inflows flowed into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which attracted roughly $652 million over the three-day stretch — accounting for more than half of total flows.Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC recorded its largest single-day inflow since converting from a trust to an ETF structure, despite maintaining the highest fee among the group.Other funds, including Bitwise’s BITB and Ark 21Shares’ ARKB, also contributed to the rebound, though some products saw minor outflows.Coinbase Premium Turns Positive After 40 DaysThe ETF inflows coincided with a rebound in the Coinbase Premium Index, which flipped positive after 40 consecutive days in negative territory.The index measures the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase — widely used by U.S. institutions — and global exchanges. A positive premium is typically interpreted as renewed U.S. buying pressure.On-chain data from Checkonchain shows total Bitcoin holdings across U.S. spot ETFs have climbed to 1.29 million BTC, leaving assets under management less than 10% below their October peak — even though Bitcoin’s spot price remains about 45% below its all-time high.CME Open Interest Declines, Suggesting Outright BuyingWhile ETF inflows surged, CME Bitcoin futures open interest continued to decline, falling to 107,780 BTC, according to Glassnode.This detail is notable because CME is commonly used for basis trades — a strategy where institutions hold spot BTC while shorting futures. Falling open interest suggests that recent ETF inflows may represent outright long exposure, rather than hedged arbitrage positioning.In other words, investors appear to be buying spot Bitcoin exposure directly, rather than executing neutral yield strategies.“Buy the Dip” Behavior EmergesETF analyst Nate Geraci described the move as evidence that investors are “buying the dip.” Since Bitcoin’s record high in October, spot ETFs have experienced roughly $6.5 billion in cumulative outflows, a relatively modest figure compared to the $55 billion in total inflows since January 2024.Despite Bitcoin’s roughly 50% drawdown from peak levels, ETF investors appear less reactive than expected, reinforcing the view that institutional participation remains structurally supportive.Altcoin ETFs Also Turn PositiveThe improved sentiment extended beyond Bitcoin:Spot Ether ETFs added approximately $173 million over three sessionsSolana funds logged about $35 million in inflowsXRP ETFs recorded roughly $7 million in net additionsThe broader shift suggests that risk appetite may be stabilizing across digital asset investment products.Outlook: First Weekly Inflow in 6 Weeks?If momentum continues through Friday’s session, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs could record their first positive weekly flow in six weeks, marking a meaningful shift in sentiment after February’s heavy selling.With:$1.1 billion in three-day inflowsCoinbase Premium turning positiveCME open interest decliningETF BTC holdings nearing prior highsmarket participants are increasingly viewing ETF flows as a leading indicator of institutional positioning.Whether this marks the start of a sustained recovery or a tactical rebound remains to be seen — but for now, U.S. demand is clearly back in the market.",
