On the zCloak.Money multi-signature platform, the AI ​​agent can act as an independent signer, autonomously initiating USDC payment requests based on the x402 protocol. After the AI ​​completes the signature conforming to the EIP-3009 specification on the server side, the transaction, carrying the \"x402\" identifier, is pushed to the pending list of human collaborators. After manual review and secondary signature, the payment process is complete. In the future, AI can assist in handling various on-chain stablecoin payment scenarios, including computing resource procurement, API call settlement, and data service payments, improving enterprise resource allocation efficiency and automation levels. zCloak.Money is a fully on-chain self-custodied enterprise multisignature wallet built by zCloak Network, dedicated to providing institutional users with secure, transparent, and auditable on-chain asset management solutions.",

            "description": "According to Cointelegraph, institutional investors are increasingly focusing on altcoins as the next wave of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) emerges in the United States. Despite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has received at least five new altcoin ETF filings in the first half of October. Market analysts suggest that each approval could pave the way for increased institutional buying. Leon Waidmann, head of research at Web3 analytics firm Onchain, noted that altcoin ETF inflows are a natural progression following the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have demonstrated significant institutional demand. This regulatory confidence is expected to translate into substantial capital flows.\n\nSpot Ether (ETH) ETFs have notably surpassed Bitcoin (BTC) ETF inflows in the third quarter of 2025, attracting $9.6 billion compared to Bitcoin's $8.7 billion, as reported by data aggregator SosoValue. This shift indicates a growing institutional appetite for alternative crypto exposure. Analysts predict that altcoin ETFs could drive the next wave of institutional adoption, potentially resulting in sustained inflows over the coming years. Waidmann emphasized that institutions initially discovered Bitcoin through ETFs and are now expanding into Ethereum, with other altcoins likely to follow.\n\nThe industry's top traders, identified as \"smart money\" on Nansen's blockchain intelligence platform, are strategically positioning themselves for the anticipated approval of altcoin ETFs. Data from Nansen reveals that Uniswap (UNI), Aave (AAVE), and Chainlink (LINK) are the most held tokens by these traders. However, some analysts express concerns about the absence of BlackRock from the altcoin ETF landscape, which could limit overall inflows. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF has amassed $28.1 billion in investments in 2025, making it the only fund with positive year-to-date inflows. Without BlackRock's participation, spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded a cumulative net outflow of $1.27 billion year-to-date, according to Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33. Lunde explained that BlackRock's absence might restrict cumulative inflows and their potential impact on the underlying tokens, based on the dynamics observed in Bitcoin ETF investments.",
