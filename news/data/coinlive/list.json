He stated, \"The dot plot figures indicate different opinions, but we shouldn't overinterpret them. We will rely on the data to ensure appropriate decision-making.\" (Jinshi)",

            "description": "JPMorgan analysts say Circle's USDC stablecoin has surpassed Tether's USDT in terms of on-chain activity and market capitalization growth. Since January of this year, USDC's market capitalization has increased from approximately $43 billion to approximately $74 billion, a 72% increase, significantly higher than USDT's 32% growth during the same period. Analysts point out that USDC's growth is attributed to a clearer regulatory framework, transparent reserve management, regular audits, and compliance advantages under the European MiCA regulations, along with increasing institutional adoption. In contrast, USDT, which is not MiCA authorized, has faced delisting from exchanges in Europe, while USDC has driven on-chain settlements and merchant payments through integration with payment networks such as Visa, Mastercard, and Stripe. Furthermore, increased decentralized finance activity on blockchains such as Solana and Base, and Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) supporting secure cross-chain transfers, have also contributed to its growth.",

Note: The reopening of the government may affect the timeline; if the application is complete and the SEC is satisfied, the timeline may be shortened; if staff raise further concerns, the timeline may be delayed. However, it is worth noting that the SEC Chairman himself seems to support companies utilizing the automatic registration mechanism. While not directly commenting on the ETF launch, Paul Satkins stated yesterday that he was pleased to see companies like MapLight using the 20-day statutory waiting period to list during the government shutdown and praised Bitwise and Canary for using the same legal mechanism when launching their SOL, HBAR, and LTC ETFs this week.",

Revenue hit a record $180.2 million, more than doubling year-over-year (from $84.8 million in the same period last year). The growth was primarily driven by a $93.3 million increase in Bitcoin mining revenue, with the company mining 1,406 bitcoins during the quarter. Despite a 52% surge in global hashrate compared to the previous quarter, and an increase in the average cost of mining a single bitcoin (excluding depreciation) to $46,324, Riot benefited from electricity credits offsetting some of the costs. The company's adjusted EBITDA was $197.2 million, including $133.1 million in book Bitcoin gains. CEO Jason Les stated that the company is accelerating its data center expansion, including the development of the 112-megawatt Corsicana campus, with the goal of transforming into a large-scale, diversified data center operator. Riot currently holds nearly 20,000 bitcoins, worth over $2 billion, making it the second-largest holding among mining companies.
