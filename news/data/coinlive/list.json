            "description": "According to official news, on October 31st, Fractal Bitcoin officially launched two native staking pools: Triple Gem and Whale, with a total staking limit of 2.5 million FB. The newly launched \"Triple Gem Pool\" and \"Whale Pool\" are designed to cater to different user needs based on the existing tiered yield model. The Triple Gem Pool technically enables concurrent use of multiple yield acceleration modes, allowing users to simultaneously enable three yield acceleration modes, raising the usage limit by one level compared to the conventional solution. This pool has a time limit and will close on November 5th. The Whale Pool is primarily for large-scale staking needs, increasing the staking limit per address to 200,000 FB. This iteration of Fractal Bitcoin's activities continues its technical approach based on the Taproot protocol, further improving the diversity of the yield structure while maintaining user asset self-custody. It is understood that the opening of the staking pool also introduced opportunities to obtain its bonus acceleration tools. Users can access the event page to obtain additional bonus tools and strategically use them in staking to gain extra returns, thereby achieving a maximum annualized return of 49.8%. This staking scheme has no lock-up period and supports full or partial release of staking at any time.",

This measure will prevent the transfer of USDC from these wallets. According to court documents, Circle implemented the freeze by adding the relevant addresses to a blacklist mechanism within the USDC smart contract. Multichain suffered a $210 million cross-chain bridge attack in July 2023, which included the theft of approximately $63 million in USDC. Earlier this year, Multichain entered liquidation proceedings in Singapore to recover the stolen assets. The court believes this interim relief is an effective mechanism for maintaining asset security in cross-border bankruptcy cases and helps promote judicial cooperation between the US and foreign courts. Previously, the US Department of Justice had requested Circle to freeze the addresses involved but withdrew the seizure order due to its inability to confirm the hacker's identity. Separately, a group of US investors have filed a class-action lawsuit against Circle regarding the same batch of stolen USDC, and both parties have agreed to maintain the account freeze during the litigation process.
