Elliptic points out that the Central Bank of Iran received at least $507 million in USDT in 2025 for stabilizing the rial and trade settlements. The Iranian government's Bitcoin mining cost is approximately $1,300 per coin, which is sold at market price. Recent US-Israeli military strikes against Iran may disrupt the power grid, thereby affecting energy-intensive mining activities. (CoinDesk)",
