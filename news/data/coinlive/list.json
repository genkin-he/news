            "description": "Tools for Humanity (TFH), the development team behind Worldcoin, is collaborating with Gap, Visa, and Tinder to promote the application of its \"World ID\" biometric authentication product. Reports indicate that some Gap stores in San Francisco have already deployed \"Orb\" devices to collect facial and iris information from users to generate World IDs. Simultaneously, TFH plans to launch a Visa-linked payment card, allowing World ID holders to use digital assets for purchases. Dating app Tinder is also testing the identity system in Japan to verify users' identities and age information. TFH states that the Orb device converts facial and iris images into anonymous digital identifiers and stores them on the user's device; the company itself does not retain the original biometric data. Its business model aims to generate revenue by charging applications for verification services. (Wall Street Journal)",

However, such behavior is typically intraday speculation, with prices often returning to normal within seconds or minutes, having limited impact on the long-term trend of highly liquid assets like Bitcoin ETFs. He pointed out that the main reason for this round of BTC decline was the selling of tens of thousands of BTC by early holders, coupled with insufficient market buying. Ari Paul believes that while long-term large-scale manipulation is not entirely impossible, it is less likely and carries higher risk. In most cases, market deviations from expectations should not be simply attributed to \"manipulation,\" and investors should optimize their analytical frameworks.
