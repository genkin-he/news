The global M2, which includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money, is often seen as an indicator of economic health and liquidity. However, Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency, has not shown a corresponding increase in value, prompting discussions about its role and behavior in the current economic climate.
