According to Jin10, the KBW Bank Index fell by 4.7% on Friday, reaching its lowest level since December last year, and is on track to record its worst monthly performance since March. Throughout this month, banks, payment service providers, and asset management firms have faced substantial challenges, primarily due to issues in the private credit sector and the emergence of new AI applications.\n\nBlock's decision to lay off nearly half of its workforce on Thursday night has heightened concerns about AI's potential to disrupt various economic sectors. Additionally, credit spreads have begun to widen, exacerbated by the collapse of MFS, a UK mortgage lender backed by Wall Street, which has fueled fears of rising default risks in the opaque private loan market.\n\nAnalyst Herman Chan commented, \"Banks are entering a more volatile period, with many unknowns regarding the pace of AI applications and disruptions. The rise in government bond prices combined with widening credit spreads indicates a market in a risk-averse state.\"",
