            "description": "In a post on the X platform, Vitalik stated that Ethereum has been discussing Account Abstraction (AA) since early 2016, and now EIP-8141, as a comprehensive proposal, aims to solve all the remaining issues related to AA. The core concept of this proposal is \"frame transactions,\" where a transaction contains N calls that can read each other's call data and authorize senders and gas payers. This mechanism supports multiple use cases: ordinary account transactions (such as multi-signature, variable keys, and quantum-resistant signature schemes) are completed through verification frames and execution frames; when paying gas fees using non-ETH tokens, it can be achieved through the payment main contract without any intermediaries; regarding privacy protocols, it can be achieved by verifying ZK-SNARKs or adding two-dimensional random numbers through the payment contract. In terms of security, at the on-chain level, transactions are only valid when the verification frame returns ACCEPT with a payment gas flag; at the mempool level, conservative rules will be used initially, with gradual expansion later. EIP-8141 is highly complementary to FOCIL; FOCIL ensures rapid transaction inclusion, while AA ensures that complex operations can be executed directly as first-class transactions. The proposal is also discussing EOA compatibility, which is feasible in principle. After more than a decade of research, these technologies are expected to be implemented through a Hegota fork within a year.",
