Custodia argued that the Fed had no right to reject master account applications. Last year, a federal judge dismissed Custodia's lawsuit, ruling that the Fed was not obligated to grant master accounts to every eligible depository institution. The company subsequently appealed, and a panel of three judges heard arguments from both sides in January of this year. (Coindesk)",
