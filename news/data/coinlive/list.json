The Senate announced the approval of a joint resolution to end the national emergency declared by the President for implementing global tariffs. Earlier this week, the Senate passed two resolutions aimed at removing tariffs imposed on Canada and Brazil.\n\nThese resolutions now require approval from the House of Representatives. However, previous attempts to overturn tariff legislation have been blocked by House Republicans, making it unlikely for these resolutions to proceed to a vote.

Fusaka was activated on the Hoodi testnet earlier this week, marking the final step towards its mainnet activation. Earlier this month, it was successfully deployed on the Holesky and Sepolia testnets.\n\nThe backward-compatible Fusaka hard fork will implement approximately a dozen Ethereum Improvement Proposals aimed at enhancing the sustainability, security, and scalability of the base chain and its surrounding layer-two ecosystem. Notably, Fusaka will introduce 'Peer Data Availability Sampling' (PeerDAS), a technology designed to simplify data access for validators. PeerDAS was initially planned for Ethereum's previous major upgrade in February, known as Pectra, but was delayed for further testing.

The firm said Thursday that its asset and wealth management division, in partnership with fund manager Citco, completed its first transaction using a new system called Kinexys Fund Flow. This system automates the recording of alternative investment fund activity on a private blockchain. The tool tokenizes investor records and uses smart contracts to automatically transfer cash between JPMorgan brokerage accounts and fund managers, replacing the manual reconciliation and wire transfer methods currently dominant in private fund operations. The system runs on the same permissioned Kinexys network that underpins JPMorgan's tokenized deposit and payment products. Kinexys Fund Flow is expected to be fully rolled out early next year, with more features to be added by 2026. Citco stated that the technology can reduce error rates and costs across the industry, while JPMorgan sees it as part of a broader initiative to modernize alternative asset distribution and services.
