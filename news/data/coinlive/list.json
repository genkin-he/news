According to NS3.AI, Wales predicts that while Bitcoin may continue to exist as a network, its price could fall below $10,000 by 2050. He cites Bitcoin's limited adoption and volatility as reasons for its unlikely success as a dominant form of money or a safe haven asset. While some analysts share this bearish outlook, others caution against overreacting to price fluctuations, leaving Bitcoin's long-term role in the financial landscape uncertain.",

Wall Street Journal (Markets) posted on X that the healthcare provider plans to list on the Malaysian stock exchange, marking a significant move in the country's financial markets. The IPO is expected to attract substantial investor interest, given the size and potential of the healthcare sector in Malaysia.\n\nSunway Healthcare's decision to go public comes amid a growing demand for healthcare services in the region, driven by an aging population and increased healthcare spending. The company operates several hospitals and healthcare facilities across Malaysia, positioning itself as a key player in the industry.\n\nThe IPO is anticipated to boost the Malaysian stock market, which has seen limited large-scale listings in recent years. Analysts suggest that Sunway Healthcare's public offering could pave the way for more companies in the sector to consider similar moves, potentially revitalizing the market.\n\nInvestors are closely watching the development, as the IPO could set a benchmark for future listings in Malaysia. The healthcare group's strong market presence and growth prospects are expected to be key factors in attracting investment.

            "description": "Matrixport released a chart today stating that Bitcoin saw almost no significant volatility this week, which precisely illustrates the importance of paying attention at this juncture. Beneath the calm surface, the market structure is subtly shifting. Approximately $2.5 billion in gamma exposure is nearing its monthly clearing, and $26.7 billion has been withdrawn from the market since the peak, with overall positioning approaching a reset. The dominant factor driving future price movements may gradually shift from options mechanisms to liquidity itself. In this report, we will focus on three key points: whether the recent rebound is misleading and sufficient to constitute a trend reversal; where will passive hedging pressure primarily concentrate after options expire; and what conditions the market needs to meet to support more sustainable stabilization. Perhaps the most noteworthy phase of this cycle has only just begun. Currently, Bitcoin's price is roughly flat compared to a week ago, but the trend is not stable. The previous rapid decline, and the subsequent equally rapid rebound, were largely related to the options positioning structure. Market makers had been maintaining shortgamma positions. As prices fell, they were forced to sell futures to hedge their exposure, which amplified the decline and accelerated the price toward $63,000.",
