According to Ming Pao, this situation has raised concerns among Hong Kong travelers who often transit through Dubai and Doha on Emirates or Qatar Airways flights to Europe and Africa. The insurance comparison platform 10Life highlighted in a blog post that most travel insurance policies include coverage for 'airport closures' under 'trip delay' benefits, typically activated after a delay of five to six hours. However, 10Life pointed out that unlike cancellation coverage, most delay clauses do not explicitly exempt war-related incidents. This means that insurance companies could potentially deny claims if the delay is due to military conflict. 10Life urges insurance companies to clarify their stance on this issue promptly.",

Among them, the contract for the event \"Will Khamenei lose his position as Iran's Supreme Leader before March 31?\" was 100% settled after Iranian state television confirmed his death, with a trading volume of $45 million.
