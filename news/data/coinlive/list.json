            "description": "A report from CPM Group highlights misconceptions about silver usage in missiles. According to Jin10, some promoters have claimed that missiles worldwide consume large amounts of silver in a non-recoverable manner, with assertions that each 'Tomahawk' missile contains 482 or 500 ounces of silver. However, informed sources reveal that the actual silver content in a 'Tomahawk' missile is approximately 10 to 15 ounces, primarily found in solder and ignition batteries, rather than the exaggerated figures. Smaller missiles used in regions like Ukraine and the Middle East reportedly contain less than an ounce of silver, also located in solder and ignition batteries.",

According to Jin10, this price level was the peak during the 12-day conflict in Iran last June. Jackson cautioned that if the conflict continues to affect supply, oil prices could jump to around $100 per barrel, potentially increasing global inflation rates by 0.6 to 0.7 percentage points.\n\nIn a 'doomsday scenario,' where the Strait of Hormuz is completely blocked for 2–4 weeks due to an escalation in conflict, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have set a target price of $150–200 per barrel. This could trigger a global energy crisis, leading major economies into stagflation or recession. Historically, the second oil crisis in the late 1970s caused international oil prices to soar by over 200%, resulting in a recession in the United States.",
