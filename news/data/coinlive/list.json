            "description": "Bitcoin mining company Core Scientific failed to secure approval for its merger plan with AI infrastructure company CoreWeave at its shareholder meeting on Thursday. The company stated that the final vote result will be disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday. Under the previously announced acquisition terms, CoreWeave plans to acquire Core Scientific at a valuation of approximately $9 billion, with shareholders receiving shares at a ratio of 0.1235 CoreWeave Class A ordinary shares for every Core Scientific share. However, several shareholders have questioned the valuation of the deal, arguing that the acquisition price significantly undervalues ​​the company. Two Seas Capital, the largest active shareholder, stated in August that the deal “seriously undervalues ​​the company and exposes shareholders to unnecessary financial risks.” Following the announcement, Core Scientific's stock price fell more than 5% on Thursday. This deal, which has garnered significant attention since last year, is seen as a landmark event in the increasing convergence of the Bitcoin mining industry and the field of artificial intelligence.

The proposal seeks to authorize the foundation to use treasury funds to repurchase ETHFI tokens when their market price falls below $3, with a total buyback amount capped at $50 million. The objective is to accumulate ETHFI tokens when prices are low and to increase the proportion of protocol revenue allocated for buybacks.\n\nThe buyback will commence immediately following DAO approval and will continue until one of the following conditions is met: the maximum amount is reached, the foundation deems the plan complete, or subsequent governance votes modify or terminate the plan.\n\nThe next step involves a four-day voting period on Snapshot. Once approved, the buyback plan will be activated as soon as the price conditions are met.",

He addressed inquiries about the accuracy of timing market bottoms and tops, explaining that the process is not as flawless as it may seem. Yi Lihua recounted his experience with Ethereum (ETH), noting that when ETH fell to $1,800, he began buying, but the price continued to drop to $1,350, causing concern. The subsequent rebound to $1,450 prompted further analysis and reports at $1,750. When ETH reached $2,700, a Middle Eastern geopolitical event led to a correction down to $2,100, resulting in widespread criticism. Yi Lihua mentioned that he reduced leverage too early when ETH surpassed $3,000 and sold holdings around $4,500 instead of waiting for $4,900. He emphasized that while no one can be entirely accurate, following the correct trend can prevent fatal mistakes. He concluded by stating that buying is ultimately for selling, and selling is for buying.",
