What the Data Is Showing Perpetual market directional premium measures the degree to which traders are paying a premium to hold leveraged long positions. When that premium is elevated, it indicates crowded long positioning and a market that is leaning heavily in one direction. When it compresses, the long bias is fading, funding rates are normalizing, and open interest is cooling as speculative capital exits its positions\nsource: https://www.ethnews.com/bitcoins-perpetual-markets-are-quietly-resetting-and-that-may-be-exactly-what-the-market-needs/",
