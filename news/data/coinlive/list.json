            "description": "Benchmark reiterated its buy rating on Hut 8 and set a price target of $85, noting that management will focus on execution and delivery in 2026 to advance its AI data center strategy. This statement directly quotes CEO Asher Genoot's remarks during the company's Q4 earnings call. Speaking about the flagship River Bend campus in Louisiana, Genoot stated that \"2026 will be 1000% focused on execution and delivery,\" adding that construction is \"on schedule.\" Analyst Mark Palmer noted in a report on Wednesday that while Q4 results were impacted by book losses on Bitcoin, more importantly, Hut 8 is steadily transitioning into a power-first digital infrastructure platform with a clearer long-term contract cash flow path. Hut 8 reported a net loss of $301.8 million in Q4, primarily due to $401.9 million in unrealized digital asset losses. Revenue nearly tripled year-over-year to $88.5 million, with significant improvement in computing revenue. Palmer continues to argue that the 15-year, 245-megawatt River Bend IT lease with Fluidstack, financially backed by Google, is central to his investment argument. The approximately $7 billion base lease helps Hut 8's valuation align with infrastructure multiples. Benchmark's $85 price target is based on what Palmer calls a \"piece-for-piece\" valuation model, which includes the River Bend lease, a probability-weighted valuation of up to 1,000 megawatts under the first-purchase option, the market value of Hut 8's 60% stake in American Bitcoin, and its Bitcoin holdings. As of Thursday morning, Hut 8 shares were trading slightly below $55, down about 1.5% on the day. The stock remains below its recent high of around $66, but has risen over 300% in the past year, even as Bitcoin has fallen about 27% over the same period. (The Block)",

TradingView data shows that BTC/USD fell by more than 1% on the day, having previously touched the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) and the all-time high of 2021 at $70,040, but failed to hold. Rekt Capital states that the 200-week EMA has now become a resistance level, and historical data shows that if Bitcoin continues to fall below this level, the price tends to decline further. The liquidity ladder below $69,000 has been exhausted, and the momentum has been lost. Yesterday's rally pushed the price to the previous cycle high and the 12-hour trendline before being retraced. The trend remains clear, and caution is advised. Rekt Capital further points out that the shortest Bitcoin bear market lasted 365 days, and it has currently entered its 140th day, meaning it is not yet time to exit the bear market. Historically, bear markets typically see declines of around 80%, and BTC's largest retracement from its October 2025 high of $126,200 to its 15-month low in February was approximately 53%.
