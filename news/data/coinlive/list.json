            "description": "According to Cointelegraph, maximal extractable value (MEV) is a process where miners or validators reorder transactions within a block to extract profits, posing significant challenges for financial institutions considering decentralized finance (DeFi). Aditya Palepu, CEO of DEX Labs and lead contributor to DerivaDEX, a decentralized crypto derivatives exchange, highlights that MEV is a barrier to institutional adoption, which ultimately impacts retail users.\n\nPalepu explains that all electronically-traded markets face issues similar to MEV due to information asymmetry in ordering trading transaction data. He suggests that the solution lies in preventing order flow data from being visible before execution. This can be achieved by processing transactions in trusted execution environments, which handle transactions privately through mechanisms like funded vaults. These environments encrypt trading intentions client-side and decrypt them only within secure enclaves after sequencing, making front-running transactions impossible and protecting users from market manipulation tactics such as sandwich attacks.\n\nThe presence of MEV in crypto and DeFi infrastructure has sparked debate among industry leaders and protocol founders. They are concerned about MEV's potential to increase centralization, drive up costs, and hinder mass adoption. Palepu notes that the lack of transaction privacy deters financial institutions from engaging with DeFi, as it exposes them to market manipulation and front-running risks. He emphasizes that institutional participation is crucial for the smooth functioning of financial markets, as they provide the necessary trading infrastructure.\n\nPalepu further explains that institutions offer non-extractive arbitrage trading opportunities that help dampen price volatility and maintain asset prices at parity across exchanges. He warns that without institutional involvement, liquidity can dry up, volatility can spike, market manipulation can increase, and transaction costs can surge. The vibrancy and diversity of participation in exchanges are essential for a healthy marketplace, and the absence of institutional players can significantly impact these dynamics.",
