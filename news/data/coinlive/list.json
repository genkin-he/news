            "description": "The recent airstrikes by the United States and Israel on Iran have led to escalating conflicts in several Middle Eastern countries. According to Ming Pao, this situation has raised concerns among Hong Kong travelers who often transit through Dubai and Doha on Emirates or Qatar Airways flights to Europe and Africa. The insurance comparison platform 10Life highlighted in a blog post that most travel insurance policies include coverage for 'airport closures' under 'trip delay' benefits, typically activated after a delay of five to six hours. However, 10Life pointed out that unlike cancellation coverage, most delay clauses do not explicitly exempt war-related incidents. This means that insurance companies could potentially deny claims if the delay is due to military conflict. 10Life urges insurance companies to clarify their stance on this issue promptly.",

Since the attacks, the market has attracted approximately $600 million in trading volume. Among them, the contract for the event \"Will Khamenei lose his position as Iran's Supreme Leader before March 31?\" was 100% settled after Iranian state television confirmed his death, with a trading volume of $45 million. The biggest winner, the account \"Curseaaaaaaa,\" profited approximately $757,000 through a \"Yes\" position, and four other traders profited over six figures. Furthermore, the largest single event contract is the contract for the event \"When will the US launch airstrikes against Iran?\", which has accumulated a trading volume of $529 million since its launch on December 22 last year, with a single-day trading volume of $89.6 million on February 28. Subsequent market activity showed that traders were generally betting on a phased resolution to the conflict within weeks: the probability of a ceasefire between the US and Iran was only 4% before March 2nd, 15% before March 6th, but rose to 61% before March 31st, and reached 78% before April 30th.
