            "description": "According to Foresight News, Professor Ian Miers, an expert in security and applied cryptography, recently shared insights on Twitter regarding the role of cryptography in data security. Miers emphasized that cryptography is a subset of the security field rather than a theoretical branch. He cautioned against the centralized storage of highly sensitive data, even when using advanced cryptographic techniques like MPC (Multi-Party Computation) or FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption), citing examples such as global AML (Anti-Money Laundering) KYC (Know Your Customer) processes or content moderation strategies.\n\nVitalik Buterin, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency community, responded to Miers' comments by highlighting that content itself is often in plaintext. He suggested that anonymous posting combined with blocking features could be achieved through ZK (Zero-Knowledge) proofs, and AI-driven content moderation could utilize ZK proof algorithms with delayed publication.\n\nIn the context of encrypted message content moderation, such as chat control, Miers pointed out that neither TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) nor cryptography can securely handle servers viewing all messages. Buterin agreed with this assessment and proposed that client-side scanning could be a compliant method. He suggested that users could opt for local AI maintained by different organizations or choose to disable it entirely, eliminating the need for complex cryptographic solutions.",

Later, we started calling for buying when it rebounded to $1450 and issued research reports at $1750. When it reached $2700, the Middle East black swan event caused a pullback to $2100, which led to us being ridiculed online as 'E Lihua.' Then, we prematurely unleveraged at over $3000 and liquidated our positions around $4500 instead of $4900. No one is 100% correct, but in the right trend, fatal mistakes are less likely.

Judge David S. Jones ordered Circle to keep three Ethereum wallets frozen and to retain the dollar reserves backing the stolen USDC. The liquidators warned that lifting the freeze order in the state court would cause “irreparable harm.” The order also suspended another class-action lawsuit filed by a group of U.S. investors attempting to gain control of the funds. The case was transferred to the Southern District of New York federal court last Friday after Circle invoked the Fair Class Action Act. Under Section 1519 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the order is temporary, and the court will review whether the Singapore liquidation proceedings meet the criteria for “foreign principal proceedings” to regulate cross-border bankruptcy cooperation.
