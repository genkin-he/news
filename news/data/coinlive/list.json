The letter cites reports that approximately $1.7 billion in digital assets flowed through Binance to entities linked to Iranian terrorism, including organizations affiliated with Houthis and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Investigators also found access to over 1,500 accounts by Iranian users, and potential activities related to circumventing Russian sanctions. The letter further notes that some Binance compliance personnel who discovered suspicious transactions were subsequently dismissed, and law enforcement agencies stated that Binance's cooperation in providing customer information has declined. Senators Chris Van Hollen, Ruben Gallego, and nine other senators co-signed the letter, expressing concerns about Binance's payment cards and stablecoin-related projects in the former Soviet Union region, arguing that these products could be used to circumvent sanctions. The senators requested that relevant agencies report on the progress of the review by March 13. In addition, Senator Richard Blumenthal launched a congressional investigation into Binance on Tuesday, requesting relevant documents and internal records from Binance CEO Richard Teng. Binance denies the allegations, stating that it has identified and reported suspicious activity to authorities and does not allow Iranian users to use its platform. (Cointelegraph)",
