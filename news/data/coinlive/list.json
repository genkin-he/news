            "description": "According to Cointelegraph, ARK Invest, led by Cathie Wood, has increased its investment in Bullish, a digital asset exchange that recently went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker BLSH. The firm acquired over $5 million worth of shares across multiple exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This move is part of ARK Invest's ongoing strategy to expand its holdings in the digital asset sector.\n\nThe recent acquisition includes 72,537 shares purchased by the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), 21,354 shares by the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), and 11,122 shares by the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). This follows a previous purchase in mid-October, where ARK Invest acquired $8.27 million in Bullish shares through two of its funds. Since Bullish's $1.1 billion debut on the NYSE, ARK has accumulated approximately $172 million worth of shares across its funds. Bullish shares experienced a 1.24% increase on Friday, closing at $50.57, as the market showed signs of recovery from earlier volatility. The exchange, supported by Block.one and led by CEO Tom Farley, continues to attract attention from investors.\n\nThe timing of these purchases aligns with Bullish's recent launch event in New York, marking its expansion into the U.S. market. The event brought together leaders in the digital asset industry to celebrate this milestone. Bullish expressed enthusiasm about its future prospects, highlighting the positive atmosphere at the event. In early October, Bullish officially launched operations in 20 U.S. states after obtaining a BitLicense and a money transmission license from New York regulators. The platform commenced spot trading with BitGo and Nonco as its initial clients.\n\nSince its global launch in 2021, Bullish has processed over $1.5 trillion in trades and has established itself among the top 10 exchanges by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) trading volume. This expansion into the U.S. market is expected to further solidify its position in the digital asset exchange landscape.",

This indicates that the holdings structure is rapidly tightening, and after the energy accumulates, a potentially large fluctuation is imminent. On September 30th, the concentration of BTC holdings within 5% of the spot price rose to 15%, and shortly afterward, BTC experienced a strong rebound that broke through its all-time high. Looking at the performance of this data over the past two years, there have been eight instances where the concentration exceeded 13%, and BTC experienced varying degrees of volatility afterward each time.

Data analytics website CoinGlass shows that Bitcoin's volatility is currently below 2%, a historical low. Around the time of the third halving in 2020, Bitcoin volatility exceeded 5%, but this time the situation has changed significantly. Keiji Maeda, an executive at the Japanese crypto company Backsea, believes that the rule of thumb for Bitcoin halvings has broken down, and a stable bull market may continue. With increased market liquidity, the influence of short-term trading by individual investors has weakened; it can be said that the self-fulfilling prophecy of the rule of thumb driving speculative selling is no longer able to sway the market.
