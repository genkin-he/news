Furthermore, the analyst stated that while the possibility of global gold prices reaching $6,000 in extreme scenarios cannot be ruled out, its trajectory will largely depend on how the conflict evolves. In the short term, increased market volatility and risk aversion are likely to continue supporting gold prices. Jigar Trivedi, senior research analyst at IndusInd Securities, believes that the unprecedented strikes by the US and Israel against Iran have exacerbated tensions in the Middle East and raised concerns about potential disruptions to global energy supplies, potentially providing new upward momentum for New York gold futures driven by safe-haven buying. Since the beginning of the year, ongoing geopolitical tensions have supported prices. Gold closed higher last Friday, and the precious metals market is likely to gap up again on Monday. (Jinshi)",

The situation in Iran is still rapidly changing, and CITIC Securities anticipates that it is difficult to predict and interpret the final scenario in one go. It is more likely that the situation will continue to fluctuate based on important signals. CITIC Securities believes that whether there are potential changes in three key signals—US military mobilization, changes in the Iranian political situation, and the scope of the conflict's spillover—will determine whether the global market impact will be an amplified version of the \"12-Day War\" in June 2025, or a more extreme scenario. To provide a reference for the potential market impact, CITIC Securities reviewed the market impact of eight major conflicts in the Middle East since 1970, summarizing the following patterns: gold is a better safe-haven asset than the US dollar; oil prices still depend on supply and demand in the long term; US stock market performance is directly related to the degree of US military intervention and the course of the war; and there is no significant impact on Chinese assets.
