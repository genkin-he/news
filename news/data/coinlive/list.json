            "description": "Ryan VanGrack, Coinbase's Vice President of Legal Affairs and Head of Global Litigation, stated that some U.S. state governments are \"misleading the public\" and misinterpreting federal law in their restrictions on prediction market businesses, attempting to expand state-level regulatory power. Following its recent partnership with prediction market platform Kalshi to launch related products, Coinbase has filed lawsuits in Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, and Nevada. Regulatory agencies in these states previously issued stop-loss orders or warnings, deeming contracts related to sports events illegal betting. VanGrack stated that these actions pose a \"real and imminent threat\" to users, prompting Coinbase to seek a federal court ruling. VanGrack pointed out that the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act explicitly grants the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) exclusive jurisdiction over the derivatives market, and prediction market products, including event contracts, should fall under federal regulation. He believes that the states' attempts to exclude sports event contracts from the definition of derivatives lack legal basis. VanGrack denied claims by some state governments that the market would lack regulation without state-level intervention, emphasizing that the CFTC has long overseen the multi-trillion-dollar derivatives market and has already issued enforcement warnings regarding insider trading in event contracts. Coinbase also pointed out that exchange-based prediction markets are fundamentally different from traditional sports betting. In CFTC-regulated exchanges like Kalshi, prices are determined by market participants, while traditional betting institutions have operators setting odds and directly betting against each other. VanGrack stated that states can still play a role in consumer protection and anti-fraud, but placing the national derivatives market under a \"hodgepodge of 50 different regulatory agencies\" would damage market stability and investor confidence.",

The earnings report showed that Block.com achieved operating profit of $485 million in the fourth quarter, with adjusted operating profit reaching $588 million. Net income attributable to common shareholders was $116 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $930 million. The company also raised its 2026 gross profit guidance to $12.2 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 18%. Block.com CEO Jack Dorsey recently announced that the company will lay off more than 40% of its workforce, reducing its total number of employees from over 10,000 to less than 6,000, in order to promote a leaner, AI-centric operating model. Analysts believe that Block.com is one of the first fintech companies to fundamentally reassess its workforce structure and productivity. In addition, the company recently increased its holdings by 103 Bitcoins, bringing its total holdings to approximately 8,883 BTC, worth about $577 million, making it the fourteenth largest enterprise in the world in terms of Bitcoin holdings. Dorsey stated that the company rapidly expanded its workforce during the pandemic, while simultaneously establishing separate systems for Square and Cash App, resulting in redundant personnel. Block is currently pushing for organizational consolidation and plans to increase gross profit per employee to over $2 million, approximately four times the pre-pandemic level.

Gox, recently proposed a Bitcoin hard fork to recover approximately 79,956 BTC stolen in the 2011 hack, worth about $5.2 billion at current prices. The proposal targets a wallet address associated with the 2011 Mt. Gox system breach, which received nearly 80,000 Bitcoins after the attack and remained untouched for over 15 years. Under current Bitcoin rules, these funds can only be transferred if the corresponding private key is held. The proposal would allow the unspent outputs of a recovered Mt. Gox address to be controlled via a signature, thus bringing the funds into the existing judicial oversight and compensation process to repay Mt. Gox creditors. Karpelès stated that this proposal is merely a starting point for discussion, intending to limit the rule change to a single address and activate it at a future block height. However, the proposal also acknowledges that this plan requires a coordinated upgrade across the entire network, and if some community members refuse to support it, it could lead to a risk of a blockchain split. It's important to note that these approximately 80,000 BTC are not currently part of the assets allocated to Mt. Gox creditors, nor are they controlled by the bankruptcy trustee.",
