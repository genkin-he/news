            "description": "Zhou Hongyi, founder of 360 Group, stated on his personal social media that the Bitcoin migration in the Chen Zhi case of Prince Group occurred in 2020, during Trump's first term. After Biden took office in 2021, the United States discovered that the origin of these cryptocurrencies was unclear, but did not immediately take action to openly seize them. Instead, it kept the assets in a technologically controllable dormant state for a long time until Trump took office again in 2025. Only then did the US government take the opportunity to publicly announce the seizure of these assets. However, what is strange is that, according to the legal documents of the US government's lawsuit against Chen Zhi, no US citizens were victims of telecommunications fraud before the theft of these digital assets. This is like shooting an arrow before finding a target. To be more specific, the United States has formed a perfect closed loop of \"attack, harvest, and evidence collection\". Ironically, after the U.S. Department of Justice released the indictment on October 8, 2025, several so-called victim compensation groups emerged in the United States. However, in-depth analysis revealed that these claimants were victims of telecom fraud from May 2020 to August 2022, and the time and flow of assets did not match up with this batch of Bitcoins. In other words, this batch of Bitcoins was stolen by hackers as early as December 2020, and has absolutely nothing to do with these so-called victims in the United States. The so-called victims are merely a backdrop to provide witnesses for the \"legal confiscation.\" The entire indictment itself is riddled with loopholes and is a typical piecemeal compilation. For example, the \"cell phone wall\" image in the indictment is actually a criminal tool used by online troll groups exposed by CCTV's 315 Gala in March 2023. The stools in the image are common and frequently used in China. This kind of low-level error of misattribution not only exposes the sloppy evidence collection process, but also reveals the true intention of using the fight against crime as a pretext to cover up the nature of asset plunder. Therefore, the most terrifying thing about state-sponsored attacks is not a single breakthrough, but long-term infiltration and control. Once the rules and law enforcement conditions are met, the entire operation can be carried out in one go. You may think they are fighting crime, but in reality, they are often turning other people's assets into their own \"strategic reserves.\"",
