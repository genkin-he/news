According to RTHK, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Lo Suk-pui, announced at a press conference that the new show is expected to launch in the second half of this year, marking the end of the 'Symphony of Lights' after over 20 years. The government is considering organizing a farewell event for the iconic show.\n\nLo explained that significantly altering the 'Symphony of Lights' would require extensive discussions with participating buildings, which could be inefficient. In contrast, the new light show offers flexibility in changing its content and can be tailored to various festive occasions, such as the Mid-Autumn Festival and Halloween. The Tourism Board is exploring the possibility of hosting the show at The Peak to enhance the appeal of traditional attractions. Lo noted that the show will not be held nightly, which could increase tourist interest. Details regarding the cost will be provided by the Tourism Board at a later date.\n\nLo also highlighted the strong performance of Hong Kong's tourism industry last year, with nearly 50 million visitors, a 12% increase from the previous year. Non-mainland visitors rose by 15%. During the recent Mainland China Spring Festival Golden Week, approximately 1.77 million tourists visited Hong Kong, a 14% increase compared to the same period last year. It is projected that the total number of visitors to Hong Kong this year will reach 53.8 million, an 8% rise from last year.",

However, integrating AI with autonomous planning capabilities into existing workflows might lead to inefficiencies. In the future, companies may restructure processes around 'intent and boundaries,' with humans setting goals and rules, AI optimizing execution, and humans overseeing and making decisions.\n\nAs AI involvement increases, Shenyu believes departmental barriers and middle management roles may diminish, potentially leading to more efficient dynamic collaboration models within organizations.",
