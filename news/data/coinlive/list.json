            "description": "Japan is reportedly planning to restrict the number of battery packs passengers can bring on flights to prevent fires. According to Jin10, the proposed regulations would limit each passenger to a maximum of two battery packs with a capacity of 160 watt-hours or less, including camera batteries. There will be no limit on battery packs with a capacity of 100 watt-hours or less. Additionally, passengers will be prohibited from charging battery packs using onboard power outlets during flights.\n\nThe Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism intends to amend the regulations by mid-April and will seek public opinion by the end of March. A similar regulation may be approved by the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, as early as next month.",
