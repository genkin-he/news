In a report, Morgan Stanley noted, \"Recent gold price movements have pushed it into 'overbought' territory on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), but the recent pullback has brought it back to healthier levels, potentially clearing market positions.\" The bank expects continued buying of gold ETFs as interest rates decline, along with continued central bank purchases, albeit at a slower pace, while jewelry demand is expected to stabilize. However, Morgan Stanley also warned of downside risks, including potential price volatility that could prompt investors to shift to other asset classes, or central banks deciding to reduce their gold reserves.
