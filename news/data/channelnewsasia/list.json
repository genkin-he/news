            "title": "Zscaler posts wider quarterly loss on higher spending; shares down 9%",
            "description": "Feb 26 : Zscaler on Thursday posted a wider net loss in the second quarter, citing higher spending on sales, marketing, and research and development in a competitive market, sending shares of the cloud security firm down roughly 9 per cent in extended trading. The results come when IT budgets remain tight and clients spend cautiously on large deals amid economic uncertainty, even though cybersecurity budgets face less pressure than general capital outlays. Zscaler provides cloud-based zero trust security, which is designed to eliminate the need for legacy firewalls and virtual private networks (VPNs) by authenticating each connection rather than granting broader network access. Shares of cybersecurity companies, including CrowdStrike and Zscaler, have fallen in recent days as investors assessed the potential impact of AI startup Anthropic's Claude Code Security tool on the industry. Zscaler, which competes with Palo Alto Networks and Cloudflare, reported a net loss of $34.3 million in the quarter ended January 31, widening sharply from a net loss of $7.7 million a year earlier. Total operating expenses rose to $676.3 million in the second quarter, compared with $539.5 million in the year-ago period, driven by sales, marketing and research and development expenses. \"While CIOs (chief information officers) care about the budget, but they're doing two things: they do want to embrace AI and they want to do it securely. So, AI is driving demand for security,\" Zscaler CEO Jay Chaudhry said. Businesses spend on tools offered by companies such as Zscaler amid a wave of high-profile cyberattacks that has hit companies, including F5. Zscaler said its second-quarter revenue rose 26 per cent to $815.8 million, beating analysts' average estimate of $798.8 million, according to LSEG-compiled data. Its adjusted profit per share of $1.01 exceeded estimate of 90 cents. The company forecast third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.00 to $1.01, above analysts' estimates of 95 cents, and revenue of $834 million to $836 million, topping expectations of $831.9 million.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : Anthropic cannot accede to the Pentagon's request in an AI safeguards dispute despite threats to remove the company from the Department of Defense's systems, the AI firm's CEO, Dario Amodei, said on Thursday. The Pentagon's dispute with Anthropic stems from the AI startup's refusal to remove safeguards that would prevent its technology from being used to target weapons autonomously and conduct surveillance in the United States. Anthropic, backed by Google and Amazon, has a contract with the department worth up to $200 million. The department has said it will contract only with AI companies that accede to \"any lawful use\" and remove safeguards, Amodei said on Thursday. Use cases for its AI such as mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons have never been included in Anthropic's contracts with the department and \"we believe they should not be included now,\" Amodei said. Amodei added that the department threatened to remove Anthropic from its systems if the company maintained the safeguards and threatened to designate it a \"supply chain risk and to invoke the Defense Production Act to force the safeguards' removal\". \"Regardless, these threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request,\" Amodei said. Earlier in the day, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said on X that the department has no interest in using AI to conduct mass surveillance of Americans nor does it want to use AI to develop autonomous weapons that operate without human involvement. \"Here's what we're asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic's model for all lawful purposes,\" Parnell said. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Anthropic's statement. \"It is the Department's prerogative to select contractors most aligned with their vision. But given the substantial value that Anthropic's technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider,\" Amodei said. \"Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider,\" he added. An Anthropic spokesperson said the company remains \"ready to continue talks and committed to operational continuity for the Department and America's warfighters.\"",

            "description": "TORONTO, Feb 26 : OpenAI said on Thursday that it will set up a direct point of contact with Canadian law enforcement and improve detection of repeat policy violators, among steps to boost its safety protocols in the wake of a recent school shooting in Canada. The ChatGPT maker detailed the steps in a letter to Canada's minister in charge of artificial intelligence, Evan Solomon.  Ann O’Leary, OpenAI’s vice president of global policy, wrote the letter after Canadian ministers this week urged the ChatGPT maker to boost its safety protocols quickly and warned Ottawa would effect change through legislation if the company did not. \"We remain committed to cooperating with law enforcement authorities on the investigation into the Tumbler Ridge tragedy, and we are committed to an ongoing partnership with federal and provincial governments,\" O’Leary said, referring to the town in British Columbia where the shooting occurred. Ottawa summoned OpenAI's safety team for talks this week after the company said it had not contacted police about an account that it banned belonging to the alleged shooter, Jesse Van Rootselaar. Van Rootselaar, 18, is suspected of killing eight people on February 10 before taking her own life in Tumbler Ridge. OpenAI said it banned her ChatGPT account last year for policy violations, which it did not specify. It said the issues did not meet its internal criteria for reporting to law enforcement. Police said Van Rootselaar had a history of mental health problems. ",

            "description": "LONDON, Feb 27 : Activists are set to take to British streets on Friday for two days of protests against the expansion of data centres to serve booming demand for artificial intelligence, and the impact of the facilities on communities and the environment. The protests, coordinated by environmental charity Global Action Plan, are part of a growing international backlash against the power- and water-hungry sites needed to meet surging demand for AI computing power. \"Big Tech's unchecked construction of hyperscale AI data centres is putting the UK's climate targets at risk,\" said Oliver Hayes, Head of Campaigns at Global Action Plan, in a statement. Among the biggest is set to be the 'March Against The Machines' event starting outside the offices of OpenAI on Saturday at midday. While there is no formal definition of what a data centre is in Britain or how many there are, a techUK report from November 2024 put the number at around 450. The British energy regulator said 140 data centres had signalled they wanted to plug into the grid and could require 50 gigawatts of power. By comparison, it said peak British electricity demand on February 11 was 45 GW. OpenAI said in January it would create a community plan for each of the sites in its Stargate operation, a $500 billion initiative to build AI data centres for training and inference. Tech companies are investing directly in power infrastructure as energy access becomes a critical constraint on AI expansion, with the push for larger and more numerous data centres driving electricity demand higher. In Havering, east London, Ian Pirie, Coordinator Friends of the Earth Havering, said plans to build locally were \"completely inappropriate in a semi-rural Green Belt area\", citing what he called its power and water needs and the destruction of farmland. Leigh Tugwood, Co-chair of Iver Heath Residents Association, protesting against a build in Buckinghamshire, said he was concerned that datacentre development was being fast-tracked at the expense of local communities. \"We are, therefore, in support of a moratorium on all future hyperscale data centre development unless and until there is informed debate, a public inquiry and a meaningful community-designed engagement framework that ensures ownership of the process by those most likely to be impacted,\" he said.",

            "description": "DUBLIN, Feb 26 : FanDuel-owner Flutter forecast modest profit growth for 2026 far below analyst expectations due to challenges in the betting giant's main U.S. market compounded by its misfiring attempts to win customers over with promotions and bonuses.  The world's largest online betting company reported a 21 per cent jump in 2025 core profit on Thursday but expected growth of just 4 per cent this year to $2.97 billion, significantly below the $3.5 billion expected by analysts polled by LSEG SmartEstimate. The company's shares fell more than 9 per cent in after-hours trading. Flutter said the guidance largely reflected lower levels of U.S. customer engagement in the fourth quarter and into 2026 after it took more money from American football gamblers than its rivals during a run of favourable sports results.  While bookmakers tend to make more money when favourites lose, Flutter said the lack of marquee names in the closing stages of the NFL season meant customers were less interested in gambling during the key playoff games. \"We just didn't execute our generosity strategy as well as we should have done in the face of those results,\" Flutter CEO Peter Jackson told Reuters, referring to the promotions and bonuses gambling companies offer customers to keep them betting. Jackson said FanDuel, which has a leading 41 per cent share of the U.S. market, plans to improve how it rewards customers to be \"better positioned\" for the 2026/27 NFL season, including by launching a loyalty programme in the second quarter. Flutter also intends to increase planned investment in its new prediction markets platform launched in late December with derivatives exchange CME Group. Prediction markets, which allow users to win money on the likelihood of specific events occurring, from sports and entertainment to politics and the economy, have surged into the mainstream in the U.S. With FanDuel Predicts now offering non-sports markets in all 50 states and sports markets in 18 states including California, Texas and Florida where sports betting is illegal, Flutter expects investment to reduce 2026 core profit by the upper end of its previous $200 million to $300 million estimate.",

            "description": "SAN JOSE, California, Feb 26 : ASML Holding's next-generation chipmaking machine is ready for manufacturers to start bringing it into use for production at high volumes, a senior executive told Reuters, a big step for the chip industry. The Dutch company produces the world's only commercial extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) tools, which are a critical piece of equipment for chipmakers. This new tool will help chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  and Intel produce more powerful and efficient chips, by eliminating several costly and complex steps from the chip-manufacturing process, data from ASML shows. ASML plans to release this data, which represents a key milestone, at a technical conference in San Jose on Thursday, the company's chief technology officer, Marco Pieters, told Reuters on Wednesday. It has taken ASML years to develop the costly, next-generation tools as chipmakers have attempted to determine at what point it makes economic sense to begin to use them for mass production. But given that the current generation of EUV tools is approaching the technical limit of their ability to make complex AI chips, the next-generation machines - called High-NA EUV tools - are key for the AI industry to improve chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and help chipmakers deliver their AI chip roadmaps on time to meet surging demand. The new tools cost roughly $400 million, twice the cost of the original EUV machines. The High-NA EUV tools now experience limited downtime, have produced 500,000 dinner-plate-sized silicon wafers and can draw sufficiently precise patterns that make up the circuits on the chip, the ASML data shows, Pieters said. In combination, the three data points indicate the tools are ready for manufacturers. \"I think that it's at a critical point to look at the amount of learning cycles that have happened,\" he said, referring to the number of tests that have been conducted on the machines by customers. Despite their technical readiness, it will take two to three years for companies to conduct enough testing and development to integrate them into manufacturing. \"(Chipmakers) have all the knowledge to qualify these tools,\" Pieters said. Pieters also said the company has achieved roughly 80 per cent uptime at the moment and plans to achieve 90 per cent by the end of the year. The imaging data ASML plans to release is enough to convince customers to replace multiple steps with the older-generation tools with a single High-NA step, Pieters said. The 500,000 wafers the machines have processed have allowed the company to work out many of the kinks.",

            "description": "TOKYO, Feb 27 : Annual core inflation in Japan's capital slowed in February as food price hikes run their course, data showed on Friday, offering consumers some relief but complicating the central bank's communication in justifying further rate hikes. The data is in line with the Bank of Japan's projection that consumer inflation will temporarily slow due to the impact of fuel subsidies and the base effect of last year's spike, before reaccelerating on steady wage gains. The Tokyo core consumer price index, which excludes volatile costs of fresh food, rose 1.8 per cent in the year to February after a 2.0 per cent gain in January, data showed, falling below the central bank's 2 per cent target for the first time since October 2024. It compared with a median market forecast for a 1.7 per cent gain. An index stripping away the effect of fresh food and fuel, which is seen as a better gauge of trend inflation, rose 2.5 per cent in February from a year earlier after a 2.4 per cent gain in January. The BOJ raised interest rates to a 30-year high of 0.75 per cent in December, taking another landmark step in ending decades of huge monetary support in a sign of its conviction that Japan is progressing toward durably hitting its 2 per cent inflation target. The central bank has signalled its readiness to continue raising interest rates if its economic and price forecasts materialise.",

            "description": "NEW YORK, Feb 26 : A federal judge on Thursday rejected Binance's request that customers who accused the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange of illegally selling unregistered tokens that lost much of their value arbitrate their claims. U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter in Manhattan said customers could pursue claims that arose by February 20, 2019 in court, because Binance did not sufficiently notify them that it modified their terms of use to require arbitration and waive the right to sue in a class action. Carter said there was no evidence that Binance \"announced\" an arbitration provision, or told customers in the terms of use where they might look for one. He also said the alleged class-action waiver in Binance's 2019 terms of use was ambiguous and unenforceable. Binance founder and former chief executive Changpeng Zhao is also a defendant. Lawyers for Binance and Zhao did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Some defendants prefer arbitration to litigation because arbitration can remain confidential, make gathering evidence more difficult, and cost less. Customers who suffered losses on seven tokens - ELF, EOS, FUN, ICX, OMG, QSP and TRX - accused Binance of failing to warn that purchases carried \"significant risks,\" as required under federal and state securities laws, and sought to recoup what they paid. Carter dismissed the lawsuit in 2022, but a federal appeals court revived it two years later.",
