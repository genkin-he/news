The update on global deliveries came in a post on Weibo by a BYD executive in charge of marketing and public relations. The company sold 502,675 vehicles in October 2024. BYD reported a nearly 33 per cent drop in third-quarter profit on Thursday. Revenue was down 3 per cent for the quarter, the first such decline in more than five years, reflecting increasing competition from domestic rivals.",

            "title": "Trump-Xi meeting offers relief but rivalry, distrust remain: PM Wong",
            "description": "GYEONGJU, South Korea: It is a “relief” that the Trump-Xi meeting in Busan earlier this week went well, but the fundamental rivalry and the structural issues between the two superpowers are still unresolved, said Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Saturday (Nov 1). He said he was glad the meeting took place and that it has provided some stability for the global economy. Nevertheless, the outcome of the meeting seemed more of a “temporary truce” that established “guardrails” around the US-China relationship. US President Donald Trump hailed the Thursday meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping as a “ great success ”, and China confirmed that some rare earth curbs would be suspended. The positive outcome is much needed and very welcomed as it provides some predictability, but the underlying structural issues have not been fully resolved, said Mr Wong. “The rivalry between the two countries remains, the mutual suspicion, the distrust of one another remains, the continued attempts to insulate themselves from one another, I'm sure, will continue,” he said in an interview with the Singapore media at the end of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders’ Meeting (AELM). Over the four days in Gyeongju, Mr Wong attended AELM sessions, met his counterparts over dinners and held bilateral meetings, including with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday. “We just have to be realistic,\" Mr Wong said of the Trump-Xi meeting. \"It's a relief that this has taken place, but we should also be very clear that the underlying concerns and underlying rivalry between the two great powers will continue.\"SECURITY AND TRADE ARE MORE INTERTWINED TODAY Giving his take on how the APEC summit went, Mr Wong said there is a shift in how trade discussions are conducted in today’s context, noting that the multilateral bloc’s founding mission was to promote open and free trade in the Asia-Pacific. Mr Wong said: “Today, when we meet, APEC leaders still talk about trade, but different modifiers are used to describe trade. “It is not just ‘open and free’. Some economists talk about trade having to be ‘fair and balanced’, suggesting that it wasn’t in the past,” he said. Increasingly, the word “security” is also used liberally alongside trade discussions – not just carve-outs related to national security, but also economic, supply chain and technological security, Mr Wong said. “In the name of security, more barriers are put up against trade.” Asked about his dinner on Oct 29 with Mr Trump as well as other APEC leaders, Mr Wong said a wide range of global and regional issues were discussed, but not the specifics of trade. But he added that looking at the policies under the Trump administration, it is “quite clear” what the US will continue to do where trade is concerned. “They would like to see trade continuing. They know that they can’t do everything within America ... they will need partners.” He then added that the Trump administration's actions reflect the mood of the American people, which believes that trade in past decades has not benefitted the US and hence would like to see some rebalancing. “How long will this continue for? No one can say,” said Mr Wong, reiterating that these wider trends are likely to continue across the world in terms of security and trade concerns. After his meeting during the APEC summit with US Treasury Secretary Bessent, Mr Wong said in response to a question about the US’ trade tariffs on Singapore that the issue of trade was only discussed briefly. Mr Wong, who is also Singapore’s finance minister, said the two sides discussed fintech, digital assets, tax policies and how Singapore cooperates with the US when they take action against organised crime. As for trade, the prime minister noted that US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong are the main negotiators in this area. Singapore is currently subject to a US baseline tariff rate of 10 per cent. Pharmaceutical companies are subject to a 100 per cent tariff rate “unless a company is building their pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in America ”. “I updated (Mr Bessent) on Singapore’s positions and where we stand, and hopefully he will update and share that with his colleagues in the government too, and we can continue to make progress on our trade negotiations.”COMPETITION SHARPENS SINGAPORE’S CAPABILITIES It is in such an environment where trade barriers are put up in the name of security that APEC leaders are meeting, said Mr Wong. “Understandably, there are different views across APEC economies around trade, but it is still very good that in this APEC meeting, we were able to achieve a consensus,” he said, underscoring that APEC leaders are “generally still pro-trade” in spite of the caveats on security. “This is important for Singapore, because we are such a trade-reliant and trade-dependent economy. Trade is not just good to have for us. Trade is our lifeblood, trade is existential for us,” said Mr Wong. This is why Singapore must continue to support the liberalisation of trade, added the prime minister. To this end, Singapore has continued to push for reforms to the World Trade Organization , while bringing regional groupings together, such as through trade pacts and free trade agreements. He highlighted the launch of the Green Economy Partnership Agreement (GEPA) negotiations with New Zealand and Chile during the APEC summit and past deals struck with other countries in the digital economy. Among other things, these agreements would facilitate trade and investment flows, as well as harmonise standards and cut the red tape for businesses to interoperate in different economies, he said. Asked how such deals could benefit Singaporeans, Mr Wong said it boils down to the tangible benefits brought about by trade – more trade and investment leads to better jobs for Singaporeans. “Trade also has a lot of intangible benefits. When we trade with one another, it leads to more competition,” said Mr Wong. “But the competition sharpens our capabilities. There’s an exchange of ideas – we learn from one another, and we all get better along the way.” AI COOPERATION Earlier on Saturday, Mr Wong spoke to APEC leaders on the importance for the bloc to cooperate on artificial intelligence. Singapore is a small, compact, digitally connected city-state that cannot develop the best AI foundation models, he said during a session at the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting. “We can make use of them to develop and create applications with the biggest impact, in areas like finance, logistics, healthcare and advanced manufacturing, but we can’t do this work alone,” he said. “We are very keen to cooperate and exchange best practices with other APEC economies,” the prime minister added, noting that APEC members have AI expertise and experience. After leaving Gyeongju, Mr Wong will be making an official visit to Seoul at the invitation of South Korean President Lee Jae Myung.",

Polestar has rolled out discounts and leasing incentives to boost EV sales, but faces larger rivals such as Tesla and BYD, with Wall Street cautious about its growth potential despite strong demand from its home market of Europe. Its U.S.-listed shares closed at 84 cents on Friday and have lost about 20 per cent of their value this year after dropping over 50 per cent last year. Nasdaq's notice indicates the company has 180 days, or until April 29, 2026, to regain compliance by having the closing price of the U.S.-listed shares meet or exceed $1 per share for at least ten consecutive business days, Polestar said. If Polestar does not gain compliance by then, it may get an additional 180-day extension, the company said. This marks Polestar's second tryst with Nasdaq non-compliance, after it faced a potential delisting last year due to its inability to file its annual report with the U.S. securities regulator in a timely manner.",

            "description": "In a testament to Kim Kardashian's power to grab the spotlight, the head of NASA felt compelled this week to set the record straight when the reality TV queen said she believed a well-worn conspiracy theory that the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing was a fake. In a new episode of Hulu's long-running family saga \"The Kardashians,\" the show's star said she thinks the lunar landing by astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin was a fiction.  What convinced her, she said during the segment, was a video she saw online of an Aldrin interview. She said she interpreted his comments in that interview to mean the moon landing never occurred. Since the 1970s, skeptics have floated the notion that the mission - viewed live by tens of millions of people around the world - was actually staged.  That theory has waxed and waned over the years, but Sean Duffy, U.S. Transportation Secretary and NASA's acting administrator, wasted no time in shooting it down after Kardashian told her 4 million viewers that she was embracing the idea.     \"Yes, @KimKardashian, we've been to the Moon before ... 6 times!\" Duffy wrote on Thursday on the X social media platform. In fact, he said, the U.S. was going back to the moon under the leadership of President Donald Trump. In 2026, the Artemis II mission is scheduled to send astronauts on a 10-day trip around the moon, ahead of a planned moon landing in 2027. \"We won the last space race and we will win this one too,\" Duffy wrote. Kardashian referenced a video in which Aldrin, now 95, was asked what was the \"scariest moment\" during the Apollo mission. Reading from her phone, Kardashian quoted Aldrin as saying: \"There was no scary moment, because it didn't happen.\" The reality star then said: \"So I think it didn't happen.\" Aldrin's remarks appear to have been taken out of context from a 2015 onstage appearance at Britain's Oxford Union debating society. During the event, Aldrin was asked by someone in the audience, \"What was the scariest moment of the journey?\" He hesitated and said, \"The scariest?\" throwing up his hands as if to dismiss the notion. \"It didn't happen. It could have been scary,\" he said, suggesting that nothing frightening happened.  Then someone in the audience asked him about a faulty circuit breaker, and he proceeded to describe a technical problem that arose during the mission. A spokesperson for NASA could not immediately be reached to elaborate on the story. A spokesperson for Kardashian did not immediately respond. A spokesperson for Aldrin was not immediately available.",

            "description": "Bitcoin on Friday was on track for a monthly loss in October for the first time since 2018, snapping a seven-year streak of gains that had earned the month a lucky reputation among cryptocurrency traders.  Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, is set for a nearly 5 per cent decline this month, as the digital asset has struggled in recent weeks amid broader market jitters and muted investor risk appetite.  Cryptocurrencies \"came into October, tracking gold, tracking stocks near all-time highs, and then as uncertainty hit people for the first time maybe this year, they didn't rotate back into bitcoin en masse,\" said Adam McCarthy, a senior research analyst at digital market data provider Kaiko. October saw the largest crypto liquidation in history after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 100 per cent tariff on Chinese imports and threatened export controls on critical software. Bitcoin fell as low as $104,782.88 during the October 10-11 period, after setting a fresh record high just days earlier above $126,000.  \"That washout on the 10th, it really reminded people that this asset class is very narrow,\" said McCarthy. \"It's bitcoin and (ether), and even those can still have 10 per cent drawdowns in 15, 20 minutes.\" A whirlwind October is set to end with spooked investors unsure of the global monetary policy path in the near term, as the U.S. Federal Reserve pushed back against market bets that it would continue to cut rates this year as the government shutdown blocks crucial economic data. Meanwhile, several influential figures have expressed concerns about high valuations in equity markets. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon earlier this month warned of a heightened risk of a significant correction in the U.S. stock market within the next six months to two years. Despite its October decline, bitcoin is still up more than 16 per cent so far this year.  Cryptocurrencies have generally enjoyed a boost this year as Trump has embraced digital assets, which has led to the dismissal of a spate of lawsuits against prominent crypto platforms and a shift by Trump's financial regulators to create specialized rules to accommodate digital assets.",

            "description": "TOKYO :Japan's Electric Power Development (J-Power) said on Friday it will decommission two coal-fired power plants by March 2029 as part of efforts to meet its 2030 goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 46 per cent from 2013 levels. President Hitoshi Kanno also reaffirmed the company's commitment to completing the Oga-Katagami-Akita offshore wind project in northern Akita prefecture under Japan's second-round public auction framework. J-Power, a wholesale electricity supplier, relies on coal-fired generation for over half of its domestic sales. The units slated for closure are No.1 and No.2 units at the Takasago thermal power station in western Hyogo prefecture, subcritical-pressure plants that began operation in 1968 and 1969, each with a 250-megawatt capacity. \"To achieve our 2030 target, we must shut down remaining inefficient thermal units, but we also must maintain supply capacity .... we will decide through discussions with the authorities,\" Kanno said. He cited the 700-MW No.3 unit at Takehara in western Hiroshima prefecture, and the 1,000-MW No.1 unit at Matsuura in southern Nagasaki prefecture as candidates for future closures. Shutting these, in addition to the two Takasago units, would reduce the utility's domestic capacity by 12 per cent. Japan's power demand is projected to rise due to growing electricity needs from data centres and semiconductor plants, reversing years of decline. Kanno said Japan must accelerate renewable energy deployment, particularly offshore wind, to achieve both carbon neutrality and energy security. Offshore wind developers face global headwinds from rising material, equipment and labour costs. With Mitsubishi Corp withdrawing from three first-round auction projects, uncertainty looms over Japan's offshore wind market. \"But we are pushing ahead with our Katagami project despite rising costs,\" Kanno said. A consortium of JERA, J-Power, Itochu and Tohoku Electric Power aims to start operations of the Oga-Katagami-Akita project in autumn 2028, using Vestas' wind turbines, Kanno said. The government is reviewing bidding rules for the reopening of the first-round auction, but any decisions should apply retroactively to second- and third-round projects, Kanno said.",

            "title": "Yen faces worst monthly drop since July as BOJ disappoints",
            "description": "NEW YORK :The Japanese yen was heading for a monthly loss against the U.S. dollar on Friday after the Bank of Japan disappointed traders hoping for a more hawkish stance on future rate hikes, while the Federal Reserve dampened expectations for a December rate cut. The yen clawed back some losses on Friday after Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said that the government has been monitoring foreign exchange movements with a high sense of urgency as the yen weakens. Core inflation in Japan's capital also accelerated in October and stayed above the central bank's 2 per cent target, data showed on Friday. But disappointment after Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda adopted a less-hawkish tone on future rate hikes than hoped as the Japanese central bank kept rates on hold at 0.5 per cent on Thursday limited gains.  Noel Dixon, global macro strategist at State Street Global Markets, says he remains constructive on the yen, saying that “the BOJ ultimately is still going to have to normalize policy at least to 1 per cent.” “From a multi-year perspective, wages are definitely higher than they've been… and the fiscal spending is only going to exacerbate that prospect,” Dixon said. Japan’s newly elected leader Sanae Takaichi is expected to pursue more fiscally expansive policies to boost economic growth. The yen was last up 0.09 per cent against the greenback at 153.96 per dollar. It is heading for its worst month since July, with the dollar up 4.1 per cent against the currency this month.  The dollar index rose 0.28 per cent to 99.75 and is on track for a 2 per cent monthly gain, its best since July. The greenback has been boosted by more optimism over the economic outlook even as the labor market weakens, while Fed policymakers remain concerned about inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that a policy divide within the U.S. central bank and a lack of federal government data may put another interest rate cut out of reach this year.  “It sounded like he was just trying to give himself some optionality,” said Dixon. The Fed cut rates  on Wednesday, as expected, though two policymakers dissented. Governor Stephen Miran again called for a deeper reduction in borrowing costs, while Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid favored no cut. Schmid said on Friday that he dissented out of concern that continued high inflation and signs of price pressures spreading in the economy could raise doubts about the central bank's commitment to its 2 per cent inflation target. Fed funds futures traders are now pricing in a 63 per cent probability of a cut in December, down from 92 per cent a week ago, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool.  Dixon said he expects the dollar index to consolidate under technical resistance at around 102, before gaining next year when growth is likely to accelerate.  “From a positioning standpoint, it's clear that investors, at least from a real money perspective, are maxed out from a short perspective, so I think it's difficult to short it,” he added. The euro fell 0.27 per cent to $1.1534 after the European Central Bank kept interest rates unchanged at 2 per cent for the third meeting in a row on Thursday and repeated that policy was in a \"good place\" as economic risks recede. The euro has fallen 1.7 per cent this month, as the dollar gains broadly. Sterling fell 0.28 per cent to $1.3113, the lowest since April 14, as political pressures grew surrounding British Finance Minister Rachel Reeves. Against the euro, the pound reached its weakest since May 2023. The pound is heading for a 2.5 per cent drop this month, while gilt yields have dropped on concern over what Reeves' November budget might mean for businesses, households and overall economic activity. Traders are also pricing in rising odds of a Bank of England interest rate cut, though the British central bank is viewed as most likely keeping rates on hold when it meets next week. In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin gained 2.37 per cent to $110,080.  ",

About 80 workers were affected by the company's sudden closure, with the business saying it had been placed under provisional liquidation on Wednesday.  Employees told CNA that there was no prior notice from the management, and they only learned of the closure when liquidators arrived at the office.  Staff were owed salaries, and despite being a unionised company, Twelve Cupcakes did not engage the union early, before affected employees were notified.  Such behaviour is “irresponsible”, said MOM and the CPF Board. “While retrenchments may be unavoidable, employees should be treated in a responsible and sensitive manner,” they added. The CPF Board will file a Proof of Debt with the liquidator to recover outstanding CPF contributions for September and October. CNA has contacted the parent company, Dhunseri Group, and Twelve Cupcakes CEO Juliana Lee for comment. LOSSES SINCE 2023 The bakery operated outlets at locations including Changi City, Sentosa and Star Vista. In August, it opened a new outlet in Hougang Mall.  Financial statements show that the company has been in the red since 2023, when it made a total comprehensive loss of S$463,618 (US$356,100). In the 2024 financial year, this figure grew to S$1,070,855, and S$1,233,943 the year after. In its latest financial statement, auditors hinted at business uncertainty, with a note implying that the bakery could only be sustainable if it continued to depend on its parent company for financial support.Employees who spoke to CNA said they were only informed of the decision on Wednesday, about an hour before the end of the workday. CNA understands that outlet staff were only alerted later in the evening, through a WhatsApp message. The abrupt closure has left workers - many of them on work visas - in limbo. An outlet employee in his late 30s said that management had informed foreign staff that their work permits and S passes would be cancelled on Nov 1 or Nov 2. This means that those with work permits will have to find a job within seven days, while those on an S pass will have to find a job within 30 days, or return to their home country. “But the problem is, how are we going to survive this one month, if we don't have any salary yet to pay our rent and our food expenses?” he said. For now, the most pressing concern is their unpaid salaries, said one staff member. Some have rent that is due at the end of October. “We did our best for them. But how can they treat us like this?” she said through tears. \"It's kind of inhumane.\" In its joint statement, MOM and the CPF Board said their priority is to help the affected workers find employment. \"This includes working with Twelve Cupcakes to provide job matching support and career coaching for these employees,\" they added. The Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) will also assist employees of Twelve Cupcakes who need to file a Proof of Debt for their salary and other employment claims with the liquidator.",

            "title": "Cebu Pacific CEO upbeat on Philippines air travel; says sustainable fuel most realistic path to greener skies",
            "description": "Philippine budget airline Cebu Pacific is optimistic about the outlook for the nation’s aviation sector, particularly in the domestic market, said its Chief Executive Officer Mike Szucs.  He cited the country’s young and expanding population, a thriving middle class and improving infrastructure as key growth drivers. “Tourism, going forward, is going to be a key part of growth … becoming an even more important part of the economy in the Philippines,” he said on Friday (Oct 31).  As an archipelago of around 7,000 islands, the Philippines relies heavily on air travel to connect its many regions and communities. The domestic market accounts for about 70 per cent of Cebu Pacific’s total capacity. “There aren’t many alternatives when it comes to public transportation. From an economic standpoint, the domestic market will remain extremely resilient,” Szucs said.  “The international market, that will be more subject because there's more discretionary spending both for incoming (tourists) and those outbound. But even so, the population growth is so big. It's such a large, addressable market.”  FLEET EXPANSION On Friday, the budget airline announced a two-month partnership with Bulgarian national carrier Bulgaria Air to boost capacity during the holiday season.  In December and January, two Airbus A320ceo aircraft will fly four domestic routes from Manila to Cebu, Davao, Iloilo and Cagayan de Oro. Under the arrangement, Bulgaria Air will provide the aircraft, pilots, maintenance and insurance, while Cebu Pacific will supply cabin crew.To meet long-term growing demand, Cebu Pacific last year ordered 152 Airbus jets worth US$24 billion. The order begins in 2029 and will be delivered through 2035, Szucs told CNA.  Amid a global aircraft shortage caused by supply chain disruptions, some airlines have turned to China’s Commercial Aircraft Corporation (COMAC) as an alternative to Airbus and Boeing. Szucs said the competition is healthy for the industry.  “It's great that there is potential for another manufacturer of jets coming onto the scene. Competition improves products and also improves economics,” he said.  He added that Cebu Pacific would consider COMAC planes once they receive international certifications. “COMAC will have to go through the certification requirements, principally with the FAA and ISSA,” he said, referring to the United States’ Federal Aviation Administration and the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) Standard Safety Assessment. “That's clearly on their milestones, and it's clearly going to happen at some point. As soon as COMAC is available, it's something that we will consider.” SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL As airlines worldwide race toward net-zero emissions, Szucs said he believes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) offers the most practical way forward.  SAF is a liquid fuel made from feedstock including waste oil and fats. It can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to traditional jet fuel.  Unlike hydrogen or electric alternatives, sustainable aviation fuel can be used immediately with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure.  Other proposed technologies would require modified or new aircraft engines, infrastructure and regulatory systems that do not yet exist at scale. Despite its promise, the main challenge with sustainable aviation fuel is its limited availability and high cost. It accounted for just 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production in 2024, and is between two and five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.  “All aircraft today and for the foreseeable future will need hydrocarbon fuel, and SAF is the way. Airlines need to explore ways of how we can get more SAF produced on an economic scale,” he said.  Szucs noted that unlike fossil fuels, which are concentrated in certain parts of the world, sustainable aviation fuel has one clear advantage: it can be produced locally – potentially stimulating domestic economies in the process. FLEET MODERNISATION  The Cebu Pacific CEO said the most impactful step airlines can take today is upgrading to more fuel-efficient aircraft and engines. Currently, about 72 per cent of the carrier’s all-Airbus fleet is fitted with advanced engine options that reduce fuel burn by around 18 per cent, Szucs said. Beyond aircraft upgrades, another practical way to reduce the industry’s carbon footprint is electrifying ground operations and vehicles such as airport buses, pushback tractors and baggage carts, he added. “Everyone’s got an obligation to make sure they're taking the steps on what I consider to be the low-hanging fruits. That's deliverable today. Airlines should be progressively replacing (such) equipment,” he said.",

            "description": "KARACHI :Pakistan said it has awarded 23 offshore exploration blocks to four consortiums led by local energy companies, some partnered with foreign firms including Turkey's national oil company TPAO. In Pakistan's first such bidding round in nearly two decades, its energy ministry said on Friday that bids were awarded for 23 of 40 offshore blocks offered, covering around 53,500 square kilometres. The energy ministry listed state-run Oil and Gas Development Co. Ltd (OGDCL), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) and MariEnergies, along with privately-owned Prime Energy, which is backed by Pakistan's Hub Power Company (Hubco), among the successful bidders. TPAO secured a 25 per cent stake in one of the awarded blocks and the right to operate it after signing a joint bidding agreement with Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) earlier this year to explore the country's offshore prospects. Other partners include Hong Kong-based United Energy Group, Orient Petroleum, a major local independent producer, and Fatima Petroleum, part of Pakistan's Fatima Group conglomerate. The four winning consortiums, led by OGDCL, PPL, Mari Petroleum and Prime Energy, collectively pledged about $80 million in exploration work over the initial three-year period, the energy ministry said. Total investment could rise to between $750 million and $1 billion if drilling proceeds, it added. Pakistan's 300,000 square kilometre offshore zone, bordering energy-rich Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Iran, has seen just 18 wells drilled since the country's independence in 1947, too few to fully assess its hydrocarbon potential. Pakistan, which imports about half its oil, is seeking to revive foreign interest after the failure of the 2019 Kekra-1 well led to the exit of U.S. major Exxon Mobil.",
