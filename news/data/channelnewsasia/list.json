            "description": "LONDON :The London Metal Exchange said on Friday it had fined a unit of Japanese financial group Mizuho 265,000 pounds ($356,000) for a breach of rules following an investigation into alleged misconduct. Mizuho Securities USA, a Category 2 LME member, failed to report the over-the-counter positions of two of its affiliates between September 5, 2022 and December 20, 2024, the LME said in a notice. Exchange rules require members to report information about the OTC metals business of their clients, affiliates or themselves to the LME on a weekly basis. Mizuho's failure to submit the reportable OTC positions was due to \"a gap in its internal system and controls\", breaching its obligations to establish and maintain appropriate and adequate risk management systems, the LME said, adding that Mizuho had since carried out remedial action. The fine is part of a settlement with Mizuho that has been approved by the LME's enforcement committee, said the notice from the LME's head of market surveillance, Joe Morrison. Mizuho declined to comment. ($1 = 0.7451 pounds)",

            "title": "Yen faces worst monthly drop since July as BOJ disappoints",
            "description": "NEW YORK :The Japanese yen was heading for a monthly loss against the U.S. dollar on Friday after the Bank of Japan disappointed traders hoping for a more hawkish stance on future rate hikes, while the Federal Reserve dampened expectations for a December rate cut. The yen clawed back some losses on Friday after Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said that the government has been monitoring foreign exchange movements with a high sense of urgency as the yen weakens. Core inflation in Japan's capital also accelerated in October and stayed above the central bank's 2 per cent target, data showed on Friday. But disappointment after Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda adopted a less-hawkish tone on future rate hikes than hoped as the Japanese central bank kept rates on hold at 0.5 per cent on Thursday limited gains.  Noel Dixon, global macro strategist at State Street Global Markets, says he remains constructive on the yen, saying that “the BOJ ultimately is still going to have to normalize policy at least to 1 per cent.” “From a multi-year perspective, wages are definitely higher than they've been… and the fiscal spending is only going to exacerbate that prospect,” Dixon said. Japan’s newly elected leader Sanae Takaichi is expected to pursue more fiscally expansive policies to boost economic growth. The yen was last up 0.09 per cent against the greenback at 153.96 per dollar. It is heading for its worst month since July, with the dollar up 4.1 per cent against the currency this month.  The dollar index rose 0.28 per cent to 99.75 and is on track for a 2 per cent monthly gain, its best since July. The greenback has been boosted by more optimism over the economic outlook even as the labor market weakens, while Fed policymakers remain concerned about inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that a policy divide within the U.S. central bank and a lack of federal government data may put another interest rate cut out of reach this year.  “It sounded like he was just trying to give himself some optionality,” said Dixon. The Fed cut rates  on Wednesday, as expected, though two policymakers dissented. Governor Stephen Miran again called for a deeper reduction in borrowing costs, while Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid favored no cut. Schmid said on Friday that he dissented out of concern that continued high inflation and signs of price pressures spreading in the economy could raise doubts about the central bank's commitment to its 2 per cent inflation target. Fed funds futures traders are now pricing in a 63 per cent probability of a cut in December, down from 92 per cent a week ago, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool.  Dixon said he expects the dollar index to consolidate under technical resistance at around 102, before gaining next year when growth is likely to accelerate.  “From a positioning standpoint, it's clear that investors, at least from a real money perspective, are maxed out from a short perspective, so I think it's difficult to short it,” he added. The euro fell 0.27 per cent to $1.1534 after the European Central Bank kept interest rates unchanged at 2 per cent for the third meeting in a row on Thursday and repeated that policy was in a \"good place\" as economic risks recede. The euro has fallen 1.7 per cent this month, as the dollar gains broadly. Sterling fell 0.28 per cent to $1.3113, the lowest since April 14, as political pressures grew surrounding British Finance Minister Rachel Reeves. Against the euro, the pound reached its weakest since May 2023. The pound is heading for a 2.5 per cent drop this month, while gilt yields have dropped on concern over what Reeves' November budget might mean for businesses, households and overall economic activity. Traders are also pricing in rising odds of a Bank of England interest rate cut, though the British central bank is viewed as most likely keeping rates on hold when it meets next week. In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin gained 2.37 per cent to $110,080.  ",

            "title": "MOM investigating Twelve Cupcakes for potential breaches of Employment Act",
            "description": "SINGAPORE: Bakery chain Twelve Cupcakes is being investigated for non-payment of salaries and other potential breaches of the Employment Act, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the CPF Board said on Friday (Oct 31). About 80 workers were affected by the company's sudden closure, with the business saying it had been placed under provisional liquidation on Wednesday.  Employees told CNA that there was no prior notice from the management, and they only learned of the closure when liquidators arrived at the office.  Staff were owed salaries, and despite being a unionised company, Twelve Cupcakes did not engage the union early, before affected employees were notified.  Such behaviour is “irresponsible”, said MOM and the CPF Board. “While retrenchments may be unavoidable, employees should be treated in a responsible and sensitive manner,” they added. The CPF Board will file a Proof of Debt with the liquidator to recover outstanding CPF contributions for September and October. CNA has contacted the parent company, Dhunseri Group, and Twelve Cupcakes CEO Juliana Lee for comment. LOSSES SINCE 2023 The bakery operated outlets at locations including Changi City, Sentosa and Star Vista. In August, it opened a new outlet in Hougang Mall.  Financial statements show that the company has been in the red since 2023, when it made a total comprehensive loss of S$463,618 (US$356,100). In the 2024 financial year, this figure grew to S$1,070,855, and S$1,233,943 the year after. In its latest financial statement, auditors hinted at business uncertainty, with a note implying that the bakery could only be sustainable if it continued to depend on its parent company for financial support.Employees who spoke to CNA said they were only informed of the decision on Wednesday, about an hour before the end of the workday. CNA understands that outlet staff were only alerted later in the evening, through a WhatsApp message. The abrupt closure has left workers - many of them on work visas - in limbo. An outlet employee in his late 30s said that management had informed foreign staff that their work permits and S passes would be cancelled on Nov 1 or Nov 2. This means that those with work permits will have to find a job within seven days, while those on an S pass will have to find a job within 30 days, or return to their home country. “But the problem is, how are we going to survive this one month, if we don't have any salary yet to pay our rent and our food expenses?” he said. For now, the most pressing concern is their unpaid salaries, said one staff member. Some have rent that is due at the end of October. “We did our best for them. But how can they treat us like this?” she said through tears. \"It's kind of inhumane.\" In its joint statement, MOM and the CPF Board said their priority is to help the affected workers find employment. \"This includes working with Twelve Cupcakes to provide job matching support and career coaching for these employees,\" they added. The Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) will also assist employees of Twelve Cupcakes who need to file a Proof of Debt for their salary and other employment claims with the liquidator.",

            "title": "Cebu Pacific CEO upbeat on Philippines air travel; says sustainable fuel most realistic path to greener skies",
            "description": "Philippine budget airline Cebu Pacific is optimistic about the outlook for the nation’s aviation sector, particularly in the domestic market, said its Chief Executive Officer Mike Szucs.  He cited the country’s young and expanding population, a thriving middle class and improving infrastructure as key growth drivers. “Tourism, going forward, is going to be a key part of growth … becoming an even more important part of the economy in the Philippines,” he said on Friday (Oct 31).  As an archipelago of around 7,000 islands, the Philippines relies heavily on air travel to connect its many regions and communities. The domestic market accounts for about 70 per cent of Cebu Pacific’s total capacity. “There aren’t many alternatives when it comes to public transportation. From an economic standpoint, the domestic market will remain extremely resilient,” Szucs said.  “The international market, that will be more subject because there's more discretionary spending both for incoming (tourists) and those outbound. But even so, the population growth is so big. It's such a large, addressable market.”  FLEET EXPANSION On Friday, the budget airline announced a two-month partnership with Bulgarian national carrier Bulgaria Air to boost capacity during the holiday season.  In December and January, two Airbus A320ceo aircraft will fly four domestic routes from Manila to Cebu, Davao, Iloilo and Cagayan de Oro. Under the arrangement, Bulgaria Air will provide the aircraft, pilots, maintenance and insurance, while Cebu Pacific will supply cabin crew.To meet long-term growing demand, Cebu Pacific last year ordered 152 Airbus jets worth US$24 billion. The order begins in 2029 and will be delivered through 2035, Szucs told CNA.  Amid a global aircraft shortage caused by supply chain disruptions, some airlines have turned to China’s Commercial Aircraft Corporation (COMAC) as an alternative to Airbus and Boeing. Szucs said the competition is healthy for the industry.  “It's great that there is potential for another manufacturer of jets coming onto the scene. Competition improves products and also improves economics,” he said.  He added that Cebu Pacific would consider COMAC planes once they receive international certifications. “COMAC will have to go through the certification requirements, principally with the FAA and ISSA,” he said, referring to the United States’ Federal Aviation Administration and the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) Standard Safety Assessment. “That's clearly on their milestones, and it's clearly going to happen at some point. As soon as COMAC is available, it's something that we will consider.” SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL As airlines worldwide race toward net-zero emissions, Szucs said he believes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) offers the most practical way forward.  SAF is a liquid fuel made from feedstock including waste oil and fats. It can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to traditional jet fuel.  Unlike hydrogen or electric alternatives, sustainable aviation fuel can be used immediately with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure.  Other proposed technologies would require modified or new aircraft engines, infrastructure and regulatory systems that do not yet exist at scale. Despite its promise, the main challenge with sustainable aviation fuel is its limited availability and high cost. It accounted for just 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production in 2024, and is between two and five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.  “All aircraft today and for the foreseeable future will need hydrocarbon fuel, and SAF is the way. Airlines need to explore ways of how we can get more SAF produced on an economic scale,” he said.  Szucs noted that unlike fossil fuels, which are concentrated in certain parts of the world, sustainable aviation fuel has one clear advantage: it can be produced locally – potentially stimulating domestic economies in the process. FLEET MODERNISATION  The Cebu Pacific CEO said the most impactful step airlines can take today is upgrading to more fuel-efficient aircraft and engines. Currently, about 72 per cent of the carrier’s all-Airbus fleet is fitted with advanced engine options that reduce fuel burn by around 18 per cent, Szucs said. Beyond aircraft upgrades, another practical way to reduce the industry’s carbon footprint is electrifying ground operations and vehicles such as airport buses, pushback tractors and baggage carts, he added. “Everyone’s got an obligation to make sure they're taking the steps on what I consider to be the low-hanging fruits. That's deliverable today. Airlines should be progressively replacing (such) equipment,” he said.",

            "description": "KARACHI :Pakistan said it has awarded 23 offshore exploration blocks to four consortiums led by local energy companies, some partnered with foreign firms including Turkey's national oil company TPAO. In Pakistan's first such bidding round in nearly two decades, its energy ministry said on Friday that bids were awarded for 23 of 40 offshore blocks offered, covering around 53,500 square kilometres. The energy ministry listed state-run Oil and Gas Development Co. Ltd (OGDCL), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) and MariEnergies, along with privately-owned Prime Energy, which is backed by Pakistan's Hub Power Company (Hubco), among the successful bidders. TPAO secured a 25 per cent stake in one of the awarded blocks and the right to operate it after signing a joint bidding agreement with Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) earlier this year to explore the country's offshore prospects. Other partners include Hong Kong-based United Energy Group, Orient Petroleum, a major local independent producer, and Fatima Petroleum, part of Pakistan's Fatima Group conglomerate. The four winning consortiums, led by OGDCL, PPL, Mari Petroleum and Prime Energy, collectively pledged about $80 million in exploration work over the initial three-year period, the energy ministry said. Total investment could rise to between $750 million and $1 billion if drilling proceeds, it added. Pakistan's 300,000 square kilometre offshore zone, bordering energy-rich Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Iran, has seen just 18 wells drilled since the country's independence in 1947, too few to fully assess its hydrocarbon potential. Pakistan, which imports about half its oil, is seeking to revive foreign interest after the failure of the 2019 Kekra-1 well led to the exit of U.S. major Exxon Mobil.",

Both Seagate and Western Digital stocks are trading near record highs, having surged more than 200 per cent this year on the artificial intelligence boom. Western Digital gained 10.5 per cent in premarket trading on Friday after it forecast second-quarter earnings above Wall Street estimates. \"The fact that WDC has secured purchase orders extending through CY26 with five of its largest customers is a clear indication that customers are unwilling to risk falling short on storage capacity as AI-related demand continues to march higher,\" J.P.Morgan analysts said in a note. Earlier this week, rival Seagate Technology also forecast second-quarter revenue and profit above estimates late Tuesday. Its shares have surged 20 per cent since, and were up 1.7 per cent on Friday. Seagate and Western Digital are the second and third-highest percentage gainers this year on the S&P 500, only behind trading platform operator Robinhood. Smaller rival Sandisk, spun out of Western Digital in February, has also seen a five-fold jump in its stock since listing. Shares of the company, which will report its results on November 6, were up 3.1 per cent on Friday. The S&P 1500 technology hardware, storage and peripherals sector - which houses all three companies - has jumped more than 11 per cent for the year and hit a record high on Thursday. Tech giants Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon all announced plans for higher annual capital expenditures as they pour money into chips and data centers. Global AI-related infrastructure spending could reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, Goldman Sachs estimates. \"If you went back twelve months or twenty-four months and you asked somebody about AI, they wouldn't have talked about hard disks...

            "description": "GYEONGJU, South Korea: United States tech giant Nvidia said on Friday (Oct 31) it will supply 260,000 of its most cutting-edge chips to South Korea, as CEO Jensen Huang met President Lee Jae Myung and the heads of the country's biggest companies on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. South Korea is home to two of the world's leading memory chip makers - Samsung Electronics and SK hynix - which manufacture chips essential for artificial intelligence products and the data centres that the fast-evolving industry relies on. Lee has also expressed his hope that the country can become the world's third AI power after the US and China. Speaking to media after the announcement, Huang said that the goal was \"ambitious\". But, he said, \"there's no reason why Korea cannot achieve it - you have the technology, you have the software expertise, and you also have a natural ability to build manufacturing plants\". Nvidia has been caught in the middle of that geopolitical tussle. Its chips are currently not sold in China due to a combination of Beijing government bans , US national security concerns and ongoing trade tensions.Huang has urged the US to allow the sale of US-made AI chips in China in order to ensure Silicon Valley companies remain a global powerhouse in providing AI. \"The US government and the Chinese government have to decide what role they would like Nvidia to play,\" Huang told reporters on Friday. \"I've been very clear that having Nvidia technology in China is in the best interest of the US and in the best interest of China as well,\" he said. \"I'm optimistic,\" he added. And asked if he wanted Nvidia's most high-tech chip, the Blackwell, to be sold in China, he said: \"I hope so.\" \"But that's a decision for President Trump to make.\" Nvidia's chips featured in talks between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Gyeongju this week. Beijing has ramped up its chip industry to beat Washington's export restrictions on the critical component used to power AI systems.CHICKEN AND CHIPS Under Friday's deal, 50,000 of the graphics processing units will go towards a new \"AI factory\" being built by Samsung Electronics. \"By deploying more than 50,000 Nvidia GPUs, AI will be embedded throughout Samsung's entire manufacturing flow,\" the Korean tech giant said. SK Group and Hyundai Motor Group will also receive 50,000 chips for use in AI facilities. NAVER Cloud - which operates South Korea's largest search engine - will receive 60,000 to expand its AI infrastructure. A further 50,000 will be deployed across Seoul's National AI Computing Center and to cloud service and IT providers. Huang has sought to forge closer ties with South Korean tech giants in his visit to the country this week. He met Samsung Chairman Lee Jae-yong and Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Chung Eui-sun on Thursday for \"chimaek\" - a beloved South Korean pairing of fried chicken and beer - in the capital Seoul. The restaurant, Kkanbu, was reportedly chosen by Nvidia because the term - popularised by Netflix's megahit \"Squid Game\" and meaning \"friend\" - was intended to highlight the spirit of friendship underpinning their AI and chip collaborations. Nvidia in July became the first company to top US$4 trillion in market capitalisation, and followed that up by becoming the first to hit US$5 trillion following an event on Tuesday where it announced new ventures building on its AI technology.",

            "description": "TAIPEI :Taiwan's top chip design company, MediaTek, expects to earn revenue of billions of dollars from its AI accelerator ASIC chips by 2027, the chief executive said on Friday, as the company pushes further into the data centre business. Chief Executive Rick Tsai told a quarterly earnings conference call that MediaTek was on track to generate $1 billion in revenue from its cloud AI chips in 2026 after its first AI accelerator ASIC project was well executed. \"The first project we generate multiple billions in 2027,\" Tsai said. \"And another project we'll start delivering revenue starting 2028 and beyond.\" The total addressable market (TAM) for data center ASIC chip is now estimated at $50 billion and MediaTek is striving to gain market share of at least 10 to 15 per cent in the next two years, Tsai added. On Monday, competitor Qualcomm unveiled two artificial intelligence chips for data centres that will be available in 2026 and 2027. MediaTek has partnered with Nvidia to co-design the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip used in Nvidia's DGX Spark, a personal AI supercomputer that went on sale this month. In September, Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in Intel. Asked whether Nvidia’s investment in Intel, its rival in CPUs, would have any impact on MediaTek's future cooperation with Nvidia, Tsai said he did not believe the news would affect the companies' joint efforts on the GB10. On Friday, MediaTek reported third-quarter revenue of T$142.1 billion ($4.64 billion), up 7.8 per cent from a year earlier, while net income was down 0.5 per cent at T$25.5 billion. MediaTek shares have fallen 7.4 per cent this year, underperforming a rise of 22.6 per cent in the benchmark index. The stock closed flat on Friday ahead of its earnings release. The world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, raised its full-year revenue forecast this month on a bullish outlook for spending on AI, after posting a record profit that blew past market estimates.  ($1=30.5930 Taiwan dollars)",

            "description": "BANGKOK :Thailand's economy improved in September from the previous month due to a rebound in manufacturing, rising exports and increasing foreign tourism receipts, but it was weaker over the entire July to September quarter, the central bank said on Friday. Domestic demand also slowed over the month, with both private consumption and investment showing declines, the Bank of Thailand said in a statement. Exports, a key driver of the economy, jumped 19.2 per cent in September from a year earlier while imports increased 18.0 per cent, the central bank said, leading to a trade surplus of $3.6 billion. The current account surplus THCURA=ECI was $1.9 billion in September. For the whole of the third quarter, the economy softened compared to the previous quarter after a decline in manufacturing output, reflecting temporary production halts in certain products, as well as weaker domestic demand, the central bank said. The central bank had earlier forecast year-on-year growth of 1.5 per cent in the third quarter and a 0.5 per cent dip compared to the previous three months. Third-quarter gross domestic product data is due on November 17. The central bank forecast economic growth of 2.2 per cent this year and 1.6 per cent next year. Southeast Asia's second-largest economy expanded 2.5 per cent last year, lagging peers. The central bank unexpectedly left its key rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent. Governor Vitai Ratanakorn earlier said rates could be cut if needed to lift inflation and growth. The next policy review is due on December 17. The economy has struggled with U.S. tariffs, high household debt, and a strong baht currency, prompting the government to introduce a series of stimulus measures, including a 44 billion baht ($1.34 billion) consumer subsidy programme. On Thursday, the finance ministry raised its 2025 GDP growth forecast to 2.4 per cent from 2.2 per cent and predicted 2 per cent growth next year.",

            "title": "India's Happiest Minds sees GenAI reaching double‑digit revenue share in three years",
            "description": "BENGALURU :Happiest Minds Technologies expects a double-digit revenue share from its generative AI business within three years, up from 1.6 per cent in fiscal 2025, as clients accelerate AI spending to cut costs and boost productivity, its top executive told Reuters. This makes it the first Indian IT firm to give a revenue forecast tied to the futuristic technology and the second in the $283 billion sector to report AI-related revenue after HCLTech. Earlier this month, HCLTech said advanced AI quarterly revenue crossed $100 million, accounting for around 2.7 per cent of total sales, in the September quarter. Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence that creates new content such as text, images or code by learning from existing data. It powers tools like ChatGPT and Gemini that mimic human-like output. \"Today, all the new businesses we are signing, there is a huge amount of AI at play. When our sales guys go (to pitch to clients), they get an entry at the table only through AI,\" MD Venkatraman Narayanan said on Wednesday. \"That's the flavour of the season.\" Happiest Minds said its GenAI projects command a 20 per cent–25 per cent premium over standard rates. It has identified 22 use cases with $50 million sales potential, with five projects already live, including three valued at over $1 million each. The company raked in about $4 million in the first half of the current fiscal year from GenAI-led services and expects the revenue to double by the end of the year. Use cases span from student onboarding and grade management in the ed-tech sector to automating inventory and invoicing in consumer goods, Narayanan said. The company's GenAI growth target looks challenging but is feasible due to the low base, said Centrum Broking analyst Piyush Pandey, adding \"it is possible because the GenAI unit is growing faster than the rest of the business.\" A Massachusetts Institute of Technology study in August found that 95 per cent of organisations globally saw no returns on $30 billion–$40 billion in GenAI investments, citing integration challenges and user skill gaps.",

            "description": "A momentous week in the technology sector made it clear there is no sign the boom in building artificial intelligence infrastructure is slowing — despite the bubble talk. Nvidia, whose processors are the AI revolution's backbone, became the first company to surpass $5 trillion in market value. Microsoft and OpenAI inked a deal enhancing the ChatGPT maker's fundraising ability and OpenAI promptly started laying groundwork for an initial public offering that could value the company at $1 trillion.  Amazon said it would cut 14,000 corporate jobs, just days before its cloud unit posted its strongest growth in nearly three years. These developments, along with numerous earnings calls and interviews with executives, make clear that AI has cemented itself as the single biggest catalyst for global corporate investment and the engine of the market rally, even as some question the sustainability of both. SPENDING WITHOUT ENDING Soaring revenue at Microsoft, Alphabet and other technology giants was expected. But more than 100 non-tech global companies noted data centers on quarterly calls this week, including Honeywell, turbine maker GE Vernova, and heavy equipment maker Caterpillar. Sales in Caterpillar's division that supplies data centers jumped 31 per cent in its most recent quarter. \"We're definitely really excited about the prime power opportunity with data centers,\" CEO Joseph Creed said this week.  “The AI supply chain now spans power, industrials and cooling technology, and investors are looking at the entire ecosystem rather than just core tech,\" said Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio manager at Wealth Enhancement Group. Goldman Sachs estimates global AI-related infrastructure spending could reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet are expected to spend roughly $350 billion combined this year. AI investment is propping up global trade, with about 60 per cent of U.S. data-center capex spent on imported IT equipment, according to Oxford Economics, much of it semiconductors from Taiwan, South Korea and Vietnam. At least two dozen companies representing more than $21 trillion in combined market value reported quarterly earnings or spoke with Reuters about AI in recent days. Many, including Procter & Gamble and Boliden, noted that the hoped-for productivity gains, though uneven, are beginning to show. \"We strongly believe the future contribution of artificial intelligence within R&D, within developing innovation, will steadily increase,\" Schindler CEO Paolo Compagna told Reuters, though he said AI's impact is yet to be seen. The Swiss lift and escalator maker raised its annual margin forecast last week. Year-over-year revenue growth in the U.S. tech sector is up more than 15 per cent, outpacing all other sectors, according to LSEG data. Apple said it was significantly increasing AI investment and Amazon projected capital spending of $125 billion in 2025. WORRIES ABOUT OVERVALUATION Since ChatGPT’s debut in 2022, global equity values have climbed 46 per cent, or $46 trillion. One-third of that gain has come from AI-linked companies, according to Bespoke Investment Group.  Analysts warn of a quickening replacement cycle for servers, accelerators and chips as each new generation delivers exponential performance gains. The useful life of AI chips is shrinking to five years or less, forcing companies to “write down assets faster and replace them sooner,\" said UBS semiconductor analyst Tim Arcuri. The surge in AI-related spending has widened the gap between investment and returns, with a Reuters analysis showing that sales-to-capex ratios at major tech firms have fallen sharply as outlays on chips and data centers grow faster than revenue. Capital expenditures represent a larger chunk of cash generated by operating activities for some companies, causing some investor concern. “If progress hasn’t been made toward monetization within three years, the market will start asking hard questions,\" said Sumali Sanyal, senior portfolio manager at investment firm Xponance. Microsoft reported a record $35 billion in capex in its most recent quarter and projected higher spending, prompting Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler to ask whether the company was spending into a bubble. Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood responded that AI-related demand still outpaces Microsoft's spending. \"I thought we were going to catch up. We are not,\" she said.  Some companies are financing AI projects with debt. Oracle’s $18 billion bond sale last month was one of the largest ever for a tech company, and it looks set to be surpassed by an up to $30 billion bond sale from Meta Platforms. News of its largest ever bond sale knocked Meta's shares down 11 per cent on Thursday. Still, many economists say the AI cycle is far from exhausted. Goldman estimates AI investment is currently less than 1 per cent of U.S. GDP, far below peaks of 2 per cent to 5 per cent seen during the electricity and dot-com booms. “We are in the early innings ... and the pace of AI innovation is the fastest we have seen in decades,” said Nick Evans, portfolio manager at Polar Capital Technology Trust. ",

            "description": "Coinbase's first-mover advantage as the only publicly traded crypto exchange helped it top earnings estimates again, but competition is looming from clearer rules and newly listed companies, Wall Street analysts said on Friday. The global crypto market has swelled to $3.7 trillion as institutional and retail investors pour money into digital assets. President Donald Trump has eased regulatory hurdles in the United States after taking office in January, driving bitcoin to record highs and paving the way for the industry's biggest players to tap public markets. \"While we think regulatory clarity for cryptocurrency and stablecoins will remain a positive tailwind for volume, it will also likely lead to additional competition,\" analysts at brokerage Morningstar said, adding Coinbase's premium pricing will likely face increasing pressure.  Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, listed on the Nasdaq in September. Rival Bullish went public in August, while Kraken is reportedly preparing to list in the first half of 2026. The growing roster of public crypto exchanges signals a maturing market and poses the strongest challenge yet to Coinbase's dominance. \"Coinbase has established itself as the most institutionally trusted crypto company in the world. That said, we remain cautious on the retail outlook given rising competition and management's recent comments around customers wanting to trade more than just crypto,\" Piper Sandler analysts wrote in a note.  Coinbase ranks third among the top crypto spot exchanges globally on crypto analytics provider CoinMarketCap, trailing Binance and Bybit. It beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter profit after the bell on Thursday, underpinned by a surge in trading volume. On a post-earnings call, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said regulatory clarity in the U.S. and globally is starting to bear fruit, helping drive growth in the crypto sector, but added it means \"that lots of new competition is coming in and so we need to make sure we're executing well\".  The company has expanded its product portfolio through a string of acquisitions in recent years, including a $2.9 billion deal for derivatives exchange Deribit in May and a $375 million purchase of investment platform Echo earlier this month.  CFO Alesia Haas added \"we've always faced competition\", noting that Coinbase has continued to grow its market share, scale and trading volume. Analysts expect Coinbase to continue its acquisition spree. \"We think the M&A door remains very much open for future acquisitions and strategic investments,\" J.P. Morgan analysts said.  \"With a leading market position and solid industry and government relationships, we think Coinbase is in an advantaged position to submit competitive bids as an aggressive acquirer.\"  Shares of the crypto exchange were last up 5 per cent in premarket trading. ",
