            "description": "Disney's networks went dark on Google's pay-TV platform YouTube TV after negotiations to reach a licensing deal failed, the companies said in separate statements late on Thursday. The affected Disney networks include ESPN, ABC, FX, Nat Geo, Nat Geo Wild, Disney Channel, ABC News Live and others. A source told Reuters that Disney's channels were removed from YouTube ahead of the contract lapsing. YouTube TV issued its statement on X at 11:16 pm ET on Thursday, while the deal was originally set to expire only at midnight. YouTube TV, one of the largest pay-TV distributors in the U.S., has been locked in a series of negotiations this year with firms threatening to pull their media networks from the platform. Earlier this month, the company, after a difficult negotiation period, struck a deal with Comcast-owned NBCUniversal to keep NBC shows such as \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" on YouTube TV. The platform also struck similar deals with Fox and Paramount earlier this year after difficult contract negotiations. YouTube TV, which has over 10 million subscribers, said Disney's proposed offer terms would raise prices for its subscribers and benefit Disney's own live TV services such as Hulu + Live TV, while Disney accused YouTube of being unwilling to pay fair rates. \"Our contract with Disney has reached its renewal date, and we'll not agree to terms that disadvantage our members while benefiting Disney's TV products,\" YouTube TV said in a post on social media platform X. A Disney spokesperson said the company was committed to working toward a resolution as quickly as possible. \"With a $3 trillion market cap, Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we've successfully negotiated with every other distributor,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. YouTube TV will offer its subscribers a $20 credit if the Disney networks remain unavailable on the platform for an extended period of time. The pay-TV platform had dropped Spanish-language network Univision last month after a failed contract deal.",

            "title": "Analysis:BOJ locks in near-term rate hike, yen may sway timing",
            "description": "TOKYO :The Bank of Japan's cautious governor has dropped unusually hawkish hints of an interest rate hike in December or January next year, with the timing likely swayed not just by wage momentum but by moves in the yen. The central bank kept interest rates steady at 0.5 per cent on Thursday as expected, but Governor Kazuo Ueda said the likelihood of its baseline scenario materialising has heightened - language he had used in the past to signal a rate hike was imminent. While warning of lingering global uncertainties, the board revised up this year's growth forecast and made few tweaks to its sanguine view of Japan's recovery prospects in a quarterly report released after the meeting. As was the case before the BOJ's previous rate hike in January, Ueda also elaborated on the triggers for action with an emphasis on the \"initial momentum\" of next year's wage negotiations. \"Ueda's remarks ... contained many signals that, barring major shocks in the U.S. economy or markets, the probability of a near-term rate hike is rising,\" said Takeshi Yamaguchi, chief Japan economist at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities. \"Given Ueda's use of the term 'initial momentum,' we think it is unlikely the BOJ will wait until March wage results,\" said Yamaguchi, who predicts a rate hike in December. MORE DATA TO COME More data will be available by the BOJ's upcoming policy meeting on December 18-19 that would provide hints to next year's wage outlook, including corporate earnings reports and the central bank's \"tankan\" business survey due on December 15. Already, Japan's largest labour union group said it would seek wage hikes of 5 per cent or more in 2026, aiming for bumper pay raises for the fourth straight year despite external headwinds. There could also be early hints on how automakers - a sector Ueda said he was paying particular attention to - set wages as they face the hit from U.S. tariffs. Last year, labour unions at major automakers set pay hike targets in December. Ueda may also heed to mounting pressure from within his nine-member board to act sooner rather than later. Two board members repeated their proposal, made in September, to hike rates to 0.75 per cent, on Thursday. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has recently chimed in, urging the government of new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who is known as an advocate of loose monetary policy, to allow the BOJ to raise rates and avoid excessive yen declines. \"A hawkish bloc has solidified within the BOJ policy board\" with the hawks having \"an external advocate pushing for monetary tightening\" in Bessent, said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, who predicts a rate hike in December. \"As a new prime minister, it may even be advantageous for Takaichi to get the rate hike out of the way early on in her tenure,\" he added. YEN COMPLICATES TIMING To be sure, the BOJ may opt to play it safe by waiting until its January 22-23 meeting, as most big manufacturers firm up wage plans at the start of the year, some analysts say. By then, there will be more clarity on the Takaichi administration's budget plans and economic policies. The BOJ, too, can offer a more thorough analysis justifying a rate hike in a quarterly report due after the January meeting. In the end, however, the timing may depend much on yen moves as a renewed slide in the currency would push up import costs and broader inflation, some analysts say. The yen fell to a nearly nine-month low against the dollar on Thursday despite Ueda's hawkish comments. Data on Friday showed core consumer inflation in Japan's capital, a leading indicator of nationwide trends, perked up in October and remained above the central bank's 2 per cent target. Further rises in the cost of living would run counter to Takaichi's pledge to cushion households' blow from inflation. Former BOJ executive Akira Otani expects the BOJ to hike rates in January, when enough data becomes available on whether companies will weather the tariff hit and keep hiking pay. But he cites the yen as potentially changing the timing. \"At present, we don't see a strong chance of a December rate increase,\" said Otani, currently managing director at Goldman Sachs Japan. \"But the possibility could heighten if yen falls accelerate and increase the risk of inflation overshooting the BOJ's baseline forecast made in October.\"",

            "title": "Commentary: Nvidia’s US$5 trillion valuation redefines what Big Tech means",
            "description": "NEW YORK: On Wednesday (Oct 29), just 112 days after becoming the first US$4 trillion company, Nvidia became the first US$5 trillion company .  It’s worth is more than 8 per cent of the S&P 500, but that’s just the start of it - the AI boost to the markets is built almost entirely off the back of use cases developed on Nvidia chips. The AI strategies of the biggest tech companies, like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and others, rest on their ability to hurriedly acquire and deploy Nvidia’s hardware in their data centres. While some rivals are trying to develop their own alternatives, notes analyst group Wedbush, “there is only one chip in the world fuelling this AI Revolution … and it’s Nvidia.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the man they call the Godfather of AI, has spent this week reassuring the world he is not creating a bubble. On his balance sheet, at least, the money is becoming very real: half a trillion dollars expected in revenue over the next five quarters from bookings for its latest chips.  “This is quite extraordinary,” Huang said of the moment as he sought to emphasise the diversity of businesses Nvidia is powering. These go well beyond the humble chatbot. Its presentations this week have spanned self-driving cars with Uber and Lucid Motors, AI-enhanced cybersecurity with CrowdStrike; pharmaceutical research with Eli Lilly, and an expansion into the nascent but promising realm of quantum computing. FEW ARE FINDING REASON TO BE CAUTIOUS The only blip along the way, if it could even be called that, were fears in September 2024 about the production delays of its latest chip, Blackwell, which triggered a sharp 13 per cent selloff. Then there was the worry that China’s DeepSeek would upend US tech sector spending on hardware. It didn’t, and those fears are long forgotten.  Huang says the company projects it will sell 20 million of its latest chips, more than five times the volume of the previous generation. This doesn’t take into account the possibility that talks on Thursday between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping of China might pave the way for Nvidia’s most sophisticated chips to be sold to China.  The country’s AI companies are eager for better hardware than what its homegrown chipmakers can offer. Current restrictions, which allow only for the sale of older generations of technology, represent the only meek regulatory constraint on Nvidia’s unstoppable rise.  Few are finding reason to be cautious. Concerns about circular financing, in which Nvidia invests in its own customers, do not appear to have altered investment theses. Nor has it dampened Nvidia’s appetite for a deal - the latest being a US$1 billion investment in Nokia , announced this week.  If Wall Street wanted to look for potential headwinds to Nvidia’s progress, they would start with its reliance on Taiwan - where most of the latest chips are produced - or in the lingering (though not yet pressing) risk that regulators scrutinise more closely the lock-in between Nvidia’s hardware and its proprietary software for AI development. The overly rash reaction to Blackwell production mishaps last year demonstrated how touchy investors are to any sign of turbulence in Nvidia’s supply chain and logistics.RISKS AND DANGERS More broadly, Nvidia needs the downstream rollout of AI - putting it in the hands of consumers and businesses - to start paying off, otherwise the wild capital expenditures might start getting pulled back. Nvidia is relying on others to actually reach the goal of human-level artificial intelligence that will, some say, make all the investment worthwhile. There was a time when Nvidia was a company responsible for making video games look better. Those carefree days are over.  The market cap milestone is a moment for reflection on how one company came to redefine the meaning of “big” in Big Tech at this moment of seismic change.  Beyond being just a big number, what is truly unprecedented in the Nvidia story is how integral its success is to the entire global economy: an industrial revolution in which only one company is seen as capable of building the factories. What made Nvidia into a US$5 trillion company is also what makes it a potential US$5 trillion single point of failure.",

            "description": "Strategy posted a profit in the third quarter, compared with a loss a year earlier, as improving sentiment around the cryptocurrency sector benefited the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, sending its shares up nearly 4 per cent after the bell. Until the fourth quarter of 2024, Strategy could only record impairment losses when bitcoin's value fell below its purchase price, while gains from price increases remained unrealized unless the cryptocurrency was sold. U.S. President Donald Trump's focus on the digital asset sector and his pledge to make America the global hub for cryptocurrencies, combined with strong ETF inflows, have helped bitcoin to scale multiple record highs in 2025. Strategy held 640,808 bitcoins as of October 26, at a total cost of $47.44 billion, or $74,032 per bitcoin. The world's biggest cryptocurrency currently trades at around $107,833. Rising bitcoin prices tend to appreciate Strategy's stock, enabling the company to raise additional capital for reinvestment into the cryptocurrency, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. The increase in bitcoin's value lifts net income at Strategy's buy-and-hold treasury model, which has inspired several other companies to adopt similar approaches. Strategy's net profit was $2.78 billion, or $8.42 per share, for the three months ended September 30, compared with a loss of $340.2 million, or $1.72 per share, a year earlier.

            "description": "Netflix is actively exploring a bid for Warner Bros Discovery's studio and streaming business, retaining a financial advisor and gaining access to financial information, according to three sources familiar with the matter. The video streaming service has hired Moelis & Co, the investment bank that advised Skydance Media on its successful bid for Paramount Global, to evaluate a prospective offer, two of the sources said. Netflix also has been granted access to the data room, which contains the financial details needed to make a bid, according to two of the sources familiar with the matter. Warner Bros Discovery and Moelis declined to comment. Netflix could not be reached for comment. Owning Warner Bros' studio business would give Netflix control over some of Hollywood's most successful stories and characters, including the Harry Potter and DC Comics franchises. Warner Bros' prolific television studio also produces many of Netflix's hits, including original series like \"Running Point,\" \"You\" and \"Maid.\" HBO and its companion streaming service would add more prestige dramas, and subscribers. Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos told investors last week that while the company is traditionally \"more builders than buyers,\" it does evaluate acquisitions based on criteria such as the size of the opportunity and whether it would strengthen the company's entertainment offerings. Sarandos indicated Netflix would not be interested in acquiring Warner Bros Discovery's cable television networks, which include CNN, TNT, Food Network and Animal Planet. \"We've been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks,\" Sarandos said in the company's third-quarter investor video. \"There is no change there.\" Warner Bros Discovery announced last week that it would begin evaluating options, after receiving a trio of unsolicited offers from Paramount Skydance to acquire the entire company. The company said its board would consider whether to move forward with its planned split, which would separate the Warner Bros film and television studios, HBO and the companion HBO Max streaming service from its television business, or pursue a sale of all or parts of the company. Comcast President Mike Cavanagh told investors on Thursday the company is evaluating media assets that would be \"complementary\" to its existing business. He also appeared to dismiss those who are skeptical of Comcast winning regulatory approval, saying \"more things are viable than maybe some of the public commentary that's out there.\"",

            "description": "TOKYO :Core inflation in Japan's capital accelerated in October and stayed above the central bank's 2 per cent target, data showed on Friday, keeping alive market expectations for a near-term interest rate hike. But the increase was driven mostly by stubbornly high food costs with service-sector inflation staying modest, a sign companies were slow in passing through rising labour costs. The data followed the Bank of Japan's decision on Thursday to keep interest rates steady at 0.5 per cent that drew two dissenters from the board fretting about broadening inflationary pressure. The Tokyo core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 2.8 per cent in October from a year earlier, data showed on Friday, exceeding market forecasts for a 2.6 per cent gain and accelerating from a 2.5 per cent gain in September. A separate index for Tokyo that strips away both fresh food and fuel costs - closely watched by the BOJ as a measure of domestic demand-driven prices - rose 2.8 per cent in October from a year earlier after a 2.5 per cent increase in September. The increase was driven partly by a 38.4 per cent rise in the price of Japan's staple rice and an end to subsidies for water fees. Food inflation, excluding prices for volatile fresh food, stood at 6.7 per cent in October, slowing from 6.9 per cent in September, the data showed. Services inflation, at 1.6 per cent in October, was roughly steady from 1.5 per cent in September and much slower than a 4.1 per cent gain in goods prices, the data showed. \"Core consumer inflation is expected to slow as the effects of food price rises dissipate,\" said Masato Koike, senior economist at Sompo Institute Plus. \"While we expect the BOJ to raise interest rates in January, further hikes could become difficult,\" he said. The BOJ has stressed the need to see inflation driven more by solid demand and wage gains, rather than the push from raw material costs, to resume interest rate hikes. The BOJ exited a decade-long, radical stimulus programme last year and raised short-term interest rates to 0.5 per cent in January on the view Japan was on the cusp of sustainably hitting its 2 per cent inflation target. While consumer inflation has exceeded the BOJ's 2 per cent target for well over three years, Governor Kazuo Ueda has stressed the need to tread cautiously in further rate hikes on uncertainty over the impact of U.S. tariffs on Japan's economy. In a sign companies are weathering the hit from tariffs for now, separate data released on Friday showed Japan's factory output rose 2.2 per cent in September from the previous month, exceeding market forecasts for a 1.6 per cent gain. The jobless rate in September was unchanged from the previous month at 2.6 per cent, government data showed.",

The company posted an operating profit of 573 billion won ($403.10 million) for the July-September period, versus a 423 billion won loss a year earlier. That compared with an average analyst forecast of 304 billion won profit. Third-quarter revenue rose 16.3 per cent to 20.5 trillion won from the same period a year earlier. SK On, which supplies batteries to Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen, Hyundai Motor among others widened its operating loss to 124.8 billion won in the third quarter from 66.4 billion won loss in the previous quarter, hurt by slowing EV battery shipments. SK Innovation said in a statement that its battery unit's third-quarter performance was hurt by lower battery sales, affected by the phase-out of subsidies for battery-powered vehicles in the United States. In September, SK On signed a deal with U.S.-based Flatiron Energy Development to supply lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for energy storage systems (ESS), marking its first order for LFP batteries to use in ESS. SK's deal echoes a trend among EV battery makers expanding into energy storage as a hedge against slow EV battery demand. SK On's cross-town rival LG Energy Solution on Thursday said it expects U.S. EV battery sales to decline this year from a year ago. Shares in SK Innovation were trading up 0.2 per cent, versus the benchmark KOSPI's 0.3 per cent rise, after the company's earnings announcement. ($1 = 1,421.4800 won)",

            "description": "SINGAPORE: Air Japan will cease all flight operations from March 2026, almost two years after Japanese airline group ANA launched the brand to offer low-cost flights mainly on Asian routes.  Its final flight will be from Singapore to Narita Airport on Mar 29 at 12.55am.  ANA Group said on Thursday (Oct 30) that the decision comes as it seeks to restructure its brand strategy. Currently, it has three brands - full-service flight operator ANA, low-cost carrier Peach, as well as AirJapan, which operates as a hybrid carrier. The restructuring will consolidate ANA Group's flight operations into two brands - its namesake airline and Peach. \"This decision is aimed at maximising the entire group's profitability and competitiveness while flexibly responding to recent changes in the business environment,\" said ANA Group. It cited concerns about global developments such as the war in Ukraine and aircraft delivery delays , and added that it is also managing the aircraft on the ground (AOG) situation involving its Boeing 787 aircraft. AOG is an aviation term for planes that are unable to fly due to technical, mechanical or maintenance issues. \"To optimise the allocation of the group's resources, ANA Group decided to suspend the Air Japan brand. Its aircraft and human resources will be consolidated into the ANA brand's operations to expand its international business,\" it said. Air Japan had said on Sep 4 that it would ramp up its schedule with daily Singapore-Tokyo flights from Nov 21 due to the addition of another aircraft to its fleet. It also touted its \" well-priced\" one-way fares starting at S$226 (US$174).",

            "title": "China factory activity shrinks for seventh month, PMI shows",
            "description": "BEIJING: China's factory activity shrank for a seventh month in October, an official survey showed on Friday (Oct 31), keeping alive calls for further stimulus to boost domestic demand, with efforts to ship goods abroad merely exporting price wars. The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 49.0 in October from 49.8 in September, a six-month low, the National Bureau of Statistics' survey showed on Friday. It remained below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction, and missed a median forecast of 49.6 in a Reuters poll. The non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI), which includes services and construction, rose to 50.1 from 50.0 in September. \"Economic momentum has weakened since the middle of the year. The property sector slowdown continues to put pressure on domestic demand,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. \"The fiscal stance has not changed significantly to offset such downward pressure.\" The prolonged slump comes as manufacturers struggle to mount a sustained recovery in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic and a costly trade war with US President Donald Trump forces factory owners to give up on the world's top consumer market. Producers are also having difficulty making ends meet in new markets, with exporters increasingly selling at a loss in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. The PMI, a sentiment-based survey, has at times presented a gloomier picture of the economy than the hard data, with September's industrial output and profit figures showing growth for a third and second consecutive month, respectively. But analysts warn those gains were likely distorted by a push from China's large, state-owned firms. \"Given that we are actually seeking a bit more stimulus in the fourth quarter - investment driven by policy financing tools and new government bonds - I am a bit surprised by the drop in the PMI reading this month,\" said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. China's economic growth slowed to 4.8 per cent in the third quarter, its weakest pace in a year. While that keeps the world's second-largest economy on track to meet its target of roughly 5 per cent this year, it raises questions about Beijing's reliance on external demand amid mounting trade tensions. The ruling Communist Party pledged to boost domestic consumption following a four-day closed-door meeting last week that outlined economic and policy objectives for the next five years, while also emphasising efforts to strengthen its vast industrial system. However, analysts question whether Beijing has anything new to offer or is simply reaching for its usual playbook of channeling resources to large firms while bypassing private producers and households. Some analysts believe Beijing doesn't need more stimulus this year, while others see speeding up infrastructure investment as a way to ensure the economy remains on target in the fourth quarter. That does little to ease longer-term concerns over Beijing's ability to rebalance an economy in which household consumption trails global averages by about 20 per centage points of GDP. \"The stimulus will be just enough to reach the full-year target, and to not make any indicators look too bad leading up to the beginning of the fifteenth five-year plan period,\" said Dan Wang, director for China at Eurasia Group. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast the private-sector RatingDog PMI to come in at 50.9 on Monday, down from 51.2 a month prior.",
