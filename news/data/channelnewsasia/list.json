            "description": "Getty Images and Perplexity signed a global multi-year licensing agreement on Friday, allowing the AI startup to display the photo distributor's editorial and creative images across its search and discovery tools. Shares of Getty, which serves millions of customers worldwide through its brands and vast image library, soared 50 per cent in early trading following the deal. Under the agreement, Perplexity will integrate Getty's API technology into its AI platform workflows, enabling users to access premium visuals while improving image attribution. The collaboration is part of a wider trend of digital platforms signing licensing deals with AI content providers to expand content access while respecting intellectual property rights and generating revenue. Perplexity also plans to include image credits and source links to educate users on the proper legal use of licensed content. AI firms' use of copyrighted content has drawn mounting scrutiny and has triggered lawsuits. Getty, which also licenses to platforms like iStock and Unsplash, has previously sued Stability AI over image scraping. Perplexity also has faced multiple copyright lawsuits from prominent publishers, including Japan's Nikkei and Asahi Shimbun, and has since introduced a revenue-sharing model, partnering with outlets like TIME, Der Spiegel and others. The licensing deal follows Getty's efforts to support AI-driven creativity, enabling users to generate visuals safely using licensed content in generative AI tools.",

            "description": "KARACHI :Pakistan said it has awarded 23 offshore exploration blocks to four consortiums led by local energy companies, some partnered with foreign firms including Turkey's national oil company TPAO. In Pakistan's first such bidding round in nearly two decades, its energy ministry said on Friday that bids were awarded for 23 of 40 offshore blocks offered, covering around 53,500 square kilometres. The energy ministry listed state-run Oil and Gas Development Co. Ltd (OGDCL), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) and MariEnergies, along with privately-owned Prime Energy, which is backed by Pakistan's Hub Power Company (Hubco), among the successful bidders. TPAO secured a 25 per cent stake in one of the awarded blocks and the right to operate it after signing a joint bidding agreement with Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) earlier this year to explore the country's offshore prospects. Other partners include Hong Kong-based United Energy Group, Orient Petroleum, a major local independent producer, and Fatima Petroleum, part of Pakistan's Fatima Group conglomerate. The four winning consortiums, led by OGDCL, PPL, Mari Petroleum and Prime Energy, collectively pledged about $80 million in exploration work over the initial three-year period, the energy ministry said. Total investment could rise to between $750 million and $1 billion if drilling proceeds, it added. Pakistan's 300,000 square kilometre offshore zone, bordering energy-rich Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Iran, has seen just 18 wells drilled since the country's independence in 1947, too few to fully assess its hydrocarbon potential. Pakistan, which imports about half its oil, is seeking to revive foreign interest after the failure of the 2019 Kekra-1 well led to the exit of U.S. major Exxon Mobil.",

            "description": "Shares of data storage companies such as Seagate and Western Digital have sharply outperformed the broader market this year, powered by the staggering demand for hard drives in the global race to scale up AI-related infrastructure. Both Seagate and Western Digital stocks are trading near record highs, having surged more than 200 per cent this year on the artificial intelligence boom. Western Digital gained 10.5 per cent in premarket trading on Friday after it forecast second-quarter earnings above Wall Street estimates. \"The fact that WDC has secured purchase orders extending through CY26 with five of its largest customers is a clear indication that customers are unwilling to risk falling short on storage capacity as AI-related demand continues to march higher,\" J.P.Morgan analysts said in a note. Earlier this week, rival Seagate Technology also forecast second-quarter revenue and profit above estimates late Tuesday. Its shares have surged 20 per cent since, and were up 1.7 per cent on Friday. Seagate and Western Digital are the second and third-highest percentage gainers this year on the S&P 500, only behind trading platform operator Robinhood. Smaller rival Sandisk, spun out of Western Digital in February, has also seen a five-fold jump in its stock since listing. Shares of the company, which will report its results on November 6, were up 3.1 per cent on Friday. The S&P 1500 technology hardware, storage and peripherals sector - which houses all three companies - has jumped more than 11 per cent for the year and hit a record high on Thursday. Tech giants Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon all announced plans for higher annual capital expenditures as they pour money into chips and data centers. Global AI-related infrastructure spending could reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, Goldman Sachs estimates. \"If you went back twelve months or twenty-four months and you asked somebody about AI, they wouldn't have talked about hard disks... It's exciting,\" said Martin Frandsen, portfolio manager at Principal Asset Management.",

            "title": "Nvidia to supply 260,000 cutting-edge chips to South Korea",
            "description": "GYEONGJU, South Korea: United States tech giant Nvidia said on Friday (Oct 31) it will supply 260,000 of its most cutting-edge chips to South Korea, as CEO Jensen Huang met President Lee Jae Myung and the heads of the country's biggest companies on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. South Korea is home to two of the world's leading memory chip makers - Samsung Electronics and SK hynix - which manufacture chips essential for artificial intelligence products and the data centres that the fast-evolving industry relies on. Lee has also expressed his hope that the country can become the world's third AI power after the US and China. Speaking to media after the announcement, Huang said that the goal was \"ambitious\". But, he said, \"there's no reason why Korea cannot achieve it - you have the technology, you have the software expertise, and you also have a natural ability to build manufacturing plants\". Nvidia has been caught in the middle of that geopolitical tussle. Its chips are currently not sold in China due to a combination of Beijing government bans , US national security concerns and ongoing trade tensions.Huang has urged the US to allow the sale of US-made AI chips in China in order to ensure Silicon Valley companies remain a global powerhouse in providing AI. \"The US government and the Chinese government have to decide what role they would like Nvidia to play,\" Huang told reporters on Friday. \"I've been very clear that having Nvidia technology in China is in the best interest of the US and in the best interest of China as well,\" he said. \"I'm optimistic,\" he added. And asked if he wanted Nvidia's most high-tech chip, the Blackwell, to be sold in China, he said: \"I hope so.\" \"But that's a decision for President Trump to make.\" Nvidia's chips featured in talks between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Gyeongju this week. Beijing has ramped up its chip industry to beat Washington's export restrictions on the critical component used to power AI systems.CHICKEN AND CHIPS Under Friday's deal, 50,000 of the graphics processing units will go towards a new \"AI factory\" being built by Samsung Electronics. \"By deploying more than 50,000 Nvidia GPUs, AI will be embedded throughout Samsung's entire manufacturing flow,\" the Korean tech giant said. SK Group and Hyundai Motor Group will also receive 50,000 chips for use in AI facilities. NAVER Cloud - which operates South Korea's largest search engine - will receive 60,000 to expand its AI infrastructure. A further 50,000 will be deployed across Seoul's National AI Computing Center and to cloud service and IT providers. Huang has sought to forge closer ties with South Korean tech giants in his visit to the country this week. He met Samsung Chairman Lee Jae-yong and Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Chung Eui-sun on Thursday for \"chimaek\" - a beloved South Korean pairing of fried chicken and beer - in the capital Seoul. The restaurant, Kkanbu, was reportedly chosen by Nvidia because the term - popularised by Netflix's megahit \"Squid Game\" and meaning \"friend\" - was intended to highlight the spirit of friendship underpinning their AI and chip collaborations. Nvidia in July became the first company to top US$4 trillion in market capitalisation, and followed that up by becoming the first to hit US$5 trillion following an event on Tuesday where it announced new ventures building on its AI technology.",

            "description": "TAIPEI :Taiwan's top chip design company, MediaTek, expects to earn revenue of billions of dollars from its AI accelerator ASIC chips by 2027, the chief executive said on Friday, as the company pushes further into the data centre business. Chief Executive Rick Tsai told a quarterly earnings conference call that MediaTek was on track to generate $1 billion in revenue from its cloud AI chips in 2026 after its first AI accelerator ASIC project was well executed. \"The first project we generate multiple billions in 2027,\" Tsai said. \"And another project we'll start delivering revenue starting 2028 and beyond.\" The total addressable market (TAM) for data center ASIC chip is now estimated at $50 billion and MediaTek is striving to gain market share of at least 10 to 15 per cent in the next two years, Tsai added. On Monday, competitor Qualcomm unveiled two artificial intelligence chips for data centres that will be available in 2026 and 2027. MediaTek has partnered with Nvidia to co-design the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip used in Nvidia's DGX Spark, a personal AI supercomputer that went on sale this month. In September, Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in Intel. Asked whether Nvidia’s investment in Intel, its rival in CPUs, would have any impact on MediaTek's future cooperation with Nvidia, Tsai said he did not believe the news would affect the companies' joint efforts on the GB10. On Friday, MediaTek reported third-quarter revenue of T$142.1 billion ($4.64 billion), up 7.8 per cent from a year earlier, while net income was down 0.5 per cent at T$25.5 billion. MediaTek shares have fallen 7.4 per cent this year, underperforming a rise of 22.6 per cent in the benchmark index. The stock closed flat on Friday ahead of its earnings release. The world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, raised its full-year revenue forecast this month on a bullish outlook for spending on AI, after posting a record profit that blew past market estimates.  ($1=30.5930 Taiwan dollars)",

            "description": "BANGKOK :Thailand's economy improved in September from the previous month due to a rebound in manufacturing, rising exports and increasing foreign tourism receipts, but it was weaker over the entire July to September quarter, the central bank said on Friday. Domestic demand also slowed over the month, with both private consumption and investment showing declines, the Bank of Thailand said in a statement. Exports, a key driver of the economy, jumped 19.2 per cent in September from a year earlier while imports increased 18.0 per cent, the central bank said, leading to a trade surplus of $3.6 billion. The current account surplus THCURA=ECI was $1.9 billion in September. For the whole of the third quarter, the economy softened compared to the previous quarter after a decline in manufacturing output, reflecting temporary production halts in certain products, as well as weaker domestic demand, the central bank said. The central bank had earlier forecast year-on-year growth of 1.5 per cent in the third quarter and a 0.5 per cent dip compared to the previous three months. Third-quarter gross domestic product data is due on November 17. The central bank forecast economic growth of 2.2 per cent this year and 1.6 per cent next year. Southeast Asia's second-largest economy expanded 2.5 per cent last year, lagging peers. The central bank unexpectedly left its key rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent. Governor Vitai Ratanakorn earlier said rates could be cut if needed to lift inflation and growth. The next policy review is due on December 17. The economy has struggled with U.S. tariffs, high household debt, and a strong baht currency, prompting the government to introduce a series of stimulus measures, including a 44 billion baht ($1.34 billion) consumer subsidy programme. On Thursday, the finance ministry raised its 2025 GDP growth forecast to 2.4 per cent from 2.2 per cent and predicted 2 per cent growth next year.",

            "description": "BENGALURU :Happiest Minds Technologies expects a double-digit revenue share from its generative AI business within three years, up from 1.6 per cent in fiscal 2025, as clients accelerate AI spending to cut costs and boost productivity, its top executive told Reuters. This makes it the first Indian IT firm to give a revenue forecast tied to the futuristic technology and the second in the $283 billion sector to report AI-related revenue after HCLTech. Earlier this month, HCLTech said advanced AI quarterly revenue crossed $100 million, accounting for around 2.7 per cent of total sales, in the September quarter. Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence that creates new content such as text, images or code by learning from existing data. It powers tools like ChatGPT and Gemini that mimic human-like output. \"Today, all the new businesses we are signing, there is a huge amount of AI at play. When our sales guys go (to pitch to clients), they get an entry at the table only through AI,\" MD Venkatraman Narayanan said on Wednesday. \"That's the flavour of the season.\" Happiest Minds said its GenAI projects command a 20 per cent–25 per cent premium over standard rates. It has identified 22 use cases with $50 million sales potential, with five projects already live, including three valued at over $1 million each. The company raked in about $4 million in the first half of the current fiscal year from GenAI-led services and expects the revenue to double by the end of the year. Use cases span from student onboarding and grade management in the ed-tech sector to automating inventory and invoicing in consumer goods, Narayanan said. The company's GenAI growth target looks challenging but is feasible due to the low base, said Centrum Broking analyst Piyush Pandey, adding \"it is possible because the GenAI unit is growing faster than the rest of the business.\" A Massachusetts Institute of Technology study in August found that 95 per cent of organisations globally saw no returns on $30 billion–$40 billion in GenAI investments, citing integration challenges and user skill gaps.",

            "description": "A momentous week in the technology sector made it clear there is no sign the boom in building artificial intelligence infrastructure is slowing — despite the bubble talk. Nvidia, whose processors are the AI revolution's backbone, became the first company to surpass $5 trillion in market value. Microsoft and OpenAI inked a deal enhancing the ChatGPT maker's fundraising ability and OpenAI promptly started laying groundwork for an initial public offering that could value the company at $1 trillion.  Amazon said it would cut 14,000 corporate jobs, just days before its cloud unit posted its strongest growth in nearly three years. These developments, along with numerous earnings calls and interviews with executives, make clear that AI has cemented itself as the single biggest catalyst for global corporate investment and the engine of the market rally, even as some question the sustainability of both. SPENDING WITHOUT ENDING Soaring revenue at Microsoft, Alphabet and other technology giants was expected. But more than 100 non-tech global companies noted data centers on quarterly calls this week, including Honeywell, turbine maker GE Vernova, and heavy equipment maker Caterpillar. Sales in Caterpillar's division that supplies data centers jumped 31 per cent in its most recent quarter. \"We're definitely really excited about the prime power opportunity with data centers,\" CEO Joseph Creed said this week.  “The AI supply chain now spans power, industrials and cooling technology, and investors are looking at the entire ecosystem rather than just core tech,\" said Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio manager at Wealth Enhancement Group. Goldman Sachs estimates global AI-related infrastructure spending could reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet are expected to spend roughly $350 billion combined this year. AI investment is propping up global trade, with about 60 per cent of U.S. data-center capex spent on imported IT equipment, according to Oxford Economics, much of it semiconductors from Taiwan, South Korea and Vietnam. At least two dozen companies representing more than $21 trillion in combined market value reported quarterly earnings or spoke with Reuters about AI in recent days. Many, including Procter & Gamble and Boliden, noted that the hoped-for productivity gains, though uneven, are beginning to show. \"We strongly believe the future contribution of artificial intelligence within R&D, within developing innovation, will steadily increase,\" Schindler CEO Paolo Compagna told Reuters, though he said AI's impact is yet to be seen. The Swiss lift and escalator maker raised its annual margin forecast last week. Year-over-year revenue growth in the U.S. tech sector is up more than 15 per cent, outpacing all other sectors, according to LSEG data. Apple said it was significantly increasing AI investment and Amazon projected capital spending of $125 billion in 2025. WORRIES ABOUT OVERVALUATION Since ChatGPT’s debut in 2022, global equity values have climbed 46 per cent, or $46 trillion. One-third of that gain has come from AI-linked companies, according to Bespoke Investment Group.  Analysts warn of a quickening replacement cycle for servers, accelerators and chips as each new generation delivers exponential performance gains. The useful life of AI chips is shrinking to five years or less, forcing companies to “write down assets faster and replace them sooner,\" said UBS semiconductor analyst Tim Arcuri. The surge in AI-related spending has widened the gap between investment and returns, with a Reuters analysis showing that sales-to-capex ratios at major tech firms have fallen sharply as outlays on chips and data centers grow faster than revenue. Capital expenditures represent a larger chunk of cash generated by operating activities for some companies, causing some investor concern. “If progress hasn’t been made toward monetization within three years, the market will start asking hard questions,\" said Sumali Sanyal, senior portfolio manager at investment firm Xponance. Microsoft reported a record $35 billion in capex in its most recent quarter and projected higher spending, prompting Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler to ask whether the company was spending into a bubble. Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood responded that AI-related demand still outpaces Microsoft's spending. \"I thought we were going to catch up. We are not,\" she said.  Some companies are financing AI projects with debt. Oracle’s $18 billion bond sale last month was one of the largest ever for a tech company, and it looks set to be surpassed by an up to $30 billion bond sale from Meta Platforms. News of its largest ever bond sale knocked Meta's shares down 11 per cent on Thursday. Still, many economists say the AI cycle is far from exhausted. Goldman estimates AI investment is currently less than 1 per cent of U.S. GDP, far below peaks of 2 per cent to 5 per cent seen during the electricity and dot-com booms. “We are in the early innings ... and the pace of AI innovation is the fastest we have seen in decades,” said Nick Evans, portfolio manager at Polar Capital Technology Trust. ",

            "description": "Coinbase's first-mover advantage as the only publicly traded crypto exchange helped it top earnings estimates again, but competition is looming from clearer rules and newly listed companies, Wall Street analysts said on Friday. The global crypto market has swelled to $3.7 trillion as institutional and retail investors pour money into digital assets. President Donald Trump has eased regulatory hurdles in the United States after taking office in January, driving bitcoin to record highs and paving the way for the industry's biggest players to tap public markets. \"While we think regulatory clarity for cryptocurrency and stablecoins will remain a positive tailwind for volume, it will also likely lead to additional competition,\" analysts at brokerage Morningstar said, adding Coinbase's premium pricing will likely face increasing pressure.  Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, listed on the Nasdaq in September. Rival Bullish went public in August, while Kraken is reportedly preparing to list in the first half of 2026. The growing roster of public crypto exchanges signals a maturing market and poses the strongest challenge yet to Coinbase's dominance. \"Coinbase has established itself as the most institutionally trusted crypto company in the world. That said, we remain cautious on the retail outlook given rising competition and management's recent comments around customers wanting to trade more than just crypto,\" Piper Sandler analysts wrote in a note.  Coinbase ranks third among the top crypto spot exchanges globally on crypto analytics provider CoinMarketCap, trailing Binance and Bybit. It beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter profit after the bell on Thursday, underpinned by a surge in trading volume. On a post-earnings call, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said regulatory clarity in the U.S. and globally is starting to bear fruit, helping drive growth in the crypto sector, but added it means \"that lots of new competition is coming in and so we need to make sure we're executing well\".  The company has expanded its product portfolio through a string of acquisitions in recent years, including a $2.9 billion deal for derivatives exchange Deribit in May and a $375 million purchase of investment platform Echo earlier this month.  CFO Alesia Haas added \"we've always faced competition\", noting that Coinbase has continued to grow its market share, scale and trading volume. Analysts expect Coinbase to continue its acquisition spree. \"We think the M&A door remains very much open for future acquisitions and strategic investments,\" J.P. Morgan analysts said.  \"With a leading market position and solid industry and government relationships, we think Coinbase is in an advantaged position to submit competitive bids as an aggressive acquirer.\"  Shares of the crypto exchange were last up 5 per cent in premarket trading. ",

            "title": "AI turned Google Cloud from also-ran into Alphabet’s growth driver",
            "description": "NEW YORK, NY :Once a money-losing backwater, Google Cloud has become one of Alphabet's fastest-growing businesses, powered by massive bets on AI and years of costly investment in datacenters, custom chips, and networking gear. Alphabet’s cloud revenue topped $15 billion in the third quarter, a 34 per cent increase reflecting strong demand for AI infrastructure and services, including Google’s own Gemini model, the company announced Wednesday. Google Cloud is now challenging YouTube as Alphabet’s No. 2 cash generator behind its search ads business. “Google Cloud is one of the most important priorities for Alphabet as a whole and I expect it to play an even more central role as the company moves forward,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told Reuters in an interview earlier in October. Much of the cloud unit’s growth can be attributed to the business bets and diplomatic maneuvering of its head Thomas Kurian, who joined Google from Oracle in 2018 and grew the unit’s market share from 7 per cent then to 13 per cent in 2025, according to Synergy Research Group, which tracks the cloud industry. When Pichai replaced Google co-founder Larry Page as CEO in 2019, he identified Google Cloud and YouTube as his two big bets to move Alphabet beyond its core business of search advertising.  Since then, YouTube has largely delivered, becoming the world’s largest video platform with 1 billion hours watched per day. By contrast, Google Cloud lost billions between 2018 and 2022 due to heavy investments in servers, datacenters and chips until it turned its first profit in 2023. Now, with generative AI, Alphabet sees a chance to close the gap with rivals Microsoft and Amazon, which hold 20 per cent and 30 per cent market share respectively. Making Google Cloud a contender has come at a cost: Alphabet has already shocked Wall Street twice during quarterly earnings this year by proclaiming higher-than-expected capital spending due to the need to build more infrastructure to fulfill cloud demand. “This is the moment Google Cloud was waiting for,” Dave McCarthy, who directs coverage of the cloud industry for research firm IDC. “A lot of the future growth at Alphabet is being looked at through its potential.” In exclusive interviews with Reuters, senior Alphabet executives mapped out the gameplan that transformed the also-ran into a growth driver: a cultural shift to a more customer-driven sales approach; changing how it worked with rivals; and a renewed focus on delivering profits. ‘GET OUT OF HERE, KID’ Back when Kurian joined Alphabet, Google Cloud struggled to win enterprise customers, unlike the ads side of the business which was dealing with the biggest companies in the world. “We would go to the ads team asking, ‘Hey, can you help us out with this customer?’ And they would basically be like, ‘Get out of here, kid,’” said Josh Gwyther, a startup founder who worked at Google Cloud from 2016 to 2025. That’s not a problem anymore: Google’s scope of AI offerings have brought it into conversations with large companies that previously only considered Amazon and Microsoft.  “The ads business is extremely healthy, but it’s not going to grow at the pace that we are,” said Matt Renner, Google Cloud’s president of global revenue.  Nine of the 10 leading AI labs are now customers, Kurian said at an industry conference in September. They include OpenAI, Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence. Details of Google’s deals with two of those labs were first reported by Reuters earlier this year. To get there, Kurian took a mallet to traditional practices, replacing it with what several employees called an “un-Googley” culture.  Kurian, who left a job as one of Larry Ellison’s highest-paid lieutenants at Oracle, brought financial discipline to Google’s “loosely-run, ground-up culture” that encouraged side projects and experimentation, said Chirag Mehta, a tech analyst who worked at Google Cloud from 2017 to 2021. To slash costs, Kurian opened new offices in cheaper locations, such as North Carolina and Poland. He audited Google Cloud’s contracts for internal services and renegotiated those where he deemed his unit was being overcharged by other departments, as was first reported in The Information. He has ordered employees to focus on revenue rather than bookings. Google Cloud also shifted its sales strategy to target customers by sector rather than geography. That helped reduce sales reps being assigned accounts in industries where they lacked specialized knowledge, said Renner. Its focus on generative AI has allowed it to catch up with rivals Microsoft and Amazon from a technical standpoint, according to some analysts.  “We believe that the three clouds competitively are on roughly equal footing,” said Goldman Sachs managing director Eric Sheridan. “That’s a very different competitive positioning for Google Cloud now than two or three years ago.” WORKING WITH THE ENEMY For years, Alphabet had reserved the lion’s share of its own chips, or TPUs, for in-house use only. That changed in 2022, when Kurian successfully lobbied to move the group selling TPUs from Google’s core engineering unit into Google Cloud. That move drastically increased Google Cloud's allocation of TPUs because the unit could now freely offer the chips rather than having to receive approval from another part of the company, according to two people familiar with the move. At a time when the world was scrambling for compute, Alphabet made the decision to make its chips available to not just its own DeepMind AI unit, but also to its competitors.  That decision stoked tensions internally, according to former employees of both units, but it gave Kurian a stronger sales pitch for courting customers. “We are the only hyperscaler with both silicon and models of our own,” he said. “How deep is your technical differentiation when the same stuff that you’re reselling can be bought from somebody else?” Google Cloud quickly leveraged the opportunity to petition Anthropic to test TPUs as a viable alternative to Nvidia’s GPUs, according to a former Google Cloud executive involved in the partnership. By 2024, Anthropic had seen enough to deploy Alphabet’s TPUs at scale. In October, it expanded its deal with Google to use as many as one million TPUs, worth tens of billions of dollars. The startup, which is now valued at $183 billion, has also tapped Amazon for chips as it reduces its dependency on Nvidia, which controls about 80 per cent of the AI chip market. “The whole world was sort of on GPUs, OpenAI in particular,” said Dan Rosenthal, who manages Anthropic’s partnerships with Google and Amazon. The need for chips “pushed us to be more flexible,” he said. Other AI developers including Apple and Safe Superintelligence have since adopted Alphabet's TPUs. Pichai told analysts on an earnings conference call this week that Alphabet is \"investing in TPU capacity to meet the tremendous demand we are seeing from customers and partners.\" And although Google Cloud launched an enterprise version of its flagship model Gemini in October, Kurian told Reuters he would welcome adding OpenAI’s family of enterprise models to Google Cloud if the ChatGPT maker was interested. POWER SHIFT The ascent of Google Cloud is shifting the balance of power inside Alphabet. Current and former executives told Reuters Kurian has gained clout at Google’s weekly “leads,” the agenda-setting meetings where division leaders jostle over resources and priorities. “What Thomas has been a powerful voice for is making sure that when we say we’re focusing on the user, that we’re focusing on the enterprise customer too,” Pichai said. It still has a long way to catch up with its rivals and it will be expensive to get there. In July, Pichai hiked Alphabet’s projected capital spending for 2025 by $10 billion to $85 billion. This week, he raised the projection again to between $91 billion and $93 billion, adding that 2026 was likely to run an even larger bill. With concerns over an AI bubble growing, Pichai told Reuters that he expects Google Cloud’s business to have “a lot of resilience” against short-term market corrections. “From our standpoint, we've been doing the AI thing for a decade now, and we're going to be doing it a decade from now.”",

            "title": "Taiwan plans to raise 2025 growth target as AI boom boosts Q3 figures",
            "description": "TAIPEI :Taiwan plans to raise its economic growth forecast this year to more than 5 per cent after the economy expanded by a better-than-expected rate in the third quarter given a strong performance by the crucial tech sector thanks to the AI boom. Taiwan's gross domestic product grew 7.64 per cent year-on-year in the July-September quarter, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said on Friday. That surpassed the 6.0 per cent forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, though slightly lagged the 8.01 per cent growth rate in the second quarter. The better-than-expected growth will pave the way to raise the full-year forecast to more than 5 per cent, the agency said, from a previous prediction of 4.45 per cent. A formal unveiling of the final forecast for 2025 will come at the end of next month. \"The performance was truly outstanding,\" said analyst Kevin Wang of Taishin Investment Advisory. \"It mainly benefited from strong demand for AI, driving increased capital expenditure in the cloud industry, supporting robust AI exports, and offsetting the impact of weak exports from traditional industries.\" Taiwan's key semiconductor chip industry is currently exempt from the 20 per cent U.S. tariffs on Taiwanese exports in effect since August. Taiwan is in talks with the United States to get that rate reduced. Taiwan is a major hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Nvidia, and home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, whose semiconductors are widely used for AI applications. Taiwan's tech firms have reported roaring demand thanks to the surge in interest in AI applications. TSMC this month reported a record, forecast-beating quarterly profit, and raised its 2025 full-year revenue forecast on a bullish outlook for spending on AI. The continued strong growth of the economy reinforces the view that Taiwan's central bank will be one of the few in Asia to leave interest rates unchanged this coming year, some analysts said. \"The main reasons are mild inflationary pressure and the far better-than-expected economic growth,\" said Wang. Taiwan's statistics agency will provide revised figures on November 28 with more details and the update of its forward-looking forecasts.",

            "title": "Amazon shares soar as AI boom fuels stellar growth in AWS cloud unit",
            "description": "Amazon shares jumped nearly 12 per cent in premarket trade on Friday after strong growth at its cloud unit and a bullish sales outlook eased fears that the tech giant was falling behind rivals in the AI race. Revenue at Amazon Web Services, the hub of the company's recent AI investments, rose 20 per cent in the third quarter, compared with Microsoft Azure's 40 per cent and Google Cloud's 34 per cent. However, analysts said the rebound marked a potential turning point for Amazon. The company's $33 billion in quarterly cloud revenue is more than double of Google's $15.16 billion. \"There was definitely concern about AWS losing market share to Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud,\" said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital. \"But now AWS is aboard the train as well and they're seeing a big revenue increase.\" The Seattle-based company has relied on strong cloud demand to offset pressures on e-commerce as consumer spending softens amid tariff uncertainty and inflation. Still, worries over its slower pace in winning major AI deals have weighed on the stock, up just 1.6 per cent this year, making it the worst performer among the \"Magnificent Seven.\" CEO Andy Jassy said on Thursday AWS is \"growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022,\" citing strong demand for AI and core infrastructure. Like other Big Tech firms, Amazon also forecast increased capital spending over the next year. Amazon's forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio recently stood at 29.63, surpassing Alphabet's 25.98 but trailing Microsoft's 31.72. RETAIL, ADS PITCH IN The company's retail and advertising businesses also delivered strong performances. Retail revenue rose 11 per cent year-over-year, outpacing most large U.S. peers, while advertising sales jumped 24 per cent to $17.7 billion. \"Amazon's retail results were very good. They're growing 11 per cent year over year. Name me another big retailer in America growing that fast - they don't exist,\" said Jed Ellerbroek of Argent Capital. The company has been expanding ad placements across Echo devices, grocery carts, and sponsored listings, helping boost margins and diversify revenue.",
