            "description": "Feb 27 : Shares of CoreWeave slumped around 12 per cent before the bell on Friday, after the company's plans to double capital expenditure this year fueled investor concerns about margin pressure and effective returns from its artificial intelligence push.  The cloud infrastructure company has committed significant capital toward the construction of large data centers filled with top-of-the line Nvidia chips to capitalize on the booming demand for AI services.  CoreWeave has budgeted $30 billion to $35 billion in capital expenditure this year, more than double the $14.9 billion it spent in 2025. The increased spending will put some \"short-term pressure on the margins,\" the company said. The company's ballooning spending mirrors that of hyperscale cloud providers such as Alphabet's Google and Amazon , which have collectively committed more than $600 billion this year for AI infrastructure buildouts.  Unlike Big Tech companies that are cushioned by massive cash reserves, neoclouds like CoreWeave and peer Nebius are more exposed to significant market downturns due to their business models. CoreWeave had $3.13 billion in cash and its equivalents, compared with Microsoft's $24.3 billion and Amazon's $86.8 billion, according to their most recent earnings reports.  Amsterdam-based Nebius earlier this month reported a sharp rise in capital spending to $2.1 billion in the December quarter from just $416 million in the prior year period. Neoclouds offer hardware and cloud capacity as services to other tech firms, usually by providing access to high-quality processors and cloud infrastructure.  Moreover, a rush to build out data centers could put pressure on chip availability. Any disruption to the supply could hamper CoreWeave's infrastructure plans and leave it with a revenue backlog it cannot fulfill. ",

            "description": "Feb 27 : U.S. commodities exchange operator CME Group has approved its first aluminium storage facilities in Taiwan after receiving several applications for new warehousing in Asia, the biggest regional market for the metal. In two separate notices late on Thursday, CME said it had approved two applications from warehousing firm C. Steinweg and one from Pacorini Global Services to store aluminium deliverable against its Comex aluminium futures contract in the southern Taiwanese port city of Kaohsiung. Reuters reported this month that the CME was set to approve facilities in Taiwan and another new base metals warehousing location, Hong Kong, as part of efforts to make its aluminium contract gain more traction in Asia. The London Metal Exchange already has warehousing in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The total approved outdoor storage capacity for aluminium at the CME's Taiwan sites is 95,000 metric tons - 50,000 tons and 20,000 tons for the two Steinweg locations and 25,000 tons for Pacorini's facility.",

            "description": "PARIS, Feb 27 : El Salvador-based stablecoin issuer Tether said it has frozen about $4.2 billion of its crypto tokens over links to \"illicit activity\", mostly in the past three years, as authorities around the world try to crack down on crypto-related crime. The world's largest stablecoin company, which has more than $180 billion of its dollar-pegged token in circulation, up from around $70 billion three years ago, is able to remotely freeze its tokens held in users' crypto wallets when asked to do so by law enforcement. Tether said this week it had helped the U.S. Justice Department freeze nearly $61 million worth of its tokens, called USDT, which were linked to \"pig-butchering\", a form of fraud in which scammers form a personal relationship with their victims. That brought its total frozen assets linked to illicit activity to $4.2 billion, of which $3.5 billion has been frozen since 2023, a spokesperson for Tether said in emailed comments late on Thursday. Tether has also previously said it had blocked wallets linked to human trafficking, and \"terrorism and warfare\" in Israel and Ukraine. Sanctioned Russian crypto exchange Garantex said last year Tether had blocked funds on its platform. Authorities around the world have long raised concerns about the role of crypto in illicit finance. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) last year called on countries to take stronger action to combat illicit finance in crypto markets, which are generally less regulated than mainstream financial markets. Money launderers received at least $82 billion in cryptocurrencies last year, up sharply from just $10 billion in 2020, partly driven by growth among Chinese-speaking groups, blockchain researchers said in January. Stablecoins are mostly used in crypto trading, and their volumes have surged in recent years.",

            "description": "Feb 27 : U.S. stock index futures slid on Friday as growing AI unease weighed on technology stocks, with the Nasdaq staring at its steepest monthly drop since March 2025, and investors awaited key inflation data later in the day. Technology stocks saw immense turbulence this month due to AI concerns, even as investors fretted about the payoff from massive planning spending on artificial-intelligence technology. Brewing tariff uncertainty also stoked volatility after the U.S. Supreme Court last week voided most of the duties U.S. President Donald Trump imposed last year. In response, Trump announced a temporary global tariff of 10 per cent that came into effect on Tuesday. Nvidia inched up 0.4 per cent in premarket trading after sliding more than 5 per cent in the previous session despite strong earnings, a sign that risk sentiment for all things AI remained shaky. Zscaler lost 9.1 per cent after the cloud security firm reported a wider net loss in the second quarter, while Intuit dipped 3.6 per cent after the financial software company forecast third-quarter profit below estimates. Software shares were rocked earlier this year on fears of industrywide AI-led disruptions. Financial brokerages, data analytics and legal services, real estate services and trucking are also hit hard by brewing AI concerns. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq clocked losses in the last session, with the Nasdaq closing below its 50-day moving average for the 17th straight session. The closely followed moving average is seen as a proxy for the intermediate-term trend. In economic data, a January producer prices reading due before the bell could offer insights into the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate path. At 06:00 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis fell 271 points, or 0.55 per cent, S&P 500 E-minis shed 24.75 points, or 0.36 per cent, and Nasdaq 100 E-minis lost 78 points, or 0.31 per cent. Most megacap and growth stocks inched lower. Chip stocks including AMD and Broadcom also declined. Netflix added 7.4 per cent as investors cheered its decision to exit the fight for Warner Bros Discovery, which fell 2 per cent, while Paramount Skydance advanced 7.8 per cent after it won the race for some of the world's most prized TV and film assets. Block surged nearly 19 per cent after the payments firm said it will cut over 4,000 jobs, nearly half its workforce, as part of an overhaul to embed artificial intelligence across its operation. Dell climbed 10.6 per cent after the PC-maker said it expects revenue from its key AI-optimized servers business to double in fiscal year 2027 and promised to return more cash to shareholders. Duolingo dropped almost 25 per cent after the language-learning app forecast first-quarter and 2026 bookings below expectations.",

            "description": "NEW YORK, Feb 27 : Prospects for artificial intelligence to disrupt business sectors should keep the U.S. stock market on edge in the coming week, as Wall Street looks for more insight into how the emerging technology will reverberate through the economy. The monthly U.S. jobs report headlines economic data due next week, while major semiconductor player Broadcom is among the remaining reports that will close out the fourth-quarter earnings season. The disruptive potential of AI has consumed investors in recent weeks, with shares in industries such as software, wealth management and real estate services pummeled by concerns about business upheaval. \"There continues to be this...back and forth about who might be the victim and those that will actually emerge winners because they are harnessing AI as opposed to being replaced by it,\" said Kristina Hooper, chief market strategist at Man Group. \"There is very little definitive right now about that, and so I think that will continue to be a concern.\" Stock prices in areas such as software remain acutely sensitive to AI-related developments. AI bellwether Nvidia's highly anticipated quarterly report failed to calm nerves, with the semiconductor giant's shares falling over 5 per cent on Thursday and weighing on the technology sector. Investors are concerned about whether Nvidia's \"hyperscaler\" customers will garner sufficient returns to justify their massive spending on data centers and other infrastructure. Despite the tech sector's struggles, gains this year in other areas such as industrials and consumer staples have helped buoy major equity indexes. The benchmark S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent in 2026 as of Thursday. \"The U.S. equity market is sort of in its late cycle, trying to find the winners and losers of this new disruptive technology and pretty much treading water,\" said John Velis, Americas macro strategist at BNY. WILL FEBRUARY JOBS BACK JANUARY'S STRENGTH? The U.S. jobs report for February, due on March 6, is expected to show an increase of 60,000 jobs, according to a Reuters poll. It comes after January's surprisingly robust report, with an increase of 130,000 jobs and the unemployment rate falling to 4.3 per cent. The January report allayed worries about a weakening labor market, but \"the concern is that January is a one-off,\" said Paul Nolte, senior wealth adviser and market strategist at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management. \"We saw a good January jobs report, but we also have seen a really weak 2025 for the job market,\" Hooper said. \"And so the question becomes, where do we go from here?\" Investors will also seek clues from the report about when the Federal Reserve may next cut interest rates. Fed funds futures suggest the next reduction will come in June or July, after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May and his nominated replacement Kevin Warsh could be in charge. The Fed cut rates last year in the face of a weakening employment backdrop but paused the easing cycle in January, and solid jobs data could prompt investors to push back their expectations for further cuts. Investors generally associate lower interest rates with higher prices for stocks and other assets. BNY's Velis said the market's reaction to the jobs data will be telling for which factors are prominent for equity investors. For example, strong data followed by weak stock performance is \"going to be a sign that the rate argument is important,\" Velis said. RETAIL SALES, BROADCOM EARNINGS ALSO UP NEXT Other economic releases due in the coming week include reports on manufacturing and services sector activity. The retail sales report for January is expected on March 6. Aside from Broadcom's quarterly report on Wednesday, results are expected from retailers Best Buy and Target. Wall Street is eager for any evidence of AI's impact on the economy, both positive and negative. In an interview with Reuters this week, outgoing Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the U.S. may be entering a period of structurally higher unemployment as firms deploy AI tools to save labor. \"Major technological shifts provoke both excitement and anxiety,\" Keith Lerner, chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, said in a research note on Thursday. \"More recently... optimism has begun to give way to heightened anxiety and increasingly bleak narratives about AI’s impact on work, productivity, and economic outcomes.\"",

            "title": "Pentagon Anthropic feud has sales and AI warfare at stake as Friday deadline looms",
            "description": "NEW YORK, Feb 27 : An explosive feud between the Pentagon and top artificial intelligence lab Anthropic is set to come to a head by 5:01 p.m. (2201 GMT) on Friday over concerns about how the military could use AI at war. The dispute, barreling toward a deadline set by the Pentagon for resolution, is widely seen as a referendum on how powerful AI could be deployed by the military and how its risks are managed. The Pentagon wants any lawful use to be allowed and has threatened Anthropic’s business if the startup does not scrap additional guardrails. “It’s a shot across the bow about the future of artificial intelligence and its use on the battlefield,” Chris Miller, the former acting secretary of defense, told Reuters. He added that the outcome will “be an acid test for those companies that claim to want to use AI humanely.” The months-long spat has divided some industry leaders, military officials and lawmakers over whether AI should be wielded without constraints when its creator Anthropic said the technology was not yet reliable for fully autonomous weapons. Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin weighed in on Thursday: “The average person does not think we should allow weapons systems to get into war and kill people without a human being overseeing that in some way.” Speaking at a confirmation hearing for two assistant defense secretary nominees, Slotkin added: “I certainly don’t think any American, Democrat or Republican, wants mass surveillance on the American people.” The Pentagon, which the Trump administration renamed the Department of War, has pushed back on the dilemma as a false choice “peddled by leftists in the media.” “The Department of War has no interest in using AI to conduct mass surveillance of Americans (which is illegal) nor do we want to use AI to develop autonomous weapons that operate without human involvement,” Pentagon chief spokesperson Sean Parnell posted on X Thursday. NEGOTIATIONS FALTER The Pentagon has signed $200-million ceiling agreements with major AI labs in the past year, including Anthropic, OpenAI and Google. It is pushing companies to agree to scrap their usage policies in favor of abiding by an all-lawful use clause. Anthropic, continuing these talks, has maintained red lines over the military’s use of its Claude AI models for autonomous weapons and domestic surveillance. Anthropic was first among these AI companies to work with classified information, through a supply deal via cloud provider Amazon. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, famous for quitting OpenAI in 2020 over concerns about AI technology’s stewardship, has warned that AI has advanced faster than the law. Powerful technology could hoover up disparate material to gather intelligence on unwitting civilians, he said in a Thursday blog post, a prospect that critics view as a legal loophole. “Anthropic understands that the Department of War, not private companies, makes military decisions,” but AI in narrow cases “can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values,” Amodei said. Amodei met with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week. Afterward, the Pentagon gestured toward compromise and sent the startup revised contract language. But the two parties remained at an apparent impasse. An Anthropic spokesperson said on Thursday, “The contract language we received overnight from the Department of War made virtually no progress” and would allow “safeguards to be disregarded at will.” BUSINESS THREATS Key business for Anthropic is at stake. The Pentagon warned it would terminate its work with the startup and declare it a supply-chain risk if Anthropic did not accede to the department’s demand for all-lawful use of AI. The designation, reserved typically for suppliers in adversary nations, means that defense contractors could be barred from deploying Anthropic's AI during work for the Pentagon. The setback comes as Anthropic races to win sales to businesses and government, with national security an area of focus. The Pentagon has asked contractors including Lockheed Martin to give an appraisal of their reliance on Anthropic ahead of the risk designation, Reuters reported on Wednesday. The defense industrial base totaled around 60,000 contractors including major public companies as of 2021. The Pentagon made a second threat, the legality of which some experts have questioned. “If they don’t get on board, SecWar will ensure the Defense Production Act is invoked on Anthropic,” a senior Pentagon official told Reuters, “compelling them to be used by the Pentagon regardless of if they want to or not.”",

The ruling Civic Coalition will present the draft outline on Friday, with fines planned for platforms that remain accessible to younger users, Nowacka said, adding that the law could take effect by early 2027. \"We see the mental health of children and young people, we see a decline in their intellectual competence,\" said Nowacka adding that the size of penalties that companies would have to pay is still under discussion. Several European governments including Denmark, Greece, France, Spain and Britain have explored similar restrictions amid claims that social-media services are harmful or addictive for minors. The British government said in January it was considering restrictions to protect children online, after Australia implemented similar laws in December.

            "description": "JAKARTA, Feb 27 : Indonesia's trade surplus is expected to have widened in January from a month earlier as double-digit growth in exports offset higher imports, a Reuters poll showed on Friday. A dozen economists surveyed by Reuters between February 23 and February 27 forecast a median January trade surplus of $2.76 billion, up from $2.52 billion in December, but down from $3.45 billion in January 2025. The largest economy in Southeast Asia has posted monthly trade surpluses since mid-2020, reaching a peak in April 2022 during a commodities boom. Exports in the first month of 2026 were estimated to have risen 11.07 per cent from a year earlier, a slightly slower pace compared with 11.64 per cent in December. January imports were projected to be 13.23 per cent higher than a year earlier, compared with 10.81 per cent growth in December. On Monday, the government's statistics office will also release consumer price data for February. The poll produced a median forecast for headline inflation of 4.31 per cent, picking up from 3.55 per cent in January. The central bank is targeting an inflation rate of 1.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent in 2026 and 2027. Annual core inflation, which strips out government-controlled and volatile food prices, was estimated at 2.48 per cent in February, up from 2.45 per cent in January, the poll showed.

The 24 workers from Nepal and Bangladesh, one of whom has died and whose estate brought the case, sued Dyson Technology Ltd, Dyson Ltd and a Malaysian subsidiary in 2022. The claimants were workers for Malaysian firm ATA Industrial or its sister company and made components for Dyson products. Their lawyers previously said the workers had money unlawfully deducted from their wages and were sometimes beaten for not meeting onerous targets, alleging the Dyson companies were ultimately responsible. Dyson, whose Malaysian subsidiary cancelled its contract with ATA in 2021, denied the claimants' allegations. The lawsuit at London's High Court was settled, the claimants' law firm Leigh Day said in a statement, with no admission of liability by the defendants. \"This resolution was reached in recognition of the expenses of litigation and the benefits of settlement,\" a statement on Leigh Day's website said. \"The defendants deny and have always denied all liability in respect of the claimants, who were employed by a third-party supplier, at factories in Malaysia which were owned and operated by ATA Industrial (M) Sdn Bhd and its related entities.\"",

            "title": "Netflix, Paramount shares jump as months-long fight for Warner Bros ends",
            "description": "Feb 27 : Netflix jumped more than 9 per cent premarket on Friday as investors cheered its decision to exit the fight for Warner Bros Discovery, while Paramount rose about 10 per cent on winning the race for some of the world's most prized TV and film assets. The end of the months-long bidding war put the focus back on the significant antitrust scrutiny that the Paramount-Warner Bros tie-up would face in the U.S. and Europe, including an active investigation in California. Warner Bros shares were marginally lower. Paramount Skydance maintained its dogged pursuit of Warner Bros, launching a hostile campaign to wrest the prize from Netflix. It managed to lure Warner Bros back to the bargaining table last week, with a revised $31-a-share bid that topped Netflix's $27.75 offer for the studio and streaming assets. Netflix said the price required to stay in the contest had climbed beyond what it considered financially sound, confirming to Reuters that it would withdraw from the takeover battle. \"We've always been disciplined… the deal is no longer financially attractive,\" the company said. \"The bid always looked like a mix of offence and defence – shoring up content and scale, while keeping competition from gaining any edge, but at a very high price,\" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown. \"For now, at least, the market seems to be pricing this as a win for everyone.\" In the fight for Warner Bros, the Paramount consortium backed by billionaire Larry Ellison and led by his son, Paramount CEO David Ellison, also boosted its termination fee to $7 billion and expanded its financing commitments, including $45.7 billion in equity. \"In the U.S., we believe Paramount has a good enough relationship with the presidential administration to ease concerns, and the Department of Justice has set a precedent in overlooking the merger of major studios when Disney bought Fox,\" analysts at Morningstar said.",

            "title": "Global shares inch higher, on track for monthly gain despite AI, Iran jitters",
            "description": "TOKYO/LONDON, Feb 27 : Global shares edged up on Friday to within a fraction of a fresh record high, and were set for a monthly gain, even as geopolitical tensions and persistent concerns about AI caused wild swings under the surface. Manish Kabra, head of U.S. equity strategy at SocGen, said in the absence of any major news, the market is refocusing on fundamentals which he described as \"rock solid.\" \"This is on a global basis. When I say fundamental, this is the profit cycle, the growth cycle, the broadening of the growth,\" said Kabra. Global shares rose 0.2 per cent, while Europe's STOXX 600 was up 0.4 per cent, buoyed by positive earnings. Nevertheless, jitters around AI spending and fears about the technology's broader business disruptions, as well as U.S.-Iran tensions, have weighed on sentiment this week. U.S. stock market futures were flashing red during early European trading, with S&P futures off 0.2 per cent while the tech-heavy Nasdaq futures were flat. Tech shares fell on Thursday even as Nvidia posted better-than-expected results for the January quarter and forecast current-quarter revenue above market estimates. \"It seems 'the Street' simply wanted more, or perhaps just isn't prepared to chase the stock at its current lofty valuation,\" IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said about Nvidia's results in a note. Shares in Nvidia down over 5 per cent ended Thursday. IRAN TENSIONS SIMMER Markets were also closely watching the latest developments in U.S. and Iran nuclear talks, as Washington amassed more military resources in the Middle East. An Omani mediator of U.S. and Iran nuclear talks gave an optimistic summary of the latest round of negotiations, but signs of a breakthrough that would avert potential U.S. strikes remained elusive. \"With no major breakthroughs announced in the U.S.–Iran talks, crude markets remained in wait-and-see mode, continuing to price in a significant risk of military escalation between the two countries,\" said Mantas Vanagas, senior economist at Westpac Group. U.S. crude rose 1.4 per cent to $66.16 a barrel, and Brent rose to $71.65, up 1.3 per cent. Spot gold shed 0.15 per cent to $5,178.29 an ounce.  The U.S. and Iran plan to resume negotiations over Tehran's nuclear programme after consultations in their countries' capitals, Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi said in a post on X after the day's meetings in Switzerland.  Any substantial move forward could curb chances for U.S. President Donald Trump to carry out a threatened attack on Iran that many fear could escalate into a wider war. POLITICS ALSO IN FOCUS FOR CURRENCIES The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was flat at 97.73, with the euro up 0.07 per cent at $1.1805. The yen was flat 156.16 per dollar. Sterling rose 0.1 per cent to $1.349 after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party suffered an election defeat in an area of Greater Manchester that it had dominated for almost a century. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 2.6 basis points to 3.99 per cent. Data in Japan showed cooling inflation in Tokyo and weaker-than-expected factory output, complicating the case for policy rate increases by the central bank. The data came on the heels of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi putting forward two Bank of Japan board nominees who share her dovish mindset.  Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama signalled heightened vigilance over currency moves, telling parliament the government is monitoring the yen's recent drop with a strong sense of urgency.",
