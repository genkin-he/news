            "description": "One of the top decentralized cryptocurrency trading platforms, dYdX, is preparing to enter the U.S. market by the end of the year, in a shift for the derivatives-focused exchange that was previously not available to American users, the president of dYdX told Reuters in an interview.  Unlike centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken that act as the intermediary between buyers and sellers, decentralized platforms like dYdX aim to cut out the middleman and allow users to transact directly on a blockchain network, which powers cryptocurrencies. DYdX specializes in perpetual contracts, a type of derivative that lets traders speculate on the price of an asset without actually owning it, and unlike traditional futures, does not have an expiration date. It recently surpassed $1.5 trillion in total trading volume since its inception, the San Francisco-based company said.  The platform plans to add to its offerings, bringing spot trading on solana and other linked cryptocurrencies to the U.S. by the end of the year, said Eddie Zhang, the president of dYdX.  \"It's very important for us as a platform to have something available in the United States, because I think it represents, hopefully, the direction we're trying to move in,\" Zhang said.  DYdX's move follows President Donald Trump's embrace of the cryptocurrency sector this year, which has led to the dismissal of a spate of lawsuits against prominent crypto platforms and a shift by financial regulators to create specialized rules to accommodate digital assets.  Upon entering the U.S., dYdX plans to slash its trading fees by as much as half \"across the board,\" to between 50 and 65 basis points, Zhang said.  Perpetual contracts will not be available in the U.S., but dYdX hopes U.S. regulators will eventually provide guidance for decentralized platforms to be able to offer those products, Zhang said.  In a joint statement last month by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the agencies indicated they would consider allowing crypto perpetual contracts to trade across regulated platforms in the U.S. ",

            "title": "Agile and vicious Nanotyrannus was not just a teenage T. rex",
            "description": "WASHINGTON :At the twilight of the age of dinosaurs, an agile and vicious predator named Nanotyrannus prowled western North America, resembling a smaller version of Tyrannosaurus - about a tenth the body mass - but with several key anatomical differences. That is the finding of new research concluding that Nanotyrannus - which for years has been at the center of a debate among paleontologists as to whether it was merely a teenage version of Tyrannosaurus - was, in fact, its own distinct dinosaur. The researchers examined fossil specimens of Nanotyrannus unearthed in 1942, 2001 and 2006 in Montana dating to about 67 million years ago, determining that the individuals were mature and not juveniles based on traits in the bones including annual growth rings. They also found that Nanotyrannus differed anatomically from its larger cousin by having more teeth, a crest in front of its eyes, an air sinus in a certain bone at the back of the skull and the presence of a vestigial third finger, unlike the two-fingered Tyrannosaurus. Nanotyrannus and Tyrannosaurus both were members of a lineage of meat-eating dinosaurs called tyrannosaurs, but were not the same genus, the researchers said. A genus is a group of closely related species that share similar characteristics. For example, lions, tigers, leopards and jaguars are from the same genus, Panthera, but each represents a different species. The genus name Tyrannosaurus means \"tyrant lizard,\" with the species name \"rex\" meaning \"king.\" The genus name Nanotyrannus means \"dwarf tyrant.\" \"T. rex was a massive predator adapted to wielding incredible bite forces. Nanotyrannus was a slender, agile pursuit predator that could have run circles around the tyrant king,\" said paleontologist Lindsay Zanno of North Carolina State University and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, lead author of the study published on Thursday in the journal Nature. The new analysis ends the debate around Nanotyrannus, Zanno said. \"It is not biologically possible to conclude that it is a juvenile T. rex,\" Zanno said. Their size difference was stark. Nanotyrannus had about 10 per cent the body mass - about 1,500 pounds (700 kg) versus 15,000 pounds (7,000 kg). And it had about half the linear dimensions - approximately 18 feet (5.5 meters) versus roughly 40 feet (12.2 meters) long, and 7 feet (2 meters) versus 13 feet tall. \"Nanotyrannus and T. rex are extremely different,\" said paleontologist and anatomist James Napoli of Stony Brook University in New York, co-author of the study. Nanotyrannus was a predator built for speed and agility, with long legs, a long snout with blade-like teeth and strong arms for manipulating prey. Tyrannosaurus was a colossal predator that was built for strength, with stocky legs, an enormous head, thick, banana-shaped teeth and greatly reduced arms. \"I suspect that these two species would have occasionally come into conflict, as predators tend to do, but the long legs of Nanotyrannus, and its small size, suggest that it mostly hunted smaller, faster prey than Tyrannosaurus,\" Napoli said. The researchers also determined that the Nanotyrannus specimens had sufficient anatomical differences to be divided into two separate species - Nanotyrannus lancensis and the newly named Nanotyrannus lethaeus. One of the Nanotyrannus fossils was part of the well-known \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" specimen, battling the horned dinosaur Triceratops at the time of death. Some scientific research into how Tyrannosaurus matured was based on the notion that the Nanotyrannus fossils represented T. rex juveniles, including studies that hypothesized that this apex predator experienced an extreme growth rate. \"For decades, paleontologists have unknowingly used Nanotyrannus specimens as a model for teenage T. rex to understand the biology of Earth's most famous dinosaur. Those studies need a second look,\" Zanno said. The finding that Nanotyrannus and Tyrannosaurus shared the same landscape, along with myriad plant-eating dinosaurs, offers the latest evidence that dinosaur diversity was rich prior to the asteroid impact 66 million years ago that ended the age of dinosaurs. \"This discovery shows us that dinosaurs continued to evolve, innovate and diversify right up until their reign was cut short. This fits into a growing body of evidence proving that dinosaurs were not declining for millions of years before they went extinct, contrary to what we once thought,\" Napoli said.",

            "description": "Palantir Technologies on Thursday sued two of its former senior engineers, accusing them of using the software company's secret information to launch a \"copycat\" firm, Percepta AI.  The lawsuit in Manhattan federal court claims that Radha Jain and Joanna Cohen were \"entrusted with Palantir’s crown jewels,\" including its source code and customer information, and breached agreements they signed with the company to safeguard that information. Palantir said that just like its own AI-powered software, Percepta's products are designed to make businesses and government agencies more efficient using data they already possess.  Jain left Palantir in November 2024 after helping to design and build its flagship software, and Cohen, who worked on AI solutions for individual customers, resigned in February, according to the lawsuit. Percepta AI, which is owned by venture capital firm General Catalyst, was publicly unveiled earlier this month.  \"Jain’s and Cohen’s deception and violation of their agreements with Palantir are black and white,\" the company said in the lawsuit.  Percepta, which is not a defendant in the lawsuit, and Jain did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cohen could not immediately be reached.  Percepta hired at least 10 former Palantir employees within months of its founding last year, and nearly half its workforce are former Palantir staffers, including co-founder and CEO Hirsh Jain, according to the complaint. Palantir says Jain and Cohen signed agreements barring them from competing with the company for one year after leaving, from soliciting Palantir customers or employees for two years, and from using any of the company's confidential information outside their employment.  The lawsuit accuses Jain and Cohen of breaching those agreements and seeks to force them to comply with them.",

            "title": "Global central banks converge towards rate cut caution",
            "description": "LONDON :The U.S. Federal Reserve has moved back into line with other major rate setters after it cut rates by a quarter point on Wednesday but pushed back against market bets that it would keep going as the Washington shutdown fogs up its forecasting lens. The Bank of Japan and European Central Bank left rates unchanged on Thursday. Here's where 10 major central banks stand after the latest round of meetings: 1/ SWITZERLAND  The Swiss National Bank cut its key rate to 0 per cent in June and is widely expected to hold steady with markets pricing a long pause. In its first set of minutes detailing its rate setting discussions, published last week, the SNB quashed market speculation that it would return to negative rates to stop the strong franc pushing the sluggish economy into deflation. 2/ CANADA The Bank of Canada, battling an economic slowdown exacerbated by U.S. tariffs and the inflationary impact of the trade war, cut rates to a more than three-year low of 2.25 per cent on Wednesday. It also sent strong signals that easing ends here and traders see more than 60 per cent odds on the BoC standing pat until December 2026. 3/ SWEDEN Sweden's Riksbank meets next week after cutting rates to 1.75 per cent in September and saying it expects that elevated inflation will prove transitory. Money markets price in less than a one in five chance of further easing before 2026 as domestic inflation stays sticky, which has sent traders piling in to Sweden's crown. The currency has risen 15 per cent against the dollar year-to-date.  4/ NEW ZEALAND The Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut rates by a punchy 50 basis points (bps) to 2.5 per cent this month in an attempt to prop up a frail economy. Markets see a good chance of a further cut in late November, though inflation sitting at the top of the RBNZ's 1-3 per cent target band could be a complication. 5/ EURO ZONE The ECB on Thursday matched traders' expectations and held the bloc's main deposit rate at 2 per cent for a third straight meeting. Traders viewed this ECB easing cycle as almost over, pricing in less than a 50 per cent chance of further easing by July 2026.  6/ UNITED STATES The Fed on Wednesday executed a widely flagged 25 bps cut but pushed back against market bets for more by warning that data gaps caused by the U.S. government shutdown were clouding its forecasting lens. \"If you're driving in the fog you slow down,\" Chair Jerome Powell said in his post-announcement press conference. The rate cut drew dissent from two policymakers, with Stephen Miran again calling for a deeper reduction and Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid favoring no cut given above-target inflation. Traders price a 70 per cent probability of a 25 bps December cut, down from 84 per cent ahead of Wednesday's decision. 7/ BRITAIN The Bank of England is another major rate setter that is signalling cautious moves from here as it kept rates unchanged at its last meeting and said inflation risks remained high. Traders expect another hold on November 6 but markets price a 60 per cent chance of a December cut after above-target UK inflation at least held steady in September.  8/ AUSTRALIA The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut rates by 75 bps since February but hotter-than-expected inflation encouraged it to hold rates steady and turn more hawkish in September. That trend has continued, pushing expectations for the next cut forward to at least February 2026..  9/ NORWAY Norway's central bank eased borrowing costs by 25 bps to 4.0 per cent in September but signalled further cuts were less likely because underlying inflation was rising. That has helped the crown keep powering higher against the dollar, with a 12 per cent gain for the year so far. 10/ JAPAN  The Bank of Japan, the sole central bank in hiking mode, kept rates steady on Thursday but repeated its pledge to keep increasing borrowing costs if the economy moves as it projects, shifting investor focus to December's meeting. The yen weakened after the announcement. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week called for speedier BOJ rate hikes to avoid weakening the currency too much.",

            "description": "LONDON :Mercuria is shipping more than 30,000 metric tons of aluminium from Port Klang in Malaysia to New Orleans, three sources familiar with the matter said, adding that the commodity trader probably needed the metal for its U.S. customers. The metal is coming from London Metal Exchange approved warehouses in Port Klang, the sources said, where aluminium stocks at 268,325 metric tons as of October 29 are down 74,700 tons or 22 per cent since September 22. Mercuria's shipment of aluminium to the United States is part of a wider strategic push into industrial metals, as the trader seeks to diversify beyond its traditional energy business, industry sources said. Reuters reported Mercuria's plans to take large amounts of aluminium from LME storage on September 16. Mercuria is sending the aluminium it has taken from LME warehouses in Port Klang to the United States on a vessel named Astro Denebola, the sources familiar with the matter said. Swiss-based Mercuria declined to comment. According to data provider Kpler, the Astro Denebola carrying 32,000 tons of aluminium left Port Klang on October 24 and is due to arrive in New Orleans on December 9. Industry sources said most of the aluminium on warrant - a title document conferring ownership - stored in the LME's warehouses in Port Klang is of Indian origin. Some of the metal stored in the exchange's warehouses in Port Klang was produced in Russia, the industry sources said. Western consumers have shunned Russian aluminium since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. With its local primary aluminium industry in decline for years, the U.S. relies on imports of large amounts of unwrought aluminium and alloys - more than 3.9 million tons last year, according to U.S. government data. Aluminium is a key material for the power, construction and packaging industries. Mercuria has for much of the time since May held more than 90 per cent of LME aluminium warrants - title documents conferring ownership, industry sources said. This holding, they said, is behind the premium for nearby aluminium contracts on the LME over those with longer maturities. The LME does not publish names of companies with large holdings of its metal warrants.",

            "description": "Roblox on Thursday raised its annual bookings forecast for the third time this year on the back of strong in-game spending on viral titles such as \"Steal a Brainrot\" that also helped it surpass 150 million daily active users. Shares of the gaming platform rose over 5 per cent in premarket trading. Over the past few years, Roblox has been trying to expand the platform into a hub for socialization, advertising and ecommerce while also investing heavily into the core gaming segment. The strategy has made it one of the biggest winners in the videogame industry, with shares having more than doubled this year. Roblox's 70 per cent increase in average daily active users — a key engagement metric — represents the company's biggest third-quarter jump in around five years. \"Steal a Brainrot,\" a game where players collect characters based on viral internet culture, surpassed 25 million concurrent players in earlier this month, eclipsing \"Grow a Garden.\" CFO Naveen Chopra told Reuters he attributes the success of these games to investments into the search and discovery algorithm, capacity infrastructure and incentives for developers to spur gamemaking. \"The ability to handle multiple games with more than 20 million concurrent users, like that's never been done before . .. and so these hits could not have gone that viral without that kind of infrastructure,\" he said. Roblox now expects fiscal 2025 bookings worth between $6.57 billion and $6.62 billion, compared with its prior forecast of between $5.87 billion and $5.97 billion. It forecast fourth-quarter bookings worth between $2 billion and $2.05 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $1.80 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Bookings for the third quarter came in at $1.92 billion, beating expectations of $1.65 billion.",

The move also comes weeks after Google committed to invest $15 billion in AI infrastructure capacity in India, its biggest investment yet in the critical South Asian market. AI apps have exploded in popularity in recent months in India, prompting authorities this month to propose sweeping rules for AI and social media firms to clearly label AI-generated content to tackle the spread of deepfakes and misinformation. MIRRORING THE STREAMERS' PLAYBOOK With nearly 1 billion internet users, India has been a go-to market for global tech firms to boost their subscriber base and harvest data for improving their services. The Gemini offer will give Jio users free access to the advanced model of the AI app, two terabytes of cloud storage, and its image and video generation models, in an 18-month offering that is otherwise priced at 35,100 rupees ($399). The companies on Thursday also announced AI partnerships that targeted Indian businesses. The free AI plan rollout will begin with early access for 18-to-25-year-old users on certain telecom plans, and will expand to include every Jio customer nationwide \"in the shortest time possible,\" Reliance said in a statement. Google already offers Gemini AI Pro free for a year for students in India, while rival Perplexity is offering free access to its premium plan to Indian users through a tie-up with mobile carrier Bharti Airtel. On Tuesday, OpenAI too offered year-long free access to its ChatGPT Go plan to users in India starting November. Such moves mirror the early playbook of streaming firms to boost adoption in India, when the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime partnered with telecom players to bundle their paid offerings with monthly data plans.

            "description": "Mastercard beat Wall Street expectations for third-quarter profit on Thursday, as sustained consumer spending boosted its payment volumes. Consumer spending has proven resilient, while labor market cracks and sticky inflation continue to fuel concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's trade and immigration policies. Mastercard's earnings round off the earnings season for card companies, which are closely tracked by Wall Street to gauge consumer health. Due to their expansive share of global everyday transactions, card networks run by Mastercard and Visa are widely perceived as shielded from a potential payments slowdown. Rival Visa also beat quarterly profit expectations earlier this week, while American Express' focus on wealthy customers helped it rake in record revenue during the third quarter. The company reported adjusted profit of $3.96 billion, or $4.38 per share, for the quarter ended September 30. Analysts, on average, were expecting a profit of $4.32 per share, according to data compiled by LSEG. Mastercard's net revenue rose 17 per cent to $8.6 billion in the quarter from a year earlier. A bottleneck of Federal data due to the U.S. government shutdown has added uncertainty to the consumer outlook at a time when private data suggests plummeting consumer sentiment and a widening rift between lower-income and affluent consumers. Mastercard's value-added services and solutions business, which now makes up more than a third of the company's business, fetched 25 per cent higher revenue in the quarter. The company has diversified its revenue streams to leverage the burgeoning demand for threat intelligence and fraud reduction via value-added services. Cross-border volume, which tracks spending on cards outside the country of their issue, jumped 15 per cent on a local currency basis.

Katayama was referring to comments she made in an interview with Reuters in March, when the veteran upper house lawmaker said she believed levels of 120 to 130 against the dollar were \"seen as the value reflecting Japan's economic strength\". Katayama's comments in March were made when the yen had fallen to around 150 against the dollar. The yen was most recently trading at 154.20 per dollar, having fallen after the Bank of Japan decided to keep interest rates unchanged. \"It's always been the case that markets' movements are often unrelated to real demand,\" she said on Thursday. \"What the Japanese government can do is to steer the fundamentals onto a sound and reasonable growth path, while also maintaining Japan's credibility,\" she added.

Microsoft and Apple also reached $4 trillion market valuations by end-October, just over three months after Nvidia’s surge to that level in July.     Microsoft reported record capital spending of nearly $35 billion for its fiscal first quarter on Wednesday and said it expects investments to rise further this year Broadcom gained 17 per cent over the past month to reach a $1.82 trillion valuation, while TSMC added 15 per cent to $1.28 trillion and Alphabet climbed 13 per cent to $3.32 trillion. The market value-to-capital expenditure ratio for semiconductor firms stood at 75.1, the highest among all global sectors, suggesting investors expect strong returns from the heavy AI-related spending by chipmakers. The market values of Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase and Tencent Holdings fell 5.4 per cent, 3.1 per cent and 2.5 per cent over the past month to $1.03 trillion, $840 billion and $760 billion, respectively.",

            "description": "Crypto miner Core Scientific on Thursday ended a deal for its sale to CoreWeave after shareholders voted against the proposal, marking the culmination of months-long investor and proxy campaigns against the agreement. The move marks the second foiled attempt by CoreWeave to scoop up Core Scientific, with the crypto miner also rejecting a June 2024 all-cash buyout offer. CoreWeave had struck an all-stock deal worth $9 billion to buy Core Scientific in July, as part of its push to secure the energy and data center capacity needed to power surging demand. Soon after, Two Seas Capital, which claims to be the largest active shareholder of Core Scientific, said it would vote against the deal, citing concerns with the sale process, deal structure, and valuation. It said the fixed exchange ratio left Core Scientific shareholders vulnerable to fluctuations in the price of CoreWeave shares. Core's board had urged its shareholders to vote for the sale saying the combined company would benefit from several potential cost savings and synergies. Last week, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services also recommended investors vote against the deal, suggesting Core Scientific should continue going alone given its considerable success as a standalone company. \"We respect the views of Core Scientific stockholders and look forward to continuing our commercial partnership,\" said Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO and co-founder. Core Scientific shares fell 3.4 per cent in early trading, while CoreWeave was down nearly 5 per cent.",

            "description": "Shares of C.H. Robinson surged more than 20 per cent to a record high on Thursday as investors cheered the global freight forwarder's quarterly profit beat due to AI-driven efficiencies at a time when the rest of the logistics sector has struggled. The U.S.'s largest freight broker has been using artificial intelligence to automate tasks such as generating shipping quotes, scheduling pickups and deliveries and tracking shipments. This has helped speed up its operations and reduce reliance on manual work. \"We believe that CHRW's scale and first mover advantage will allow for continued productivity and share gains in the coming years, and management has shown its operating model is differentiated,\" Stephens analyst Reed Seay said in a note. The company's adjusted profit of $1.40 per share for the quarter beat analysts' average estimate of $1.30, according to data compiled by LSEG. The beat was helped by a 12.6 per cent decline in operating expenses from a year ago. The company's employee headcount was down 10.8 per cent. \"The transition to agentic AI to complement the large productivity improvements already enacted by generative AI, give management confidence to line-of-sight cost takeout and further margin improvement, even without market help,\" Evercore ISI analyst Jonathan Chappell said. C.H. Robinson managed to grow shipment volumes in both its truckload and less-than-truckload segments, helping its North American Surface Transportation segment post a 1.1 per cent rise in revenue. Meanwhile, the U.S. freight industry has been facing subdued volumes, while excess capacity has kept rates under pressure. The trend has forced logistics firms to tighten spending and operate with greater discipline. C.H. Robinson's shares trade at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.49, compared with the industry median of 16.32.",

            "description": "Qantas's chief customer and digital officer ‌Catriona Larritt will step down by the end of December, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Thursday, months after the airline faced one of Australia's biggest cyber breaches in years. In the note to staff, group CEO Vanessa Hudson said Larritt will leave the group to \"pursue external opportunities\".   Larritt has been with the group since 2015 and has worked with the airline's units Jetstar and Freight. She took over her current role in September 2023, and her responsibilities included customer experience, brand, marketing and technology, according to the company website. In July, the airline said more than a million customers had sensitive details such as phone numbers, birth dates or home addresses accessed as part of the cyber breach. After Larritt's departure, corporate affairs chief Danielle Keighery will be responsible for brand and marketing, while risk chief Andrew Monaghan will oversee cyber security, Hudson said. Additionally, chief marketing officer Petra Perry and her team will report to Keighery to help recover the group's brand and reputation. Meanwhile, chief information security officer Matt Biber and his team will report to Monaghan, bringing cyber security and risk to further strengthen governance, Hudson added. ",
