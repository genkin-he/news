            "title": "How will US, Israeli strikes on Iran affect oil markets?",
            "description": "LONDON: The US strikes against Iran could severely disrupt the global supply of crude oil and send prices soaring to levels not seen in years. AFP looks at the risks. MAJOR PRODUCER Iran remains just inside the world's top 10 oil producers even though its output has fallen sharply since the 1970s, hit in particular by rounds of US sanctions. \"In 1974, Iran was the third-biggest producer in the world after the US and Saudi Arabia, and ahead of Russia, producing some six million barrels per day,\" Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst at Global Risk Management, told AFP. Today, Iran produces about 3.1 million barrels per day, according to the oil-producing cartel OPEC, of which Iran is a member. This remains a significant amount, and the Islamic republic is believed to hold the world's third-largest crude reserves, cementing its strategic importance. Additionally, Iran's oil industry is in far better shape than that of Venezuela, another country hit by years of US sanctions. STRAIT OF HORMUZ The main risk to the oil market remains a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz, which connects the Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and which Iran has frequently threatened to paralyse. This waterway is by far the main shipping route connecting the wealthy oil-producing countries of the Middle East to the rest of the world. Approximately 20 million barrels of crude oil passed through it daily in 2024, equivalent to nearly 20 per cent of global liquid oil consumption, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). The strait is particularly vulnerable owing to its narrow width, around 50km, and its shallow depth, which does not exceed 60m. \"Even a doubt about security in the Strait would prompt many vessels, for insurance reasons, to face difficulties transiting, as premiums would rise sharply,\" said Rasmussen. According to Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen, \"only Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates possess meaningful bypass infrastructure\". The route could transport a maximum of 2.6 million barrels daily, noted the EIA.HIGHLY PROFITABLE OIL Iranian crude is relatively easy and cheap to extract, with production costs as little as US$10 per barrel, making it particularly profitable, Rasmussen said. Only Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates enjoy similarly low production costs. By comparison, major Western producers like Canada and the United States typically face costs of US$40 to US$60 per barrel. With such low costs, Iran gains disproportionately from high global prices, a crucial factor for an economy heavily reliant on oil revenues. US sanctions imposed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution have left Iran with few export options - especially after Trump revived a \"maximum pressure\" policy on Tehran upon his return to the White House. Last year, Washington targeted Chinese \"teapot\" refineries, which operate independently of state-owned oil companies, accusing them of buying Iranian crude. China, however, continues to buy Iranian oil at below-market prices. Iran exports between 1.3 and 1.5 million barrels daily, with more than 80 per cent of the total bound for Chinese refineries owing to US sanctions, according to Hansen. IMPACT ON IRAN NEIGHBOURS Iran's neighbours, from Gulf states to Turkey and Pakistan, fear an Iranian response since their hosting of US military sites places them in the firing line. They \"know they are vulnerable because the Iranians have enough basic intermediate-range missiles that allow them to strike vital points\" in the worst-case scenario, noted Pierre Razoux, director of studies at the Mediterranean Foundation for Strategic Studies. At-risk infrastructure includes hydrocarbon hubs as well as electrical power and seawater desalination plants, he added. Soaring oil prices meanwhile risk a return to soaring inflation, hurting the global economy. Crude reaching US$100 per barrel for the first time since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 could also hurt Trump in the midterm elections at the end of the year, especially as he has promised American voters cheap energy.",

            "title": "Dramatic changes observed in one of universe's biggest stars",
            "description": "WASHINGTON, Feb 28 : The largest stars in the universe live the life of a rock star - they are born brilliant, live fast and die young. If that is the case, the one named WOH G64 might be considered the stellar equivalent of Jimi Hendrix. WOH G64, which is 28 times the mass of the sun and resides in a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way called the Large Magellanic Cloud, is one of a handful of the biggest stars known, just like Hendrix was in rock 'n' roll. And observations spanning more than three decades show it is behaving unlike any star seen before. Astronomers have only an incomplete understanding of the life history of the largest stars, and the WOH G64 observations are providing new insight. Researchers observed a change that occurred in 2014 in the star's color, corresponding to an increase in its surface temperature, as it evolved from red to yellow. The star had been classified as an extreme red supergiant but rapidly became a yellow hypergiant. This transition happened quickly, in cosmic terms, and with no evidence of an eruption or explosion. \"Typically the evolution of a star takes place on timescales of billions of years. On human timescales, we only observe more abrupt and violent events, such as eruptions, the merger of two stars or their explosive deaths,\" said astronomer Gonzalo Muñoz-Sanchez, lead author of the research published this week in the journal Nature Astronomy. \"No current stellar models can fully explain this transformation\" in WOH G64, said Muñoz-Sanchez, who worked on the study at the National Observatory of Athens. Compared to the sun, its luminosity is about 300,000 times greater and its diameter about 1,500 times greater. If it were in the place of the sun, its surface would extend to a distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, our solar system's fifth and sixth planets. Traveling at the speed of light would take six hours to circumnavigate the star's surface. WOH G64, around 10 million years old, appears to be near the end of its lifespan. In contrast, the sun is about 4.5 billion years old and has an estimated 5 billion more years left. WOH G64 is located about 160,000 light-years from Earth. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). \"WOH G64 is a massive star and very different from the sun,\" Muñoz-Sanchez said. Stars between about eight and 23 times the sun's mass are expected to evolve into red supergiants and eventually explode as a supernova. For stars in the range of 23 to 30 times the sun's mass, their fate is less certain. It remains unclear whether they go boom as a supernova, collapse directly into forming a black hole or evolve from a red supergiant phase into a yellow hypergiant stage before ending their lives. Black holes are exceptionally dense objects with gravity so strong not even light can escape. \"Hence, WOH G64 might be the solution to this question,\" Muñoz-Sanchez said. Adding another layer of complexity to understanding WOH G64 is the fact that the observations indicated it is gravitationally bound to another star in what is called a binary system. The researchers were unable to determine the size or characteristics of the stellar companion, but said the two might at some point merge. The researchers have come up with hypotheses concerning WOH G64's recent changes. They said it may have experienced a violent episode predating the observational data that turned it red and is now returning to its usual yellow quiescent state. They said it also is possible that an interaction between WOH G64 and its companion had temporarily mimicked the appearance of a red supergiant. \"As astronomers continue to monitor this remarkable system, WOH G64 is poised to reshape our understanding of how the most massive stars live and die,\" Muñoz-Sanchez said.",

            "description": "Feb 27 : Trump Media & Technology Group, founded by U.S. President Donald Trump, is considering spinning off its social media platform Truth Social into a publicly traded company. The company is in discussions with TAE Technologies and Texas Ventures Acquisition III about the proposed transaction, the company said on Friday. Under the proposal, shares in the spun-off company would be distributed to eligible TMTG shareholders, after which the new entity would merge with a special purpose acquisition company. This would separate TMTG's social media and digital media assets from its recently announced fusion energy venture, effectively splitting the company into two publicly traded businesses with distinct strategies. The Truth Social-parent's net loss widened to $712.3 million in 2025 from $400.9 million a year earlier, mostly reflecting unrealized losses from the company's purchase of bitcoin and Cronos. TMTG ended 2025 with about $2.5 billion in financial assets, more than triple the $776.8 million it had a year earlier, the company said. Net sales edged up to $3.68 million from $3.62 million in 2024. Founded by Trump and known for its Truth Social platform aimed at conservative audiences, TMTG has faced challenges scaling its media business amid competition from larger social networks and uneven user growth. It is now seeking to reposition itself beyond its core Truth Social platform and tap investor interest in emerging energy technologies. TMTG said no definitive agreement has been reached on the spin-off and discussions are ongoing. In December, TMTG agreed to merge with TAE in an all-stock deal valued at more than $6 billion, marking a pivot toward fusion energy and the creation of a publicly traded company focused on developing utility-scale power plants to help meet rising electricity demand, including from AI data centers. TAE Technologies is a California-based private company developing advanced nuclear fusion technology that has raised more than $1 billion from investors, including Alphabet's Google and Chevron. The startup focuses on a form of fusion designed to produce electricity without releasing large amounts of neutron radiation, reducing radioactive waste.",

            "title": "Trump directs US agencies to toss Anthropic's AI as Pentagon calls startup a supply risk",
            "description": "WASHINGTON, Feb 27 : U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he is directing every federal agency to stop work with artificial intelligence lab Anthropic while the Pentagon declared it a supply-chain risk, capping a weeks-long fight over technology guardrails in an apparent blow to the startup's business. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, \"I am directing EVERY Federal Agency in the United States Government to IMMEDIATELY CEASE all use of Anthropic’s technology. We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again!\" He added there would be a six-month phaseout for the Defense Department and other agencies that use the company's products. Meanwhile, the Pentagon's supply-chain risk designation, typically reserved for companies in adversary nations, means that defense contractors could be barred from deploying Anthropic's AI as part of work for the Pentagon. The defense industrial base includes tens of thousands of contractors, including major public companies. The actions were pegged to a Friday deadline that the Pentagon set to resolve an escalating feud with San Francisco-based Anthropic, over concerns about how the military could use AI at war. Spokespeople for Anthropic, which won a $200 million ceiling Pentagon contract last year, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump's announcement stopped short of the Pentagon's threat that it could invoke the Defense Production Act to require Anthropic's compliance. But the U.S. president vowed further action if Anthropic did not cooperate going forward. Trump warned he would use \"the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow\" if Anthropic did not help with the phaseout of its technology. WEAPONS, SURVEILLANCE CONCERNS The setback comes as AI leader Anthropic raced to win a fierce competition selling novel technology to businesses and government, particularly for national security, ahead of its widely expected initial public offering. The company has said it has not finalized an IPO decision. At the same time, the battle over technological guardrails had raised concerns that the Department of Defense would follow U.S. law but little other constraint when deploying AI for national-security missions, regardless of safety or ethics service terms embraced by the technology's developers. Anthropic had sought guarantees that its AI would not be used for fully autonomous weapons or for mass domestic surveillance - applications in which the Pentagon has said it had no interest.  Anthropic was the first frontier AI lab to put its models on classified networks via cloud provider Amazon.com and the first to build customized models for national security customers, the startup has said. Its product Claude is in use across the intelligence community and armed services. U.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat and vice chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, criticized the action taken by Trump, a Republican. “The president’s directive to halt the use of a leading American AI company across the federal government, combined with inflammatory rhetoric attacking that company, raises serious concerns about whether national security decisions are being driven by careful analysis or political considerations.\" The conflict is the latest eruption in a saga that dates back at least to 2018. That year, employees at Alphabet's Google protested the Pentagon's use of the company's AI to analyze drone footage, straining relations between Silicon Valley and Washington. A rapprochement ensued, with companies including Amazon and Microsoft jousting for defense business, and still more CEOs pledging cooperation last year with the Trump administration. But theoretical \"killer robots\" have remained a concern held by human-rights and technology activists. At the same time, Ukraine and Gaza have become theaters for increasingly automated systems on the battlefield. ",

            "description": "Feb 27 : A federal judge on Friday blocked Virginia from enforcing a new law that aimed to protect children from being addicted to social media by requiring age verification and limiting use by those under 16 to one hour per day. U.S. District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles in Alexandria, Virginia, said the technology trade group NetChoice was likely to establish that the law unconstitutionally infringed the free speech rights of adults, children and its dozens of members, including Google, Meta Platforms, Netflix, Reddit and Elon Musk's X. The judge issued a preliminary injunction against the law known as Senate Bill 854, which had been signed last May by then-Governor Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, and took effect on January 1, 2026. NetChoice has also challenged similar laws in states, including California. Virginia argued that the law was reasonably tailored to protect children from the \"addictive features\" of social media, and address a mental health crisis among youth. But the judge said that notwithstanding Virginia's interest in protecting children, the law was both overinclusive by requiring everyone, including adults, to verify their age, and underinclusive by exempting potentially addictive interactive gaming from coverage. She also said the law treats \"functionally equivalent\" speech differently by preventing children from watching, for example, science, history and church programming lasting more than an hour that they could watch elsewhere, including streaming platforms.   \"The court recognizes the Commonwealth’s compelling interest in protecting its youth from the harms associated with the addictive aspects of social media,\" wrote Giles, an appointee of former Democratic President Joe Biden. \"However, it cannot infringe on First Amendment rights, including those of the same youth it aims to protect.\" Rae Pickett, a spokesperson for Virginia's Democratic Attorney General Jay Jones, said after the decision: \"We look forward to continuing to enforce laws that empower parents to protect their children from the proven harms that can come through social media.\" Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, welcomed the decision. \"This ruling reaffirms that the government cannot ration access to lawful speech - even if it has noble intentions,\" he said in a statement. \"Fundamentally, parents must stay in the driver’s seat when it comes to decisions about their families.\"",

            "description": "Feb 27 : Goldman Sachs' asset management arm has assured investors that the redemption rate at GS Credit remains well below that of its peers, setting it apart from turbulence in private credit sparked by concerns that AI could disrupt software companies. In a letter to investors seen by Reuters on Friday, the Wall Street firm added that Goldman Sachs Private Credit Corp continued to see strong appetite, with December inflows 11 per cent above the year-to-date average and a fourth-quarter redemption rate of 3.5 per cent, compared with more than 5 per cent for peers. Fears that AI could erode the earnings power of software companies and weaken their ability to repay loans are rippling through private credit, a key lender to the technology sector, prompting investors to reassess exposure, redemption risks and fundraising prospects, analysts have said. Concerns have been compounded by renewed troubles at Blue Owl over asset sales, triggering a sharp selloff in shares of alternative asset managers with a footprint in the private credit market. The shift in sentiment is testing a corner of the alternatives market that has swelled into a roughly $2 trillion juggernaut in recent years. \"As we enter 2026, the private credit landscape is facing volatile macroeconomic conditions, shifting flows in the traded and non-traded BDC (Business Development Company) market, and accelerating technological change - particularly around AI,\" Goldman said. ASSESSING AI IMPACT The firm disclosed that GS Credit's exposure to enterprise software credit was about 15.5 per cent at the end of the third quarter, toward the low end of the range reported by its peers. Investors have been grappling with the prospect of AI disruption for weeks, with many increasingly concerned that the technology has shifted from an efficiency and productivity tailwind for the software sector to a potential existential threat. Goldman said it has been assessing the impact of AI on the software space for years and passed on its first deal due to AI concerns in October 2023. \"We agree with the perspective that AI is significantly lowering development costs which will lead to increased competitive intensity for incumbent software companies,\" it said in the letter. Goldman added that it invests in businesses that show \"structural advantages and incumbency moats\" that may be difficult for new entrants to displace. The company said it rolled its first internal framework to evaluate AI disruption risk in early 2025. \"We do not underestimate the risk of AI disruption,\" it added.",

PayPay plans to list on the Nasdaq next month, one of the people said, adding SoftBank hopes that bringing cornerstone investors on board will boost the IPO’s appeal. The IPO was initially expected in December, but was delayed by a prolonged U.S. government shutdown that slowed the regulatory process. PayPay, SoftBank, Qatar Holdings, Visa and ADIA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Reuters first reported over two years ago that SoftBank was considering a U.S. listing for PayPay. SOFTBANK GENERATING FUNDS FOR AI SPENDING The planned IPO of PayPay comes at a pivotal moment for SoftBank Group, which has gone all-in on artificial intelligence. The Japanese conglomerate has committed $30 billion to OpenAI, building on a roughly $41 billion investment it said it completed in December for an estimated 11 per cent stake, Reuters reported. To help fund its AI investments, CEO Masayoshi Son has sold billions of dollars' worth of assets, including the company’s $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia and $4.8 billion of T-Mobile U.S. shares. The PayPay listing - the first U.S. listing for a SoftBank-majority business since Arm Holdings - could provide a timely cash boost for the conglomerate. Earlier this month, PayPay said it had entered a partnership with Visa, as the Japanese payments company seeks to expand into the U.S.   Jointly formed by SoftBank and Yahoo Japan in 2018, PayPay has helped accelerate Japan's digital transformation, encouraging consumers to move away from cash by offering rebates on payments through its mobile app. Just over seven years since its founding, PayPay has rapidly expanded and grown into one of Japan's most widely used payment platforms, amassing roughly 72 million registered users as of December 31.",

            "title": "Brookfield's new AI unit Radiant valued at $1.3 billion after merger with UK startup, sources say",
            "description": "LONDON, Feb 27 : Brookfield Asset Management's new AI infrastructure company Radiant has been valued at $1.3 billion after merging with London-based cloud computing firm Ori Industries, according to three people with knowledge of the matter and a document seen by Reuters. Radiant, a new company the Canadian asset manager created to provide on-demand access to artificial intelligence chips, said it had combined with Ori in a deal announced on Tuesday without disclosing any financial terms. All of Ori's existing investors have rolled their stakes into Radiant, the sources said, adding that Brookfield injected fresh capital into the new company. Reuters could not determine how much of the valuation reflected Ori's contribution. The valuation was established earlier this month, according to the document and one of the people. Reuters could not determine if it had changed since then. Brookfield and Ori declined to comment. The sources declined to be identified because the terms were not made public. RACE TO BUILD AI INFRASTRUCTURE Companies House filings show that Ori had 42.5 million pounds ($57.2 million) in total assets less current liabilities at the end of 2024. Total debt was 11.3 million pounds from 4.4 million pounds a year earlier, according to its filed accounts. The deal comes as investors race to build the data-centre, power and chip infrastructure needed for advanced AI, amid a shortage of high-performance compute capacity. Mahdi Yahya, the founder of Ori, a startup backed by Saudi Aramco's venture arm, will now be president of Radiant. \"For more than seven years we have been designing software to support AI infrastructure at scale, and it was clear Brookfield was the right partner,\" he said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Through Radiant we can help address the supply-demand imbalance that has defined AI since 2023.\" Vishal Padiyar, executive chair of Radiant, said the company blends infrastructure and software to support governments and major enterprises, aiming to lower computing costs and improve performance at scale. Radiant is one of the first projects backed by Brookfield's AI infrastructure fund, which is seeking $10 billion in investor commitments and aims to scale to as much as $100  billion through co-investment and financing. The fund includes up to $5  billion earmarked for Bloom Energy to install up to 1 gigawatt of behind-the-meter power solutions for data centres and AI factories, while chipmaker Nvidia contributed to the fund's initial capital and will supply chips to Radiant.  Britain is ramping up data-centre construction and plans to expand national computing capacity 20-fold by 2030 as data centres are classed as critical infrastructure.  Global players such as Google and Microsoft have pledged multi-billion-pound investments to the sector in the UK, alongside up to 2 billion pounds ($2.70 billion) in public funding under the UK's Compute Roadmap.  ($1 = 0.7403 pounds)",

            "description": "Feb 27 : Trump Media & Technology Group, founded by U.S. President Donald Trump, is considering spinning off its social media platform Truth Social into a publicly traded company. TMTG is in discussions with TAE Technologies and Texas Ventures Acquisition III about the proposed transaction, the company said on Friday.  Under the proposal, shares in the spun-off company will be distributed to eligible TMTG shareholders, after which the new entity will merge with a special purpose acquisition company. Such a transaction would separate TMTG's social media and digital media assets from its recently announced fusion energy venture, effectively splitting the company into two publicly traded businesses with distinct strategies. Founded by President Donald Trump and known for its Truth Social platform aimed at conservative audiences, TMTG has faced challenges scaling its media business amid competition from larger social networks and uneven user growth. It is now seeking to reposition itself beyond its core Truth Social platform and tap investor interest in emerging energy technologies. TMTG said no definitive agreement has been reached on the spin-off and discussions are ongoing. The company's shares were down more than 3 per cent in afternoon trading. In December, TMTG agreed to merge with TAE in an all-stock deal valued at more than $6 billion, marking a pivot toward fusion energy and the creation of a publicly traded company focused on developing utility-scale power plants to help meet rising electricity demand, including from AI data centers. TAE Technologies is a California-based private company developing advanced nuclear fusion technology that has raised more than $1 billion from investors including Alphabet's Google and Chevron. The startup focuses on a form of fusion designed to produce electricity without releasing large amounts of neutron radiation, reducing radioactive waste.",
