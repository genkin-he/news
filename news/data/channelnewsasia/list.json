            "description": "SAN JOSE, California, Feb 26 : ASML Holding's next-generation chipmaking machine is ready for manufacturers to start bringing it into use for production at high volumes, a senior executive told Reuters, a big step for the chip industry. The Dutch company produces the world's only commercial extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) tools, which are a critical piece of equipment for chipmakers. This new tool will help chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  and Intel produce more powerful and efficient chips, by eliminating several costly and complex steps from the chip-manufacturing process, data from ASML shows. ASML plans to release this data, which represents a key milestone, at a technical conference in San Jose on Thursday, the company's chief technology officer, Marco Pieters, told Reuters on Wednesday. It has taken ASML years to develop the costly, next-generation tools as chipmakers have attempted to determine at what point it makes economic sense to begin to use them for mass production. But given that the current generation of EUV tools is approaching the technical limit of their ability to make complex AI chips, the next-generation machines - called High-NA EUV tools - are key for the AI industry to improve chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and help chipmakers deliver their AI chip roadmaps on time to meet surging demand. The new tools cost roughly $400 million, twice the cost of the original EUV machines. The High-NA EUV tools now experience limited downtime, have produced 500,000 dinner-plate-sized silicon wafers and can draw sufficiently precise patterns that make up the circuits on the chip, the ASML data shows, Pieters said. In combination, the three data points indicate the tools are ready for manufacturers. \"I think that it's at a critical point to look at the amount of learning cycles that have happened,\" he said, referring to the number of tests that have been conducted on the machines by customers. Despite their technical readiness, it will take two to three years for companies to conduct enough testing and development to integrate them into manufacturing. \"(Chipmakers) have all the knowledge to qualify these tools,\" Pieters said. Pieters also said the company has achieved roughly 80 per cent uptime at the moment and plans to achieve 90 per cent by the end of the year. The imaging data ASML plans to release is enough to convince customers to replace multiple steps with the older-generation tools with a single High-NA step, Pieters said. The 500,000 wafers the machines have processed have allowed the company to work out many of the kinks.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : CoreWeave beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue on Thursday, benefiting from the AI boom that has driven companies to its platform for the massive computing power needed to train and deploy advanced AI models. However, CoreWeave's shares fell 7 per cent after the bell, as its operating expenses more than doubled to $1.66 billion in the fourth quarter, and the company's net loss ballooned. The company's adjusted loss widened to $284 million from $36 million in the same quarter last year. CoreWeave still faces lingering concerns regarding its backlog risk, debt and cost of capital, D.A. Davidson analyst Alexander Platt noted. Revenue backlog was $66.8 billion as of December 31, CoreWeave said. Nvidia announced a $2 billion investment in CoreWeave in January, becoming the AI infrastructure provider's second-largest shareholder. CoreWeave's adjusted operating income margin was down 6 per cent in the fourth quarter, from 16 per cent a year earlier. While the company's revenue backlog has become more diversified, large clients such as Microsoft and OpenAI remain critical to its growth trajectory. CoreWeave has positioned itself as a more specialized and cost-effective alternative to the cloud divisions of Amazon, Google and Microsoft, attracting clients ranging from AI labs to large enterprises. It has repurposed its high-performance GPU infrastructure, originally built for large-scale crypto mining, to establish itself as a premier cloud provider for the global AI sector. The company reported revenue of $1.57 billion for the fourth quarter, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.55 billion.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : Block on Thursday said it will cut over 4,000 jobs, or nearly half its workforce, as advances in AI reshape how it builds and runs its business, sending its shares up 22 per cent in after-hours trading. The layoffs underscore how the AI boom is translating from hype into workforce changes, fueling long-held concerns among workers and economists that the technology could eliminate roles even as it boosts productivity and profits. \"Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company. We're already seeing it internally. A significantly smaller team, using the tools can do more and do it better,\" CEO Jack Dorsey said in a statement. \"I don't think we're early to this realization. I think most companies are late,\" he added. In a post on social media platform X, Dorsey said Block opted for a single deep round of cuts instead of multiple smaller layoffs over time. He said a smaller company would also give it space to grow the business the right way, instead of constantly reacting to market pressures. Investors have been rewarding companies that show AI-driven cost savings, and the sharp workforce reduction signals the scale at which the technology is starting to translate into lower expenses and higher margins in some industries. The company said it expects to incur roughly $450 million to $500 million in restructuring charges. Block posted an adjusted profit of 65 cents per share in the three months ended December 31, compared with 47 cents a year earlier. Gross profit grew 24 per cent in the quarter, driven by a 33 per cent surge in the Cash App business, which enables peer-to-peer mobile payments.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : Warner Bros Discovery said Paramount Skydance's revised $31-a-share offer was superior to its existing deal with Netflix, giving the streaming giant four business days to respond or walk away from the bidding war for the coveted Hollywood studio. The high-stakes battle could be in its final stretch after the announcement on Thursday. Netflix had earlier this month granted Warner Bros a seven-day waiver to seek a \"best and final offer\" from Paramount for the company. Pursuant to the terms of the Netflix merger agreement, this notice initiates a four-business-day period during which Netflix may propose revisions to the agreement, Warner Bros said. Shares of Paramount Skydance were up more than 1.5 per cent in extended trading. Netflix, which is looking to buy Warner Bros' streaming and studio businesses, agreed in December to pay $27.75 a share, saying the offer, along with a planned spinoff of Warner Bros' cable assets, would deliver a greater shareholder value. The bid partly depends on the debt level of those assets, which would be separately listed as Discovery Global, as well as the company's equity value once it starts trading. Estimates of Discovery Global's value vary greatly. Warner Bros said it could fetch between $1.33 and $6.86 a share, but Paramount said it is almost worthless. MoffettNathanson analysts had said a Paramount bid of $34 a share would have ended debate about Discovery Global's value. In its revised bid, Paramount raised the termination fee it would pay should the deal fail to gain regulatory approval, to $7 billion from $5.8 billion. NETFLIX'S FINANCIAL MUSCLE With about $9.03 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of December, the creator of \"Stranger Things\" has ample financial muscle to raise its offer. Either deal will reshape the power structure of Hollywood by handing the suitor one of the industry's most-coveted studios and an extensive content library, as well as lucrative entertainment franchises such as \"Game of Thrones\" and DC Comics. Paramount has argued it has a clearer path to U.S. regulatory approval than Netflix and had indicated that if Warner Bros rejects the new bid, it would be ready to launch a board challenge at this year's annual meeting. One of Paramount's director candidates could be a big shareholder in Warner Bros, hedge fund Pentwater Capital Management CEO Matthew Halbower said. Activist investor Ancora Holdings, which owns a small stake in Warner Bros, has also stepped up pressure on the HBO owner by saying the company did not adequately engage with Paramount. Warner Bros has previously said its board has a track record of acting in the best interests of the company and shareholders.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : Grindr on Thursday reported fourth-quarter revenue above estimates and expanded its share repurchase program by $400 million, as the LGBTQ+ dating app bets on artificial intelligence-powered features to drive growth. The company said it would continue investing heavily in AI-powered initiatives throughout the year, signaling confidence that technology-driven improvements will help enhance user growth and engagement. The Los Angeles-based company also launched \"Edge\", a new premium AI-powered subscription tier aimed to offer the platform's AI offerings under one product. \"Edge will be the focus for most of the year, trial and testing around the pricing and enhancing the user experience through the comprehensive offering,\" Grindr CEO George Arison told Reuters. While traditional dating apps such as Bumble and Match Group's Tinder have struggled to retain younger users amid shifting preferences and dating app fatigue, Grindr has managed to maintain its dominant position in the LGBTQ+ dating space. The company is leaning into AI through its proprietary gAI system, which powers chat summaries, personalized recommendations and profile discovery tools, while differentiating itself by focusing on community-building features and location-based networking rather than just romantic connections. At the same time, Arison said Grindr would keep \"a very robust free product\" to attract younger users and improve the overall experience. In October, Grindr's majority shareholders proposed to take the company private, with talks eventually falling apart in November. \"We are going to stay public. And everyone's aligned on that. I think we have a very clear strategy,\" Arison said. The company said it would invest more heavily in 2026 to modernize its core architecture and expand beyond its dating app, including health and wellness services through its Woodwork initiative. For the full year, the company sees revenue higher than $528 million, largely in line with estimates of $529 million, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The third quarter is typically Intuit's strongest, as the tax season boosts demand for the company's financial management tools such as TurboTax, Credit Karma, and QuickBooks. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the U.S. federal government agency, began accepting federal tax returns on January 26 this year, with the filing deadline set for April 15. Intuit CFO Sandeep Aujla told Reuters that increased marketing and customer support spending are deployed in the third quarter to capitalize on the tax season and drive growth in the assisted tax and QuickBooks segments. The company forecast adjusted earnings per share of $12.45 to $12.51 for the third quarter ending April 30, compared with analysts' average estimate of $12.95, according to data compiled by LSEG. It expects about 10 per cent revenue growth in the quarter, largely in line with analysts' average estimate of 9.9 per cent growth. The forecasts come amid market fears that the growing use of AI tools would erode demand for traditional software, as customers increasingly seek personalized financial guidance and automated solutions for tasks such as bookkeeping. To better compete with rivals such as H&R Block, Oracle's NetSuite and Microsoft's Dynamics 365 Platform, Intuit has signed multi-year deals with AI startups Anthropic and OpenAI to integrate their frontier models into its software. \"We're paying OpenAI and Anthropic for the capabilities. We're not paying them revenue share,\" Aujla said, adding that more than 3 million clients engage with the company's AI agents.

            "description": "Feb 25 : Duolingo forecast first-quarter and 2026 bookings below expectations on Thursday as the language-learning app shifts strategy toward faster user growth, a move it said will weigh on bookings growth and profitability this year. As part of the push, Duolingo said it will expand access to its artificial intelligence-powered \"Video Call with Lily\" feature by adding it to its Super Duolingo subscription, rather than limiting it to the premium Max tier. The language-learning app has spent recent years fine-tuning monetization through more ads and subscription prompts, helping lift bookings per user. But that coincided with slower user growth, prompting the renewed focus on engagement. \"If we're seeing faster user growth than we're expecting, and what we are expecting is about 20 per cent, then that means the strategy is working,\" CEO Luis von Ahn told Reuters. The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based company also plans to roll out more AI-driven speaking tools to free users, reducing friction that previously nudged learners toward paid plans. The AI-based video call is now more than ten times cheaper to run than at launch, and as costs continue to fall, Duolingo plans to expand access to all users to maximize learning, Von Ahn added. Duolingo said daily active user growth decelerated through 2025 and is expected to fall to roughly half the pace it sustained in prior years. Investors have increasingly scrutinized the company's moderating expansion as it scales, particularly after several quarters of breakneck growth. Bookings are now expected to rise about 11 per cent in 2026, compared with roughly 20 per cent growth the company said it could have delivered under its previous approach. Adjusted core profit margin is forecast to decline to about 25 per cent this year as Duolingo invests in broader access to AI features and steps up marketing. For the first quarter, Duolingo forecast bookings of about $301.5 million, below estimates of $329.7 million, according to Visible Alpha data. For the full year, it expects bookings between $1.27 billion and $1.30 billion, below estimates of $1.39 billion.

Nvidia expects the supply constraints to hurt its gaming business in the current quarter and beyond even as the chip giant sees strong demand, Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said on the company's quarterly earnings call on Wednesday. \"As much as we would love to have more supply, we do believe for a couple quarters it is going to be very tight,\" Kress said. \"If things improve by the end of the year, there is an opportunity to think about what that is from a year-over-year growth. But it's still too early for us to know at this time.\" With the tech industry racing to build out artificial intelligence capacity, demand for memory chips has outstripped supply, causing a spike in prices and prompting manufacturers to prioritize components for higher-margin data center chips. That has constrained supply for consumer electronics such as smartphones and personal computers, as well as gaming consoles. Nvidia chips are widely used in PC gaming as well as in the Nintendo Switch console, while Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox consoles use AMD hardware. Forecasts for the console market have been bleak. According to projections from tech industry research firm TrendForce in December, the console market is expected to see a 4.4 per cent decline this year, compared with its earlier forecast of a 3.5 per cent drop.",

            "description": "WASHINGTON, Feb 26 : The head of the national U.S. bank regulator said on Thursday he would consider a request to allow senior members of Congress to review the bank charter application of World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture backed by the family of President Donald Trump. Jonathan Gould, Comptroller of the Currency named by Trump last year, told Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren during a Senate Banking Committee hearing he would \"entertain\" her request to confidentially review the crypto company's application to become a national trust bank, which it filed in January. Such a charter would allow the company to expand its business operations. Warren, who along with other Democrats raised concerns that the application presents a potential conflict of interest, said she wanted Gould to share an unredacted copy of the application with her and Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, a Republican, to ensure it includes all necessary information. Warren and several other Democrats on the Committee also pressed Gould to reject or delay reviewing the application. World Liberty Financial is run by Trump's sons and other associates.  Democrats also cited reporting from The Wall Street Journal that the United Arab Emirates' national security adviser is a large investor. A spokesman for World Liberty Financial said the company has complied with all requirements during the application process, including required disclosures. \"Democrats are playing politics and, with baseless lies, smearing a private American company undergoing a rigorous regulatory process,\" said spokesman David Wachsman. The White House has previously denied that the Trump family's crypto ties present a conflict of interest. Gould said the licensing process is run by \"superb\" agency staff and its process is detailed in publicly available staff manuals. \"We process applications in a fair and evenhanded manner,\" he said during the congressional hearing. A trust bank charter allows companies to manage and hold assets on behalf of customers and settle payments faster, but firms cannot take deposits or make loans. Several other crypto firms have received preliminary approval for such charters.",

            "title": "Smartphone market set for biggest-ever decline in 2026 on memory price surge, IDC says",
            "description": "Feb 26 : The global smartphone market is poised to suffer its biggest decline ever in 2026, sinking to a more than decade low in shipments, as surging memory chip prices drive up device costs, the International Data Corporation said on Thursday. Smartphone shipments are expected to drop 12.9 per cent to 1.12 billion units, the research firm said in a report. The decline will hit low-end Android manufacturers the hardest, while Apple and Samsung are positioned to gain market share as smaller rivals struggle or exit the market entirely, the report said. \"What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain,\" said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for Worldwide Client Devices at IDC. A rapid build-out of AI infrastructure by tech firms such as Meta, Google and Microsoft has captured much of the memory chips supply, lifting prices as manufacturers prioritize components for higher-margin data centers over consumer devices. Memory chips, or DRAM, are crucial to smartphones as they allow power-hungry applications to run smoothly. Analysts have said rising component costs will force budget-device focused companies to pass the expenses on to consumers, just as demand at higher price points is weakening. Apple and Samsung, with stronger balance sheets and premium positioning, are better positioned, IDC said. It expects the average selling price of smartphones to surge 14 per cent to a record $523 this year, as manufacturers shift toward higher-margin models to offset ballooning costs. IDC expects a modest 2 per cent recovery in 2027 as the crisis eases, followed by a 5.2 per cent rebound in 2028, though it said that the market was unlikely to return to previous norms. \"The memory crisis will cause more than a temporary decline; it marks a structural reset of the entire market,\" said Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC's Mobile Phone Tracker. She warned that the sub-$100 smartphone segment, representing 171 million devices, will become \"permanently uneconomical\" even after memory prices stabilize by mid-2027.",
