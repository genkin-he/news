While ad spending has been shifting from traditional television to streaming, advertisers have remained cautious with their budgets amid economic uncertainty, creating a challenging environment for platforms dependent on ad revenue. Roku also saw a 5 per cent fall in its devices revenue in the third quarter. It reported third-quarter total revenue of $1.21 billion, up 14 per cent from the year-ago period and in line with estimates, according to data compiled by LSEG.",

            "description": "Coinbase Global reported a jump in its third-quarter profit on Thursday, as heightened volatility in digital assets boosted trading volumes at the cryptocurrency exchange, sending its shares up more than 3 per cent after the bell. Digital assets rallied in July as crypto-friendly policies by U.S. President Donald Trump attracted institutional investor interest, catapulting bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, to new peaks. However, weak economic data in the following month sparked recession fears, triggering a sell-off across the sector as investors moved to liquidate riskier assets. Volatility in the sector often benefits cryptocurrency exchanges, with trading volumes typically rising as investors seek to hedge their portfolios. Coinbase's transaction revenue rose to $1.05 billion during the quarter, from $572.5 million a year ago. The company reported a net income of $432.6 million, or $1.50 per share, for the three months ended September 30, compared with $75.5 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue from its subscription and services unit, which includes businesses outside of trading, rose 34.3 per cent to $746.7 million. A portion of Coinbase's subscription and services revenue is derived from stablecoin holdings and related platform activities. Stablecoin revenue came in at $354.7 million during the third quarter, up from $246.9 million a year earlier. \"We are accelerating payments through stablecoin adoption, which we anticipate will continue given policy tailwinds, and ongoing adoption from financial institutions and corporates for payment and treasury needs,\" Coinbase said in a letter to shareholders. Stablecoin has received optimism from traditional circles of finance and has been at the forefront of legislations, with GENIUS Act been passed earlier in the year. The act aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins and promote broader adoption. Coinbase shares have gained about 32 per cent so far in 2025, while bitcoin prices have risen 14.5 per cent during the period.",

            "description": "Amazon.com forecast quarterly revenue largely above Wall Street estimates on Thursday on strong demand for its cloud services as businesses continue to spend relentlessly on artificial intelligence software development.  The massive cloud demand is helping the tech company ease the pressure from softer growth at its e-commerce business, which is gearing up for the holiday season amid weakness in consumer confidence stemming from global trade uncertainty.  Investors cheered the news, sending the company's shares up nearly 10 per cent in extended trading. CLOUD REVENUE JUMPS Its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, reported a 20 per cent rise in revenue in the third quarter ending in September, compared with estimates of a 17.95 per cent increase. Amazon projected total net sales of between $206 billion and $213 billion for the fourth quarter, while analysts on average were expecting revenue of $208.12 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. The strong results from AWS, the world's largest cloud provider, followed stellar cloud revenue growth reported on Wednesday by Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud, the No. 2 and No. 3 players in the industry, respectively.  Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook owner Meta all announced plans for higher annual capital expenditures as they pour money into chips and data centers. “AWS is growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022,\" CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement. \"We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity.\" Jassy's comments echoed those from rival CEOs, indicating Big Tech has no plans to pump the brakes on AI spending despite Wall Street expressing concern about a possible investment bubble. Companies, including Amazon, are introducing AI into nearly every facet of their operations in hopes of reducing costs and boosting productivity. AWS typically accounts for a little more than 15 per cent of Amazon's total revenue, but the segment is a huge profit engine, making up roughly 60 per cent of the company's total operating income. The unit reported revenue growth of 17.5 per cent in the second quarter. Seattle-based Amazon posted a $1.8 billion charge for severance costs. On Tuesday, it announced it had cut 14,000 corporate jobs.  ",

The company has benefited from consistent spending by public safety and government agencies in North America, which are upgrading their radio systems and investing in video security and command center software. Demand has also been bolstered by funding from government programs, including the American Rescue Plan Act, which has provided state and local governments with capital for modernizing their critical communication infrastructure.

            "description": "Lumen Technologies edged past third-quarter revenue estimate and posted a smaller-than-expected loss on Thursday, driven by demand for its network infrastructure to support massive data flows and computational workloads amid an AI boom. The telecom and networking firm continues to have an opportunity to expand its share of business revenue, as hyperscalers and enterprise customers ramp up bandwidth demand to support growing AI applications and modernize their core connectivity infrastructure. Lumen reported third-quarter revenue of $3.09 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $3.04 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. The company said it has signed new deals worth $1 billion in October for its private connectivity fabric (PCF) solutions, designed for AI workloads, bringing the total value to more than $10 billion. The October deal is largely with one client, Chief Financial Officer Chris Stansbury told Reuters in an interview, without naming the customer. There are nearly 15 to 16 customers that add up to the total value, with Lumen seeing more pathways to demand for the PCF product. In May, the company had agreed to sell its consumer fiber business to AT&T for $5.75 billion to sharpen its enterprise focus and reduce capital expenditure. The deal is expected to close in early 2026. When the deal closes, Lumen's leverage will be below four times and it will continue to reduce debt, Stansbury said. \"We're not in a position where we have to sell things anymore,\" Stansbury said. \"Our debt is no longer a headwind.\" Earlier this month, Lumen and data analytics firm Palantir announced a multi-year partnership aimed at helping businesses deploy AI more quickly and securely. Lumen has also unveiled a series of collaborations with tech firms focused on AI and cybersecurity. Lumen posted an adjusted loss of 20 cents per share during the third quarter, compared with analysts' estimate of a 27-cent loss. It also reiterated its fiscal 2025 forecast.",

The company's AI-optimized ad platform helps advertisers to place targeted ads directly within relevant discussion threads across its interest-based communities, known as subreddits. The approach allows marketers to harness user-driven conversations for better targeting. Reddit's vast content library is one of its valuable assets at a time when AI companies are looking for data to train their large language modes, a technology behind chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Grok. The company already licenses its data to Alphabet's Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI. It sued Perplexity AI and other three data scraping companies last week, alleging them of illegally collecting Reddit's data. Reddit operates in a crowded social media market, where dominant platforms such as TikTok and Meta are aggressively vying for new advertisers with their massive user-bases and AI-powered ad tools. Facebook-parent Meta reported upbeat third-quarter revenue on Wednesday. Reddit expects fourth-quarter revenue to be between $655 million and $665 million, compared with analysts' average estimate of $637.9 million, according to data compiled by LSEG. The company forecast fourth-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to be between $275 million and $285 million, compared with estimates of $258.8 million. Daily active unique visitors rose 19 per cent to 116 million in the third quarter ended September 30, while its average revenue per user increased by 41 per cent. The company said its machine translation feature now supported 30 languages, helping fuel user growth across markets outside the United States.
