            "description": "Feb 26 : Netflix will broadcast the Canadian Formula One Grand Prix live to U.S. viewers in May as part of a deal that makes season eight of its hit docu-series 'Drive to Survive' available for streaming on Apple TV. Apple TV is taking over from Walt Disney's ESPN this season as the exclusive U.S. broadcaster of Formula One, with live coverage of all 24 rounds. Streaming giant Netflix had also been a contender for the U.S. broadcasting rights, according to media reports in February last year. Season eight of 'Drive to Survive', with exclusive behind the scenes access through the 2025 Formula One campaign won by McLaren and Lando Norris, launches globally on Friday. Formula One's new season, with three U.S. rounds, starts in Australia on March 8. Apple's Senior Vice-President of Services Eddy Cue told reporters on a video call that select races and practice sessions would also be made available for free through the season, without giving details. \"We look at F1 and Apple TV as a true partnership where we're going to amplify this sport across all our Apple services,\" he said. \"Netflix, I think, has played a pivotal role in growing F1 since the launch of 'Drive to Survive' and we're thrilled to make F1 content more broadly available to new and existing U.S. fans on both Netflix and Apple TV.\" Formula One's Chief Media Rights and Broadcast officer Ian Holmes said ESPN had taken Formula One in the United States, a key market, to a new level with their coverage and the relationship with Apple was \"the next big iteration\". \"I'd say we are probably the only sport in the world whose audience is getting younger and more female skewed, and that couldn't be more represented than currently in the U.S.,\" he added. \"So we see a relationship with Apple and the way that Apple is able to offer its content as the most forward-looking approach that we can pursue.\"",

            "description": "MILAN, Feb 26 : Prada's autumn/winter show in Milan on Thursday included embroidered satin dresses, sheer skirts and wool sweaters, while the front row presence of Mark Zuckerberg fuelled speculation about a potential smart glasses partnership. Designers Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons chose to have only 15 models walk the runway, each wearing multiple looks to focus on layering clothes to best effect, including short jackets over lightweight tunics. \"As a woman, your life is layered - each day demands not only a shifting of clothes, but a richness of identities within yourself,\" said Miuccia Prada in the press notes. Brightly coloured handbags and quirky kitten heel shoes were also on display. Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook owner Meta Platforms, and his wife Priscilla Chan sat alongside Prada's CEO Andrea Guerra and Prada's family heir Lorenzo Bertelli. In November, Bertelli, who is Prada's chief marketing officer, told Reuters that the group had had \"exploratory talks\" with EssilorLuxottica over the potential development of smart glasses under its brands, but no decision had been made. Prada has a licensing agreement with the Franco-Italian eyewear maker, which has a partnership with Meta to develop AI-powered glasses.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : Nvidia's shares fell on Thursday as investors looked past strong earnings, wary that the chip designer continues to channel capital into expanding the AI ecosystem, the payoffs for which are still unclear, rather than boosting shareholder returns. Its shares slid 4 per cent to $187.6 and dragged other chip stocks including Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices lower. The stock closed at a three-month high on Wednesday. The bearish reaction reflects growing concerns about whether Nvidia's record-setting momentum can hold as rivals push new AI accelerators, hyperscalers invest in custom silicon and the broader AI spending cycle becomes more uneven. \"Nvidia once again exceeded expectations but the competitive picture is also shifting as companies like Meta diversify toward AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) and the big cloud players invest more in custom silicon,\" said Jacob Bourne, analyst at eMarketer. \"This puts a focus on Nvidia's guidance for what the future holds in terms of maintaining its dominance as the AI buildout matures and questions around enterprise ROI (return on investment) intensify.\" Hyperscalers including Meta Platforms - a major customer - have forecast total capital expenditure of at least $630 billion in 2026, with most of it earmarked for data centers and processors. Nvidia's shares also fell below technical support levels around their 50- and 100-day moving averages, which could be indicative of more selling pressure. To an analyst's question during a post-earnings call on whether the company was looking to give back shareholders some of the $100 billion cash it was likely to generate this year, Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said the company wanted to keep investing in the AI ecosystem. The world's most valuable company said it expects fiscal first-quarter sales of $78 billion, plus or minus 2 per cent, compared with analysts' average estimate of $72.60 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. \"For about the 5th time in the last 3 years, there appear to be generalist concerns that growth will slow, despite near-term acceleration and the clear increase in model usage that is starting to have a major impact on productivity,\" Morgan Stanley equity strategist Joseph Moore said in a note. Massive demand from AI infrastructure has also fuelled concerns about a global memory chip supply crunch. Nvidia dismissed questions on whether supply shortfalls at its chip contract maker TSMC would hamper growth, stating it had secured enough chip inventory and capacity to meet demand beyond the next several quarters, but did reveal that it will affect its gaming business. The company's price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is currently 24.5 times forward earnings, down from 34.6 on October 29 when it hit $5 trillion in market capitalization for the first time, as per LSEG DataStream. It is also well below Advanced Micro Devices' PE ratio of 28.8 and Intel's 81.4.",

            "description": "NEW YORK, Feb 26 : An index of global equity markets eased after hitting a fresh record high on Thursday as concerns about lofty valuations of leading technology companies weighed on markets after artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia reported strong quarterly results. Shares on Wall Street and in Europe traded down as investors digested another blowout quarter from Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, but worried about its market value even as it forecast that first-quarter revenue would come in at a whopping $78 billion.  On Wall Street, technology and communication services were the biggest losers, with Nvidia's shares down 4 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.11 per cent, the S&P 500 fell 0.70 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.37 per cent. \"People are getting concerned about lofty valuations even though when you look at a company like Nvidia, the estimates, cash flow, and everything else are dramatically higher,\" said Thomas Plumb, chief executive and portfolio manager at Plumb Funds in Madison, Wisconsin. \"But I think the sentiment will eventually match up with the realities,\" said Plumb, who has Nvidia as his largest investment holding.  In Europe, the broad STOXX 600 index fell 0.11 per cent. MSCI's All Share Index was down 0.30 per cent after rising to a record high of 1,063.86.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : Warner Bros Discovery heaped an additional burden on Netflix's $82.7 billion bid for the movie studio and HBO. The entertainment company behind the buzzy series \"Heated Rivalry\" and the film \"Wuthering Heights\" reported fourth-quarter earnings Thursday that showed profit at its cable channels is deteriorating at a fast pace. The networks, which include CNN, the Discovery Network and TNT, are not part of Netflix’s deal. But their worth as a separately traded company is a key component in valuing the streaming service’s offer for the Warner Bros film and TV studios, its library, HBO and the HBO Max streaming service. Rival Paramount Skydance raised its proposal to buy all of Warner Bros to $110 billion. On Tuesday, the Warner board said it is negotiating with the rival bidder to determine whether the revised proposal could result in a deal superior to Netflix's offer.  Warner Bros Chief Executive David Zaslav did not address the discussions on a call with investors Thursday. Instead, he highlighted his role in sparking a bidding war for the coveted assets. \"We engaged with four bidders, which led to eight price increases, and have thus far achieved a 63 per cent increase in value versus the first offer received in September, delivering significant value to WBD shareholders throughout the process,\" Zaslav told investors. Warner's board had previously determined Netflix's offer was superior to Paramount's because investors would also receive the value of its planned spin-off of the television group, Discovery Global.  The division's revenue fell to $4.2 billion, down 12 per cent from a year earlier, and adjusted income dropped to $1.4 billion, a 27 per cent plunge from the same quarter a year earlier. Such declines affect the value of the TV networks as a standalone business, Discovery Global. Its closest comparison is Versant Media, the cable and digital assets separated from Comcast earlier this year. Versant's enterprise is worth roughly 3 times its 2025 forecast EBITDA of $2.1 billion. On the same yardstick, Discovery Global's market capitalization would be approximately $3 billion or a little over $1 per share, assuming $17 billion in net debt. Add that to Netflix's cash offer of $27.75 per share and it comes in shy of Paramount's bid of $31. Warner CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels declined to address that comparison. Netflix did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  HBO Max continued to grow, helped by series like \"Heated Rivalry\" and \"It: Welcome to Derry.\" Warner Bros added 3.5 million streaming subscribers in the quarter, bringing its total number worldwide to 131.6 million. The streaming group's revenue rose 5 per cent to nearly $2.8 billion, but adjusted earnings fell 4 per cent to $393 million due to the end of an unspecified distribution deal. \"The best thing for WBD shareholders is that it is being sold, because its fundamentals continue to deteriorate,\" wrote Needham & Co senior research analyst Laura Martin. Warner's stock was largely unchanged in early morning trading. Zaslav also highlighted the success of the Warner Bros film slate, including \"Wuthering Heights,\" \"A Minecraft Movie\" and \"Superman.\" \"We love the motion picture business,\" Zaslav said on the call. \"We at the company believe so deeply in the motion picture business, putting movies on the screen for shared experience ... Our commitment to the motion picture business is the core of our company.\" Netflix Chief Executive Ted Sarandos has defended his deal for the studio and HBO by affirming his commitment to releasing movies in theaters, a strategy that was never part of Netflix's DNA. Should Warner Bros board declare that Paramount's deal is superior, Netflix has four business days to revise its offer.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : A California woman is expected to testify in court on Thursday about how using Meta Platforms' Instagram and Google's YouTube as a child harmed her mental health, as her landmark trial in Los Angeles continues. The plaintiff, known as Kaley G.M. in court, began using Instagram at age 9 and YouTube at age 6 and says the platforms contributed to her depression and body dysmorphia. The companies sought to profit by hooking young children on their services despite knowing social media could harm their mental health, her lawyers say. Kaley G.M.'s testimony comes a day after her former psychotherapist said adolescent social media usage was a \"contributing factor\" to her mental health issues. The case is part of a broader global backlash against social media companies over alleged harms to children and teens. Australia has banned under-16s from such platforms, and other countries are considering similar restrictions. YouTube and Meta have denied the allegations and said evidence in the case does not support the woman's claims. The therapist was called by lawyers for the plaintiff to set the stage for the next phase of the trial, exploring whether and how Kaley's engagement with social media as a child affected her well-being. The beginning of the trial focused on what the companies knew about how social media affects children, and their business strategies related to younger users. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified the company discussed but never launched products for children. To win the case, Kaley's lawyers must show that the way the companies designed or operated the platforms was a substantial factor in causing or worsening her mental health issues.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : Google on Thursday unveiled a successor to its viral Nano Banana image generation model, touting faster performance as the search-engine behemoth pushes to attract more users to its AI tools. The model, called Nano Banana 2, is being rolled out across products, including the Gemini app, AI Mode and Lens features on Search, and Flow, its AI-powered video tool, the Alphabet-owned company said. The launch is Google's latest in a series of moves that have propelled the company to the forefront of the AI race, helping it better compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT after suffering a string of embarrassments initially. The success has fueled a 47 per cent surge in its stock in the past six months. Google rolled out the Nano Banana AI image editor in August, which quickly became a viral sensation, attracting 13 million first-time users to the Gemini app in just four days in September. By mid-October, it had generated more than 5 billion images. The tech giant followed that with the release of the upgraded Nano Banana Pro in November. Nano Banana 2 leans on Gemini's faster and cheaper models known as Flash, which allows quicker image generation and editing, Google said, adding that it also has better instruction-following capabilities and delivers sharper details. In November, Google released its Gemini 3 AI model, whose success prompted rival OpenAI to issue an internal \"code red\" to push teams to accelerate development. Gemini 3 has significantly boosted user engagement, helping the Gemini app capture more than 750 million monthly active users at the end of December.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : Apple urged a federal judge to dismiss a proposed class action claiming it defrauded shareholders twice, by overstating the artificial intelligence capabilities of its Siri voice assistant and falsely representing its compliance with an injunction governing commissions on app sales.   In a Wednesday filing in the San Jose, California, federal court, Apple said there was no proof it knew when discussing AI at a June 2024 conference that it would take longer than expected to incorporate two advanced AI features into Siri, potentially hurting iPhone 16 sales. The company delayed some Siri upgrades the following March, and Chief Executive Tim Cook said two months later that developing a \"more personal\" Siri was \"taking a bit longer than we thought.\" Apple also said it provided no assurance that its procedures designed to comply with a 2021 injunction, in a case brought by Epic Games, to let app users pay developers directly rather than have the company charge the developers hefty commissions would be foolproof. \"It is no secret that Apple faced challenges and weathered ups and downs in its stock price in 2025, like many major companies,\" Apple said. \"But plaintiff takes a massive and unsupported leap by claiming that securities fraud caused the temporary price drops.\" The lawsuit covers Apple shareholders who suffered potentially hundreds of billions of dollars of losses in the Cupertino, California-based company's stock between May 3, 2024 and May 1, 2025, the day after a judge said Apple was violating the injunction. Lawyers for shareholders led by South Korea's National Pension Service, the world's third largest pension fund with close to $1 trillion of assets, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Apple's injunction required the company to provide app users with external links for purchases, so developers wouldn't owe 30 per cent commissions for purchases in its App Store. The judge overseeing that case rebuked Apple for creating a new system that charged a 27 per cent commission on some external sales. A federal appeals court partially reversed her sanctions in December.",

            "description": "ZURICH/HONG KONG, Feb 26 : Syngenta Group plans to launch an up to $10 billion stock market listing in Hong Kong in the second quarter of this year and has hired banks to manage the initial public offering, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Reuters reported this month that Basel-based Syngenta, which is controlled by state-owned Chinese company Sinochem, could sell up to 20 per cent of its shares in the IPO but the size and timing of the offering was not final and could change depending on market conditions. Syngenta declined to comment on possible timeline for the prospectus filing or when the IPO itself would take place.",

            "title": "Exclusive-Broadcom expects to sell 1 million 3D stacked chips by 2027",
            "description": "SAN JOSE, California, Feb 26 : Artificial intelligence chip designer Broadcom said that it expects to sell at least 1 million chips by 2027 based on its stacked design tech, an executive told Reuters on Wednesday. The forecast, which Reuters is the first to report, marks a new product and sales target for Broadcom that could represent a revenue stream potentially worth billions of dollars. Harish Bharadwaj, vice president of product marketing, said the 1 million chips the company projects it will sell are based on an approach Broadcom developed that stacks two chips on top of one another, allowing the distinct pieces of silicon to be tightly bound to improve the speed at which data can flow from one chip to another. The company has refined the technology over five years to the point where its first customer, Fujitsu, is making engineering samples to test the design. Fujitsu plans to produce the stacked, or 3D, chips later this year.  The million-chip figure includes several additional designs beyond the Fujitsu chip. The company's stacking approach gives its customers the ability to build chips that have more horsepower and use less energy to tackle the rapidly growing computing requirements AI software presents, Bharadwaj said. \"Now, pretty much all of our customers are adopting this technology,\" he said. Broadcom does not typically design entire AI chips itself. It works with companies such as Google for its tensor processing units (TPUs) and ChatGPT maker OpenAI for its in-house custom processors. The Broadcom engineers help translate an early design into the physical layout of a chip that can be fabricated by manufacturers such as TSMC. The company's chip business has grown significantly because of the custom deals with companies such as Google. Broadcom projected that its AI chip revenue would double year-over-year to $8.2 billion in its first fiscal quarter.  As a result, Broadcom has emerged as one of the most significant competitors to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, as it races to produce silicon that competes with the chip giants. Fujitsu is using the new tech for a data center chip. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is fabricating the chip using its cutting-edge 2-nanometer process and fusing it with a 5-nanometer chip. Companies can mix and match which manufacturing process TSMC uses with the Broadcom technology. TSMC fuses the top and bottom chip during the fabrication process.  Broadcom has several more designs in the works and expects to ship two more products based on the stacking tech in the second half of this year and to sample an additional three in 2027. The company spent roughly five years developing the groundwork for the stacked chip tech and testing various designs to come up with a commercial product. Engineers are working to make chips that have as many as eight stacks of two chips each.",
