            "description": "SINGAPORE: Air Japan will cease all flight operations from March 2026, almost two years after Japanese airline group ANA launched the brand to offer low-cost flights mainly on Asian routes.  Its final flight will be from Singapore to Narita Airport on Mar 29 at 12.55am.  ANA Group said on Thursday (Oct 30) that the decision comes as it seeks to restructure its brand strategy. Currently, it has three brands - full-service flight operator ANA, low-cost carrier Peach, as well as AirJapan, which operates as a hybrid carrier. The restructuring will consolidate ANA Group's flight operations into two brands - its namesake airline and Peach. \"This decision is aimed at maximising the entire group's profitability and competitiveness while flexibly responding to recent changes in the business environment,\" said ANA Group. It cited concerns about global developments such as the war in Ukraine and aircraft delivery delays , and added that it is also managing the aircraft on the ground (AOG) situation involving its Boeing 787 aircraft. AOG is an aviation term for planes that are unable to fly due to technical, mechanical or maintenance issues. \"To optimise the allocation of the group's resources, ANA Group decided to suspend the Air Japan brand. Its aircraft and human resources will be consolidated into the ANA brand's operations to expand its international business,\" it said. Air Japan had said on Sep 4 that it would ramp up its schedule with daily Singapore-Tokyo flights from Nov 21 due to the addition of another aircraft to its fleet. It also touted its \" well-priced\" one-way fares starting at S$226 (US$174).",

            "description": "SEOUL :Samsung Electronics said on Friday it is in \"close discussion\" to supply its next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, or HBM4, to Nvidia, as the South Korean chipmaker scrambles to catch up with rivals in the AI chip race. Samsung, which plans to market the new chip next year, did not specify when it aims to ship the latest version of its HBM chip, a key building block of artificial intelligence chipsets. Local rival SK Hynix, Nvidia's top HBM chip supplier, on Wednesday said it aims to start shipping its latest HBM4 chips in the fourth quarter and expand sales next year. Nvidia, in a statement announcing cooperation with Samsung and other Korean companies, said it is in \"key supply collaboration for HBM3E and HBM4\", without elaborating. Samsung has been slower to capitalise on the AI-driven memory chip boom, leading to weaker earnings performance and a reshuffle of its chip division last year. Its earnings recovered this quarter, driven by conventional memory chip demand. This week it said it sells its current-generation HBM3E chips to \"all related customers\", indicating it has joined rivals in supplying the latest 12-layer HBM3E chips to Nvidia. The launch of HBM4 chips will be a major test of Samsung's ability to regain its edge in the market, analysts said. HBM - a type of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) standard first produced in 2013 - involves stacking chips vertically to save space and reduce power consumption, helping to process the large volume of data generated by complex AI applications.",

            "title": "China factory activity shrinks for seventh month, PMI shows",
            "description": "BEIJING: China's factory activity shrank for a seventh month in October, an official survey showed on Friday (Oct 31), keeping alive calls for further stimulus to boost domestic demand, with efforts to ship goods abroad merely exporting price wars. The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 49.0 in October from 49.8 in September, a six-month low, the National Bureau of Statistics' survey showed on Friday. It remained below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction, and missed a median forecast of 49.6 in a Reuters poll. The non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI), which includes services and construction, rose to 50.1 from 50.0 in September. \"Economic momentum has weakened since the middle of the year. The property sector slowdown continues to put pressure on domestic demand,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. \"The fiscal stance has not changed significantly to offset such downward pressure.\" The prolonged slump comes as manufacturers struggle to mount a sustained recovery in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic and a costly trade war with US President Donald Trump forces factory owners to give up on the world's top consumer market. Producers are also having difficulty making ends meet in new markets, with exporters increasingly selling at a loss in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. The PMI, a sentiment-based survey, has at times presented a gloomier picture of the economy than the hard data, with September's industrial output and profit figures showing growth for a third and second consecutive month, respectively. But analysts warn those gains were likely distorted by a push from China's large, state-owned firms. \"Given that we are actually seeking a bit more stimulus in the fourth quarter - investment driven by policy financing tools and new government bonds - I am a bit surprised by the drop in the PMI reading this month,\" said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. China's economic growth slowed to 4.8 per cent in the third quarter, its weakest pace in a year. While that keeps the world's second-largest economy on track to meet its target of roughly 5 per cent this year, it raises questions about Beijing's reliance on external demand amid mounting trade tensions. The ruling Communist Party pledged to boost domestic consumption following a four-day closed-door meeting last week that outlined economic and policy objectives for the next five years, while also emphasising efforts to strengthen its vast industrial system. However, analysts question whether Beijing has anything new to offer or is simply reaching for its usual playbook of channeling resources to large firms while bypassing private producers and households. Some analysts believe Beijing doesn't need more stimulus this year, while others see speeding up infrastructure investment as a way to ensure the economy remains on target in the fourth quarter. That does little to ease longer-term concerns over Beijing's ability to rebalance an economy in which household consumption trails global averages by about 20 per centage points of GDP. \"The stimulus will be just enough to reach the full-year target, and to not make any indicators look too bad leading up to the beginning of the fifteenth five-year plan period,\" said Dan Wang, director for China at Eurasia Group. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast the private-sector RatingDog PMI to come in at 50.9 on Monday, down from 51.2 a month prior.",

            "description": "Disney's networks went dark on Google's pay-TV platform YouTube TV after negotiations to reach a licensing deal failed, the companies said in separate statements late on Thursday. The affected Disney networks include ESPN, ABC, FX, Nat Geo, Nat Geo Wild, Disney Channel, ABC News Live and others. A source told Reuters that Disney's channels were removed from YouTube ahead of the contract lapsing. YouTube TV issued its statement on X at 11:16 pm ET on Thursday, while the deal was originally set to expire only at midnight. YouTube TV, one of the largest pay-TV distributors in the U.S., has been locked in a series of negotiations this year with firms threatening to pull their media networks from the platform. Earlier this month, the company, after a difficult negotiation period, struck a deal with Comcast-owned NBCUniversal to keep NBC shows such as \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" on YouTube TV. The platform also struck similar deals with Fox and Paramount earlier this year after difficult contract negotiations. YouTube TV, which has over 10 million subscribers, said Disney's proposed offer terms would raise prices for its subscribers and benefit Disney's own live TV services such as Hulu + Live TV, while Disney accused YouTube of being unwilling to pay fair rates. \"Our contract with Disney has reached its renewal date, and we'll not agree to terms that disadvantage our members while benefiting Disney's TV products,\" YouTube TV said in a post on social media platform X. A Disney spokesperson said the company was committed to working toward a resolution as quickly as possible. \"With a $3 trillion market cap, Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we've successfully negotiated with every other distributor,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. YouTube TV will offer its subscribers a $20 credit if the Disney networks remain unavailable on the platform for an extended period of time. The pay-TV platform had dropped Spanish-language network Univision last month after a failed contract deal.",

            "title": "Analysis:BOJ locks in near-term rate hike, yen may sway timing",
            "description": "TOKYO :The Bank of Japan's cautious governor has dropped unusually hawkish hints of an interest rate hike in December or January next year, with the timing likely swayed not just by wage momentum but by moves in the yen. The central bank kept interest rates steady at 0.5 per cent on Thursday as expected, but Governor Kazuo Ueda said the likelihood of its baseline scenario materialising has heightened - language he had used in the past to signal a rate hike was imminent. While warning of lingering global uncertainties, the board revised up this year's growth forecast and made few tweaks to its sanguine view of Japan's recovery prospects in a quarterly report released after the meeting. As was the case before the BOJ's previous rate hike in January, Ueda also elaborated on the triggers for action with an emphasis on the \"initial momentum\" of next year's wage negotiations. \"Ueda's remarks ... contained many signals that, barring major shocks in the U.S. economy or markets, the probability of a near-term rate hike is rising,\" said Takeshi Yamaguchi, chief Japan economist at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities. \"Given Ueda's use of the term 'initial momentum,' we think it is unlikely the BOJ will wait until March wage results,\" said Yamaguchi, who predicts a rate hike in December. MORE DATA TO COME More data will be available by the BOJ's upcoming policy meeting on December 18-19 that would provide hints to next year's wage outlook, including corporate earnings reports and the central bank's \"tankan\" business survey due on December 15. Already, Japan's largest labour union group said it would seek wage hikes of 5 per cent or more in 2026, aiming for bumper pay raises for the fourth straight year despite external headwinds. There could also be early hints on how automakers - a sector Ueda said he was paying particular attention to - set wages as they face the hit from U.S. tariffs. Last year, labour unions at major automakers set pay hike targets in December. Ueda may also heed to mounting pressure from within his nine-member board to act sooner rather than later. Two board members repeated their proposal, made in September, to hike rates to 0.75 per cent, on Thursday. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has recently chimed in, urging the government of new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who is known as an advocate of loose monetary policy, to allow the BOJ to raise rates and avoid excessive yen declines. \"A hawkish bloc has solidified within the BOJ policy board\" with the hawks having \"an external advocate pushing for monetary tightening\" in Bessent, said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, who predicts a rate hike in December. \"As a new prime minister, it may even be advantageous for Takaichi to get the rate hike out of the way early on in her tenure,\" he added. YEN COMPLICATES TIMING To be sure, the BOJ may opt to play it safe by waiting until its January 22-23 meeting, as most big manufacturers firm up wage plans at the start of the year, some analysts say. By then, there will be more clarity on the Takaichi administration's budget plans and economic policies. The BOJ, too, can offer a more thorough analysis justifying a rate hike in a quarterly report due after the January meeting. In the end, however, the timing may depend much on yen moves as a renewed slide in the currency would push up import costs and broader inflation, some analysts say. The yen fell to a nearly nine-month low against the dollar on Thursday despite Ueda's hawkish comments. Data on Friday showed core consumer inflation in Japan's capital, a leading indicator of nationwide trends, perked up in October and remained above the central bank's 2 per cent target. Further rises in the cost of living would run counter to Takaichi's pledge to cushion households' blow from inflation. Former BOJ executive Akira Otani expects the BOJ to hike rates in January, when enough data becomes available on whether companies will weather the tariff hit and keep hiking pay. But he cites the yen as potentially changing the timing. \"At present, we don't see a strong chance of a December rate increase,\" said Otani, currently managing director at Goldman Sachs Japan. \"But the possibility could heighten if yen falls accelerate and increase the risk of inflation overshooting the BOJ's baseline forecast made in October.\"",

            "title": "Commentary: Nvidia’s US$5 trillion valuation redefines what Big Tech means",
            "description": "NEW YORK: On Wednesday (Oct 29), just 112 days after becoming the first US$4 trillion company, Nvidia became the first US$5 trillion company .  It’s worth is more than 8 per cent of the S&P 500, but that’s just the start of it - the AI boost to the markets is built almost entirely off the back of use cases developed on Nvidia chips. The AI strategies of the biggest tech companies, like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and others, rest on their ability to hurriedly acquire and deploy Nvidia’s hardware in their data centres. While some rivals are trying to develop their own alternatives, notes analyst group Wedbush, “there is only one chip in the world fuelling this AI Revolution … and it’s Nvidia.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the man they call the Godfather of AI, has spent this week reassuring the world he is not creating a bubble. On his balance sheet, at least, the money is becoming very real: half a trillion dollars expected in revenue over the next five quarters from bookings for its latest chips.  “This is quite extraordinary,” Huang said of the moment as he sought to emphasise the diversity of businesses Nvidia is powering. These go well beyond the humble chatbot. Its presentations this week have spanned self-driving cars with Uber and Lucid Motors, AI-enhanced cybersecurity with CrowdStrike; pharmaceutical research with Eli Lilly, and an expansion into the nascent but promising realm of quantum computing. FEW ARE FINDING REASON TO BE CAUTIOUS The only blip along the way, if it could even be called that, were fears in September 2024 about the production delays of its latest chip, Blackwell, which triggered a sharp 13 per cent selloff. Then there was the worry that China’s DeepSeek would upend US tech sector spending on hardware. It didn’t, and those fears are long forgotten.  Huang says the company projects it will sell 20 million of its latest chips, more than five times the volume of the previous generation. This doesn’t take into account the possibility that talks on Thursday between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping of China might pave the way for Nvidia’s most sophisticated chips to be sold to China.  The country’s AI companies are eager for better hardware than what its homegrown chipmakers can offer. Current restrictions, which allow only for the sale of older generations of technology, represent the only meek regulatory constraint on Nvidia’s unstoppable rise.  Few are finding reason to be cautious. Concerns about circular financing, in which Nvidia invests in its own customers, do not appear to have altered investment theses. Nor has it dampened Nvidia’s appetite for a deal - the latest being a US$1 billion investment in Nokia , announced this week.  If Wall Street wanted to look for potential headwinds to Nvidia’s progress, they would start with its reliance on Taiwan - where most of the latest chips are produced - or in the lingering (though not yet pressing) risk that regulators scrutinise more closely the lock-in between Nvidia’s hardware and its proprietary software for AI development. The overly rash reaction to Blackwell production mishaps last year demonstrated how touchy investors are to any sign of turbulence in Nvidia’s supply chain and logistics.RISKS AND DANGERS More broadly, Nvidia needs the downstream rollout of AI - putting it in the hands of consumers and businesses - to start paying off, otherwise the wild capital expenditures might start getting pulled back. Nvidia is relying on others to actually reach the goal of human-level artificial intelligence that will, some say, make all the investment worthwhile. There was a time when Nvidia was a company responsible for making video games look better. Those carefree days are over.  The market cap milestone is a moment for reflection on how one company came to redefine the meaning of “big” in Big Tech at this moment of seismic change.  Beyond being just a big number, what is truly unprecedented in the Nvidia story is how integral its success is to the entire global economy: an industrial revolution in which only one company is seen as capable of building the factories. What made Nvidia into a US$5 trillion company is also what makes it a potential US$5 trillion single point of failure.",

            "description": "Strategy posted a profit in the third quarter, compared with a loss a year earlier, as improving sentiment around the cryptocurrency sector benefited the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, sending its shares up nearly 4 per cent after the bell. Until the fourth quarter of 2024, Strategy could only record impairment losses when bitcoin's value fell below its purchase price, while gains from price increases remained unrealized unless the cryptocurrency was sold. U.S. President Donald Trump's focus on the digital asset sector and his pledge to make America the global hub for cryptocurrencies, combined with strong ETF inflows, have helped bitcoin to scale multiple record highs in 2025. Strategy held 640,808 bitcoins as of October 26, at a total cost of $47.44 billion, or $74,032 per bitcoin. The world's biggest cryptocurrency currently trades at around $107,833. Rising bitcoin prices tend to appreciate Strategy's stock, enabling the company to raise additional capital for reinvestment into the cryptocurrency, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. The increase in bitcoin's value lifts net income at Strategy's buy-and-hold treasury model, which has inspired several other companies to adopt similar approaches. Strategy's net profit was $2.78 billion, or $8.42 per share, for the three months ended September 30, compared with a loss of $340.2 million, or $1.72 per share, a year earlier. Shares of the company have lost about 12 per cent so far in 2025, while bitcoin prices have risen 14.5 per cent.",

            "description": "Hong Kong-based insurer AIA Group said on Friday its value of new business (VONB) reached a record in the third quarter, boosted by growth in its flagship Hong Kong unit. AIA's VONB, which gauges expected profit from new premiums and is a key barometer for growth, rose 25 per cent to $1.48 billion, on a constant exchange currency basis, for the three months ended September 30. That compares with $1.16 billion a year ago. Hong Kong, one of AIA's largest contributors in terms of profit, also logged an all-time high quarterly VONB. \"Our unrivalled distribution platform is a key competitive advantage and both our Premier Agency and partnership distribution channels generated very strong growth during the quarter,\" said Lee Yuan Siong, AIA's group CEO and president. AIA said its proprietary Premier Agency model, the insurer's elite in-house sales force, generated more than 70 per cent of the group's VONB, while recording 19 per cent growth.",

            "description": "Atlassian forecast second-quarter revenue above estimates on Thursday, betting on strong demand for its enterprise software services as businesses upgrade to integrate artificial intelligence, sending its shares up nearly 7 per cent in extended trading. Businesses rushing to adopt AI are increasingly leveling up their systems to incorporate the data-intensive tech, helping drive demand for Atlassian's enterprise software services. Atlassian expects revenue of between $1.535 billion and $1.54 billion in the second quarter, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.51 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Atlassian also announced that its finance chief Joe Binz will retire, effective June 30, 2026, and the company has commenced a search for its next CFO. The company has been looking to improve cross-selling across its portfolio of products and is working to drive demand through its own AI products such as its Rovo Dev coding agent. Atlassian's collaboration tools - such as Jira software for planning and project management and Confluence for content creation — serve over 300,000 customers. It expects cloud revenue to grow about 22.5 per cent in the second quarter. However, Atlassian's revenue stood at $1.37 billion for the three months ended September 30, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.40 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.  Its first-quarter adjusted profit stood at $1.04 per share, compared with the estimates of 84 cents.",
