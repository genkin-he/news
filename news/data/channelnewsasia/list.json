            "description": "Feb 26 : Apple urged a federal judge to dismiss a proposed class action claiming it defrauded shareholders twice, by overstating the artificial intelligence capabilities of its Siri voice assistant and falsely representing its compliance with an injunction governing commissions on app sales.   In a Wednesday filing in the San Jose, California, federal court, Apple said there was no proof it knew when discussing AI at a June 2024 conference that it would take longer than expected to incorporate two advanced AI features into Siri, potentially hurting iPhone 16 sales. The company delayed some Siri upgrades the following March, and Chief Executive Tim Cook said two months later that developing a \"more personal\" Siri was \"taking a bit longer than we thought.\" Apple also said it provided no assurance that its procedures designed to comply with a 2021 injunction, in a case brought by Epic Games, to let app users pay developers directly rather than have the company charge the developers hefty commissions would be foolproof. \"It is no secret that Apple faced challenges and weathered ups and downs in its stock price in 2025, like many major companies,\" Apple said. \"But plaintiff takes a massive and unsupported leap by claiming that securities fraud caused the temporary price drops.\" The lawsuit covers Apple shareholders who suffered potentially hundreds of billions of dollars of losses in the Cupertino, California-based company's stock between May 3, 2024 and May 1, 2025, the day after a judge said Apple was violating the injunction. Lawyers for shareholders led by South Korea's National Pension Service, the world's third largest pension fund with close to $1 trillion of assets, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Apple's injunction required the company to provide app users with external links for purchases, so developers wouldn't owe 30 per cent commissions for purchases in its App Store. The judge overseeing that case rebuked Apple for creating a new system that charged a 27 per cent commission on some external sales. A federal appeals court partially reversed her sanctions in December.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : CNBC is restructuring its newsroom to unify its TV and digital operations in a move that would result in nearly a dozen layoffs including the departure of the website's managing editor, Jeff McCracken, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The cuts are part of an overhaul under Editor-in-Chief David Cho, as CNBC prepares to introduce a paywall on its website, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the information was not public. The layoffs are not aimed at cutting costs and the news organization plans to add some 40 roles in the coming year, according to two of the sources. CNBC and McCracken declined to comment. CNBC is among the most-watched cable networks thanks to its live coverage of markets and global business developments. The layoffs come weeks after Versant Media, the parent company of CNBC, was spun out of Comcast. Shares of Versant have declined more than 30 per cent since the company listed on the Nasdaq in January. Besides CNBC, Versant also owns cable networks such as USA, MS NOW, Oxygen, as well as digital assets like Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes.",

Telegram is a hugely popular tool in Russia for both public and private communications, but the authorities accuse it of allowing itself to be used as a platform for illegal and extremist content.

The theft of personal data of 6 million customers from the firm, T-Mobile's former Dutch operations, included names, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, bank account numbers, birth dates and passport numbers. Odido said it believes the claim of the group \"ShinyHunters\" that it carried out the hack. \"Odido came to the decision not to engage in negotiations with these criminals or submit to their attempts at blackmail,\" the company said in a statement, saying it had taken advice from cybersecurity firms and the police. National broadcaster NOS, which has communicated with the hacking group, reported on Thursday that it has threatened to publish a million lines worth of customer data per day unless the company pays an unspecified amount. \"Our advice to victims of ransomware is not to pay,\" Stan Duijf of the country's national police, which is investigating the hack, said in a statement.

            "description": "SAN JOSE, California, Feb 26 : Artificial intelligence chip designer Broadcom said that it expects to sell at least 1 million chips by 2027 based on its stacked design tech, an executive told Reuters on Wednesday. The forecast, which Reuters is the first to report, marks a new product and sales target for Broadcom that could represent a revenue stream potentially worth billions of dollars. Harish Bharadwaj, vice president of product marketing, said the 1 million chips the company projects it will sell are based on an approach Broadcom developed that stacks two chips on top of one another, allowing the distinct pieces of silicon to be tightly bound to improve the speed at which data can flow from one chip to another. The company has refined the technology over five years to the point where its first customer, Fujitsu, is making engineering samples to test the design. Fujitsu plans to produce the stacked, or 3D, chips later this year.  The million-chip figure includes several additional designs beyond the Fujitsu chip. The company's stacking approach gives its customers the ability to build chips that have more horsepower and use less energy to tackle the rapidly growing computing requirements AI software presents, Bharadwaj said. \"Now, pretty much all of our customers are adopting this technology,\" he said. Broadcom does not typically design entire AI chips itself. It works with companies such as Google for its tensor processing units (TPUs) and ChatGPT maker OpenAI for its in-house custom processors. The Broadcom engineers help translate an early design into the physical layout of a chip that can be fabricated by manufacturers such as TSMC. The company's chip business has grown significantly because of the custom deals with companies such as Google. Broadcom projected that its AI chip revenue would double year-over-year to $8.2 billion in its first fiscal quarter.  As a result, Broadcom has emerged as one of the most significant competitors to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, as it races to produce silicon that competes with the chip giants. Fujitsu is using the new tech for a data center chip. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is fabricating the chip using its cutting-edge 2-nanometer process and fusing it with a 5-nanometer chip. Companies can mix and match which manufacturing process TSMC uses with the Broadcom technology. TSMC fuses the top and bottom chip during the fabrication process.  Broadcom has several more designs in the works and expects to ship two more products based on the stacking tech in the second half of this year and to sample an additional three in 2027. The company spent roughly five years developing the groundwork for the stacked chip tech and testing various designs to come up with a commercial product. Engineers are working to make chips that have as many as eight stacks of two chips each.",

Xiaomi has been asked to pay $72 million in unpaid taxes on royalties, but it has challenged this at the Supreme Court in a case seen as a test of the country's legal framework for contract manufacturing. Flex is asking the Supreme Court to strike down the Indian Tax Tribunal order, which said Xiaomi's contract manufacturers \"willingly participated in the layering of transactions facilitating the evasion of taxes,\" Flex's court filing showed. U.S.-listed Flex told India's Supreme Court it did not help Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi to undervalue certain imports into India, the court filing showed. Flex's court filing said the Indian Tax Tribunal ruling could expose the contract manufacturer to \"extremely harsh penalties.\" Flex in India and Xiaomi did not immediately respond to requests for comment. India's customs authorities did not respond to requests for comment. Flextronics Technologies India, a subsidiary of Flex, was not \"involved in any manner in the transaction pertaining to royalty,\" the company told the court in its January 16 filing, which is not public but has been reviewed by Reuters. Xiaomi has said the implications of the tribunal's ruling are far-reaching as they indicate \"an implicit mistrust of the entire contract manufacturing industry\" in the country. In its Supreme Court challenge, Xiaomi argued that the tax tribunal erred by saying it was the \"beneficial owner\" of the components while requiring it to pay tax on the royalties. The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Indian government to respond to the legal challenges and it will take up the case next in April.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : American Bitcoin, backed by two of U.S. President Donald Trump's sons, swung to a fourth-quarter loss on Thursday amid a weakness in the digital assets space. Concerns over stretched valuations in artificial-intelligence stocks and uncertainty around the timing and scale of U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts have pressured risk assets, dragging bitcoin to quarterly lows and leaving many so-called digital asset treasury (DAT) companies on an unsteady footing. American Bitcoin, a miner of the world's largest cryptocurrency, sells it at a premium or holds for a surge in the price. However, in the reported quarter the sector saw a selloff with bitcoin tumbling nearly 23 per cent in the three months. The company runs industrial-scale mining operations, relying largely on infrastructure provided by Hut 8 to produce bitcoin at costs below prevailing market prices. Stocks of crypto treasury companies typically move in line with the token's price as shifts in prices directly affect the value of reserves. Shares of American Bitcoin, which was co-founded by Eric Trump and where Donald Trump is a stockholder, have lost nearly 22 per cent in the past twelve months. Sustained pressure on the shares of crypto treasury companies could complicate the ability of these firms to raise additional capital to mine more crypto tokens at an industrial scale, the crux of their business model. The company, however, holds over 6,000 bitcoin presently, up from the 5,401 they held at 2025 year-end, Eric Trump said in a statement. The company posted a net loss of $59.45 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a $3.48 million profit in the year ago period. The company had also reported a profit in the previous quarter. American Bitcoin reported revenue of $78.3 million in the three months ended December 31, compared with $64.2 million in the prior-year period. Analysts were expecting revenue of $79.6 million.",

            "description": "LONDON, Feb 26 : Instagram said it would notify parents if their teenager repeatedly searches for terms related to suicide or self-harm within a short period, as pressure grows for governments to follow Australia's ban on the use of social media for under 16s. Britain said in January it was considering restrictions to protect children online, after Australia's move in December. Spain, Greece, and Slovenia have in recent weeks said they are also looking at limiting access. Instagram, owned by Meta Platforms Inc, said on Thursday it would start alerting parents who are signed up to its optional supervision setting if their children try to access suicide or self-harm content. \"These alerts build on our existing work to help protect teens from potentially harmful content on Instagram,\" the platform said in a statement. \"We have strict policies against content that promotes or glorifies suicide or self-harm.\" Its existing policy is to block such searches and redirect people to support resources, Instagram said, adding that it would begin the alerts from next week for those signed up in the United States, Britain, Australia and Canada. Governments are increasingly seeking to protect children from harm online, particularly after worries over the AI chatbot Grok which has generated non-consensual sexualised images. In Britain, measures designed to stop access to pornography sites for children have had implications for adults' privacy, and have led to tension with the U.S. over limits on free speech and regulatory reach. Instagram's \"teen accounts\" for under 16s need a parent's permission to change settings, while parents can select an extra layer of monitoring with the agreement of their teenager.",

One of the world's largest investors, the fund holds stakes in around 7,200 companies globally, owning about 1.5 per cent of all listed stocks. It has often set the pace on environmental, social and governance issues. The fund's investments are measured against a benchmark index set by the finance ministry, with equities tracked against the FTSE Global All Cap index. Each time that index includes new companies, the fund's operator, Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), must screen them before they enter the portfolio. Since 2025, NBIM has used large language models to screen all companies on the day they enter the equity portfolio, rapidly scanning for public information that data vendors typically do not provide. \"Within 24 hours of our investment, the AI tools flag new companies in the fund's equity portfolio with potential links to, for example, forced labour, corruption or fraud,\" NBIM said in its annual responsible investment report, published on Thursday. \"In multiple instances, we identified and sold these investments before the broader market reacted to the risks, avoiding potential losses.\" AI is especially useful for researching smaller companies in emerging markets, NBIM said, noting that data vendors often offer limited coverage and international media may not report on them. \"News may be limited to small media outlets in local languages, and controversies suggesting systemic failures in risk management may go unreported in international media,\" it said.",

Tesla did nothing to secure that approval in 2025, according to previously unreported state Department of Motor Vehicles records and a state spokesperson. Tesla logged zero miles of autonomous test driving on California roads last year for the sixth year in a row, the records show. Documenting test miles is critical in California’s regulatory system for robotaxis, which requires companies to progress through a series of permits before being allowed to operate a driverless ride-hailing service such as Alphabet's Waymo. Much of Tesla’s $1.5 trillion market value is tied to investors’ belief that it will soon operate a vast fleet of robotaxis and sell millions of autonomous-driving software subscriptions. Operating driverless vehicles in California – the largest U.S. auto market – is a linchpin of those ambitions. Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor and autonomous-driving expert who has consulted for the California DMV, said Tesla is implying that “they are ready and regulators are not,” while the reality is that “regulators are ready, and they are not.” Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. On an earnings call in October, Musk told analysts that the company is \"paranoid about safety\" and that it takes a \"cautious approach\" to new markets. \"We probably could just let it loose in these cities,\" he said, \"but we just don't want to take a chance.\" So far, Tesla operates only a small pilot robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, which has far fewer regulatory barriers than California. In the San Francisco Bay Area, the company last July started operating what it called a “robotaxi” service that was not a robotaxi service at all. Instead, it is a chauffeur service with human drivers who use Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” driver-assistance software, which is not fully autonomous, according to the state regulator authorizing the service and Tesla’s disclosures to customers. In order to operate fully self-driving vehicles in California, like Waymo, Tesla would first need to obtain permits to test and operate driverless vehicles from the state's DMV and Public Utilities Commission, which regulates commercial ride-hailing. Tesla so far has only the entry-level DMV permit, which allows testing driverless vehicles only with a human safety monitor in the driver’s seat. A DMV spokesperson said Tesla has not applied for any additional permits. Tesla would need to log at least 50,000 miles (80,467 km) of autonomous driving on public roads in California with a safety driver before applying for a different permit allowing testing without one, according to proposed DMV regulations expected to be finalized later this year. Tesla has not logged any miles with state regulators since 2019 and has documented only 562 miles in total since 2016.  Waymo, by comparison, logged more than 13 million testing miles and secured seven different regulatory approvals between 2014 and 2023, when it received approval to charge passengers for rides in driverless robotaxis. Waymo is one of three companies with California permits to commercially operate driverless vehicles and the only one approved to operate a robotaxi fleet anything like what Musk envisions. In written comments last year, Tesla criticized some of the California DMV's proposed revisions to autonomous-driving rules, questioning the need for testing on state roads and minimum-mile requirements. The company also complained about \"overly burdensome reporting requirements\" for crashes and other system failures. Musk has often suggested California regulations are the main impediment to deploying robotaxis there. On an October 2024 earnings call, he said California has “quite a long regulatory approval process.” “I’d be shocked if we don’t get approved next year,” he added, “but it’s just not something we totally control.”",
