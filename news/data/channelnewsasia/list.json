            "description": "TOKYO :Japan's Nikkei share average climbed to an all-time high on Friday, posting its biggest monthly gain in three decades, as tech stocks rallied following strong sales forecasts from Amazon and Apple. A weaker yen also boosted heavyweight exporters, following its slide to a record low against the euro and the lowest level since February versus the dollar on Thursday after the Bank of Japan governor kept a cautious tone in holding interest rates steady. The Nikkei closed up 2.1 per cent at the session high of 52,411.34, a record peak that took the index's gains for October to 16.6 per cent - the biggest since January of 1994. The broader Topix rose as much as 1.4 per cent to reach an all-time peak of 3,348.06, before ending the day with a 0.9 per cent gain at a record closing high of 3,331.83. On Thursday, Amazon reported its cloud revenue rose at the fastest clip in nearly three years, helping the company to forecast quarterly sales above estimates. Meanwhile, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook gave forecasts for holiday-quarter iPhone sales and overall revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Japan's chip-sector shares were among the biggest gainers. Socionext soared nearly 17 per cent, while Advantest climbed 3.9 per cent, making it the Nikkei's largest gainer in terms of index points due to its heavy weighting. Artificial intelligence data centre-related shares also gained, with Hitachi jumping 7.2 per cent. Tech stocks have been at the centre of the Nikkei's relentless rally in recent months, joining a global equity resurgence fuelled by sky-high expectations for AI. Japan has had the additional tailwind this month from hopes for aggressive fiscal stimulus under new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. One of her focus areas is AI innovation, meaning Japanese tech shares will benefit from both global and domestic momentum, according to MUFG Asset Management. Topping the 52,000 level for the Nikkei \"is just a step on the way higher,\" said MUFG Asset Management Chief Market Economist Naoya Oshikubo. \"We have more room, like another 10 per cent rise from here towards April,\" he said. \"This is not a bubble.\"",

            "title": "Samsung Electronics in talks with Nvidia to supply next-generation HBM4 chips",
            "description": "SEOUL :Samsung Electronics said on Friday it is in \"close discussion\" to supply its next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, or HBM4, to Nvidia, as the South Korean chipmaker scrambles to catch up with rivals in the AI chip race. Samsung, which plans to market the new chip next year, did not specify when it aims to ship the latest version of its HBM chip, a key building block of artificial intelligence chipsets. Local rival SK Hynix, Nvidia's top HBM chip supplier, on Wednesday said it aims to start shipping its latest HBM4 chips in the fourth quarter and expand sales next year. Nvidia, in a statement announcing cooperation with Samsung, said it is in \"key supply collaboration for HBM3E and HBM4\", without elaborating. In a separate deal, Samsung said it will purchase 50,000 high-end Nvidia chips to build an AI-enhanced semiconductor factory aimed at improving chip manufacturing speed and yields. Samsung's share price rose as much as 4.32 per cent after the announcements. Chairman Jay Y. Lee and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met over fried chicken and beer on Thursday during Huang's visit to Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit. Lee said Nvidia is a key customer and strategic partner and highlighted more than two decades of collaboration. Jeff Kim, head of research at KB Securities, said HBM4 likely needs further testing but Samsung widely is seen to be in a favourable position given its production capacity. \"If Samsung supplies HBM4 chips to Nvidia, it could secure a significant market share that it was unable to achieve with previous HBM series products,\" Kim said. Samsung has been slower to capitalise on the AI-driven memory chip boom, leading to weaker earnings performance and a reshuffle of its chip division last year. Its earnings recovered in the latest quarter driven by conventional memory chip demand. This week it said it sells its current-generation HBM3E chips to \"all related customers\", indicating it has joined rivals in supplying the latest 12-layer HBM3E chips to Nvidia. The launch of HBM4 chips will be a major test of Samsung's ability to regain its edge in the market, analysts said. HBM - a type of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) standard first produced in 2013 - involves stacking chips vertically to save space and reduce power consumption, helping to process the large volume of data generated by complex AI applications. Investors are watching for whether Samsung's HBM4 can cut SK Hynix's lead in advanced memory chips. The chipmaker, which also is also a leading smartphone maker, said in July it had provided HBM4 samples to customers, with plans to begin supply next year. Samsung's share price has risen nearly 60 per cent since July as investors expect the chipmaker to benefit from the current uptrend in memory prices and advance in the AI race.",

            "description": "TOKYO :Core inflation in Japan's capital accelerated in October and stayed above the central bank's 2 per cent target, data showed on Friday, keeping alive market expectations for a near-term interest rate hike. But the increase was driven mostly by stubbornly high food costs with service-sector inflation staying modest, a sign companies were slow in passing through rising labour costs. The data followed the Bank of Japan's decision on Thursday to keep interest rates steady at 0.5 per cent that drew two dissenters from the board fretting about broadening inflationary pressure. The Tokyo core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 2.8 per cent in October from a year earlier, data showed on Friday, exceeding market forecasts for a 2.6 per cent gain and accelerating from a 2.5 per cent gain in September. A separate index for Tokyo that strips away both fresh food and fuel costs - closely watched by the BOJ as a measure of domestic demand-driven prices - rose 2.8 per cent in October from a year earlier after a 2.5 per cent increase in September. The increase was driven partly by a 38.4 per cent rise in the price of Japan's staple rice and an end to subsidies for water fees. Food inflation, excluding prices for volatile fresh food, stood at 6.7 per cent in October, slowing from 6.9 per cent in September, the data showed. Services inflation, at 1.6 per cent in October, was roughly steady from 1.5 per cent in September and much slower than a 4.1 per cent gain in goods prices, the data showed. \"Core consumer inflation is expected to slow as the effects of food price rises dissipate,\" said Masato Koike, senior economist at Sompo Institute Plus. \"While we expect the BOJ to raise interest rates in January, further hikes could become difficult,\" he said. The BOJ has stressed the need to see inflation driven more by solid demand and wage gains, rather than the push from raw material costs, to resume interest rate hikes. The BOJ exited a decade-long, radical stimulus programme last year and raised short-term interest rates to 0.5 per cent in January on the view Japan was on the cusp of sustainably hitting its 2 per cent inflation target. While consumer inflation has exceeded the BOJ's 2 per cent target for well over three years, Governor Kazuo Ueda has stressed the need to tread cautiously in further rate hikes on uncertainty over the impact of U.S. tariffs on Japan's economy. In a sign companies are weathering the hit from tariffs for now, separate data released on Friday showed Japan's factory output rose 2.2 per cent in September from the previous month, exceeding market forecasts for a 1.6 per cent gain. The jobless rate in September was unchanged from the previous month at 2.6 per cent, government data showed.",

            "description": "SEOUL :SK Innovation Co Ltd, owner of South Korea's top refiner SK Energy, on Friday said refining margins are expected to remain resilient in the fourth quarter amid global supply disruptions and the onset of the winter peak demand season. The company posted an operating profit of 573 billion won ($403.10 million) for the July-September period, versus a 423 billion won loss a year earlier. That compared with an average analyst forecast of 304 billion won profit. Third-quarter revenue rose 16.3 per cent to 20.5 trillion won from the same period a year earlier. SK On, which supplies batteries to Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen, Hyundai Motor among others widened its operating loss to 124.8 billion won in the third quarter from 66.4 billion won loss in the previous quarter, hurt by slowing EV battery shipments. SK Innovation said in a statement that its battery unit's third-quarter performance was hurt by lower battery sales, affected by the phase-out of subsidies for battery-powered vehicles in the United States. In September, SK On signed a deal with U.S.-based Flatiron Energy Development to supply lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for energy storage systems (ESS), marking its first order for LFP batteries to use in ESS. SK's deal echoes a trend among EV battery makers expanding into energy storage as a hedge against slow EV battery demand. SK On's cross-town rival LG Energy Solution on Thursday said it expects U.S. EV battery sales to decline this year from a year ago. Shares in SK Innovation were trading up 0.2 per cent, versus the benchmark KOSPI's 0.3 per cent rise, after the company's earnings announcement. ($1 = 1,421.4800 won)",

            "description": "BEIJING: China's factory activity shrank for a seventh straight month in October, official data showed on Friday (Oct 31), as trade uncertainty ahead of talks between President Xi Jinping and US leader Donald Trump weighed on the economic powerhouse. The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index - a key measure of industrial health - came in at 49.0, marking another contraction, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The reading missed a forecast of 49.6 by a Bloomberg survey of economists and was down 0.8 percentage points from the previous month. Manufacturing in October slowed \"due to factors such as ... the more complex international environment\", said NBS statistician Huo Lihui in a statement. Huo also attributed part of the slowdown to China's Golden Week National Day holiday this month, a period that usually sees slower factory activity. The country's overall economic output \"remained generally stable\", he added. October's reading equalled the lowest level of factory activity this year, matching the 49.0 figure in April. That month kicked off a streak of contraction as factories dealt with ebbs and flows of a US-China trade war. \"The economic momentum has weakened\" since the middle of the year, wrote economist Zhiwei Zhang of Pinpoint Asset Management. But after negotiations with the US \"went successfully ... I think the macro policy in China will stay unchanged for the rest of this year\", he said.The leaders of the world's two largest economies met on Thursday in South Korea for high-stakes trade talks. Trump said he would halve a 20 per cent tariff on Chinese goods and Xi agreed to suspend certain export restrictions on the key rare-earth sector for one year. China would also resume purchases of US soybeans after orders came to a halt this harvest season, according to Trump. Meanwhile, the non-manufacturing PMI, which measures activity in sectors including services and construction, ticked up to 50.1 in October from 50.0 in September, marking a slight expansion on par with a Bloomberg forecast.",

Currently, it has three brands - full-service flight operator ANA, low-cost carrier Peach, as well as AirJapan, which operates as a hybrid carrier. The restructuring will consolidate ANA Group's flight operations into two brands - its namesake airline and Peach. \"This decision is aimed at maximising the entire group's profitability and competitiveness while flexibly responding to recent changes in the business environment,\" said ANA Group. It cited concerns about global developments such as the war in Ukraine and aircraft delivery delays , and added that it is also managing the aircraft on the ground (AOG) situation involving its Boeing 787 aircraft. AOG is an aviation term for planes that are unable to fly due to technical, mechanical or maintenance issues. \"To optimise the allocation of the group's resources, ANA Group decided to suspend the Air Japan brand. Its aircraft and human resources will be consolidated into the ANA brand's operations to expand its international business,\" it said. Air Japan had said on Sep 4 that it would ramp up its schedule with daily Singapore-Tokyo flights from Nov 21 due to the addition of another aircraft to its fleet. It also touted its \" well-priced\" one-way fares starting at S$226 (US$174).",

            "description": "BEIJING: China's factory activity shrank for a seventh month in October, an official survey showed on Friday (Oct 31), keeping alive calls for further stimulus to boost domestic demand, with efforts to ship goods abroad merely exporting price wars. The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 49.0 in October from 49.8 in September, a six-month low, the National Bureau of Statistics' survey showed on Friday. It remained below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction, and missed a median forecast of 49.6 in a Reuters poll. The non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI), which includes services and construction, rose to 50.1 from 50.0 in September. \"Economic momentum has weakened since the middle of the year. The property sector slowdown continues to put pressure on domestic demand,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. \"The fiscal stance has not changed significantly to offset such downward pressure.\" The prolonged slump comes as manufacturers struggle to mount a sustained recovery in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic and a costly trade war with US President Donald Trump forces factory owners to give up on the world's top consumer market. Producers are also having difficulty making ends meet in new markets, with exporters increasingly selling at a loss in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. The PMI, a sentiment-based survey, has at times presented a gloomier picture of the economy than the hard data, with September's industrial output and profit figures showing growth for a third and second consecutive month, respectively. But analysts warn those gains were likely distorted by a push from China's large, state-owned firms. \"Given that we are actually seeking a bit more stimulus in the fourth quarter - investment driven by policy financing tools and new government bonds - I am a bit surprised by the drop in the PMI reading this month,\" said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. China's economic growth slowed to 4.8 per cent in the third quarter, its weakest pace in a year. While that keeps the world's second-largest economy on track to meet its target of roughly 5 per cent this year, it raises questions about Beijing's reliance on external demand amid mounting trade tensions. The ruling Communist Party pledged to boost domestic consumption following a four-day closed-door meeting last week that outlined economic and policy objectives for the next five years, while also emphasising efforts to strengthen its vast industrial system. However, analysts question whether Beijing has anything new to offer or is simply reaching for its usual playbook of channeling resources to large firms while bypassing private producers and households. Some analysts believe Beijing doesn't need more stimulus this year, while others see speeding up infrastructure investment as a way to ensure the economy remains on target in the fourth quarter. That does little to ease longer-term concerns over Beijing's ability to rebalance an economy in which household consumption trails global averages by about 20 per centage points of GDP. \"The stimulus will be just enough to reach the full-year target, and to not make any indicators look too bad leading up to the beginning of the fifteenth five-year plan period,\" said Dan Wang, director for China at Eurasia Group. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast the private-sector RatingDog PMI to come in at 50.9 on Monday, down from 51.2 a month prior.",

The affected Disney networks include ESPN, ABC, FX, Nat Geo, Nat Geo Wild, Disney Channel, ABC News Live and others. A source told Reuters that Disney's channels were removed from YouTube ahead of the contract lapsing. YouTube TV issued its statement on X at 11:16 pm ET on Thursday, while the deal was originally set to expire only at midnight. YouTube TV, one of the largest pay-TV distributors in the U.S., has been locked in a series of negotiations this year with firms threatening to pull their media networks from the platform. Earlier this month, the company, after a difficult negotiation period, struck a deal with Comcast-owned NBCUniversal to keep NBC shows such as \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" on YouTube TV. The platform also struck similar deals with Fox and Paramount earlier this year after difficult contract negotiations. YouTube TV, which has over 10 million subscribers, said Disney's proposed offer terms would raise prices for its subscribers and benefit Disney's own live TV services such as Hulu + Live TV, while Disney accused YouTube of being unwilling to pay fair rates. \"Our contract with Disney has reached its renewal date, and we'll not agree to terms that disadvantage our members while benefiting Disney's TV products,\" YouTube TV said in a post on social media platform X. A Disney spokesperson said the company was committed to working toward a resolution as quickly as possible. \"With a $3 trillion market cap, Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we've successfully negotiated with every other distributor,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. YouTube TV will offer its subscribers a $20 credit if the Disney networks remain unavailable on the platform for an extended period of time. The pay-TV platform had dropped Spanish-language network Univision last month after a failed contract deal.",

            "description": "TOKYO :The Bank of Japan's cautious governor has dropped unusually hawkish hints of an interest rate hike in December or January next year, with the timing likely swayed not just by wage momentum but by moves in the yen. The central bank kept interest rates steady at 0.5 per cent on Thursday as expected, but Governor Kazuo Ueda said the likelihood of its baseline scenario materialising has heightened - language he had used in the past to signal a rate hike was imminent. While warning of lingering global uncertainties, the board revised up this year's growth forecast and made few tweaks to its sanguine view of Japan's recovery prospects in a quarterly report released after the meeting. As was the case before the BOJ's previous rate hike in January, Ueda also elaborated on the triggers for action with an emphasis on the \"initial momentum\" of next year's wage negotiations. \"Ueda's remarks ... contained many signals that, barring major shocks in the U.S. economy or markets, the probability of a near-term rate hike is rising,\" said Takeshi Yamaguchi, chief Japan economist at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities. \"Given Ueda's use of the term 'initial momentum,' we think it is unlikely the BOJ will wait until March wage results,\" said Yamaguchi, who predicts a rate hike in December. MORE DATA TO COME More data will be available by the BOJ's upcoming policy meeting on December 18-19 that would provide hints to next year's wage outlook, including corporate earnings reports and the central bank's \"tankan\" business survey due on December 15. Already, Japan's largest labour union group said it would seek wage hikes of 5 per cent or more in 2026, aiming for bumper pay raises for the fourth straight year despite external headwinds. There could also be early hints on how automakers - a sector Ueda said he was paying particular attention to - set wages as they face the hit from U.S. tariffs. Last year, labour unions at major automakers set pay hike targets in December. Ueda may also heed to mounting pressure from within his nine-member board to act sooner rather than later. Two board members repeated their proposal, made in September, to hike rates to 0.75 per cent, on Thursday. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has recently chimed in, urging the government of new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who is known as an advocate of loose monetary policy, to allow the BOJ to raise rates and avoid excessive yen declines. \"A hawkish bloc has solidified within the BOJ policy board\" with the hawks having \"an external advocate pushing for monetary tightening\" in Bessent, said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, who predicts a rate hike in December. \"As a new prime minister, it may even be advantageous for Takaichi to get the rate hike out of the way early on in her tenure,\" he added. YEN COMPLICATES TIMING To be sure, the BOJ may opt to play it safe by waiting until its January 22-23 meeting, as most big manufacturers firm up wage plans at the start of the year, some analysts say. By then, there will be more clarity on the Takaichi administration's budget plans and economic policies. The BOJ, too, can offer a more thorough analysis justifying a rate hike in a quarterly report due after the January meeting. In the end, however, the timing may depend much on yen moves as a renewed slide in the currency would push up import costs and broader inflation, some analysts say. The yen fell to a nearly nine-month low against the dollar on Thursday despite Ueda's hawkish comments. Data on Friday showed core consumer inflation in Japan's capital, a leading indicator of nationwide trends, perked up in October and remained above the central bank's 2 per cent target. Further rises in the cost of living would run counter to Takaichi's pledge to cushion households' blow from inflation. Former BOJ executive Akira Otani expects the BOJ to hike rates in January, when enough data becomes available on whether companies will weather the tariff hit and keep hiking pay. But he cites the yen as potentially changing the timing. \"At present, we don't see a strong chance of a December rate increase,\" said Otani, currently managing director at Goldman Sachs Japan. \"But the possibility could heighten if yen falls accelerate and increase the risk of inflation overshooting the BOJ's baseline forecast made in October.\"",

            "description": "JAKARTA :South Korea's Hyundai Motor is interested in participating in Indonesia's plan to develop its own national car, Indonesia's economic ministry said on Friday. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto said on October 20 that Indonesia was planning to fully manufacture its own national car in the next three years, with a budget already allocated and land prepared for the factories. Indonesian Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said in a statement the South Korean automaker had expressed \"strong interest\" in participating during talks between himself and Hyundai Motor Group President Sung Kim on Thursday in Gyeongju, South Korea. Airlangga provided no details and Hyundai Motor did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hyundai Motor is the world No.3 automaker by sales along with its affiliate Kia Corp. It already operates an auto manufacturing plant in the Indonesian province of West Java. Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution last year inaugurated Indonesia's first battery cell production plant for electric vehicles, with an annual capacity of 10 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery cells.",
