            "description": "LONDON :Mercuria is shipping more than 30,000 metric tons of aluminium from Port Klang in Malaysia to New Orleans, three sources familiar with the matter said, adding that the commodity trader probably needed the metal for its U.S. customers. The metal is coming from London Metal Exchange approved warehouses in Port Klang, the sources said, where aluminium stocks at 268,325 metric tons as of October 29 are down 74,700 tons or 22 per cent since September 22. Mercuria's shipment of aluminium to the United States is part of a wider strategic push into industrial metals, as the trader seeks to diversify beyond its traditional energy business, industry sources said. Reuters reported Mercuria's plans to take large amounts of aluminium from LME storage on September 16. Mercuria is sending the aluminium it has taken from LME warehouses in Port Klang to the United States on a vessel named Astro Denebola, the sources familiar with the matter said. Swiss-based Mercuria declined to comment. According to data provider Kpler, the Astro Denebola carrying 32,000 tons of aluminium left Port Klang on October 24 and is due to arrive in New Orleans on December 9. Industry sources said most of the aluminium on warrant - a title document conferring ownership - stored in the LME's warehouses in Port Klang is of Indian origin. Some of the metal stored in the exchange's warehouses in Port Klang was produced in Russia, the industry sources said. Western consumers have shunned Russian aluminium since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. With its local primary aluminium industry in decline for years, the U.S. relies on imports of large amounts of unwrought aluminium and alloys - more than 3.9 million tons last year, according to U.S. government data. Aluminium is a key material for the power, construction and packaging industries. Mercuria has for much of the time since May held more than 90 per cent of LME aluminium warrants - title documents conferring ownership, industry sources said. This holding, they said, is behind the premium for nearby aluminium contracts on the LME over those with longer maturities. The LME does not publish names of companies with large holdings of its metal warrants.",

            "description": "Roblox on Thursday raised its annual bookings forecast for the third time this year on the back of strong in-game spending on viral titles such as \"Steal a Brainrot\" that also helped it surpass 150 million daily active users. Shares of the gaming platform rose over 5 per cent in premarket trading. Over the past few years, Roblox has been trying to expand the platform into a hub for socialization, advertising and ecommerce while also investing heavily into the core gaming segment. The strategy has made it one of the biggest winners in the videogame industry, with shares having more than doubled this year. Roblox's 70 per cent increase in average daily active users — a key engagement metric — represents the company's biggest third-quarter jump in around five years. \"Steal a Brainrot,\" a game where players collect characters based on viral internet culture, surpassed 25 million concurrent players in earlier this month, eclipsing \"Grow a Garden.\" CFO Naveen Chopra told Reuters he attributes the success of these games to investments into the search and discovery algorithm, capacity infrastructure and incentives for developers to spur gamemaking. \"The ability to handle multiple games with more than 20 million concurrent users, like that's never been done before . .. and so these hits could not have gone that viral without that kind of infrastructure,\" he said. Roblox now expects fiscal 2025 bookings worth between $6.57 billion and $6.62 billion, compared with its prior forecast of between $5.87 billion and $5.97 billion. It forecast fourth-quarter bookings worth between $2 billion and $2.05 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $1.80 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Bookings for the third quarter came in at $1.92 billion, beating expectations of $1.65 billion.",

            "description": "Google will offer 18-month free access to its Gemini AI service for all 505 million telecom users of India's Reliance Jio, a tie-up that follows similar freebies from rivals including OpenAI to boost adoption in the world's most populous nation. The move also comes weeks after Google committed to invest $15 billion in AI infrastructure capacity in India, its biggest investment yet in the critical South Asian market. AI apps have exploded in popularity in recent months in India, prompting authorities this month to propose sweeping rules for AI and social media firms to clearly label AI-generated content to tackle the spread of deepfakes and misinformation. MIRRORING THE STREAMERS' PLAYBOOK With nearly 1 billion internet users, India has been a go-to market for global tech firms to boost their subscriber base and harvest data for improving their services. The Gemini offer will give Jio users free access to the advanced model of the AI app, two terabytes of cloud storage, and its image and video generation models, in an 18-month offering that is otherwise priced at 35,100 rupees ($399). The companies on Thursday also announced AI partnerships that targeted Indian businesses. The free AI plan rollout will begin with early access for 18-to-25-year-old users on certain telecom plans, and will expand to include every Jio customer nationwide \"in the shortest time possible,\" Reliance said in a statement. Google already offers Gemini AI Pro free for a year for students in India, while rival Perplexity is offering free access to its premium plan to Indian users through a tie-up with mobile carrier Bharti Airtel. On Tuesday, OpenAI too offered year-long free access to its ChatGPT Go plan to users in India starting November. Such moves mirror the early playbook of streaming firms to boost adoption in India, when the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime partnered with telecom players to bundle their paid offerings with monthly data plans.

            "description": "Mastercard beat Wall Street expectations for third-quarter profit on Thursday, as sustained consumer spending boosted its payment volumes. Consumer spending has proven resilient, while labor market cracks and sticky inflation continue to fuel concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's trade and immigration policies. Mastercard's earnings round off the earnings season for card companies, which are closely tracked by Wall Street to gauge consumer health. Due to their expansive share of global everyday transactions, card networks run by Mastercard and Visa are widely perceived as shielded from a potential payments slowdown. Rival Visa also beat quarterly profit expectations earlier this week, while American Express' focus on wealthy customers helped it rake in record revenue during the third quarter. The company reported adjusted profit of $3.96 billion, or $4.38 per share, for the quarter ended September 30. Analysts, on average, were expecting a profit of $4.32 per share, according to data compiled by LSEG. Mastercard's net revenue rose 17 per cent to $8.6 billion in the quarter from a year earlier. A bottleneck of Federal data due to the U.S. government shutdown has added uncertainty to the consumer outlook at a time when private data suggests plummeting consumer sentiment and a widening rift between lower-income and affluent consumers. Mastercard's value-added services and solutions business, which now makes up more than a third of the company's business, fetched 25 per cent higher revenue in the quarter. The company has diversified its revenue streams to leverage the burgeoning demand for threat intelligence and fraud reduction via value-added services. Cross-border volume, which tracks spending on cards outside the country of their issue, jumped 15 per cent on a local currency basis. Shares of the Purchase, New York-based card network giant fell marginally before the bell.",

Katayama was referring to comments she made in an interview with Reuters in March, when the veteran upper house lawmaker said she believed levels of 120 to 130 against the dollar were \"seen as the value reflecting Japan's economic strength\". Katayama's comments in March were made when the yen had fallen to around 150 against the dollar. The yen was most recently trading at 154.20 per dollar, having fallen after the Bank of Japan decided to keep interest rates unchanged. \"It's always been the case that markets' movements are often unrelated to real demand,\" she said on Thursday. \"What the Japanese government can do is to steer the fundamentals onto a sound and reasonable growth path, while also maintaining Japan's credibility,\" she added. She also said she believes the Bank of Japan's decision to keep interest rates steady on Thursday was \"extremely reasonable in light of overall current economic conditions\".",

            "description": "Top technology companies hit fresh valuation milestones in October, as their shares climbed on expectations of robust demand for AI chips and computing infrastructure driven by the artificial intelligence boom. Nvidia’s shares jumped nearly 11 per cent over the past month, adding about $500 billion in market value as it became the first company to reach a $5 trillion valuation. Chief Executive Jensen Huang this week announced $500 billion in AI chip orders and plans to build seven supercomputers for the U.S. government.   Tech shares have risen sharply on optimism over AI’s potential and a series of partnerships and deals with major global companies, including OpenAI, Oracle, Nokia and drugmaker Eli Lilly. Microsoft and Apple also reached $4 trillion market valuations by end-October, just over three months after Nvidia’s surge to that level in July.     Microsoft reported record capital spending of nearly $35 billion for its fiscal first quarter on Wednesday and said it expects investments to rise further this year Broadcom gained 17 per cent over the past month to reach a $1.82 trillion valuation, while TSMC added 15 per cent to $1.28 trillion and Alphabet climbed 13 per cent to $3.32 trillion. The market value-to-capital expenditure ratio for semiconductor firms stood at 75.1, the highest among all global sectors, suggesting investors expect strong returns from the heavy AI-related spending by chipmakers. The market values of Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase and Tencent Holdings fell 5.4 per cent, 3.1 per cent and 2.5 per cent over the past month to $1.03 trillion, $840 billion and $760 billion, respectively.",

The move marks the second foiled attempt by CoreWeave to scoop up Core Scientific, with the crypto miner also rejecting a June 2024 all-cash buyout offer. CoreWeave had struck an all-stock deal worth $9 billion to buy Core Scientific in July, as part of its push to secure the energy and data center capacity needed to power surging demand. Soon after, Two Seas Capital, which claims to be the largest active shareholder of Core Scientific, said it would vote against the deal, citing concerns with the sale process, deal structure, and valuation. It said the fixed exchange ratio left Core Scientific shareholders vulnerable to fluctuations in the price of CoreWeave shares. Core's board had urged its shareholders to vote for the sale saying the combined company would benefit from several potential cost savings and synergies. Last week, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services also recommended investors vote against the deal, suggesting Core Scientific should continue going alone given its considerable success as a standalone company. \"We respect the views of Core Scientific stockholders and look forward to continuing our commercial partnership,\" said Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO and co-founder. Core Scientific shares fell 3.4 per cent in early trading, while CoreWeave was down nearly 5 per cent.",

Robinson surged more than 20 per cent to a record high on Thursday as investors cheered the global freight forwarder's quarterly profit beat due to AI-driven efficiencies at a time when the rest of the logistics sector has struggled. The U.S.'s largest freight broker has been using artificial intelligence to automate tasks such as generating shipping quotes, scheduling pickups and deliveries and tracking shipments. This has helped speed up its operations and reduce reliance on manual work. \"We believe that CHRW's scale and first mover advantage will allow for continued productivity and share gains in the coming years, and management has shown its operating model is differentiated,\" Stephens analyst Reed Seay said in a note. The company's adjusted profit of $1.40 per share for the quarter beat analysts' average estimate of $1.30, according to data compiled by LSEG. The beat was helped by a 12.6 per cent decline in operating expenses from a year ago. The company's employee headcount was down 10.8 per cent. \"The transition to agentic AI to complement the large productivity improvements already enacted by generative AI, give management confidence to line-of-sight cost takeout and further margin improvement, even without market help,\" Evercore ISI analyst Jonathan Chappell said. C.H. Robinson managed to grow shipment volumes in both its truckload and less-than-truckload segments, helping its North American Surface Transportation segment post a 1.1 per cent rise in revenue. Meanwhile, the U.S. freight industry has been facing subdued volumes, while excess capacity has kept rates under pressure. The trend has forced logistics firms to tighten spending and operate with greater discipline. C.H. Robinson's shares trade at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.49, compared with the industry median of 16.32.",

            "title": "An October to remember for bruised global bond markets",
            "description": "LONDON :The mood music in some of the world's biggest bond markets has shifted in October as concerns about hefty borrowing and sticky inflation ebb, prompting a rush back to the likes of British, German and Japanese debt.  UK government bonds, or gilts, battered earlier this year by fiscal concerns, have led the way. Ten and 30-year borrowing costs have fallen around 30 basis points each, set for their biggest monthly drops since late 2023, as their prices jumped. Bond yields in Germany and even strife-laden France are set for their biggest monthly fall since April, when U.S. tariff turmoil bolstered safe-haven debt. Japanese 30-year yields are set for the biggest monthly drop since August 2024 as fiscal concerns around Japan's new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, ease. A trend of high government borrowing and lofty debt levels is nonetheless expected to keep markets on their toes. Yields in some markets have edged off multi-month lows in recent days as trade tensions, which helped the bond rally, show signs of easing. Still, October's moves suggest pressure is abating - a relief for Britain as a key budget looms, and France which is beset by political turbulence. \"It's been a bit of a surprise for markets everywhere, that inflation hasn't picked up as much as people would have thought a month or two ago and that's helped push bond yields down,\" said Mike Riddell, lead portfolio manager for strategic bond strategies at Fidelity International. Inflation coming in lower than expected in both Britain and the U.S. has boosted bets on Bank of England rate cuts and cemented expectations for the Federal Reserve. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields are set to end October with a third straight month of falls. Mizuho multi-asset strategist Evelyne Gomez-Liechti said that on top of inflation, a weakening labour market and signs that finance minister Rachel Reeves might increase budgetary headroom and raise taxes had \"created the perfect mix\" for gilts. \"On the long-end, you could argue there's less of a supply pressure,\" she said, referring to Britain issuing less long-dated debt and the Bank of England's decision to skew its bond sales shorter. Fidelity's Riddell said he still liked gilts but had trimmed bullish bets given recent strong price gains. STILL REASONS FOR CAUTION, ANALYSTS SAY In Japan, political uncertainty has declined. The appointment of new finance minister Satsuki Katayama has also helped reassure investor concerns around long-end issuance, said Mizuho's Gomez-Liechti. Last week's robust auction stands out in a year that has seen a string of weak Japanese bond sales. Japan's 30-year bond yields are still up a hefty 80 bps this year. Despite October's recovery, there is reason for caution, analysts said. France's Socialists have threatened to topple the government if their budget conditions are not met, and Britain's budget on November 26 remains a big test for Reeves. Surging German borrowing as fiscal stimulus ramps up and a Dutch pension fund reform that will dent demand for longer-dated bonds from next year are also expected to keep the pressure on European debt. Ross Hutchison, head of euro zone market strategy at Zurich Insurance Group, said bonds were attractive, but risks remained as structural demand was lower than in the past and compensation for inflation risks also remained limited. \"You need a lengthy period of stability in yields before investors are comfortable increasing allocations, especially in long maturity paper.\"",

            "description": "MELBOURNE :BHP, the world's biggest miner, and South Korean steelmaker POSCO said on Thursday that they have signed an agreement to advance the production of \"near zero emissions\" iron, a major step in manufacturing green steel. The iron will be produced at a demonstration plant at POSCO's steelworks in South Korea's portside city of Pohang, using a hydrogen-based production process and an electric smelting furnace. Construction is set to begin soon with commissioning targeted for early 2028. It is slated to have the capacity to make 300,000 metric tons a year. A ton of steel made through a blast furnace, which accounts for the majority of the world's steel production, produces around 2.3 tons of carbon dioxide while the sector accounts for 8 per cent of global emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. In comparison, when crude steel is produced from iron ore without using scrap and with emissions of 0.4 tons of carbon per tonne of crude steel or less, it can be classified as having used \"near zero emissions\" iron. Australia's iron ore is typically too low grade to make green steel without an additional processing step, which could make it less competitive in a lower carbon future than higher grade ores produced in Brazil.",

            "description": "The Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady on Thursday but repeated its pledge to continue increasing borrowing costs if the economy moves in line with its projections, shifting investor focus to the prospect of a hike as soon as December. While the central bank roughly maintained its long-term forecasts, it elaborated on overseas risks that may hurt Japan's recovery in a sign of its focus on growth concerns. Following are excerpts from BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's comments at his post-meeting news conference, which was conducted in Japanese, as translated by Reuters: IMPACT OF TRADE POLICIES \"There are various risks to the outlook. In particular, there remains high uncertainty on the impact of trade policies on overseas economic and price developments.\" PROJECTIONS \"Our projections so far have not changed much from the previous report in July. The likelihood of our baseline projection materialising is heightening somewhat.\" WAGE AND PRICES \"We would like to spend a bit more time scrutinising wages and price moves. We will have more data on how companies, hit by 15 per cent tariffs, would respond and set wages including for next year. \"We would like to confirm whether wage and prices will gradually rise in tandem.\" INFLATION \"Food inflation is moderating, while underlying inflation is rising moderately. The economy is moving in line with our baseline scenario, so we don't see ourselves as being behind the curve. \"We will continue to scrutinise developments in underlying inflation, and whether food price rises, if they persist, could cause upside or downside risks to the price outlook.\" RATE HIKE \"As for the timing and viability of rate hikes, we don't have any preset idea.\" TAKAICHI ADMINISTRATION \"We will continue to communicate closely with the government.\" U.S. ECONOMY \"AI demand is stronger than expected. The impact of tariffs seems to be delayed significantly. But it could hurt consumption and the economy quite a bit... Even if the tariffs were to affect U.S. consumption, it would come gradually. As such, the risk surrounding the U.S. economy could be smaller than what we expected in April. Still, the government shutdown could affect the economy more than expected, so we'll keep a close eye out on developments.\" BESSENT'S COMMENTS CALLING ON BOJ RATE HIKES \"I won't comment directly. We will craft our economic and price outlook, and adjust the degree of monetary support as the likelihood of our projections heighten.\" DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION \"Wages are rising moderately but high prices mainly for food are weighing on non-durable goods, services and eat-outs. But consumer sentiment is turning up, so we expect consumption to remain resilient. As for the outlook, it will depend on the outcome of next year's wage negotiations.\" NEUTRAL RATE \"Unfortunately, we haven't been able to narrow down the estimated range of Japan's neutral rate given various uncertainties around it.\" BOJ DECISION TO KEEP RATES STEADY TODAY \"Uncertainty surrounding trade policy, and their impact on overseas and U.S. economies may have diminished somewhat. But it's still there. For the time being, we would like to scrutinise a bit more data to gauge how next year's wage negotiations could unfold.\" YEN MOVES \"I can't comment on short-term moves in exchange rates. It's desirable for currency rates to move stably reflecting fundamentals. As for the impact of currency volatility on the economy and prices, we will always scrutinise the impact including the drivers behind exchange-rate moves.\" WHETHER THE BOJ COULD GATHER ENOUGH DATA ON NEXT YEAR'S WAGE OUTLOOK BY ITS NEXT POLICY MEETING IN DECEMBER \"I'm not saying that we need to wait until the final outcome of next year's wage talks becomes available. We want to gather a bit more data on the initial momentum of the talks.\" WHETHER JAPAN'S BUDGET DRAFTING IN DECEMBER COULD PREVENT THE BOJ FROM HIKING RATES IN DECEMBER \"Even if the government is in the process of drafting the budget, we can incorporate what we know into our estimates. As such, it's possible for us to change policy (even when the budget drafting is in process).\" FEASIBILITY OF KEEPING POLICY RATE STEADY WHEN INFLATION EXPECTATIONS CONTINUE TO HEIGHTEN \"We have been placing importance on uncertainty over the impact of U.S. tariffs. But we are always closely watching the impact of falling real interest rates on the economy, and will make an appropriate decision at the next meeting.\" WHETHER THE BOJ COULD RAISE RATES EVEN WHEN PREMIER TAKAICHI OPPOSES HIGHER BORROWING COSTS \"The reason why we kept rates on hold this time is because overseas economic uncertainties remain high, and because we wanted to await a bit more data on whether companies' positive wage-setting behaviour will be sustained. If we are convinced enough, we will raise interest rates. \"Our main focus is on scrutinising the initial momentum of next year's wage talks. But during the course of scrutinising data on that front, we also want to check the U.S. economy does not worsen more than we expect.\" WHETHER DOWNSIDE RISKS TO JAPAN'S ECONOMY HAVE DECLINED \"That's a bit hard to say. The impact of tariffs is being delayed, and could inflict big damage around the final quarter of this year through next year. That's being reflected in our forecasts for fiscal 2026... What we're focusing on in terms of risks to Japan's economy is the initial momentum of next year's wage talks, and whether food inflation will stabilise as we project.\"",
