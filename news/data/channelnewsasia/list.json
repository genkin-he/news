            "description": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 25 : Nvidia may have made its immense fortune on the back of specialized graphics processing units (GPUs) used to power artificial intelligence servers, but CEO Jensen Huang is increasingly professing his love for the more generalist CPU. The CPU, or central processing unit, was for decades traditionally viewed as the main brain of a computer - a product most associated with Intel or sometimes Advanced Micro Devices. Huang is fond of saying that where once 90 per cent of computing used to happen on CPUs and 10 per cent on chips like his, the ratio had flipped in recent years. But the CPU is now making a comeback - increasingly seen as an equivalent if not better option as AI companies shift from training their models to deploying them - a shift that Nvidia plans to be a big part of. \"We love CPUs as well as GPUs,\" Huang said on a call with analysts on Wednesday for the company's fourth-quarter results. He assured them that Nvidia was not only ready for the CPU's return to the spotlight, but also that Nvidia's own CPU offerings for data centers, first released in 2023, would outcompete rivals. Last month, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, Huang also said the number of high-performance Nvidia CPUs being used in data centers would explode and that he wouldn't be surprised \"if Nvidia becomes one of the largest CPU makers in the world.\" THE CPU VERSUS THE GPU CPUs and GPUs have served different computing tasks for decades. CPUs are generalist chips designed to handle any mathematical task a software programmer might throw at the chip at reasonable speed, given the variety of work. GPUs, by contrast, specialize in carrying out a simpler set of mathematical tasks, but doing those simple calculations in parallel thousands of times at once. In video games that meant calculating the value of thousands of pixels on a screen many times a second, and in AI work that means multiplying and adding large matrices of numbers that developers use to represent real-world data such as words and images. AI companies are increasingly deploying \"agents\" that can independently carry out tasks such as writing code, sifting through documents and writing research reports - and that sort of computing \"is happening more and more, and sometimes primarily, on the CPU,\" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. Nvidia's current flagship AI server - called the NVL72 - contains 36 of its CPUs and 72 of its GPUs. Bajarin thinks that could change to a 1 to 1 ratio for so-called agentic work or even that the GPU could be skipped altogether. NVIDIA OUT TO PROVE A POINT Underscoring its CPU ambitions, Nvidia recently announced a deal with Meta Platforms that will see the Facebook owner use large volumes of its Grace and Vera CPU chips on a standalone basis. That's a relatively new development compared to Nvidia's current AI servers where each CPU is accompanied by multiple GPUs. Though it's not that Meta has switched vendors for CPUs - it's just securing more suppliers. Days later, AMD also announced a large deal with Meta that also included its CPUs, which Meta has been buying for years. On the call with analysts, Huang argued that Nvidia had taken a fundamentally different approach to CPUs. He outlined why Nvidia had minimized an approach to breaking up chips into smaller parts that Intel and AMD have used, saying the Nvidia CPU was able to carry out many simple tasks in a row with good access to a lot of computer memory. \"It is designed to be focused on very high data processing capabilities,\" Huang said on the call. \"And the reason for that is because most of the computing problems that we're interested in are data driven - artificial intelligence being one.\" Dave Altavilla, principal analyst at HotTech Vision and Analysis, said Nvidia is aiming to prove that the CPU type once supplied primarily by Intel \"is no longer the assumed default foundation of modern compute infrastructure. Instead, it becomes just one architectural option among several.\" Huang said that Nvidia would have more to disclose about its CPUs at the company's annual developer conference in Silicon Valley next month. ",

            "description": "MUMBAI, Feb 26 : Fears that new artificial intelligence tools could replace large IT services firms are \"overblown\" as clients still need help deploying and scaling the technology, Babak Hodjat, chief AI officer at Cognizant, told Reuters in an interview.  Automated AI tools from startups such as Anthropic have stirred concerns about disruption in the business models of software and services firms globally, including India's traditionally labour-intensive IT services industry. Enterprises are far from being able to rely on a single, all-purpose AI agent, said Hodjat, adding that most clients still need help engineering, integrating, and governing AI systems. \"That mapping is our job, it does not come just automatically out of the box,\" said Hodjat, whose work helped power Apple's Siri voice assistant. Nasdaq-listed Cognizant, which has more than 70 per cent of its workforce operating out of India, forecast annual revenue above Wall Street estimates on the back of strong demand as businesses adopt AI into their workflows. Rivals Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro have also maintained that rapid AI adoption will boost, rather than shrink, demand for software service providers. Hodjat's vote of confidence in the role of services companies comes despite AI-related job cuts already underway. Shipping and logistics management software company WiseTech Global said it would lay off nearly a third of its workforce as it integrates AI into its customer software and internal operations. TCS announced 12,000 job cuts last year, but has since denied to local media that the layoffs were AI-related. Cognizant, which generates about 30 per cent of its code through AI and aims to reach 50 per cent, is not worried about automation eliminating entry-level jobs. CEO Ravi Kumar S said during the company's earnings call earlier this month that it hired 25,000 fresh graduates in 2025, and expects to exceed that in 2026. Almost all of Cognizant's clients have already tried to work with AI agents, Hodjat said, but have acknowledged that they need us to deploy it within their systems for returns.",

            "title": "Schneider beats profit expectations on data center demand",
            "description": "Feb 26 : French industrial group Schneider Electric on Thursday reported stronger-than-expected core earnings, driven by robust data centre demand, and provided 2026 expectations that analysts saw as conservative. The company also announced that its CFO Hilary Maxson would leave the company on April 5 and be replaced by Nathan Fast, who became head of investor relations in January. The Paris-listed stock was up almost 4 per cent to 275 euros by 1015 GMT, its highest price on record. Schneider, once known primarily for industrial components like fuses and circuit breakers, now builds the backbone of data centers, supplying everything from cooling units and server racks to critical power distribution equipment. Data centers and networks account for about 30 per cent of its total orders. While the United States is driving data centres growth, demand in also picking up in Northern European countries and France, \"places where they've put together permitting, electrical connection, with the governments pushing\", Maxson told journalists. The group reported triple-digit year-on-year growth within its pure data centre segment. Quarterly revenues grew organically by 10.7 per cent to 11.10 billion euros ($13.12 billion). Full-year adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation (EBITA) totaled 7.52 billion euros despite pressure from a weakening dollar. Analysts polled by the company expected on average fourth-quarter revenue of 10.90 billions and full-year adjusted EBITA of 7.48 billions. CONSERVATIVE FORECASTS Schneider said it expects organic revenue growth between 7 per cent and 10 per cent and its adjusted EBITA margin growing between 50bps and 80 bps this year, in line with targets it laid out in December. \"I can understand how they want to just set the base at the level that they can be very confident on and then maybe improve as you go through the year\" after the abrupt CFO change and risks such as tariffs and pricing, UBS analysts Andre Kukhnin said. JP Morgan also described the guidance as \"suitably beatable\". The group, which makes over a third of its revenues in North America, said it expected a foreign exchange impact of between 850 and 950 million euros on its 2026 revenues, after currency fluctuations reduced its fourth-quarter revenues by 701 million euros due to a weakening dollar, Indian Rupee and Chinese Yuan. Schneider sees an impact from import tariffs, including in the U.S., of \"a little bit less than double\" the incremental 160 million euros reported for 2025, Maxson said. It is the latest company to provide bullish expectations for AI demand this year, following upbeat comments by chipmaker Nvidia overnight. ($1 = 0.8462 euros)",

            "title": "Deliveroo's Singapore exit may lead to higher fees, fewer discounts, analysts say",
            "description": "SINGAPORE: Deliveroo’s exit from Singapore could gradually translate into higher delivery fees, fewer promotions and steeper commissions for eateries as the market shifts to two major players, although consumers may not feel the impact immediately. After Deliveroo's last day of service on Mar 4, Grab and Foodpanda will be the two major food delivery platforms in Singapore. Analysts said the transition is unlikely to cause immediate disruption and may even spark a brief burst of competition as the remaining platforms compete for Deliveroo's merchants and users. This could lead to lower prices initially, said Associate Professor Seshan Ramaswami, who teaches marketing at Singapore Management University (SMU). However, the longer-term outlook may be less favourable. Analysts said the market would resemble a duopoly, with Grab expected to command a significantly larger share. \"Both platforms are likely to reduce subsidies, raise delivery fees, and/or increase commissions; for example, slower voucher intensity and higher basket-level fees,\" National University of Singapore's (NUS) Professor of Marketing Jochen Wirtz said. NUS Assistant Professor Tiffany Tsai, who is in the Department of Economics, said that if the two continue to compete aggressively on delivery speed, service quality and merchant selection, they may maintain \"relatively high promotional intensity and keep fees in check\".  \"In that case, the overall impact on consumers may be limited,\" she added. On whether an eventual monopoly may arise, Prof Wirtz said this was unlikely unless a merger occurred, which would then be scrutinised by competition authorities. But Asst Prof Tsai said that an effective monopoly may become a concern if one of the remaining competitors is unable to \"meaningfully constrain pricing or commission levels over time, or to maintain sufficient scale and a multi-category ecosystem to discipline the largest platform\".  Observers said the short-term impact on businesses is expected to be limited, but reduced competition could weaken their bargaining power, potentially leading to higher commission rates sought by platforms.  Similarly, delivery riders who switch platforms could result in stronger competition for orders, Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) Assistant Professor Lee Wee Kiat said.  Over the longer term, reduced platform competition may weaken riders’ bargaining power, with possible shifts away from sign-up bonuses and surge incentives that were previously used to attract and retain riders, said Asst Prof Tsai. Platforms may shift towards more performance-based pay structures, she said.WHY DELIVEROO STRUGGLED Deliveroo entered Singapore in 2015 to a highly competitive food delivery landscape . Analysts CNA spoke to noted the difficulties of Singapore's market for a subscale competitor like Deliveroo. \"Delivery platforms are fundamentally density-driven businesses, where the profitability depends on having high order volume within the same area and time window to keep costs low,\" said NTU's Asst Prof Lee, who is from the Nanyang Business School's College of Business. \"In a geographically compact and highly competitive market like Singapore, where two platforms already hold significant scale, it is difficult for a smaller player to build and sustain an advantage in the same area.\" NUS' Prof Wirtz said the market was highly competitive and promotion-heavy, with compressed margins. \"Riders pick the platform that offers a higher pay, and customers pick the platform that has lower costs. Switching between platforms is just a click away,\" he said. Experts pointed out that Grab’s super-app ecosystem - spanning ride-hailing, payments and rewards - allows it to cross-promote across services and generate additional revenue through advertising.  Prof Wirtz pointed out that while Foodpanda was not a super app, it monetised ads and retail media, especially via Pandamart and fast-moving consumer goods brand partnerships. \"Deliveroo had sponsored listings and co-funded promos, but with a smaller audience and fewer surfaces, its ad monetisation was relatively limited,\" he added. Last year, DoorDash acquired Deliveroo with a view to growing its market share in Europe. \"Given Deliveroo’s limited growth trajectory in Singapore, it is likely that the market was not considered a strategic priority within DoorDash’s broader global portfolio,\" said Asst Prof Tsai from NUS. SMU's Assoc Prof Ramaswami noted that the industry could be entering a slower growth phase following the pandemic-era surge in demand, and may even decline. Challenges remain even with only two competitors. They still face headwinds in the form of price-sensitive consumers, rising operating costs, as well as the ongoing challenge of maintaining reliable rider supply and service, NTU's Asst Prof Lee said. Asst Prof Tsai said that the platforms may shift away from simple user acquisition, and that it was no longer sufficient for a platform to maintain market share in food delivery alone. \"Platforms increasingly rely on ecosystem bundling (eg integrating delivery with ride-hailing, payments, subscriptions, or loyalty programmes) to retain users, increase order frequency, and improve overall unit economics,\" she said. \"In such a mature market, profitability, customer retention, and ecosystem integration become more important than the rapid expansion strategies observed in the earlier growth phase.\" Assoc Prof Ramaswami raised the possibility of new entrants who may see an opportunity to differentiate themselves from the two remaining players. Other delivery services, such as Lalamove, are also in a position to enter the food delivery market, as they have delivery fleets and the logistics infrastructure.",

            "description": "TOKYO: Toyota plans a large-scale unwinding of strategic shareholdings that would involve banks and insurance firms selling around US$19 billion of its shares, two sources said, in what would mark a watershed moment in Japan's corporate governance reform. The sale will likely total around ¥3 trillion (US$19 billion) but could be larger depending on the willingness of shareholders to sell, the sources said. Toyota aims for the sale to happen as early as this year, although the timing and scale could change depending on shareholders - or the plan could be abandoned, one of the sources said.  Reuters is reporting Toyota's preparations for the first time. Toyota declined to comment. The sources declined to be identified because the information is not public.  Toyota aims to acquire shares through buybacks, the sources said. A secondary sale to other investors has also emerged as an option, one of the sources said. The move by the world's largest automaker would be evidence of the scale of Japan's on-going corporate governance reform. Regulators and the Tokyo Stock Exchange have been encouraging Japanese companies to unwind their cross-shareholdings. The practice, which involves firms holding shares in each other to cement business ties, has long been criticised by governance experts and overseas investors as insulating management from shareholders. Although widespread in Japan for decades, it has been less common in the West.    While Toyota has a policy to cut its cross-shareholdings, it has also come under fire over governance and has faced calls from investors to improve capital efficiency.  Toyota wants to demonstrate its seriousness about governance reform by unwinding the strategic shares, one of the sources said.  The automaker is in the midst of a tender offer for forklift maker Toyota Industries. Activist investor Elliott opposes the deal, arguing it is underpriced and lacks transparency. Toyota has extended the tender offer to March 2 due to insufficient shareholder support. Toyota shareholders include banks such as Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and insurers such as MS&AD Insurance Group.  Japanese banks and insurers have in recent years outlined policies to reduce their cross-shareholdings.",

            "description": "SEOUL, Feb 26 : South Korea's antitrust regulator said on Thursday it has fined Coupang 2.2 billion won ($1.55 million) for pressuring suppliers to cut prices and shoulder additional costs to meet profit margins, as well as for delaying payments to vendors. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) said the e-commerce giant violated the country's large-scale retail business law by demanding reductions in supply prices and requiring suppliers to bear advertising and other fees in order to achieve margin targets set by the company. \"As the overwhelming No.1 market leader, Coupang forced suppliers to bear sacrifices in order to maintain its profit margins and used retaliatory measures such as suspending or reducing orders when suppliers refused or were uncooperative,\" the regulator said in a statement. When suppliers failed to meet targets, Coupang at times negotiated or demanded lower supply prices, and suspended or reduced orders, or implied it would do so to pressure vendors. Coupang also set gross margin targets and required suppliers to bear additional expenses, including advertising fees, fees for its \"Coupang Experience Group\" programme - under which selected customers receive free or discounted products in exchange for posting product reviews - and premium data services. If margins fell short, the company used order cuts or the threat of such action as leverage, it said. In a separate violation, the KFTC said Coupang delayed payments to suppliers in 508,752 direct purchase transactions with 25,715 vendors between October 2021 and June 2024. The total value of delayed payments amounted to about 281 billion won. Coupang, which is due to report fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, faces intensifying competition and regulatory headwinds after last year's massive data breach dented spending and erased nearly 35 per cent of its share price.

            "description": "TOKYO, Feb 26 : Japanese electric motor maker Nidec on Thursday said its founder, Shigenobu Nagamori, has resigned as chairman emeritus, amid an investigation into accounting improprieties involving a Chinese subsidiary. Nidec's announcement comes less than three months since Nagamori resigned as chairman and from the board, after the Tokyo Stock Exchange placed the manufacturer on \"special alert\" in October due to governance concerns. \"At present, Nidec is making headlines over its suspected inappropriate accounting practices, for which I once again deeply apologize to everyone,\" Nagamori, 81, said in a written statement. \"I deeply regret that these suspicions have occurred, feeling that now is the time for me to step down gracefully.\" Nidec submitted a plan to the Tokyo bourse to address its concerns last month. Companies placed on alert have one year to strengthen internal controls or face possible delisting. The manufacturer has yet to release financial results for October–December while a third-party committee and external experts investigate its accounting practices.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : French industrial group Schneider Electric on Thursday reported stronger-than-expected core earnings, driven by robust data centre demand, supporting its 2026 outlook despite pressure from a weakening dollar. The group reported triple-digit year-on-year growth within its pure data centre segment. Quarterly revenues grew organically by 10.7 per cent to 11.10 billion euros ($13.12 billion). Full-year adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation (EBITA) totaled 7.52 billion euros. Analysts polled by the company expected on average fourth-quarter revenue of 10.90 billions and full-year adjusted EBITA of 7.48 billions. While the United States is driving data centres growth, demand in also picking up in Northern European countries and France, the company's CFO Hilary Maxson told media. \"We start to see some unlock of data centers in Europe in places where they've put together permitting, electrical connection, with the governments pushing,\" Maxson said. Schneider, once known primarily for industrial components like fuses and circuit breakers, now builds the backbone of data centers, supplying everything from cooling units and server racks to critical power distribution equipment. Data centers and networks account for about 30 per cent of its total orders. It is the latest company to provide bullish expectations for AI demand this year, after upbeat comments by chipmaker Nvidia and French electrical and digital building infrastructure group Legrand. DATA CENTERS SUPPORT GROWTH Schneider said it expects organic revenue growth between 7 per cent and 10 per cent and its adjusted EBITA margin growing between 50bps and 80 bps this year. That is in line with long-term targets it laid out in December, which guided for average annual organic revenue growth of 7 per cent to 10 per cent and organic adjusted EBITA margin growth of around 250 basis points cumulatively between 2026 and 2030. The group, which makes over a third of its revenues in North America, said it expected a foreign exchange impact of between 850 and 950 million euros on its 2026 revenues, after currency fluctuations reduced its fourth-quarter revenues by 701 million euros due to a weakening dollar, Indian Rupee and Chinese Yuan. The company sees an impact from import tariffs, including in the U.S., of \"a little bit less than double\" the incremental 160 million euros reported for 2025, Maxson said. Maxson will leave the company on April 5 and be replaced by investor relations head Nathan Fast, Schneider said. ($1 = 0.8462 euros)",

Meta and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. Pang oversaw artificial intelligence infrastructure for Meta's Superintelligence Labs, which is developing the company's next generation of AI models. He left Meta last week after being aggressively recruited by OpenAI for several months, the report added. Pang joined Meta last year on a compensation package valued at more than $200 million over several years, according to a Bloomberg report.

            "description": "Feb 25 : Amazon's plan to invest up to $50 billion in OpenAI could depend on whether the AI developer goes public or achieves an artificial general intelligence (AGI) milestone, The Information reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.  Under terms still being negotiated, Amazon would invest $15 billion upfront, with an additional $35 billion contingent on Microsoft-backed OpenAI hitting an AGI milestone or pursuing an IPO, according to the report. Additionally, SoftBank and Nvidia each plan to invest $30 billion in three installments over the year as part of the funding round, the Information added.  Reuters could not immediately verify the report. OpenAI and Amazon did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comments outside regular business hours. OpenAI is laying the groundwork for an IPO that could value the company at up to $1 trillion, Reuters exclusively reported last year. Major tech companies and investors are racing to forge partnerships with OpenAI, which is spending heavily on data centers, betting that closer ties with the artificial-intelligence startup would give them a competitive edge in the AI race. Amazon has been in talks to invest tens of billions of dollars in OpenAI, and the amount could reach $50 billion, a source told Reuters last month.  Investing up to $50 billion could make Amazon the biggest contributor to the AI company's ongoing fundraising round.  ",
