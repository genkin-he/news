Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto said on October 20 that Indonesia was planning to fully manufacture its own national car in the next three years, with a budget already allocated and land prepared for the factories. Indonesian Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said in a statement the South Korean automaker had expressed \"strong interest\" in participating during talks between himself and Hyundai Motor Group President Sung Kim on Thursday in Gyeongju, South Korea. Airlangga provided no details and Hyundai Motor did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hyundai Motor is the world No.3 automaker by sales along with its affiliate Kia Corp. It already operates an auto manufacturing plant in the Indonesian province of West Java. Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution last year inaugurated Indonesia's first battery cell production plant for electric vehicles, with an annual capacity of 10 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery cells.",

            "title": "Commentary: Nvidia’s US$5 trillion valuation redefines what Big Tech means",
            "description": "NEW YORK: On Wednesday (Oct 29), just 112 days after becoming the first US$4 trillion company, Nvidia became the first US$5 trillion company .  It’s worth is more than 8 per cent of the S&P 500, but that’s just the start of it - the AI boost to the markets is built almost entirely off the back of use cases developed on Nvidia chips. The AI strategies of the biggest tech companies, like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and others, rest on their ability to hurriedly acquire and deploy Nvidia’s hardware in their data centres. While some rivals are trying to develop their own alternatives, notes analyst group Wedbush, “there is only one chip in the world fuelling this AI Revolution … and it’s Nvidia.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the man they call the Godfather of AI, has spent this week reassuring the world he is not creating a bubble. On his balance sheet, at least, the money is becoming very real: half a trillion dollars expected in revenue over the next five quarters from bookings for its latest chips.  “This is quite extraordinary,” Huang said of the moment as he sought to emphasise the diversity of businesses Nvidia is powering. These go well beyond the humble chatbot. Its presentations this week have spanned self-driving cars with Uber and Lucid Motors, AI-enhanced cybersecurity with CrowdStrike; pharmaceutical research with Eli Lilly, and an expansion into the nascent but promising realm of quantum computing. FEW ARE FINDING REASON TO BE CAUTIOUS The only blip along the way, if it could even be called that, were fears in September 2024 about the production delays of its latest chip, Blackwell, which triggered a sharp 13 per cent selloff. Then there was the worry that China’s DeepSeek would upend US tech sector spending on hardware. It didn’t, and those fears are long forgotten.  Huang says the company projects it will sell 20 million of its latest chips, more than five times the volume of the previous generation. This doesn’t take into account the possibility that talks on Thursday between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping of China might pave the way for Nvidia’s most sophisticated chips to be sold to China.  The country’s AI companies are eager for better hardware than what its homegrown chipmakers can offer. Current restrictions, which allow only for the sale of older generations of technology, represent the only meek regulatory constraint on Nvidia’s unstoppable rise.  Few are finding reason to be cautious. Concerns about circular financing, in which Nvidia invests in its own customers, do not appear to have altered investment theses. Nor has it dampened Nvidia’s appetite for a deal - the latest being a US$1 billion investment in Nokia , announced this week.  If Wall Street wanted to look for potential headwinds to Nvidia’s progress, they would start with its reliance on Taiwan - where most of the latest chips are produced - or in the lingering (though not yet pressing) risk that regulators scrutinise more closely the lock-in between Nvidia’s hardware and its proprietary software for AI development. The overly rash reaction to Blackwell production mishaps last year demonstrated how touchy investors are to any sign of turbulence in Nvidia’s supply chain and logistics.RISKS AND DANGERS More broadly, Nvidia needs the downstream rollout of AI - putting it in the hands of consumers and businesses - to start paying off, otherwise the wild capital expenditures might start getting pulled back. Nvidia is relying on others to actually reach the goal of human-level artificial intelligence that will, some say, make all the investment worthwhile. There was a time when Nvidia was a company responsible for making video games look better. Those carefree days are over.  The market cap milestone is a moment for reflection on how one company came to redefine the meaning of “big” in Big Tech at this moment of seismic change.  Beyond being just a big number, what is truly unprecedented in the Nvidia story is how integral its success is to the entire global economy: an industrial revolution in which only one company is seen as capable of building the factories. What made Nvidia into a US$5 trillion company is also what makes it a potential US$5 trillion single point of failure.",

            "description": "Strategy posted a profit in the third quarter, compared with a loss a year earlier, as improving sentiment around the cryptocurrency sector benefited the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, sending its shares up nearly 4 per cent after the bell. Until the fourth quarter of 2024, Strategy could only record impairment losses when bitcoin's value fell below its purchase price, while gains from price increases remained unrealized unless the cryptocurrency was sold. U.S. President Donald Trump's focus on the digital asset sector and his pledge to make America the global hub for cryptocurrencies, combined with strong ETF inflows, have helped bitcoin to scale multiple record highs in 2025. Strategy held 640,808 bitcoins as of October 26, at a total cost of $47.44 billion, or $74,032 per bitcoin. The world's biggest cryptocurrency currently trades at around $107,833. Rising bitcoin prices tend to appreciate Strategy's stock, enabling the company to raise additional capital for reinvestment into the cryptocurrency, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. The increase in bitcoin's value lifts net income at Strategy's buy-and-hold treasury model, which has inspired several other companies to adopt similar approaches. Strategy's net profit was $2.78 billion, or $8.42 per share, for the three months ended September 30, compared with a loss of $340.2 million, or $1.72 per share, a year earlier. Shares of the company have lost about 12 per cent so far in 2025, while bitcoin prices have risen 14.5 per cent.",

            "description": "Netflix is actively exploring a bid for Warner Bros Discovery's studio and streaming business, retaining a financial advisor and gaining access to financial information, according to three sources familiar with the matter. The video streaming service has hired Moelis & Co, the investment bank that advised Skydance Media on its successful bid for Paramount Global, to evaluate a prospective offer, two of the sources said. Netflix also has been granted access to the data room, which contains the financial details needed to make a bid, according to two of the sources familiar with the matter. Warner Bros Discovery and Moelis declined to comment. Netflix could not be reached for comment. Owning Warner Bros' studio business would give Netflix control over some of Hollywood's most successful stories and characters, including the Harry Potter and DC Comics franchises. Warner Bros' prolific television studio also produces many of Netflix's hits, including original series like \"Running Point,\" \"You\" and \"Maid.\" HBO and its companion streaming service would add more prestige dramas, and subscribers. Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos told investors last week that while the company is traditionally \"more builders than buyers,\" it does evaluate acquisitions based on criteria such as the size of the opportunity and whether it would strengthen the company's entertainment offerings. Sarandos indicated Netflix would not be interested in acquiring Warner Bros Discovery's cable television networks, which include CNN, TNT, Food Network and Animal Planet. \"We've been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks,\" Sarandos said in the company's third-quarter investor video. \"There is no change there.\" Warner Bros Discovery announced last week that it would begin evaluating options, after receiving a trio of unsolicited offers from Paramount Skydance to acquire the entire company. The company said its board would consider whether to move forward with its planned split, which would separate the Warner Bros film and television studios, HBO and the companion HBO Max streaming service from its television business, or pursue a sale of all or parts of the company. Comcast President Mike Cavanagh told investors on Thursday the company is evaluating media assets that would be \"complementary\" to its existing business. He also appeared to dismiss those who are skeptical of Comcast winning regulatory approval, saying \"more things are viable than maybe some of the public commentary that's out there.\"",

            "description": "TOKYO :Core inflation in Japan's capital accelerated in October and stayed above the central bank's 2 per cent target, data showed on Friday, keeping alive market expectations for a near-term interest rate hike. But the increase was driven mostly by stubbornly high food costs with service-sector inflation staying modest, a sign companies were slow in passing through rising labour costs. The data followed the Bank of Japan's decision on Thursday to keep interest rates steady at 0.5 per cent that drew two dissenters from the board fretting about broadening inflationary pressure. The Tokyo core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 2.8 per cent in October from a year earlier, data showed on Friday, exceeding market forecasts for a 2.6 per cent gain and accelerating from a 2.5 per cent gain in September. A separate index for Tokyo that strips away both fresh food and fuel costs - closely watched by the BOJ as a measure of domestic demand-driven prices - rose 2.8 per cent in October from a year earlier after a 2.5 per cent increase in September. The increase was driven partly by a 38.4 per cent rise in the price of Japan's staple rice and an end to subsidies for water fees. Food inflation, excluding prices for volatile fresh food, stood at 6.7 per cent in October, slowing from 6.9 per cent in September, the data showed. Services inflation, at 1.6 per cent in October, was roughly steady from 1.5 per cent in September and much slower than a 4.1 per cent gain in goods prices, the data showed. \"Core consumer inflation is expected to slow as the effects of food price rises dissipate,\" said Masato Koike, senior economist at Sompo Institute Plus. \"While we expect the BOJ to raise interest rates in January, further hikes could become difficult,\" he said. The BOJ has stressed the need to see inflation driven more by solid demand and wage gains, rather than the push from raw material costs, to resume interest rate hikes. The BOJ exited a decade-long, radical stimulus programme last year and raised short-term interest rates to 0.5 per cent in January on the view Japan was on the cusp of sustainably hitting its 2 per cent inflation target. While consumer inflation has exceeded the BOJ's 2 per cent target for well over three years, Governor Kazuo Ueda has stressed the need to tread cautiously in further rate hikes on uncertainty over the impact of U.S. tariffs on Japan's economy. In a sign companies are weathering the hit from tariffs for now, separate data released on Friday showed Japan's factory output rose 2.2 per cent in September from the previous month, exceeding market forecasts for a 1.6 per cent gain. The jobless rate in September was unchanged from the previous month at 2.6 per cent, government data showed.",

The company posted an operating profit of 573 billion won ($403.10 million) for the July-September period, versus a 423 billion won loss a year earlier. That compared with an average analyst forecast of 304 billion won profit. Third-quarter revenue rose 16.3 per cent to 20.5 trillion won from the same period a year earlier. SK On, which supplies batteries to Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen, Hyundai Motor among others widened its operating loss to 124.8 billion won in the third quarter from 66.4 billion won loss in the previous quarter, hurt by slowing EV battery shipments. SK Innovation said in a statement that its battery unit's third-quarter performance was hurt by lower battery sales, affected by the phase-out of subsidies for battery-powered vehicles in the United States. In September, SK On signed a deal with U.S.-based Flatiron Energy Development to supply lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for energy storage systems (ESS), marking its first order for LFP batteries to use in ESS. SK's deal echoes a trend among EV battery makers expanding into energy storage as a hedge against slow EV battery demand. SK On's cross-town rival LG Energy Solution on Thursday said it expects U.S. EV battery sales to decline this year from a year ago. Shares in SK Innovation were trading up 0.2 per cent, versus the benchmark KOSPI's 0.3 per cent rise, after the company's earnings announcement. ($1 = 1,421.4800 won)",

Currently, it has three brands - full-service flight operator ANA, low-cost carrier Peach, as well as AirJapan, which operates as a hybrid carrier. The restructuring will consolidate ANA Group's flight operations into two brands - its namesake airline and Peach. \"This decision is aimed at maximising the entire group's profitability and competitiveness while flexibly responding to recent changes in the business environment,\" said ANA Group. It cited concerns about global developments such as the war in Ukraine and aircraft delivery delays , and added that it is also managing the aircraft on the ground (AOG) situation involving its Boeing 787 aircraft. AOG is an aviation term for planes that are unable to fly due to technical, mechanical or maintenance issues. \"To optimise the allocation of the group's resources, ANA Group decided to suspend the Air Japan brand. Its aircraft and human resources will be consolidated into the ANA brand's operations to expand its international business,\" it said. Air Japan had said on Sep 4 that it would ramp up its schedule with daily Singapore-Tokyo flights from Nov 21 due to the addition of another aircraft to its fleet.

            "title": "China factory activity shrinks for seventh month, PMI shows",
            "description": "BEIJING: China's factory activity shrank for a seventh month in October, an official survey showed on Friday (Oct 31), keeping alive calls for further stimulus to boost domestic demand, with efforts to ship goods abroad merely exporting price wars. The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 49.0 in October from 49.8 in September, a six-month low, the National Bureau of Statistics' survey showed on Friday. It remained below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction, and missed a median forecast of 49.6 in a Reuters poll. The non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI), which includes services and construction, rose to 50.1 from 50.0 in September. \"Economic momentum has weakened since the middle of the year. The property sector slowdown continues to put pressure on domestic demand,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. \"The fiscal stance has not changed significantly to offset such downward pressure.\" The prolonged slump comes as manufacturers struggle to mount a sustained recovery in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic and a costly trade war with US President Donald Trump forces factory owners to give up on the world's top consumer market. Producers are also having difficulty making ends meet in new markets, with exporters increasingly selling at a loss in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. The PMI, a sentiment-based survey, has at times presented a gloomier picture of the economy than the hard data, with September's industrial output and profit figures showing growth for a third and second consecutive month, respectively. But analysts warn those gains were likely distorted by a push from China's large, state-owned firms. \"Given that we are actually seeking a bit more stimulus in the fourth quarter - investment driven by policy financing tools and new government bonds - I am a bit surprised by the drop in the PMI reading this month,\" said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. China's economic growth slowed to 4.8 per cent in the third quarter, its weakest pace in a year. While that keeps the world's second-largest economy on track to meet its target of roughly 5 per cent this year, it raises questions about Beijing's reliance on external demand amid mounting trade tensions. The ruling Communist Party pledged to boost domestic consumption following a four-day closed-door meeting last week that outlined economic and policy objectives for the next five years, while also emphasising efforts to strengthen its vast industrial system. However, analysts question whether Beijing has anything new to offer or is simply reaching for its usual playbook of channeling resources to large firms while bypassing private producers and households. Some analysts believe Beijing doesn't need more stimulus this year, while others see speeding up infrastructure investment as a way to ensure the economy remains on target in the fourth quarter. That does little to ease longer-term concerns over Beijing's ability to rebalance an economy in which household consumption trails global averages by about 20 per centage points of GDP. \"The stimulus will be just enough to reach the full-year target, and to not make any indicators look too bad leading up to the beginning of the fifteenth five-year plan period,\" said Dan Wang, director for China at Eurasia Group.

            "description": "Netflix on Thursday announced a ten-for-one stock split, making the streaming company's shares more affordable for retail investors. The company said it would issue nine additional shares for each share held after close of trading on Nov 10, adding that the split will make its stock more accessible to employees participating in its stock option program. Trading is expected to begin on a split-adjusted basis at the market open on November 17. The streaming giant, which has benefited from a strong line-up of shows, including the recent success of the animated \"KPop Demon Hunters\", currently has a market capitalization of $461.44 billion, as of Thursday's close. Its shares have risen more than 360 per cent over the past three years, far outpacing media rivals Walt Disney and Comcast . The stock was up about 3 per cent at $1,123.49 in extended trading. This marks Netflix's third stock split since it went public in 2002, with the last one in 2019 that reduced the company's per-share price to about $100 from $700. \"A split will make it easier for small investors to buy in but it doesn't change anything about the company or its attractiveness to institutional investors who drive the market,\" said Ross Benes, senior analyst at EMarketer. Netflix's forward price-to-earnings multiple (P/E), a common benchmark for valuing stocks, is 45.96, compared with Walt Disney's 17.54 and Comcast's 6.89.",
