            "description": "Qantas's chief customer and digital officer ‌Catriona Larritt will step down by the end of December, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Thursday, months after the airline faced one of Australia's biggest cyber breaches in years. In the note to staff, group CEO Vanessa Hudson said Larritt will leave the group to \"pursue external opportunities\".   Larritt has been with the group since 2015 and has worked with the airline's units Jetstar and Freight. She took over her current role in September 2023, and her responsibilities included customer experience, brand, marketing and technology, according to the company website. In July, the airline said more than a million customers had sensitive details such as phone numbers, birth dates or home addresses accessed as part of the cyber breach. After Larritt's departure, corporate affairs chief Danielle Keighery will be responsible for brand and marketing, while risk chief Andrew Monaghan will oversee cyber security, Hudson said. Additionally, chief marketing officer Petra Perry and her team will report to Keighery to help recover the group's brand and reputation. Meanwhile, chief information security officer Matt Biber and his team will report to Monaghan, bringing cyber security and risk to further strengthen governance, Hudson added. ",

            "title": "An October to remember for bruised global bond markets",
            "description": "LONDON :The mood music in some of the world's biggest bond markets has shifted in October as concerns about hefty borrowing and sticky inflation ebb, prompting a rush back to the likes of British, German and Japanese debt.  UK government bonds, or gilts, battered earlier this year by fiscal concerns, have led the way. Ten and 30-year borrowing costs have fallen around 30 basis points each, set for their biggest monthly drops since late 2023, as their prices jumped. Bond yields in Germany and even strife-laden France are set for their biggest monthly fall since April, when U.S. tariff turmoil bolstered safe-haven debt. Japanese 30-year yields are set for the biggest monthly drop since August 2024 as fiscal concerns around Japan's new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, ease. A trend of high government borrowing and lofty debt levels is nonetheless expected to keep markets on their toes. Yields in some markets have edged off multi-month lows in recent days as trade tensions, which helped the bond rally, show signs of easing. Still, October's moves suggest pressure is abating - a relief for Britain as a key budget looms, and France which is beset by political turbulence. \"It's been a bit of a surprise for markets everywhere, that inflation hasn't picked up as much as people would have thought a month or two ago and that's helped push bond yields down,\" said Mike Riddell, lead portfolio manager for strategic bond strategies at Fidelity International. Inflation coming in lower than expected in both Britain and the U.S. has boosted bets on Bank of England rate cuts and cemented expectations for the Federal Reserve. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields are set to end October with a third straight month of falls. Mizuho multi-asset strategist Evelyne Gomez-Liechti said that on top of inflation, a weakening labour market and signs that finance minister Rachel Reeves might increase budgetary headroom and raise taxes had \"created the perfect mix\" for gilts. \"On the long-end, you could argue there's less of a supply pressure,\" she said, referring to Britain issuing less long-dated debt and the Bank of England's decision to skew its bond sales shorter. Fidelity's Riddell said he still liked gilts but had trimmed bullish bets given recent strong price gains. STILL REASONS FOR CAUTION, ANALYSTS SAY In Japan, political uncertainty has declined. The appointment of new finance minister Satsuki Katayama has also helped reassure investor concerns around long-end issuance, said Mizuho's Gomez-Liechti. Last week's robust auction stands out in a year that has seen a string of weak Japanese bond sales. Japan's 30-year bond yields are still up a hefty 80 bps this year. Despite October's recovery, there is reason for caution, analysts said. France's Socialists have threatened to topple the government if their budget conditions are not met, and Britain's budget on November 26 remains a big test for Reeves. Surging German borrowing as fiscal stimulus ramps up and a Dutch pension fund reform that will dent demand for longer-dated bonds from next year are also expected to keep the pressure on European debt. Ross Hutchison, head of euro zone market strategy at Zurich Insurance Group, said bonds were attractive, but risks remained as structural demand was lower than in the past and compensation for inflation risks also remained limited. \"You need a lengthy period of stability in yields before investors are comfortable increasing allocations, especially in long maturity paper.\"",

            "description": "MELBOURNE :BHP, the world's biggest miner, and South Korean steelmaker POSCO said on Thursday that they have signed an agreement to advance the production of \"near zero emissions\" iron, a major step in manufacturing green steel. The iron will be produced at a demonstration plant at POSCO's steelworks in South Korea's portside city of Pohang, using a hydrogen-based production process and an electric smelting furnace. Construction is set to begin soon with commissioning targeted for early 2028. It is slated to have the capacity to make 300,000 metric tons a year. A ton of steel made through a blast furnace, which accounts for the majority of the world's steel production, produces around 2.3 tons of carbon dioxide while the sector accounts for 8 per cent of global emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. In comparison, when crude steel is produced from iron ore without using scrap and with emissions of 0.4 tons of carbon per tonne of crude steel or less, it can be classified as having used \"near zero emissions\" iron. Australia's iron ore is typically too low grade to make green steel without an additional processing step, which could make it less competitive in a lower carbon future than higher grade ores produced in Brazil.",

            "description": "The Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady on Thursday but repeated its pledge to continue increasing borrowing costs if the economy moves in line with its projections, shifting investor focus to the prospect of a hike as soon as December. While the central bank roughly maintained its long-term forecasts, it elaborated on overseas risks that may hurt Japan's recovery in a sign of its focus on growth concerns. Following are excerpts from BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's comments at his post-meeting news conference, which was conducted in Japanese, as translated by Reuters: IMPACT OF TRADE POLICIES \"There are various risks to the outlook. In particular, there remains high uncertainty on the impact of trade policies on overseas economic and price developments.\" PROJECTIONS \"Our projections so far have not changed much from the previous report in July. The likelihood of our baseline projection materialising is heightening somewhat.\" WAGE AND PRICES \"We would like to spend a bit more time scrutinising wages and price moves. We will have more data on how companies, hit by 15 per cent tariffs, would respond and set wages including for next year. \"We would like to confirm whether wage and prices will gradually rise in tandem.\" INFLATION \"Food inflation is moderating, while underlying inflation is rising moderately. The economy is moving in line with our baseline scenario, so we don't see ourselves as being behind the curve. \"We will continue to scrutinise developments in underlying inflation, and whether food price rises, if they persist, could cause upside or downside risks to the price outlook.\" RATE HIKE \"As for the timing and viability of rate hikes, we don't have any preset idea.\" TAKAICHI ADMINISTRATION \"We will continue to communicate closely with the government.\" U.S. ECONOMY \"AI demand is stronger than expected. The impact of tariffs seems to be delayed significantly. But it could hurt consumption and the economy quite a bit... Even if the tariffs were to affect U.S. consumption, it would come gradually. As such, the risk surrounding the U.S. economy could be smaller than what we expected in April. Still, the government shutdown could affect the economy more than expected, so we'll keep a close eye out on developments.\" BESSENT'S COMMENTS CALLING ON BOJ RATE HIKES \"I won't comment directly. We will craft our economic and price outlook, and adjust the degree of monetary support as the likelihood of our projections heighten.\" DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION \"Wages are rising moderately but high prices mainly for food are weighing on non-durable goods, services and eat-outs. But consumer sentiment is turning up, so we expect consumption to remain resilient. As for the outlook, it will depend on the outcome of next year's wage negotiations.\" NEUTRAL RATE \"Unfortunately, we haven't been able to narrow down the estimated range of Japan's neutral rate given various uncertainties around it.\" BOJ DECISION TO KEEP RATES STEADY TODAY \"Uncertainty surrounding trade policy, and their impact on overseas and U.S. economies may have diminished somewhat. But it's still there. For the time being, we would like to scrutinise a bit more data to gauge how next year's wage negotiations could unfold.\" YEN MOVES \"I can't comment on short-term moves in exchange rates. It's desirable for currency rates to move stably reflecting fundamentals. As for the impact of currency volatility on the economy and prices, we will always scrutinise the impact including the drivers behind exchange-rate moves.\" WHETHER THE BOJ COULD GATHER ENOUGH DATA ON NEXT YEAR'S WAGE OUTLOOK BY ITS NEXT POLICY MEETING IN DECEMBER \"I'm not saying that we need to wait until the final outcome of next year's wage talks becomes available. We want to gather a bit more data on the initial momentum of the talks.\" WHETHER JAPAN'S BUDGET DRAFTING IN DECEMBER COULD PREVENT THE BOJ FROM HIKING RATES IN DECEMBER \"Even if the government is in the process of drafting the budget, we can incorporate what we know into our estimates. As such, it's possible for us to change policy (even when the budget drafting is in process).\" FEASIBILITY OF KEEPING POLICY RATE STEADY WHEN INFLATION EXPECTATIONS CONTINUE TO HEIGHTEN \"We have been placing importance on uncertainty over the impact of U.S. tariffs. But we are always closely watching the impact of falling real interest rates on the economy, and will make an appropriate decision at the next meeting.\" WHETHER THE BOJ COULD RAISE RATES EVEN WHEN PREMIER TAKAICHI OPPOSES HIGHER BORROWING COSTS \"The reason why we kept rates on hold this time is because overseas economic uncertainties remain high, and because we wanted to await a bit more data on whether companies' positive wage-setting behaviour will be sustained. If we are convinced enough, we will raise interest rates. \"Our main focus is on scrutinising the initial momentum of next year's wage talks. But during the course of scrutinising data on that front, we also want to check the U.S. economy does not worsen more than we expect.\" WHETHER DOWNSIDE RISKS TO JAPAN'S ECONOMY HAVE DECLINED \"That's a bit hard to say. The impact of tariffs is being delayed, and could inflict big damage around the final quarter of this year through next year. That's being reflected in our forecasts for fiscal 2026... What we're focusing on in terms of risks to Japan's economy is the initial momentum of next year's wage talks, and whether food inflation will stabilise as we project.\"",

            "title": "Tech leaders ramp up AI spending, but Alphabet’s cash flow wins investor favor",
            "description": "Three of the biggest U.S. technology companies flagged plans on Wednesday to accelerate capital spending over the next year but investors were most accepting of Google-parent Alphabet's ability to fund its plans from its cash flow. Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta all announced plans for higher annual capital expenditures as they pour money into chips and data centers. Shares of all three have risen substantially this year on expectations that they will be winners in the AI race, but investors only cheered Alphabet's report as they calculated the costs to each firm of the investments. All three reported stellar revenue growth in their key businesses, but investors pushed Alphabet shares up 7.3 per cent while knocking down Microsoft by 3 per cent and Meta by 7 per cent in premarket trading. A key reason for this, analysts say, is Alphabet's ability to balance its soaring expenses with strong cash flow. \"I would think that comes into play - to have capital spending be a lower percentage of revenue and cash flow. That maybe gives investors more comfort. All the players are ramping up spending pretty dramatically, and there’s been a lot of concern about pressure on free cash flow,\" said Dave Heger, senior equity analyst Edward Jones. Alphabet's capital expenditure of $23.95 billion in the September quarter was 49 per cent of its cash generated from operations. The percentage for Meta, however, is 64.6 per cent, with Microsoft even higher at 77.5 per cent.  \"Ongoing investments in data centers and AI infrastructure is a theme we've seen across Big Tech this earnings season. But unlike some of its peers, Alphabet is more than covering that spend with cash flow, and it's firing on all cylinders,\" said Josh Gilbert, market analyst at eToro. Investors have become wary of AI spending but big tech companies are not detailing exactly how much AI contributes to revenue and profit. With multi-billion-dollar deals being struck across the AI industry, investors are also growing cautious of a web of circular investments. Still, executives were adamant that they had to spend to keep up with demand for AI computing power. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that in the worst-case scenario of over-investing in AI, the company would see \"some loss and depreciation, but we'd grow into that and use it over time.\" Companies with stronger cash flow can afford to invest more aggressively in AI infrastructure because they can tolerate lower returns on those outlays, said Dan Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust. Major cloud computing provider Amazon will offer another piece of the AI investment picture and returns in the tech space when it reports third-quarter earnings on Thursday.",

            "description": "TOKYO :Japan's top nuclear power operator, Kansai Electric Power Co, on Thursday revised its profit forecast for the fiscal year ending next March by 65 billion yen to 360 billion yen ($2.4 billion), as electricity demand growth is boosting sales. Following the profit guidance revision, Kansai, in which U.S. activist investor Elliott has recently become a large minority shareholder, increased its full-year dividend forecast to 75 yen per share from the previously expected 60 yen. Its nuclear capacity factor, which measures how much of the total available nuclear power capacity is actually utilized, was kept unchanged from the previous forecast at around 80 per cent. For the six-month period ended in September, Kansai Electric posted net profit of 233 billion yen, roughly flat with the year-earlier period. In contrast, Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO), which continues compensation payouts after its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station was destroyed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in 2011, saw a net loss of 712.40 billion yen in the same period. TEPCO hopes to reverse the negative profit trend with the restart of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant, Hiroyuki Yamaguchi, TEPCO's representative executive vice president, told a briefing on Thursday. There is no specific timing for a partial restart of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant as TEPCO continues public discussions with the residents of Niigata prefecture where the plant is located, a company presentation showed.

            "description": "TAIPEI :Taiwan's central bank decided unanimously to hold interest rates steady, citing strong economic growth in the tech and AI sectors, while raising concerns about the impact of tariffs on the island's export economy, minutes from the latest board meeting showed on Thursday. In a widely expected move in September, the central bank left the benchmark discount rate unchanged at 2 per cent, a level it has maintained since March 2024. It also raised its economic growth forecast for the year, hailing booming exports, but warned the impact of U.S. tariffs could be damaging enough to prompt a change in monetary policy going forward. One board member, who was not identified in the minutes of last month's meeting, said: \"Taiwan's economy still faces numerous uncertainties in the second half of this year, such as future adjustments to the U.S. tariffs under Section 232.\" Another board member said that inflation might continue on a downward trajectory if the Taiwan dollar strengthens or international oil prices weaken. However, sticky prices on expenses such as dining out and rent, as well as unpredictable weather events such as typhoons, could exert upside pressures on prices. Taiwan's inflation rate - 1.25 per cent in September and its slowest pace in 4-1/2 years - has been much milder than that of economies in Europe and the United States, and its benchmark interest rate has also been correspondingly lower. The central bank - which has 15 members on its board - holds its next quarterly rate-setting meeting in December.",

            "description": "FLORENCE, Italy :The European Central Bank said on Thursday it could launch a pilot of its digital currency in 2027 provided it can secure timely approval from lawmakers for a project it deems vital for the euro zone's financial autonomy. The ECB has presented it as a strategic alternative to private, U.S.-dominated means of payment such as credit cards and stablecoins — a move it says is increasingly important in an era of heightened geopolitical friction, where financial autonomy and resilience are seen as key to safeguarding Europe's economic sovereignty. After four years of study and preparation, the ECB said it was now looking at carrying out a pilot, meaning some transactions in digital euros may be carried out as soon as mid-2027, before a full-scale launch two years later. \"A pilot exercise and initial transactions could take place as of mid-2027,\" the ECB said in a statement. \"The whole Eurosystem should then be ready for a potential first issuance of the digital euro during 2029.\" But this was conditional on European Union lawmakers – who include the European Parliament, Council and Commission – passing legislation providing a basis for the digital euro next year. Securing that has proven difficult, with lawmakers picking up concerns from banks that the digital euro may hollow out their coffers and cost too much to set up. EU governments have claimed a last say on whether a digital currency should be launched at all and how many such euros residents will be able to own. The ECB, which estimates the cost for the industry will be between 4 billion euros ($4.66 billion) and 5.77 billion euros after taking into account savings and synergies, said it would continue to work with legislators.

            "description": "Navan is set to make its Nasdaq debut later on Thursday, after the travel technology company raised $923 million in its listing and successfully navigated a U.S. government shutdown to go public. Momentum in the U.S. IPO market, which had picked up pace in the second half of the year after a years-long lull, stalled at the start of October when the U.S. markets regulator furloughed staff and paused the review of filings. The Securities and Exchange Commission later eased restrictions, allowing companies to proceed with listings during the shutdown, prompting firms such as Navan to capitalize on a record run in the equity markets and a renewal in investor risk appetite. \"The IPO market has been a bit wobbly over the past month or so; we've definitely lost some momentum since the start of the quarter,\" said Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of IPO-focused research and ETFs. \"Some of that is due to the shutdown, global trade tensions, and the hotter AI IPOs cooling off. Still, recent IPOs have mostly held up.\" Navan and some of its existing investors together sold 36.92 million shares after pricing the offering at $25 each, the mid-point of its marketed range of between $24 and $26 per share. The IPO values Navan at roughly $6.2 billion, based on the shares outstanding in its prospectus, according to Reuters calculations. That is below the $9.2 billion valuation it reached in a late-stage funding round in 2022. AI-FOCUSED BUSINESS TRAVEL Navan describes itself as an \"all-in-one platform\" for business travel with artificial intelligence at its core. It provides a range of services to help businesses streamline travel and expense management, while enforcing company policies. Wall Street's latest AI frenzy has the hallmarks of a modern-day gold rush. From chipmakers and cloud giants to startups and software firms, companies across the financial and technology spectrum are aiming to position themselves at the center of the AI boom. Analysts say companies that can harness the current AI fixation will have the best shot at success in the IPO market, particularly among high-growth technology firms eager to capture investor enthusiasm. \"For Navan to be a true credible AI story, it needs to demonstrate some unique and hard-to-replicate value,\" Kat Liu, vice-president at IPOX said. INDUSTRY LANDSCAPE Travel demand is expected to continue rising as companies resume travel plans and consumers keep prioritizing experiences over goods, underscoring the resilience of both corporate and leisure spending. Still, the corporate travel management industry is intensely competitive, with several players vying to win large enterprise clients through lower fees, broader global networks and integrated technology platforms. Navan's customers include fashion retailer Primark, e-commerce platform Shopify, videoconferencing platform Zoom and furniture retailer Wayfair, Navan's website shows. The platform is also used by Thomson Reuters, parent of Reuters News. \"I think the narrative of a unified business travel, booking, payments, expense management and analytics platform is compelling, given the need to modernize outdated legacy systems,\" Liu said. Navan's prominent backers include Silicon Valley venture capital giants Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Zeev Ventures.",

But some advisers predict it could come even sooner, around late 2026. \"An IPO is not our focus, so we could not possibly have set a date,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said. \"We are building a durable business and advancing our mission so everyone benefits from AGI.\" The IPO preparations signal a new urgency inside the ChatGPT maker to tap public markets now that a complex restructuring is complete, that reduces its reliance on Microsoft. An IPO would open the door to more efficient capital raising and enable larger acquisitions using public stock, helping to finance CEO Sam Altman's plans to pour trillions of dollars into AI infrastructure, according to people familiar with the company's thinking. With an annualised revenue run rate expected to reach about US$20 billion by year-end, losses are also mounting inside the US$500 billion company, the people said. During a livestream on Tuesday, Altman addressed the possibility of going public. \"I think it's fair to say it is the most likely path for us, given the capital needs that we'll have,\" he said. IPO PREPARATIONS FOLLOW MAJOR RESTRUCTURING OpenAI started out as a nonprofit in 2015. A few years later, the company overhauled its structure again so that the nonprofit would have oversight and control over the for-profit arm. The main goal of the nonprofit was to ensure that OpenAI developed AI technology safely, rather than prioritising profits like a traditional company. This week, OpenAI revamped itself yet again. It is still controlled by a nonprofit, now called the OpenAI Foundation, but the nonprofit has a 26 per cent stake in OpenAI Group and a warrant to receive additional shares if the company hits certain milestones. This change makes the nonprofit a significant stakeholder in OpenAI's financial success. A successful offering would mark a major win for investors such as SoftBank, Thrive Capital and Abu Dhabi's MGX. Microsoft, one of its biggest backers, now owns about 27 per cent of the company after investing US$13 billion. The deliberations come as AI is driving a surge in public markets. Earlier this year, AI cloud company CoreWeave went public at a US$23 billion valuation and has roughly tripled since. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a US$5 trillion market value, powered by a rally that has cemented its role at the centre of the global AI boom. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the possibility of OpenAI going public as early as 2027.",

            "description": "Universal Music Group said on Wednesday it has settled a copyright infringement case with artificial intelligence company Udio and that the two firms will collaborate on a new suite of creative products. Under the agreement, the companies will launch a platform next year that leverages generative AI trained on authorized and licensed music. UMG Chairman Sir Lucian Grainge said the agreements \"demonstrate our commitment to do what's right by our artists and songwriters, whether that means embracing new technologies, developing new business models, diversifying revenue streams or beyond.\" Udio CEO Andrew Sanchez said the companies are \"building the technological and business landscape that will fundamentally expand what's possible in music creation and engagement.\" In 2024, major record labels Sony Music, Universal Music Group and Warner Records had sued Udio and another AI firm called Suno, accusing them of committing mass copyright infringement by using the labels' recordings to train music-generating AI systems.  The labels alleged that the AI companies copied hundreds of songs from some of the world's most popular musicians to teach their systems to create music that will \"directly compete with, cheapen, and ultimately drown out\" human artists. At the time, Suno and Udio argued that using copyrighted sound recordings to train their systems qualified as fair use under U.S. copyright law and described the lawsuits as attempts to stifle independent competition. The lawsuit is one of several high-stakes cases brought by copyright owners including authors, news outlets and visual artists against tech companies for allegedly using their work without permission to train AI. Sony and Warner's cases against Udio are still ongoing, as are all three labels' cases against Suno. UMG is the world's biggest music label, and its catalogue of artists also includes Taylor Swift, BTS, Ariana Grande, Sabrina Carpenter and Lady Gaga.",

            "description": "Corporate travel and expense company Navan on Wednesday priced its initial public offering at $25 per share, within its marketed range of $24 to $26 per share, raising about $923.1 million and reinforcing a strong momentum for fresh flotations. The Palo Alto, California-based firm sold 30 million shares to raise $750 million, while existing stockholders sold about 6.9 million shares to raise the remaining amount. The offering gives the company a potential valuation of $6.21 billion, according to Reuters calculations. In 2022, the company raised $300 million in a Series G funding round, achieving a valuation of $9.2 billion. While the U.S. government shutdown has caused some short-term delays, analysts and executives have hailed the rebound of fresh issues and said that it sets the stage for a meaningful pickup in activity in the coming quarters. Founded in 2015 as TripActions by Ariel Cohen and Ilan Twig, Navan initially focused on corporate travel management, aiming to modernize services traditionally provided by companies such as American Express and SAP Concur. Travel demand has rebounded from a tariff-related downturn earlier this year, with major airline executives expressing optimism about the industry's ability to increase fares later this year. Over the years, Navan has expanded into corporate payments and expense management, serving global clients including Zoom Communications and Lyft, according to its website. Navan will list its shares on the Nasdaq Global Market on Thursday under the ticker symbol NAVN. Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Jefferies, Mizuho and Morgan Stanley are among the underwriters for the offering.",

            "description": "HONG KONG/LONDON :Standard Chartered (StanChart) reported on Thursday a forecast-beating 3 per cent increase in third-quarter profit and said it expected income growth at the top end of its guidance as strong wealth, global banking and markets businesses boosted revenue. The lender, which earns most of its revenue in emerging markets in Asia and Africa, reported pretax profit for the third quarter of $1.77 billion. That compared with $1.72 billion a year earlier and the $1.52 billion average of 14 analyst estimates compiled by the bank. StanChart said it now expected income growth this year to be at the top end of its 5 per cent to 7 per cent guidance range. That means it will reach its goal of a 13 per cent return on tangible equity, a key profitability metric, in 2025 rather than an earlier forecast of 2026. Wealth management income shot up by 27 per cent, with inflows and the number of new accounts rising on demand for wealth advice amid market volatility. StanChart CEO Bill Winters said in a statement that a \"sharper strategic focus on servicing our clients' cross-border and affluent banking needs is paying off\" with double-digit growth in wealth solutions and global banking.",
