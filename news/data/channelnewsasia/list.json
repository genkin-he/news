For the full fiscal year ending in March, the government expects the South Asian economy to have grown by 7.6 per cent, the National Statistics Office said. It had been forecast to grow by 7.4 per cent under the old data series. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has undertaken to revamp economic data, including for inflation and gross domestic product, by expanding the sources of information and updating the base year to 2022-23, among other changes. The adjustments aim to address criticism of outdated data practices and enhance accuracy.",

            "description": "Feb 27 : Block shares soared more than 20 per cent in premarket trading on Friday after it announced it would nearly halve its workforce as part of an overhaul to embed artificial intelligence tools across its operations. The layoffs are the most visible signs of how the U.S. fintech industry is navigating the impact of AI, with its CEO, tech billionaire Jack Dorsey, warning that most companies were \"late\" to realize the emerging technology's potential. \"At its core, it's about how some companies may be run going forward – not just doomsday headcount reductions, but also enabling higher ROI investments in growth and FCF,\" analysts at Evercore ISI wrote, referring to free cash flow. Accelerating AI adoption is helping companies to cut jobs in divisions most exposed to automation. Economists at Goldman Sachs have estimated that AI was responsible for job losses amounting to a 5,000 to 10,000 hit to average monthly job growth in the industries most exposed to it in 2025. Block was one of the companies that aggressively hired during the pandemic as the use of digital payments and online commerce spiked. \"In Block's case, this looks like a mix of AI efficiency gains and an overdue clean-up of corporate bloat,\" said Matt Britzman, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Its workforce jumped from about 3,800 employees in 2019 to more than 10,000 in 2025 as Block battled increasing pressures from rising competition in its payments and buy-now-pay-later segments. \"While the RIF (reduction in force) is large, it does bring Block's headcount back toward pandemic-era levels, making it a standout in gross profit per employee, well ahead of its peers including Visa,\" JPMorgan analysts said.",

            "description": "Feb 27 : Shares of CoreWeave slumped around 12 per cent before the bell on Friday, after the company's plans to double capital expenditure this year fueled investor concerns about margin pressure and effective returns from its artificial intelligence push.  The cloud infrastructure company has committed significant capital toward the construction of large data centers filled with top-of-the line Nvidia chips to capitalize on the booming demand for AI services.  CoreWeave has budgeted $30 billion to $35 billion in capital expenditure this year, more than double the $14.9 billion it spent in 2025. The increased spending will put some \"short-term pressure on the margins,\" the company said. The company's ballooning spending mirrors that of hyperscale cloud providers such as Alphabet's Google and Amazon , which have collectively committed more than $600 billion this year for AI infrastructure buildouts.  Unlike Big Tech companies that are cushioned by massive cash reserves, neoclouds like CoreWeave and peer Nebius are more exposed to significant market downturns due to their business models. CoreWeave had $3.13 billion in cash and its equivalents, compared with Microsoft's $24.3 billion and Amazon's $86.8 billion, according to their most recent earnings reports.  Amsterdam-based Nebius earlier this month reported a sharp rise in capital spending to $2.1 billion in the December quarter from just $416 million in the prior year period. Neoclouds offer hardware and cloud capacity as services to other tech firms, usually by providing access to high-quality processors and cloud infrastructure.  Moreover, a rush to build out data centers could put pressure on chip availability. Any disruption to the supply could hamper CoreWeave's infrastructure plans and leave it with a revenue backlog it cannot fulfill. ",

Steinweg and one from Pacorini Global Services to store aluminium deliverable against its Comex aluminium futures contract in the southern Taiwanese port city of Kaohsiung. Reuters reported this month that the CME was set to approve facilities in Taiwan and another new base metals warehousing location, Hong Kong, as part of efforts to make its aluminium contract gain more traction in Asia. The London Metal Exchange already has warehousing in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The total approved outdoor storage capacity for aluminium at the CME's Taiwan sites is 95,000 metric tons - 50,000 tons and 20,000 tons for the two Steinweg locations and 25,000 tons for Pacorini's facility.",

            "description": "PARIS, Feb 27 : El Salvador-based stablecoin issuer Tether said it has frozen about $4.2 billion of its crypto tokens over links to \"illicit activity\", mostly in the past three years, as authorities around the world try to crack down on crypto-related crime. The world's largest stablecoin company, which has more than $180 billion of its dollar-pegged token in circulation, up from around $70 billion three years ago, is able to remotely freeze its tokens held in users' crypto wallets when asked to do so by law enforcement. Tether said this week it had helped the U.S. Justice Department freeze nearly $61 million worth of its tokens, called USDT, which were linked to \"pig-butchering\", a form of fraud in which scammers form a personal relationship with their victims. That brought its total frozen assets linked to illicit activity to $4.2 billion, of which $3.5 billion has been frozen since 2023, a spokesperson for Tether said in emailed comments late on Thursday. Tether has also previously said it had blocked wallets linked to human trafficking, and \"terrorism and warfare\" in Israel and Ukraine. Sanctioned Russian crypto exchange Garantex said last year Tether had blocked funds on its platform. Authorities around the world have long raised concerns about the role of crypto in illicit finance. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) last year called on countries to take stronger action to combat illicit finance in crypto markets, which are generally less regulated than mainstream financial markets. Money launderers received at least $82 billion in cryptocurrencies last year, up sharply from just $10 billion in 2020, partly driven by growth among Chinese-speaking groups, blockchain researchers said in January. Stablecoins are mostly used in crypto trading, and their volumes have surged in recent years.",

Technology stocks saw immense turbulence this month due to AI concerns, even as investors fretted about the payoff from massive planning spending on artificial-intelligence technology. Brewing tariff uncertainty also stoked volatility after the U.S. Supreme Court last week voided most of the duties U.S. President Donald Trump imposed last year. In response, Trump announced a temporary global tariff of 10 per cent that came into effect on Tuesday. Nvidia inched up 0.4 per cent in premarket trading after sliding more than 5 per cent in the previous session despite strong earnings, a sign that risk sentiment for all things AI remained shaky. Zscaler lost 9.1 per cent after the cloud security firm reported a wider net loss in the second quarter, while Intuit dipped 3.6 per cent after the financial software company forecast third-quarter profit below estimates. Software shares were rocked earlier this year on fears of industrywide AI-led disruptions. Financial brokerages, data analytics and legal services, real estate services and trucking are also hit hard by brewing AI concerns. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq clocked losses in the last session, with the Nasdaq closing below its 50-day moving average for the 17th straight session. The closely followed moving average is seen as a proxy for the intermediate-term trend.

Most megacap and growth stocks inched lower. Chip stocks including AMD and Broadcom also declined. Netflix added 7.4 per cent as investors cheered its decision to exit the fight for Warner Bros Discovery, which fell 2 per cent, while Paramount Skydance advanced 7.8 per cent after it won the race for some of the world's most prized TV and film assets. Block surged nearly 19 per cent after the payments firm said it will cut over 4,000 jobs, nearly half its workforce, as part of an overhaul to embed artificial intelligence across its operation.

            "description": "NEW YORK, Feb 27 : Prospects for artificial intelligence to disrupt business sectors should keep the U.S. stock market on edge in the coming week, as Wall Street looks for more insight into how the emerging technology will reverberate through the economy. The monthly U.S. jobs report headlines economic data due next week, while major semiconductor player Broadcom is among the remaining reports that will close out the fourth-quarter earnings season. The disruptive potential of AI has consumed investors in recent weeks, with shares in industries such as software, wealth management and real estate services pummeled by concerns about business upheaval. \"There continues to be this...back and forth about who might be the victim and those that will actually emerge winners because they are harnessing AI as opposed to being replaced by it,\" said Kristina Hooper, chief market strategist at Man Group. \"There is very little definitive right now about that, and so I think that will continue to be a concern.\" Stock prices in areas such as software remain acutely sensitive to AI-related developments. AI bellwether Nvidia's highly anticipated quarterly report failed to calm nerves, with the semiconductor giant's shares falling over 5 per cent on Thursday and weighing on the technology sector. Investors are concerned about whether Nvidia's \"hyperscaler\" customers will garner sufficient returns to justify their massive spending on data centers and other infrastructure. Despite the tech sector's struggles, gains this year in other areas such as industrials and consumer staples have helped buoy major equity indexes. The benchmark S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent in 2026 as of Thursday. \"The U.S. equity market is sort of in its late cycle, trying to find the winners and losers of this new disruptive technology and pretty much treading water,\" said John Velis, Americas macro strategist at BNY. WILL FEBRUARY JOBS BACK JANUARY'S STRENGTH? The U.S. jobs report for February, due on March 6, is expected to show an increase of 60,000 jobs, according to a Reuters poll. It comes after January's surprisingly robust report, with an increase of 130,000 jobs and the unemployment rate falling to 4.3 per cent. The January report allayed worries about a weakening labor market, but \"the concern is that January is a one-off,\" said Paul Nolte, senior wealth adviser and market strategist at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management. \"We saw a good January jobs report, but we also have seen a really weak 2025 for the job market,\" Hooper said. \"And so the question becomes, where do we go from here?\" Investors will also seek clues from the report about when the Federal Reserve may next cut interest rates. Fed funds futures suggest the next reduction will come in June or July, after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May and his nominated replacement Kevin Warsh could be in charge. The Fed cut rates last year in the face of a weakening employment backdrop but paused the easing cycle in January, and solid jobs data could prompt investors to push back their expectations for further cuts. Investors generally associate lower interest rates with higher prices for stocks and other assets. BNY's Velis said the market's reaction to the jobs data will be telling for which factors are prominent for equity investors. For example, strong data followed by weak stock performance is \"going to be a sign that the rate argument is important,\" Velis said. RETAIL SALES, BROADCOM EARNINGS ALSO UP NEXT Other economic releases due in the coming week include reports on manufacturing and services sector activity. The retail sales report for January is expected on March 6. Aside from Broadcom's quarterly report on Wednesday, results are expected from retailers Best Buy and Target. Wall Street is eager for any evidence of AI's impact on the economy, both positive and negative. In an interview with Reuters this week, outgoing Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the U.S. may be entering a period of structurally higher unemployment as firms deploy AI tools to save labor. \"Major technological shifts provoke both excitement and anxiety,\" Keith Lerner, chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, said in a research note on Thursday. \"More recently... optimism has begun to give way to heightened anxiety and increasingly bleak narratives about AI’s impact on work, productivity, and economic outcomes.\"",

            "title": "Pentagon Anthropic feud has sales and AI warfare at stake as Friday deadline looms",
            "description": "NEW YORK, Feb 27 : An explosive feud between the Pentagon and top artificial intelligence lab Anthropic is set to come to a head by 5:01 p.m. (2201 GMT) on Friday over concerns about how the military could use AI at war. The dispute, barreling toward a deadline set by the Pentagon for resolution, is widely seen as a referendum on how powerful AI could be deployed by the military and how its risks are managed. The Pentagon wants any lawful use to be allowed and has threatened Anthropic’s business if the startup does not scrap additional guardrails. “It’s a shot across the bow about the future of artificial intelligence and its use on the battlefield,” Chris Miller, the former acting secretary of defense, told Reuters. He added that the outcome will “be an acid test for those companies that claim to want to use AI humanely.” The months-long spat has divided some industry leaders, military officials and lawmakers over whether AI should be wielded without constraints when its creator Anthropic said the technology was not yet reliable for fully autonomous weapons. Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin weighed in on Thursday: “The average person does not think we should allow weapons systems to get into war and kill people without a human being overseeing that in some way.” Speaking at a confirmation hearing for two assistant defense secretary nominees, Slotkin added: “I certainly don’t think any American, Democrat or Republican, wants mass surveillance on the American people.” The Pentagon, which the Trump administration renamed the Department of War, has pushed back on the dilemma as a false choice “peddled by leftists in the media.” “The Department of War has no interest in using AI to conduct mass surveillance of Americans (which is illegal) nor do we want to use AI to develop autonomous weapons that operate without human involvement,” Pentagon chief spokesperson Sean Parnell posted on X Thursday. NEGOTIATIONS FALTER The Pentagon has signed $200-million ceiling agreements with major AI labs in the past year, including Anthropic, OpenAI and Google. It is pushing companies to agree to scrap their usage policies in favor of abiding by an all-lawful use clause. Anthropic, continuing these talks, has maintained red lines over the military’s use of its Claude AI models for autonomous weapons and domestic surveillance. Anthropic was first among these AI companies to work with classified information, through a supply deal via cloud provider Amazon. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, famous for quitting OpenAI in 2020 over concerns about AI technology’s stewardship, has warned that AI has advanced faster than the law. Powerful technology could hoover up disparate material to gather intelligence on unwitting civilians, he said in a Thursday blog post, a prospect that critics view as a legal loophole. “Anthropic understands that the Department of War, not private companies, makes military decisions,” but AI in narrow cases “can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values,” Amodei said. Amodei met with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week. Afterward, the Pentagon gestured toward compromise and sent the startup revised contract language. But the two parties remained at an apparent impasse. An Anthropic spokesperson said on Thursday, “The contract language we received overnight from the Department of War made virtually no progress” and would allow “safeguards to be disregarded at will.” BUSINESS THREATS Key business for Anthropic is at stake. The Pentagon warned it would terminate its work with the startup and declare it a supply-chain risk if Anthropic did not accede to the department’s demand for all-lawful use of AI. The designation, reserved typically for suppliers in adversary nations, means that defense contractors could be barred from deploying Anthropic's AI during work for the Pentagon. The setback comes as Anthropic races to win sales to businesses and government, with national security an area of focus. The Pentagon has asked contractors including Lockheed Martin to give an appraisal of their reliance on Anthropic ahead of the risk designation, Reuters reported on Wednesday. The defense industrial base totaled around 60,000 contractors including major public companies as of 2021. The Pentagon made a second threat, the legality of which some experts have questioned. “If they don’t get on board, SecWar will ensure the Defense Production Act is invoked on Anthropic,” a senior Pentagon official told Reuters, “compelling them to be used by the Pentagon regardless of if they want to or not.”",

            "description": "Feb 27 : Poland plans to introduce new legislation to ban social media for children under 15 years of age and will hold platforms responsible for age verification, Education Minister Barbara Nowacka told Bloomberg News in an interview published on Friday. The ruling Civic Coalition will present the draft outline on Friday, with fines planned for platforms that remain accessible to younger users, Nowacka said, adding that the law could take effect by early 2027. \"We see the mental health of children and young people, we see a decline in their intellectual competence,\" said Nowacka adding that the size of penalties that companies would have to pay is still under discussion. Several European governments including Denmark, Greece, France, Spain and Britain have explored similar restrictions amid claims that social-media services are harmful or addictive for minors. The British government said in January it was considering restrictions to protect children online, after Australia implemented similar laws in December. The initiative could put Warsaw at odds with U.S. tech firms such as Meta and Elon Musk's X, some of which have pushed back against restrictions following Australia's ban last year.",
