            "title": "AI turned Google Cloud from also-ran into Alphabet’s growth driver",
            "description": "NEW YORK, NY :Once a money-losing backwater, Google Cloud has become one of Alphabet's fastest-growing businesses, powered by massive bets on AI and years of costly investment in datacenters, custom chips, and networking gear. Alphabet’s cloud revenue topped $15 billion in the third quarter, a 34 per cent increase reflecting strong demand for AI infrastructure and services, including Google’s own Gemini model, the company announced Wednesday. Google Cloud is now challenging YouTube as Alphabet’s No. 2 cash generator behind its search ads business. “Google Cloud is one of the most important priorities for Alphabet as a whole and I expect it to play an even more central role as the company moves forward,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told Reuters in an interview earlier in October. Much of the cloud unit’s growth can be attributed to the business bets and diplomatic maneuvering of its head Thomas Kurian, who joined Google from Oracle in 2018 and grew the unit’s market share from 7 per cent then to 13 per cent in 2025, according to Synergy Research Group, which tracks the cloud industry. When Pichai replaced Google co-founder Larry Page as CEO in 2019, he identified Google Cloud and YouTube as his two big bets to move Alphabet beyond its core business of search advertising.  Since then, YouTube has largely delivered, becoming the world’s largest video platform with 1 billion hours watched per day. By contrast, Google Cloud lost billions between 2018 and 2022 due to heavy investments in servers, datacenters and chips until it turned its first profit in 2023. Now, with generative AI, Alphabet sees a chance to close the gap with rivals Microsoft and Amazon, which hold 20 per cent and 30 per cent market share respectively. Making Google Cloud a contender has come at a cost: Alphabet has already shocked Wall Street twice during quarterly earnings this year by proclaiming higher-than-expected capital spending due to the need to build more infrastructure to fulfill cloud demand. “This is the moment Google Cloud was waiting for,” Dave McCarthy, who directs coverage of the cloud industry for research firm IDC. “A lot of the future growth at Alphabet is being looked at through its potential.” In exclusive interviews with Reuters, senior Alphabet executives mapped out the gameplan that transformed the also-ran into a growth driver: a cultural shift to a more customer-driven sales approach; changing how it worked with rivals; and a renewed focus on delivering profits. ‘GET OUT OF HERE, KID’ Back when Kurian joined Alphabet, Google Cloud struggled to win enterprise customers, unlike the ads side of the business which was dealing with the biggest companies in the world. “We would go to the ads team asking, ‘Hey, can you help us out with this customer?’ And they would basically be like, ‘Get out of here, kid,’” said Josh Gwyther, a startup founder who worked at Google Cloud from 2016 to 2025. That’s not a problem anymore: Google’s scope of AI offerings have brought it into conversations with large companies that previously only considered Amazon and Microsoft.  “The ads business is extremely healthy, but it’s not going to grow at the pace that we are,” said Matt Renner, Google Cloud’s president of global revenue.  Nine of the 10 leading AI labs are now customers, Kurian said at an industry conference in September. They include OpenAI, Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence. Details of Google’s deals with two of those labs were first reported by Reuters earlier this year. To get there, Kurian took a mallet to traditional practices, replacing it with what several employees called an “un-Googley” culture.  Kurian, who left a job as one of Larry Ellison’s highest-paid lieutenants at Oracle, brought financial discipline to Google’s “loosely-run, ground-up culture” that encouraged side projects and experimentation, said Chirag Mehta, a tech analyst who worked at Google Cloud from 2017 to 2021. To slash costs, Kurian opened new offices in cheaper locations, such as North Carolina and Poland. He audited Google Cloud’s contracts for internal services and renegotiated those where he deemed his unit was being overcharged by other departments, as was first reported in The Information. He has ordered employees to focus on revenue rather than bookings. Google Cloud also shifted its sales strategy to target customers by sector rather than geography. That helped reduce sales reps being assigned accounts in industries where they lacked specialized knowledge, said Renner. Its focus on generative AI has allowed it to catch up with rivals Microsoft and Amazon from a technical standpoint, according to some analysts.  “We believe that the three clouds competitively are on roughly equal footing,” said Goldman Sachs managing director Eric Sheridan. “That’s a very different competitive positioning for Google Cloud now than two or three years ago.” WORKING WITH THE ENEMY For years, Alphabet had reserved the lion’s share of its own chips, or TPUs, for in-house use only. That changed in 2022, when Kurian successfully lobbied to move the group selling TPUs from Google’s core engineering unit into Google Cloud. That move drastically increased Google Cloud's allocation of TPUs because the unit could now freely offer the chips rather than having to receive approval from another part of the company, according to two people familiar with the move. At a time when the world was scrambling for compute, Alphabet made the decision to make its chips available to not just its own DeepMind AI unit, but also to its competitors.  That decision stoked tensions internally, according to former employees of both units, but it gave Kurian a stronger sales pitch for courting customers. “We are the only hyperscaler with both silicon and models of our own,” he said. “How deep is your technical differentiation when the same stuff that you’re reselling can be bought from somebody else?” Google Cloud quickly leveraged the opportunity to petition Anthropic to test TPUs as a viable alternative to Nvidia’s GPUs, according to a former Google Cloud executive involved in the partnership. By 2024, Anthropic had seen enough to deploy Alphabet’s TPUs at scale. In October, it expanded its deal with Google to use as many as one million TPUs, worth tens of billions of dollars. The startup, which is now valued at $183 billion, has also tapped Amazon for chips as it reduces its dependency on Nvidia, which controls about 80 per cent of the AI chip market. “The whole world was sort of on GPUs, OpenAI in particular,” said Dan Rosenthal, who manages Anthropic’s partnerships with Google and Amazon. The need for chips “pushed us to be more flexible,” he said. Other AI developers including Apple and Safe Superintelligence have since adopted Alphabet's TPUs. Pichai told analysts on an earnings conference call this week that Alphabet is \"investing in TPU capacity to meet the tremendous demand we are seeing from customers and partners.\" And although Google Cloud launched an enterprise version of its flagship model Gemini in October, Kurian told Reuters he would welcome adding OpenAI’s family of enterprise models to Google Cloud if the ChatGPT maker was interested. POWER SHIFT The ascent of Google Cloud is shifting the balance of power inside Alphabet. Current and former executives told Reuters Kurian has gained clout at Google’s weekly “leads,” the agenda-setting meetings where division leaders jostle over resources and priorities. “What Thomas has been a powerful voice for is making sure that when we say we’re focusing on the user, that we’re focusing on the enterprise customer too,” Pichai said. It still has a long way to catch up with its rivals and it will be expensive to get there. In July, Pichai hiked Alphabet’s projected capital spending for 2025 by $10 billion to $85 billion. This week, he raised the projection again to between $91 billion and $93 billion, adding that 2026 was likely to run an even larger bill. With concerns over an AI bubble growing, Pichai told Reuters that he expects Google Cloud’s business to have “a lot of resilience” against short-term market corrections. “From our standpoint, we've been doing the AI thing for a decade now, and we're going to be doing it a decade from now.”",

            "title": "Taiwan plans to raise 2025 growth target as AI boom boosts Q3 figures",
            "description": "TAIPEI :Taiwan plans to raise its economic growth forecast this year to more than 5 per cent after the economy expanded by a better-than-expected rate in the third quarter given a strong performance by the crucial tech sector thanks to the AI boom. Taiwan's gross domestic product grew 7.64 per cent year-on-year in the July-September quarter, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said on Friday. That surpassed the 6.0 per cent forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, though slightly lagged the 8.01 per cent growth rate in the second quarter. The better-than-expected growth will pave the way to raise the full-year forecast to more than 5 per cent, the agency said, from a previous prediction of 4.45 per cent. A formal unveiling of the final forecast for 2025 will come at the end of next month. \"The performance was truly outstanding,\" said analyst Kevin Wang of Taishin Investment Advisory. \"It mainly benefited from strong demand for AI, driving increased capital expenditure in the cloud industry, supporting robust AI exports, and offsetting the impact of weak exports from traditional industries.\" Taiwan's key semiconductor chip industry is currently exempt from the 20 per cent U.S. tariffs on Taiwanese exports in effect since August. Taiwan is in talks with the United States to get that rate reduced. Taiwan is a major hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Nvidia, and home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, whose semiconductors are widely used for AI applications. Taiwan's tech firms have reported roaring demand thanks to the surge in interest in AI applications. TSMC this month reported a record, forecast-beating quarterly profit, and raised its 2025 full-year revenue forecast on a bullish outlook for spending on AI. The continued strong growth of the economy reinforces the view that Taiwan's central bank will be one of the few in Asia to leave interest rates unchanged this coming year, some analysts said. \"The main reasons are mild inflationary pressure and the far better-than-expected economic growth,\" said Wang. Taiwan's statistics agency will provide revised figures on November 28 with more details and the update of its forward-looking forecasts.",

            "description": "Amazon shares jumped nearly 12 per cent in premarket trade on Friday after strong growth at its cloud unit and a bullish sales outlook eased fears that the tech giant was falling behind rivals in the AI race. Revenue at Amazon Web Services, the hub of the company's recent AI investments, rose 20 per cent in the third quarter, compared with Microsoft Azure's 40 per cent and Google Cloud's 34 per cent. However, analysts said the rebound marked a potential turning point for Amazon. The company's $33 billion in quarterly cloud revenue is more than double of Google's $15.16 billion. \"There was definitely concern about AWS losing market share to Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud,\" said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital. \"But now AWS is aboard the train as well and they're seeing a big revenue increase.\" The Seattle-based company has relied on strong cloud demand to offset pressures on e-commerce as consumer spending softens amid tariff uncertainty and inflation. Still, worries over its slower pace in winning major AI deals have weighed on the stock, up just 1.6 per cent this year, making it the worst performer among the \"Magnificent Seven.\" CEO Andy Jassy said on Thursday AWS is \"growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022,\" citing strong demand for AI and core infrastructure. Like other Big Tech firms, Amazon also forecast increased capital spending over the next year. Amazon's forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio recently stood at 29.63, surpassing Alphabet's 25.98 but trailing Microsoft's 31.72. RETAIL, ADS PITCH IN The company's retail and advertising businesses also delivered strong performances. Retail revenue rose 11 per cent year-over-year, outpacing most large U.S. peers, while advertising sales jumped 24 per cent to $17.7 billion. \"Amazon's retail results were very good. They're growing 11 per cent year over year. Name me another big retailer in America growing that fast - they don't exist,\" said Jed Ellerbroek of Argent Capital. The company has been expanding ad placements across Echo devices, grocery carts, and sponsored listings, helping boost margins and diversify revenue.",

The ECB kept policy unchanged on Thursday, saying the economic outlook remained in line with its earlier projections for slow but steady growth as tariff headwinds are offset by consumption. \"Many firms were investing strongly in digital infrastructure, giving rise to substantially growing demand for software and databases, particularly cloud solutions, and AI,\" the ECB said. Firms said these investments were particularly strong in the financial and public sectors and the increasing deployment of artificial intelligence was also starting to disrupt the business model of traditional consultancy firms. Meanwhile, manufacturing, continued to struggle. \"Manufacturing output was still weighed down by tariffs, uncertainty and challenges to competitiveness as well as relatively muted growth in consumer goods spending, with little improvement anticipated in the short term,\" the ECB said. Construction was, however, slowly turning the corner, and firms pointed to good or reasonable growth, linked especially to consumer spending on tourism and hospitality, and to investment in software, data solutions and artificial intelligence, the ECB added. Consumer spending remained lacklustre, appliance and electronics manufacturers were more positive and contacts in tourism, hospitality and entertainment had grown strongly over the summer. Machine investment still remained subdued but spending on AI was booming. The survey also showed that the employment outlook remained relatively subdued, wage growth was moderating and selling price momentum was showing a further slight slowdown.",

            "description": "(Corrects third bullet to say YouTube TV, not Disney, claims that Disney's terms, not Google's, benefit Hulu + Live TV) By Shubham Kalia and Dawn Chmielewski Disney's networks went dark on Google's pay-TV platform YouTube TV after negotiations to reach a licensing deal failed, the companies said in separate statements late on Thursday. The affected Disney networks include ESPN, ABC, FX, Nat Geo, Nat Geo Wild, Disney Channel, ABC News Live and others. A source told Reuters that Disney's channels were removed from YouTube TV ahead of the contract lapsing. YouTube TV issued its statement on X at 11:16 pm ET on Thursday, while the deal was originally set to expire only at midnight. YouTube TV, one of the largest pay-TV distributors in the U.S., has been locked in a series of negotiations this year with firms threatening to pull their media networks from the platform. Earlier this month, the company, after a difficult negotiation period, struck a deal with Comcast-owned NBCUniversal to keep NBC shows such as \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" on YouTube TV. The platform also struck similar deals with Fox and Paramount earlier this year after difficult contract negotiations. YouTube TV, which has over 10 million subscribers, said Disney's proposed offer terms would raise prices for its subscribers and benefit Disney's own live TV services such as Hulu + Live TV, while Disney accused YouTube TV of being unwilling to pay fair rates. \"Our contract with Disney has reached its renewal date, and we'll not agree to terms that disadvantage our members while benefiting Disney's TV products,\" YouTube TV said in a post on social media platform X. A Disney spokesperson said the company was committed to working toward a resolution as quickly as possible. \"With a $3 trillion market cap, Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we've successfully negotiated with every other distributor,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. YouTube TV will offer its subscribers a $20 credit if the Disney networks remain unavailable on the platform for an extended period of time. The pay-TV platform had dropped Spanish-language network Univision last month after a failed contract deal.",

            "title": "Analysis:BOJ locks in near-term rate hike, yen may sway timing",
            "description": "TOKYO :The Bank of Japan's cautious governor has dropped unusually hawkish hints of an interest rate hike in December or January next year, with the timing likely swayed not just by wage momentum but by moves in the yen. The central bank kept interest rates steady at 0.5 per cent on Thursday as expected, but Governor Kazuo Ueda said the likelihood of its baseline scenario materialising has heightened - language he had used in the past to signal a rate hike was imminent. While warning of lingering global uncertainties, the board revised up this year's growth forecast and made few tweaks to its sanguine view of Japan's recovery prospects in a quarterly report released after the meeting. As was the case before the BOJ's previous rate hike in January, Ueda also elaborated on the triggers for action with an emphasis on the \"initial momentum\" of next year's wage negotiations. \"Ueda's remarks ... contained many signals that, barring major shocks in the U.S. economy or markets, the probability of a near-term rate hike is rising,\" said Takeshi Yamaguchi, chief Japan economist at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities. \"Given Ueda's use of the term 'initial momentum,' we think it is unlikely the BOJ will wait until March wage results,\" said Yamaguchi, who predicts a rate hike in December. MORE DATA TO COME More data will be available by the BOJ's upcoming policy meeting on December 18-19 that would provide hints to next year's wage outlook, including corporate earnings reports and the central bank's \"tankan\" business survey due on December 15. Already, Japan's largest labour union group said it would seek wage hikes of 5 per cent or more in 2026, aiming for bumper pay raises for the fourth straight year despite external headwinds. There could also be early hints on how automakers - a sector Ueda said he was paying particular attention to - set wages as they face the hit from U.S. tariffs. Last year, labour unions at major automakers set pay hike targets in December. Ueda may also heed to mounting pressure from within his nine-member board to act sooner rather than later. Two board members repeated their proposal, made in September, to hike rates to 0.75 per cent, on Thursday. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has recently chimed in, urging the government of new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who is known as an advocate of loose monetary policy, to allow the BOJ to raise rates and avoid excessive yen declines. \"A hawkish bloc has solidified within the BOJ policy board\" with the hawks having \"an external advocate pushing for monetary tightening\" in Bessent, said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, who predicts a rate hike in December. \"As a new prime minister, it may even be advantageous for Takaichi to get the rate hike out of the way early on in her tenure,\" he added. YEN COMPLICATES TIMING To be sure, the BOJ may opt to play it safe by waiting until its January 22-23 meeting, as most big manufacturers firm up wage plans at the start of the year, some analysts say. By then, there will be more clarity on the Takaichi administration's budget plans and economic policies. The BOJ, too, can offer a more thorough analysis justifying a rate hike in a quarterly report due after the January meeting. In the end, however, the timing may depend much on yen moves as a renewed slide in the currency would push up import costs and broader inflation, some analysts say. The yen fell to a nearly nine-month low against the dollar on Thursday despite Ueda's hawkish comments. Data on Friday showed core consumer inflation in Japan's capital, a leading indicator of nationwide trends, perked up in October and remained above the central bank's 2 per cent target. Further rises in the cost of living would run counter to Takaichi's pledge to cushion households' blow from inflation. Former BOJ executive Akira Otani expects the BOJ to hike rates in January, when enough data becomes available on whether companies will weather the tariff hit and keep hiking pay. But he cites the yen as potentially changing the timing. \"At present, we don't see a strong chance of a December rate increase,\" said Otani, currently managing director at Goldman Sachs Japan. \"But the possibility could heighten if yen falls accelerate and increase the risk of inflation overshooting the BOJ's baseline forecast made in October.\"",

            "description": "BANGKOK :Thailand's economy improved in September from the previous month due to a rebound in manufacturing, rising exports and increasing foreign tourism receipts, but it was weaker over the entire July to September quarter, the central bank said on Friday. Domestic demand also slowed over the month, with both private consumption and investment showing declines, the Bank of Thailand said in a statement. Exports, a key driver of the economy, jumped 19.2 per cent in September from a year earlier while imports increased 18.0 per cent, the central bank said, leading to a trade surplus of $3.6 billion. The current account surplus THCURA=ECI was $1.9 billion in September. For the whole of the third quarter, the economy softened compared to the previous quarter after a decline in manufacturing output, reflecting temporary production halts in certain products, as well as weaker domestic demand, the central bank said. The central bank had earlier forecast year-on-year growth of 1.5 per cent in the third quarter and a 0.5 per cent dip compared to the previous three months. Third-quarter gross domestic product data is due on November 17. The central bank forecast economic growth of 2.2 per cent this year and 1.6 per cent next year. Southeast Asia's second-largest economy expanded 2.5 per cent last year, lagging peers. The central bank unexpectedly left its key rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent. Governor Vitai Ratanakorn earlier said rates could be cut if needed to lift inflation and growth. The next policy review is due on December 17. The economy has struggled with U.S. tariffs, high household debt, and a strong baht currency, prompting the government to introduce a series of stimulus measures, including a 44 billion baht ($1.34 billion) consumer subsidy programme. On Thursday, the finance ministry raised its 2025 GDP growth forecast to 2.4 per cent from 2.2 per cent and predicted 2 per cent growth next year.",

            "description": "TOKYO :Japan's Nikkei share average climbed to an all-time high on Friday, posting its biggest monthly gain in three decades, as tech stocks rallied following strong sales forecasts from Amazon and Apple. A weaker yen also boosted heavyweight exporters, following its slide to a record low against the euro and the lowest level since February versus the dollar on Thursday after the Bank of Japan governor kept a cautious tone in holding interest rates steady. The Nikkei closed up 2.1 per cent at the session high of 52,411.34, a record peak that took the index's gains for October to 16.6 per cent - the biggest since January of 1994. The broader Topix rose as much as 1.4 per cent to reach an all-time peak of 3,348.06, before ending the day with a 0.9 per cent gain at a record closing high of 3,331.83. On Thursday, Amazon reported its cloud revenue rose at the fastest clip in nearly three years, helping the company to forecast quarterly sales above estimates. Meanwhile, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook gave forecasts for holiday-quarter iPhone sales and overall revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Japan's chip-sector shares were among the biggest gainers. Socionext soared nearly 17 per cent, while Advantest climbed 3.9 per cent, making it the Nikkei's largest gainer in terms of index points due to its heavy weighting. Artificial intelligence data centre-related shares also gained, with Hitachi jumping 7.2 per cent. Tech stocks have been at the centre of the Nikkei's relentless rally in recent months, joining a global equity resurgence fuelled by sky-high expectations for AI. Japan has had the additional tailwind this month from hopes for aggressive fiscal stimulus under new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. One of her focus areas is AI innovation, meaning Japanese tech shares will benefit from both global and domestic momentum, according to MUFG Asset Management. Topping the 52,000 level for the Nikkei \"is just a step on the way higher,\" said MUFG Asset Management Chief Market Economist Naoya Oshikubo. \"We have more room, like another 10 per cent rise from here towards April,\" he said. \"This is not a bubble.\"",

            "title": "Samsung Electronics in talks with Nvidia to supply next-generation HBM4 chips",
            "description": "SEOUL :Samsung Electronics said on Friday it is in \"close discussion\" to supply its next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, or HBM4, to Nvidia, as the South Korean chipmaker scrambles to catch up with rivals in the AI chip race. Samsung, which plans to market the new chip next year, did not specify when it aims to ship the latest version of its HBM chip, a key building block of artificial intelligence chipsets. Local rival SK Hynix, Nvidia's top HBM chip supplier, on Wednesday said it aims to start shipping its latest HBM4 chips in the fourth quarter and expand sales next year. Nvidia, in a statement announcing cooperation with Samsung, said it is in \"key supply collaboration for HBM3E and HBM4\", without elaborating. In a separate deal, Samsung said it will purchase 50,000 high-end Nvidia chips to build an AI-enhanced semiconductor factory aimed at improving chip manufacturing speed and yields. Samsung's share price rose as much as 4.32 per cent after the announcements. Chairman Jay Y. Lee and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met over fried chicken and beer on Thursday during Huang's visit to Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit. Lee said Nvidia is a key customer and strategic partner and highlighted more than two decades of collaboration. Jeff Kim, head of research at KB Securities, said HBM4 likely needs further testing but Samsung widely is seen to be in a favourable position given its production capacity. \"If Samsung supplies HBM4 chips to Nvidia, it could secure a significant market share that it was unable to achieve with previous HBM series products,\" Kim said. Samsung has been slower to capitalise on the AI-driven memory chip boom, leading to weaker earnings performance and a reshuffle of its chip division last year. Its earnings recovered in the latest quarter driven by conventional memory chip demand. This week it said it sells its current-generation HBM3E chips to \"all related customers\", indicating it has joined rivals in supplying the latest 12-layer HBM3E chips to Nvidia. The launch of HBM4 chips will be a major test of Samsung's ability to regain its edge in the market, analysts said. HBM - a type of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) standard first produced in 2013 - involves stacking chips vertically to save space and reduce power consumption, helping to process the large volume of data generated by complex AI applications. Investors are watching for whether Samsung's HBM4 can cut SK Hynix's lead in advanced memory chips. The chipmaker, which also is also a leading smartphone maker, said in July it had provided HBM4 samples to customers, with plans to begin supply next year. Samsung's share price has risen nearly 60 per cent since July as investors expect the chipmaker to benefit from the current uptrend in memory prices and advance in the AI race.",
