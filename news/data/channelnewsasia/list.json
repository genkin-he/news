            "description": "Lumen Technologies edged past third-quarter revenue estimate and posted a smaller-than-expected loss on Thursday, driven by demand for its network infrastructure to support massive data flows and computational workloads amid an AI boom. The telecom and networking firm continues to have an opportunity to expand its share of business revenue, as hyperscalers and enterprise customers ramp up bandwidth demand to support growing AI applications and modernize their core connectivity infrastructure. Lumen reported third-quarter revenue of $3.09 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $3.04 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. The company said it has signed new deals worth $1 billion in October for its private connectivity fabric (PCF) solutions, designed for AI workloads, bringing the total value to more than $10 billion. The October deal is largely with one client, Chief Financial Officer Chris Stansbury told Reuters in an interview, without naming the customer. There are nearly 15 to 16 customers that add up to the total value, with Lumen seeing more pathways to demand for the PCF product. In May, the company had agreed to sell its consumer fiber business to AT&T for $5.75 billion to sharpen its enterprise focus and reduce capital expenditure. The deal is expected to close in early 2026. When the deal closes, Lumen's leverage will be below four times and it will continue to reduce debt, Stansbury said. \"We're not in a position where we have to sell things anymore,\" Stansbury said. \"Our debt is no longer a headwind.\" Earlier this month, Lumen and data analytics firm Palantir announced a multi-year partnership aimed at helping businesses deploy AI more quickly and securely. Lumen has also unveiled a series of collaborations with tech firms focused on AI and cybersecurity. Lumen posted an adjusted loss of 20 cents per share during the third quarter, compared with analysts' estimate of a 27-cent loss. It also reiterated its fiscal 2025 forecast.",

The company's AI-optimized ad platform helps advertisers to place targeted ads directly within relevant discussion threads across its interest-based communities, known as subreddits. The approach allows marketers to harness user-driven conversations for better targeting. Reddit's vast content library is one of its valuable assets at a time when AI companies are looking for data to train their large language modes, a technology behind chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Grok. The company already licenses its data to Alphabet's Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI. It sued Perplexity AI and other three data scraping companies last week, alleging them of illegally collecting Reddit's data. Reddit operates in a crowded social media market, where dominant platforms such as TikTok and Meta are aggressively vying for new advertisers with their massive user-bases and AI-powered ad tools. Facebook-parent Meta reported upbeat third-quarter revenue on Wednesday. Reddit expects fourth-quarter revenue to be between $655 million and $665 million, compared with analysts' average estimate of $637.9 million, according to data compiled by LSEG. The company forecast fourth-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to be between $275 million and $285 million, compared with estimates of $258.8 million. Daily active unique visitors rose 19 per cent to 116 million in the third quarter ended September 30, while its average revenue per user increased by 41 per cent. The company said its machine translation feature now supported 30 languages, helping fuel user growth across markets outside the United States. Third-quarter revenue rose 68 per cent to $585 million, beating estimates of $545.7 million.",

The AGCM has received reports that DJI, the world's largest drone maker, and local importer Nital monitored the prices charged by retailers. Those who deviated from the ones on Nital's website received warnings including threats that supplies would be interrupted. \"In this way, DJI and Nital allegedly enforce adherence to resale prices across their distribution network, preventing any form of price competition such as discounts or reductions for customers,\" the AGCM said in a statement released on Wednesday. Such practice, known as resale price maintenance, would be a breach of European Union rules, with fines normally imposed as a punishment if allegations of wrongdoing are upheld. In response, DJI said on Thursday that it was \"committed to rigorous legal and regulatory standards.\" \"We will cooperate fully with the relevant authorities as their investigation proceeds,\" it added in an emailed statement. Nital could not be reached for comment. (Writing by Keith Weir, editing by Gavin Jones)",

            "description": "Crypto miner Core Scientific on Thursday ended a deal for its sale to CoreWeave after shareholders voted against the proposal, marking the culmination of months-long investor and proxy campaigns against the agreement. The move marks the second foiled attempt by CoreWeave to scoop up Core Scientific, with the crypto miner also rejecting a June 2024 all-cash buyout offer. Core Scientific shares were up marginally in afternoon trading, while CoreWeave was down 3.9 per cent. CoreWeave had struck an all-stock deal worth $9 billion to buy Core Scientific in July, as part of its push to secure the energy and data center capacity needed to power surging demand. Soon after, Two Seas Capital, which claims to be the largest active shareholder of Core Scientific, said it would vote against the deal, citing concerns with the sale process, deal structure, and valuation. It said the fixed exchange ratio left Core Scientific shareholders vulnerable to fluctuations in the price of CoreWeave shares. Last week, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services also recommended investors vote against the deal, suggesting Core Scientific should continue going alone given its considerable success as a standalone company. Some analysts said the vote might have been influenced by soaring valuations commanded by AI-related companies, also raising questions if the markets are in a bubble. \"(Shareholders) believe their value should be higher based on current valuations of comparable companies, which we see as more a sign of AI trade froth than actual economic value,\" said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson. Core Scientific's board had urged its shareholders to vote for the sale, saying the combined company would benefit from several potential cost savings. \"We respect the views of Core Scientific stockholders and look forward to continuing our commercial partnership,\" said Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO and co-founder.",

            "description": "Shares of C.H. Robinson surged more than 20 per cent to a record high on Thursday as investors cheered the global freight forwarder's quarterly profit beat due to AI-driven efficiencies at a time when the rest of the logistics sector has struggled. The U.S.'s largest freight broker has been using artificial intelligence to automate tasks such as generating shipping quotes, scheduling pickups and deliveries and tracking shipments. This has helped speed up its operations and reduce reliance on manual work. \"We believe that CHRW's scale and first mover advantage will allow for continued productivity and share gains in the coming years, and management has shown its operating model is differentiated,\" Stephens analyst Reed Seay said in a note. The company's adjusted profit of $1.40 per share for the quarter beat analysts' average estimate of $1.30, according to data compiled by LSEG. The beat was helped by a 12.6 per cent decline in operating expenses from a year ago. The company's employee headcount was down 10.8 per cent. \"The transition to agentic AI to complement the large productivity improvements already enacted by generative AI, give management confidence to line-of-sight cost takeout and further margin improvement, even without market help,\" Evercore ISI analyst Jonathan Chappell said. C.H. Robinson managed to grow shipment volumes in both its truckload and less-than-truckload segments, helping its North American Surface Transportation segment post a 1.1 per cent rise in revenue. Meanwhile, the U.S. freight industry has been facing subdued volumes, while excess capacity has kept rates under pressure. The trend has forced logistics firms to tighten spending and operate with greater discipline. C.H. Robinson's shares trade at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.49, compared with the industry median of 16.32.",

The EU uses the term hybrid threats to refer to coordinated attacks using a combination of economic, technological or other measures that fall short of formal warfare. They can include such things as disinformation campaigns or the use of social media to control the political narrative. The document, known as the European Democracy Shield, is part of European Union efforts to counter foreign information manipulation and interference and protect and promote democracy across the 27-country bloc, triggered in part by Russian misinformation. Under the Digital Services Act which became applicable last year, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Elon Musk's X, TikTok and other online platforms have to do more to tackle illegal and harmful content on their platforms. They may have to broaden their efforts under the European Democracy Shield. \"The Commission will prepare a DSA crisis protocol for hybrid threats, to better detect, deter and respond to incident and crises which will be developed with online platforms, national authorities and relevant stakeholders,\" the document said. The document will also urge tech companies which signed up to the Code of Conduct on disinformation to analyse threats posed by deepfakes and AI-generated videos and media to elections, and identify measures to counter them. Signatories to the Code include Google, Microsoft, Meta and TikTok. EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen is expected to announce the proposal on November 13, according to a Commission agenda.

            "description": "One of the top decentralized cryptocurrency trading platforms, dYdX, is preparing to enter the U.S. market by the end of the year, in a shift for the derivatives-focused exchange that was previously not available to American users, the president of dYdX told Reuters in an interview.  Unlike centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken that act as the intermediary between buyers and sellers, decentralized platforms like dYdX aim to cut out the middleman and allow users to transact directly on a blockchain network, which powers cryptocurrencies. DYdX specializes in perpetual contracts, a type of derivative that lets traders speculate on the price of an asset without actually owning it, and unlike traditional futures, does not have an expiration date. It recently surpassed $1.5 trillion in total trading volume since its inception, the San Francisco-based company said.  The platform plans to add to its offerings, bringing spot trading on solana and other linked cryptocurrencies to the U.S. by the end of the year, said Eddie Zhang, the president of dYdX.  \"It's very important for us as a platform to have something available in the United States, because I think it represents, hopefully, the direction we're trying to move in,\" Zhang said.  DYdX's move follows President Donald Trump's embrace of the cryptocurrency sector this year, which has led to the dismissal of a spate of lawsuits against prominent crypto platforms and a shift by financial regulators to create specialized rules to accommodate digital assets.  Upon entering the U.S., dYdX plans to slash its trading fees by as much as half \"across the board,\" to between 50 and 65 basis points, Zhang said.  Perpetual contracts will not be available in the U.S., but dYdX hopes U.S. regulators will eventually provide guidance for decentralized platforms to be able to offer those products, Zhang said.  In a joint statement last month by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the agencies indicated they would consider allowing crypto perpetual contracts to trade across regulated platforms in the U.S. ",

            "description": "WASHINGTON :At the twilight of the age of dinosaurs, an agile and vicious predator named Nanotyrannus prowled western North America, resembling a smaller version of Tyrannosaurus - about a tenth the body mass - but with several key anatomical differences. That is the finding of new research concluding that Nanotyrannus - which for years has been at the center of a debate among paleontologists as to whether it was merely a teenage version of Tyrannosaurus - was, in fact, its own distinct dinosaur. The researchers examined fossil specimens of Nanotyrannus unearthed in 1942, 2001 and 2006 in Montana dating to about 67 million years ago, determining that the individuals were mature and not juveniles based on traits in the bones including annual growth rings. They also found that Nanotyrannus differed anatomically from its larger cousin by having more teeth, a crest in front of its eyes, an air sinus in a certain bone at the back of the skull and the presence of a vestigial third finger, unlike the two-fingered Tyrannosaurus. Nanotyrannus and Tyrannosaurus both were members of a lineage of meat-eating dinosaurs called tyrannosaurs, but were not the same genus, the researchers said. A genus is a group of closely related species that share similar characteristics. For example, lions, tigers, leopards and jaguars are from the same genus, Panthera, but each represents a different species. The genus name Tyrannosaurus means \"tyrant lizard,\" with the species name \"rex\" meaning \"king.\" The genus name Nanotyrannus means \"dwarf tyrant.\" \"T. rex was a massive predator adapted to wielding incredible bite forces. Nanotyrannus was a slender, agile pursuit predator that could have run circles around the tyrant king,\" said paleontologist Lindsay Zanno of North Carolina State University and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, lead author of the study published on Thursday in the journal Nature. The new analysis ends the debate around Nanotyrannus, Zanno said. \"It is not biologically possible to conclude that it is a juvenile T. rex,\" Zanno said. Their size difference was stark. Nanotyrannus had about 10 per cent the body mass - about 1,500 pounds (700 kg) versus 15,000 pounds (7,000 kg). And it had about half the linear dimensions - approximately 18 feet (5.5 meters) versus roughly 40 feet (12.2 meters) long, and 7 feet (2 meters) versus 13 feet tall. \"Nanotyrannus and T. rex are extremely different,\" said paleontologist and anatomist James Napoli of Stony Brook University in New York, co-author of the study. Nanotyrannus was a predator built for speed and agility, with long legs, a long snout with blade-like teeth and strong arms for manipulating prey. Tyrannosaurus was a colossal predator that was built for strength, with stocky legs, an enormous head, thick, banana-shaped teeth and greatly reduced arms. \"I suspect that these two species would have occasionally come into conflict, as predators tend to do, but the long legs of Nanotyrannus, and its small size, suggest that it mostly hunted smaller, faster prey than Tyrannosaurus,\" Napoli said. The researchers also determined that the Nanotyrannus specimens had sufficient anatomical differences to be divided into two separate species - Nanotyrannus lancensis and the newly named Nanotyrannus lethaeus. One of the Nanotyrannus fossils was part of the well-known \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" specimen, battling the horned dinosaur Triceratops at the time of death. Some scientific research into how Tyrannosaurus matured was based on the notion that the Nanotyrannus fossils represented T. rex juveniles, including studies that hypothesized that this apex predator experienced an extreme growth rate. \"For decades, paleontologists have unknowingly used Nanotyrannus specimens as a model for teenage T. rex to understand the biology of Earth's most famous dinosaur. Those studies need a second look,\" Zanno said. The finding that Nanotyrannus and Tyrannosaurus shared the same landscape, along with myriad plant-eating dinosaurs, offers the latest evidence that dinosaur diversity was rich prior to the asteroid impact 66 million years ago that ended the age of dinosaurs. \"This discovery shows us that dinosaurs continued to evolve, innovate and diversify right up until their reign was cut short. This fits into a growing body of evidence proving that dinosaurs were not declining for millions of years before they went extinct, contrary to what we once thought,\" Napoli said.",
