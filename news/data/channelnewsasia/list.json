            "title": "Warner Bros’ TV decline puts pressure on Netflix deal",
            "description": "Feb 26 : Warner Bros Discovery heaped an additional burden on Netflix's $82.7 billion bid for the movie studio and HBO. The entertainment company behind the buzzy series \"Heated Rivalry\" and the film \"Wuthering Heights\" reported fourth-quarter earnings Thursday that showed profit at its cable channels is deteriorating at a fast pace. The networks, which include CNN, the Discovery Network and TNT, are not part of Netflix’s deal. But their worth as a separately traded company is a key component in valuing the streaming service’s offer for the Warner Bros film and TV studios, its library, HBO and the HBO Max streaming service. Rival Paramount Skydance raised its proposal to buy all of Warner Bros to $110 billion. On Tuesday, the Warner board said it is negotiating with the rival bidder to determine whether the revised proposal could result in a deal superior to Netflix's offer.  Warner Bros Chief Executive David Zaslav did not address the discussions on a call with investors Thursday. Instead, he highlighted his role in sparking a bidding war for the coveted assets. \"We engaged with four bidders, which led to eight price increases, and have thus far achieved a 63 per cent increase in value versus the first offer received in September, delivering significant value to WBD shareholders throughout the process,\" Zaslav told investors. Warner's board had previously determined Netflix's offer was superior to Paramount's because investors would also receive the value of its planned spin-off of the television group, Discovery Global.  The division's revenue fell to $4.2 billion, down 12 per cent from a year earlier, and adjusted income dropped to $1.4 billion, a 27 per cent plunge from the same quarter a year earlier. Such declines affect the value of the TV networks as a standalone business, Discovery Global. Its closest comparison is Versant Media, the cable and digital assets separated from Comcast earlier this year. Versant's enterprise is worth roughly 3 times its 2025 forecast EBITDA of $2.1 billion. On the same yardstick, Discovery Global's market capitalization would be approximately $3 billion or a little over $1 per share, assuming $17 billion in net debt. Add that to Netflix's cash offer of $27.75 per share and it comes in shy of Paramount's bid of $31. Warner CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels declined to address that comparison. Netflix did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  HBO Max continued to grow, helped by series like \"Heated Rivalry\" and \"It: Welcome to Derry.\" Warner Bros added 3.5 million streaming subscribers in the quarter, bringing its total number worldwide to 131.6 million. The streaming group's revenue rose 5 per cent to nearly $2.8 billion, but adjusted earnings fell 4 per cent to $393 million due to the end of an unspecified distribution deal. \"The best thing for WBD shareholders is that it is being sold, because its fundamentals continue to deteriorate,\" wrote Needham & Co senior research analyst Laura Martin. Warner's stock was largely unchanged in early morning trading. Zaslav also highlighted the success of the Warner Bros film slate, including \"Wuthering Heights,\" \"A Minecraft Movie\" and \"Superman.\" \"We love the motion picture business,\" Zaslav said on the call. \"We at the company believe so deeply in the motion picture business, putting movies on the screen for shared experience ... Our commitment to the motion picture business is the core of our company.\" Netflix Chief Executive Ted Sarandos has defended his deal for the studio and HBO by affirming his commitment to releasing movies in theaters, a strategy that was never part of Netflix's DNA. Should Warner Bros board declare that Paramount's deal is superior, Netflix has four business days to revise its offer.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : A California woman is expected to testify in court on Thursday about how using Meta Platforms' Instagram and Google's YouTube as a child harmed her mental health, as her landmark trial in Los Angeles continues. The plaintiff, known as Kaley G.M. in court, began using Instagram at age 9 and YouTube at age 6 and says the platforms contributed to her depression and body dysmorphia. The companies sought to profit by hooking young children on their services despite knowing social media could harm their mental health, her lawyers say. Kaley G.M.'s testimony comes a day after her former psychotherapist said adolescent social media usage was a \"contributing factor\" to her mental health issues. The case is part of a broader global backlash against social media companies over alleged harms to children and teens. Australia has banned under-16s from such platforms, and other countries are considering similar restrictions. YouTube and Meta have denied the allegations and said evidence in the case does not support the woman's claims. The therapist was called by lawyers for the plaintiff to set the stage for the next phase of the trial, exploring whether and how Kaley's engagement with social media as a child affected her well-being. The beginning of the trial focused on what the companies knew about how social media affects children, and their business strategies related to younger users. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified the company discussed but never launched products for children. To win the case, Kaley's lawyers must show that the way the companies designed or operated the platforms was a substantial factor in causing or worsening her mental health issues.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : Google on Thursday unveiled a successor to its viral Nano Banana image generation model, touting faster performance as the search-engine behemoth pushes to attract more users to its AI tools. The model, called Nano Banana 2, is being rolled out across products, including the Gemini app, AI Mode and Lens features on Search, and Flow, its AI-powered video tool, the Alphabet-owned company said. The launch is Google's latest in a series of moves that have propelled the company to the forefront of the AI race, helping it better compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT after suffering a string of embarrassments initially. The success has fueled a 47 per cent surge in its stock in the past six months. Google rolled out the Nano Banana AI image editor in August, which quickly became a viral sensation, attracting 13 million first-time users to the Gemini app in just four days in September. By mid-October, it had generated more than 5 billion images. The tech giant followed that with the release of the upgraded Nano Banana Pro in November. Nano Banana 2 leans on Gemini's faster and cheaper models known as Flash, which allows quicker image generation and editing, Google said, adding that it also has better instruction-following capabilities and delivers sharper details. In November, Google released its Gemini 3 AI model, whose success prompted rival OpenAI to issue an internal \"code red\" to push teams to accelerate development. Gemini 3 has significantly boosted user engagement, helping the Gemini app capture more than 750 million monthly active users at the end of December.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : Apple urged a federal judge to dismiss a proposed class action claiming it defrauded shareholders twice, by overstating the artificial intelligence capabilities of its Siri voice assistant and falsely representing its compliance with an injunction governing commissions on app sales.   In a Wednesday filing in the San Jose, California, federal court, Apple said there was no proof it knew when discussing AI at a June 2024 conference that it would take longer than expected to incorporate two advanced AI features into Siri, potentially hurting iPhone 16 sales. The company delayed some Siri upgrades the following March, and Chief Executive Tim Cook said two months later that developing a \"more personal\" Siri was \"taking a bit longer than we thought.\" Apple also said it provided no assurance that its procedures designed to comply with a 2021 injunction, in a case brought by Epic Games, to let app users pay developers directly rather than have the company charge the developers hefty commissions would be foolproof. \"It is no secret that Apple faced challenges and weathered ups and downs in its stock price in 2025, like many major companies,\" Apple said. \"But plaintiff takes a massive and unsupported leap by claiming that securities fraud caused the temporary price drops.\" The lawsuit covers Apple shareholders who suffered potentially hundreds of billions of dollars of losses in the Cupertino, California-based company's stock between May 3, 2024 and May 1, 2025, the day after a judge said Apple was violating the injunction. Lawyers for shareholders led by South Korea's National Pension Service, the world's third largest pension fund with close to $1 trillion of assets, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Apple's injunction required the company to provide app users with external links for purchases, so developers wouldn't owe 30 per cent commissions for purchases in its App Store. The judge overseeing that case rebuked Apple for creating a new system that charged a 27 per cent commission on some external sales. A federal appeals court partially reversed her sanctions in December.",

            "description": "SAN JOSE, California, Feb 26 : Artificial intelligence chip designer Broadcom said that it expects to sell at least 1 million chips by 2027 based on its stacked design tech, an executive told Reuters on Wednesday. The forecast, which Reuters is the first to report, marks a new product and sales target for Broadcom that could represent a revenue stream potentially worth billions of dollars. Harish Bharadwaj, vice president of product marketing, said the 1 million chips the company projects it will sell are based on an approach Broadcom developed that stacks two chips on top of one another, allowing the distinct pieces of silicon to be tightly bound to improve the speed at which data can flow from one chip to another. The company has refined the technology over five years to the point where its first customer, Fujitsu, is making engineering samples to test the design. Fujitsu plans to produce the stacked, or 3D, chips later this year.  The million-chip figure includes several additional designs beyond the Fujitsu chip. The company's stacking approach gives its customers the ability to build chips that have more horsepower and use less energy to tackle the rapidly growing computing requirements AI software presents, Bharadwaj said. \"Now, pretty much all of our customers are adopting this technology,\" he said. Broadcom does not typically design entire AI chips itself. It works with companies such as Google for its tensor processing units (TPUs) and ChatGPT maker OpenAI for its in-house custom processors. The Broadcom engineers help translate an early design into the physical layout of a chip that can be fabricated by manufacturers such as TSMC. The company's chip business has grown significantly because of the custom deals with companies such as Google. Broadcom projected that its AI chip revenue would double year-over-year to $8.2 billion in its first fiscal quarter.  As a result, Broadcom has emerged as one of the most significant competitors to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, as it races to produce silicon that competes with the chip giants. Fujitsu is using the new tech for a data center chip. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is fabricating the chip using its cutting-edge 2-nanometer process and fusing it with a 5-nanometer chip. Companies can mix and match which manufacturing process TSMC uses with the Broadcom technology. TSMC fuses the top and bottom chip during the fabrication process.  Broadcom has several more designs in the works and expects to ship two more products based on the stacking tech in the second half of this year and to sample an additional three in 2027. The company spent roughly five years developing the groundwork for the stacked chip tech and testing various designs to come up with a commercial product. Engineers are working to make chips that have as many as eight stacks of two chips each.",

Xiaomi has been asked to pay $72 million in unpaid taxes on royalties, but it has challenged this at the Supreme Court in a case seen as a test of the country's legal framework for contract manufacturing. Flex is asking the Supreme Court to strike down the Indian Tax Tribunal order, which said Xiaomi's contract manufacturers \"willingly participated in the layering of transactions facilitating the evasion of taxes,\" Flex's court filing showed. U.S.-listed Flex told India's Supreme Court it did not help Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi to undervalue certain imports into India, the court filing showed. Flex's court filing said the Indian Tax Tribunal ruling could expose the contract manufacturer to \"extremely harsh penalties.\" Flex in India and Xiaomi did not immediately respond to requests for comment. India's customs authorities did not respond to requests for comment. Flextronics Technologies India, a subsidiary of Flex, was not \"involved in any manner in the transaction pertaining to royalty,\" the company told the court in its January 16 filing, which is not public but has been reviewed by Reuters. Xiaomi has said the implications of the tribunal's ruling are far-reaching as they indicate \"an implicit mistrust of the entire contract manufacturing industry\" in the country. In its Supreme Court challenge, Xiaomi argued that the tax tribunal erred by saying it was the \"beneficial owner\" of the components while requiring it to pay tax on the royalties. The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Indian government to respond to the legal challenges and it will take up the case next in April.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : American Bitcoin, backed by two of U.S. President Donald Trump's sons, swung to a fourth-quarter loss on Thursday amid a weakness in the digital assets space. Concerns over stretched valuations in artificial-intelligence stocks and uncertainty around the timing and scale of U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts have pressured risk assets, dragging bitcoin to quarterly lows and leaving many so-called digital asset treasury (DAT) companies on an unsteady footing. American Bitcoin, a miner of the world's largest cryptocurrency, sells it at a premium or holds for a surge in the price. However, in the reported quarter the sector saw a selloff with bitcoin tumbling nearly 23 per cent in the three months. The company runs industrial-scale mining operations, relying largely on infrastructure provided by Hut 8 to produce bitcoin at costs below prevailing market prices. Stocks of crypto treasury companies typically move in line with the token's price as shifts in prices directly affect the value of reserves. Shares of American Bitcoin, which was co-founded by Eric Trump and where Donald Trump is a stockholder, have lost nearly 22 per cent in the past twelve months. Sustained pressure on the shares of crypto treasury companies could complicate the ability of these firms to raise additional capital to mine more crypto tokens at an industrial scale, the crux of their business model. The company, however, holds over 6,000 bitcoin presently, up from the 5,401 they held at 2025 year-end, Eric Trump said in a statement. The company posted a net loss of $59.45 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a $3.48 million profit in the year ago period. The company had also reported a profit in the previous quarter. American Bitcoin reported revenue of $78.3 million in the three months ended December 31, compared with $64.2 million in the prior-year period. Analysts were expecting revenue of $79.6 million.",

            "description": "Feb 26 : Equinix and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board are close to reaching a deal to acquire atNorth, a pan-Nordic data-center operator backed by Partners Group, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. The deal, which may be announced in the coming days, could value atNorth at about $4 billion including debt, according to the report. CPPIB and Partners Group declined Reuters requests for comment, while Equinix did not immediately respond. Data-centre operator Equinix has been expanding aggressively to capture rising demand for digital infrastructure, while pension funds have been increasing exposure to data-center assets. Iceland-based atNorth operates data centres across Iceland, Denmark, Sweden and Finland, catering to hyperscale cloud, AI and high-performance computing customers. Private equity firm Partners Group acquired the business in 2022 for an undisclosed amount and has since supported its regional expansion.",
