UK IT leaders estimate that over half of all organisational communication (52% on average) still runs through email - yet 83% report suffering at least one email-related security incident, with nearly half (49%) hit in the past 12 months alone. On average, IT leaders say over a third of all security incidents (36%) are email-driven, underlining the inbox as a persistent national attack surface.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The strain is sharpest in sectors where accountability matters most. Government bodies are hit hardest, with 92% reporting an email-related breach and over half (56%) in the past year alone - raising concerns about the resilience of public services. UK IT leaders in finance (87%) and legal sectors (85%) also report exposure to these incidents, underlining how regulation-heavy industries are prime targets. In tech, where communication is spread more heavily across IM and collaboration tools, three-quarters (75%) still faced inbox breaches.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Exclaimer’s <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexclaimer.com%2Fresearch%2Fuk-business-email-report-2025%2F&amp;esheet=54330450&amp;newsitemid=20250930072124&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=The+UK+Business+Email+Report&amp;index=2&amp;md5=febd604a83c5e7312c34e55a1afdbc77\" rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\"><b>The UK Business Email Report</b></a><b> </b>- which surveyed 1,003 UK IT leaders including CIOs, CTOs, IT managers and security officers - reveals Britain’s inboxes now sit at the intersection of workplace productivity, security and compliance. With so much sensitive communication flowing through them, email is carrying more weight than ever - and without the correct guardrails in place, organisations risk slipping into “Mail Jail,” where each and every message can spark a security, compliance or reputational headache.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><b>Britain’s inboxes under pressure from attacks, regulation and… employee use?</b></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">When asked to name their biggest email security challenges, UK IT leaders put external threats such as phishing, spoofing and spam at the top of their list (cited by 42% of respondents). Almost as many highlighted the difficulty of balancing security with ease of use (39%) and ensuring strong encryption (38%). It underlines a balancing act: keeping inboxes secure without breaking their role as the country’s most indispensable comms tool.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><b>UK firms are stepping up inbox defences, but maturity varies by sector</b></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Despite challenges, over four in five UK IT leaders (81%) view one-to-one email as a critical comms channel - on par with IM and collaboration tools. It therefore comes as no surprise that UK enterprises are far from passive in the face of phishing and spoofing.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The most common defences now in place are employee security awareness training (cited by 47% of respondents) and email filtering (46%), with multi-factor authentication (41%) also widely adopted. More advanced measures such as AI-driven threat detection (38%) are gaining traction, signalling a gradual but broad shift towards layered protection.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Tech companies are furthest ahead, with strong adoption across every major safeguard, from filtering (cited by 63% of respondents) and training (59%) to MFA and AI detection (both 53%). In the public sector, adoption lags behind, but nearly half (44%) report using MFA - a sign of progress even as training (27%) and AI detection (26%) remain low.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><b>Email is not fading - it is evolving</b></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">UK IT leaders are clear that email’s role is far from fading. Nearly nine in ten (87%) expect it to remain a primary business communication tool for at least the next five years.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">But leaders are clear it won’t stand still. When asked which trends will have the biggest impact by 2030, the top three were stronger security and encryption standards (45%), tighter integration with real-time collaboration tools (41%) and AI-driven automation (41%). For heavily regulated industries, this signals a push to make the inbox more auditable and more tightly connected to compliance workflows. For technology, the emphasis is on automation and integration with the wider productivity stack.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Trust is also part of the picture. Almost nine in ten UK IT leaders (89%) agreed that well-managed email signatures directly contribute to professionalism and client confidence. In sectors where reputation is currency - from law firms to banks - this suggests organisations increasingly see the inbox as both a security risk and a brand asset.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Cary Vidal, VP of IT &amp; Security at Exclaimer, said: “Attackers go where the people - and the mistakes - are. Our data shows UK enterprises often still treat email as routine plumbing, yet it’s implicated in over a third of security incidents and rising. The answer is to apply layered controls, automate the basics and build trust into every message. That’s how organisations turn the inbox from their weakest link into a source of security, compliance and professionalism.”</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><b>Resources:</b></p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><li>Download the full <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexclaimer.com%2Fresearch%2Fuk-business-email-report-2025%2F&amp;esheet=54330450&amp;newsitemid=20250930072124&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=The+UK+Business+Email&amp;index=3&amp;md5=54ccda8e664f5e8b7f5943344fbf5f91\" rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\"><i>The UK Business Email</i></a> Report</li></ul><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><b>Methodology: </b>This report is based on original research commissioned by Exclaimer in partnership with Censuswide and Clarity, aiming to understand how IT leaders are managing the evolution of business email.

The survey explored individuals’ cybersecurity habits in both their workplace and personal lives. It also examined the dangers of weak security practices, and evaluated the growing concerns around emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their implications for both organizational and individual security.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">“Our survey revealed a disconnect. Individuals are complacent about securing their own online accounts, and organizations appear slow to adopt security best practices,” said Ronnie Manning, chief brand advocate, Yubico. “It’s not surprising that phishing continues to be one of the easiest ways for hackers to get in, and in fact 44% of survey respondents said they have interacted with a phishing message in the last year. To close the gap, strong, phishing-resistant authentication, education and action must go hand-in-hand.”</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The survey revealed a growing disconnect between how secure is perceived and what actual cybersecurity habits are, particularly around password use and MFA. At the same time, concern over AI-driven threats is rising sharply, and trust in hardware-based authentication methods, like security keys and passkeys, is steadily increasing, especially in the UK and the US.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Key global findings include:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><li>44% of all participants admitted to having interacted with a phishing message in the last year, an alarming indicator of continued vulnerability to social engineering attacks.<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\"><li>Gen Z stands out as the most susceptible demographic to phishing, with 62% reporting engagement (i.e. clicking a link, opening an attachment, etc.) with a phishing scam in the past year, significantly higher than other age groups.</li></ul></li><li>70% believe phishing attempts have become more successful due to the use of AI, and 78% believe they have become more sophisticated.</li><li>In fact, when shown a phishing email, 54% either believed it was an authentic message written by a human or were unsure.<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\"><li>Interestingly, age did not seem to play a role in awareness, as there were no significant differences between generations in being able to correctly recognize the phishing attempt (Gen Z 45%, millennials 47%, Gen X and baby boomers, both 46%), highlighting the fact that no group is exempt from needing extra cyber-caution in the age of AI.</li></ul></li><li>Only 48% of respondents said their company uses MFA across all apps and services, and 40% reported never having received cybersecurity training from their employer.</li><li>Despite low confidence in usernames and passwords (only 26% consider them to be the most secure), they remain the most common authentication method: used by 56% for work accounts and 60% for personal accounts.</li><li>29% of respondents still don’t have MFA set up for their personal email accounts even though they are used to login to their most critical online assets, including:<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\"><li>Social media accounts (47%)</li><li>Banking services (41%)</li><li>Mobile phone carriers (34%)</li></ul></li></ul><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">When compared to last year’s <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fresource%2Fglobal-authentication-survey-2024%2F&amp;esheet=54331618&amp;newsitemid=20250930803982&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=2024+Global+State+of+Authentication+survey&amp;index=1&amp;md5=7cef1cb83b85b15be947429c4f8863c5\" rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">2024 Global State of Authentication survey</a> from Yubico, the 2025 edition reveals significant year-over-year shifts in user behavior and perceptions across key markets.</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><li>In France, one of the most remarkable developments was the sharp increase in the adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for personal accounts.<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\"><li>Usage jumped from 29% in 2024 to 71% in 2025, marking a 42-percentage point surge.</li><li>This suggests a major improvement in personal cybersecurity practices among French users and growing acceptance of more secure login methods.</li></ul></li><li>AI has emerged as a growing area of concern globally, with marked increases in apprehension about its potential to compromise the security of both personal and business accounts.<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\"><li>Japan: 31% concerned in 2024 vs. 74% in 2025 (43 percentage point increase).</li><li>Sweden: 37% concerned in 2024 vs. 68% in 2025 (31 percentage point increase).</li><li>UK: 61% concerned in 2024 vs. 81% in 2025 (20 percentage point increase).</li><li>US: 61% concerned in 2024 vs. 77% in 2025 (16 percentage point increase).</li></ul></li><li>Meanwhile, confidence in advanced authentication methods is growing, particularly in the use of hardware security keys and device bound passkeys.<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\"><li>In the UK, 37% of respondents now believe these tools are the most secure authentication methods, up from 17% in 2024, a 20-point increase.</li><li>The U.S. reflected similar growth, with 34% identifying hardware security keys/passkeys as the most secure option, up from 18% last year (16-point increase).</li></ul></li></ul><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">“As cyber threats become more sophisticated, the good news is the survey reveals that stronger, more secure authentication methods like device-bound passkeys, like those on a YubiKey, are gaining momentum around the world,” said Manning. “Both individuals and organizations have the power to protect themselves by adopting these phishing-resistant solutions today. Modern MFA is clearly no longer just a “nice to have” and has quickly become essential for staying secure in our rapidly changing digital landscape.”</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">To explore the full survey results and discover practical recommendations, download the detailed report overview <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fresource%2Fglobal-state-of-authentication-survey-2025-perception-vs-reality%2F&amp;esheet=54331618&amp;newsitemid=20250930803982&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=here&amp;index=2&amp;md5=c9093779334eebcf5cdb74c77da36ff8\" rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, view the infographic <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fresources.yubico.com%2F53ZDUYE6%2Fat%2Fcxgm6p8sptr6qxrhq583j8z%2FEnglish_1.png%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26format%3Dpng&amp;esheet=54331618&amp;newsitemid=20250930803982&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=here&amp;index=3&amp;md5=8382860dbe53dd7d1343a8d631a8b754\" rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and read our in-depth blog post <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fblog%2F2025-global-state-of-authentication-survey-a-world-of-difference-in-cybersecurity-habits%2F&amp;esheet=54331618&amp;newsitemid=20250930803982&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=here&amp;index=4&amp;md5=cbcbb20d48ec1c548bb6d2e66f319f77\" rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

It also examined the dangers of weak security practices, and evaluated the growing concerns around emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their implications for both organizational and individual security.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">“Our survey revealed a disconnect. Individuals are complacent about securing their own online accounts, and organizations appear slow to adopt security best practices,” said Ronnie Manning, chief brand advocate, Yubico. “It’s not surprising that phishing continues to be one of the easiest ways for hackers to get in, and in fact 44% of survey respondents said they have interacted with a phishing message in the last year. To close the gap, strong, phishing-resistant authentication, education and action must go hand-in-hand.”</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The survey revealed a growing disconnect between how secure is perceived and what actual cybersecurity habits are, particularly around password use and MFA. At the same time, concern over AI-driven threats is rising sharply, and trust in hardware-based authentication methods, like security keys and passkeys, is steadily increasing, especially in the UK and the US.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Key global findings include:</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><li>44% of all participants admitted to having interacted with a phishing message in the last year, an alarming indicator of continued vulnerability to social engineering attacks.<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\"><li>Gen Z stands out as the most susceptible demographic to phishing, with 62% reporting engagement (i.e. clicking a link, opening an attachment, etc.) with a phishing scam in the past year, significantly higher than other age groups.</li></ul></li><li>70% believe phishing attempts have become more successful due to the use of AI, and 78% believe they have become more sophisticated.</li><li>In fact, when shown a phishing email, 54% either believed it was an authentic message written by a human or were unsure.<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\"><li>Interestingly, age did not seem to play a role in awareness, as there were no significant differences between generations in being able to correctly recognize the phishing attempt (Gen Z 45%, millennials 47%, Gen X and baby boomers, both 46%), highlighting the fact that no group is exempt from needing extra cyber-caution in the age of AI.</li></ul></li><li>Only 48% of respondents said their company uses MFA across all apps and services, and 40% reported never having received cybersecurity training from their employer.</li><li>Despite low confidence in usernames and passwords (only 26% consider them to be the most secure), they remain the most common authentication method: used by 56% for work accounts and 60% for personal accounts.</li><li>29% of respondents still don’t have MFA set up for their personal email accounts even though they are used to login to their most critical online assets, including:<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\"><li>Social media accounts (47%)</li><li>Banking services (41%)</li><li>Mobile phone carriers (34%)</li></ul></li></ul><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">When compared to last year’s <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fresource%2Fglobal-authentication-survey-2024%2F&amp;esheet=54331619&amp;newsitemid=20250930434197&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=2024+Global+State+of+Authentication+survey&amp;index=1&amp;md5=49a5584063a8b7cebcc1acd7bbb65623\" rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">2024 Global State of Authentication survey</a> from Yubico, the 2025 edition reveals significant year-over-year shifts in user behavior and perceptions across key markets.</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><li>In France, one of the most remarkable developments was the sharp increase in the adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for personal accounts.<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\"><li>Usage jumped from 29% in 2024 to 71% in 2025, marking a 42-percentage point surge.</li><li>This suggests a major improvement in personal cybersecurity practices among French users and growing acceptance of more secure login methods.</li></ul></li><li>AI has emerged as a growing area of concern globally, with marked increases in apprehension about its potential to compromise the security of both personal and business accounts.<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\"><li>Japan: 31% concerned in 2024 vs. 74% in 2025 (43 percentage point increase).</li><li>Sweden: 37% concerned in 2024 vs. 68% in 2025 (31 percentage point increase).</li><li>UK: 61% concerned in 2024 vs. 81% in 2025 (20 percentage point increase).</li><li>US: 61% concerned in 2024 vs. 77% in 2025 (16 percentage point increase).</li></ul></li><li>Meanwhile, confidence in advanced authentication methods is growing, particularly in the use of hardware security keys and device bound passkeys.<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\"><li>In the UK, 37% of respondents now believe these tools are the most secure authentication methods, up from 17% in 2024, a 20-point increase.</li><li>The U.S. reflected similar growth, with 34% identifying hardware security keys/passkeys as the most secure option, up from 18% last year (16-point increase).</li></ul></li></ul><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">“As cyber threats become more sophisticated, the good news is the survey reveals that stronger, more secure authentication methods like device-bound passkeys, like those on a YubiKey, are gaining momentum around the world,” said Manning. “Both individuals and organizations have the power to protect themselves by adopting these phishing-resistant solutions today. Modern MFA is clearly no longer just a “nice to have” and has quickly become essential for staying secure in our rapidly changing digital landscape.”</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">To explore the full survey results and discover practical recommendations, download the detailed report overview <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fresource%2Fglobal-state-of-authentication-survey-2025-perception-vs-reality%2F&amp;esheet=54331619&amp;newsitemid=20250930434197&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=here&amp;index=2&amp;md5=780012eeadac55aa124820b8c1b97821\" rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, view the infographic <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fresources.yubico.com%2F53ZDUYE6%2Fat%2Fcxgm6p8sptr6qxrhq583j8z%2FEnglish_1.png%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26format%3Dpng&amp;esheet=54331619&amp;newsitemid=20250930434197&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=here&amp;index=3&amp;md5=f86f769f1fcc03fc0eff2c6c3ec594ab\" rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and read our in-depth blog post <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fblog%2F2025-global-state-of-authentication-survey-a-world-of-difference-in-cybersecurity-habits%2F&amp;esheet=54331619&amp;newsitemid=20250930434197&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=here&amp;index=4&amp;md5=2ae0106e954d44a5093d2f956b1713e9\" rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

(TX) and Seven-Eleven Japan Co., Ltd. (SEJ) have entered into a partnership to jointly develop, validate, and introduce humanoid robots powered by generative AI. The initiative will advance the creation of “Astra,” a humanoid robot equipped with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) foundation model, with deployment in Seven-Eleven stores targeted for 2029.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><b><i>“Shaping the Future of Retail”</i></b></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">By implementing Astra in real store environments, TX and SEJ aim to provide solutions to rising labor costs and workforce shortages, while redefining the customer experience. Robots will take on routine in-store operations, allowing employees to focus on services that only humans can deliver—strengthening store appeal and creating new value for customers.</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><li><b>Background and scope of the Partnership</b></li></ul><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">As labor shortages and operational challenges intensify across the retail sector, Seven-Eleven has continued to invest in automation and labor-saving technologies. This partnership builds upon those efforts, aiming not only to improve efficiency but also to transform the very role of employees in convenience stores.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The partnership focuses on three major initiatives:</p><ol class=\"bwlistdecimal\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><li>Identifying retail operations suitable for automation and verifying their effectiveness.</li><li>Developing humanoid hardware tailored to real-world store challenges.</li><li>Collecting and building large-scale robot operation datasets to advance VLA training and deployment.</li></ol><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">In collaboration with the AI Robot Association (AIRoA)—whose leadership includes Professor Tetsuya Ogata (Waseda University), Professor Yutaka Matsuo (University of Tokyo), Toyota Motor Corporation, and TX—the partnership will accelerate dataset development and practical implementation of AI-powered robots.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><b><i>“Leveraging Large-Scale Real-World Motion Data”</i></b></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">TX already operates a large-scale data collection platform through its beverage restocking robot, Ghost. By integrating TX’s data collection platform with SEJ’s vast store operation of more than 20,000 stores, the partnership will create unparalleled training resources for VLA models. This will enable end-to-end integration of perception, planning, and control—bringing humanoid robots into practical use faster and at greater scale than any competitor.</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><li><b>About Telexistence</b></li></ul><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Telexistence Inc. pursues the mission of “Grasping every single object in the world.” By focusing on the retail and logistics sectors, TX combines robotics and AI to develop and operate practical robots that reshape both daily life and industrial structures.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Recruitment Information:<br/>1. <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjobs.lever.co%2Ftx-inc.com%2F059337c4-e4ca-4821-99fe-2b849cc6edb0&amp;esheet=54330741&amp;newsitemid=20250929797616&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Electronic+Engineer%2C+Logistics+Team&amp;index=1&amp;md5=be3ece3b4d244b9161420935aeeb7d23\" rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">Electronic Engineer, Logistics Team </a><br/>2. <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjobs.lever.co%2Ftx-inc.com%2F728a0ead-f423-4c3d-9b7f-2c679e8368c8&amp;esheet=54330741&amp;newsitemid=20250929797616&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Hardware+Engineer%2C+Logistics+Team&amp;index=2&amp;md5=fc709a38d8957567ed3d2be72cd010bb\" rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">Hardware Engineer, Logistics Team </a><br/>3. <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjobs.lever.co%2Ftx-inc.com%2F4ad6bd7a-f422-4a2e-90f4-597df67e53f6&amp;esheet=54330741&amp;newsitemid=20250929797616&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Head+of+Hardware+Engineering%2C+Humanoid+Team&amp;index=3&amp;md5=6e23f65a60bd10a3e4067dbf39dcd925\" rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">Head of Hardware Engineering, Humanoid Team </a><br/>4. <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjobs.lever.co%2Ftx-inc.com%2Fab280654-8bca-4335-9744-aa2ef4e66d66&amp;esheet=54330741&amp;newsitemid=20250929797616&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Head+of+Robotics+System+Engineering%2C+Humanoid+Team&amp;index=4&amp;md5=eef099464b2645e95eb6e4dada5bdad8\" rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">Head of Robotics System Engineering, Humanoid Team </a><br/>5. <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjobs.lever.co%2Ftx-inc.com%2Fb9e7e696-a6be-4bc1-9d02-7cef28cd5f5b&amp;esheet=54330741&amp;newsitemid=20250929797616&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Robotics+Foundation+Model+Engineer%2C+Foundation+Model+Team&amp;index=5&amp;md5=6ce3c7793993ad7659905e4ff2238944\" rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">Robotics Foundation Model Engineer, Foundation Model Team </a><br/>6. <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjobs.lever.co%2Ftx-inc.com%2F4f2d0c6c-0c2e-43d2-9901-5725fa2e4b66&amp;esheet=54330741&amp;newsitemid=20250929797616&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Robotics+System+Integration+Engineer%2C+Foundation+Model+Team&amp;index=6&amp;md5=0b2832744f9bbe66bde18ec581e02862\" rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">Robotics System Integration Engineer, Foundation Model Team </a><br/>Other Job Openings: <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjobs.lever.co%2Ftx-inc.com&amp;esheet=54330741&amp;newsitemid=20250929797616&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fjobs.lever.co%2Ftx-inc.com&amp;index=7&amp;md5=fd64069819c243b2af7d44f58d7bdc87\" rel=\"nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">https://jobs.lever.co/tx-inc.com</a></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><span class=\"bwct31415\"></span></p></div></div>",
