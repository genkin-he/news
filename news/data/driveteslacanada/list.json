            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Tesla has introduced a new incentive for American drivers looking to switch from gasoline to electric: 2,000 free Supercharging miles when trading in a gas-powered vehicle for a new <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/tesla/\">Tesla</a>. The promotion, available for both purchases and leases, is designed to make the transition to electric mobility more appealing — though it currently applies only in the United States.</p>\n<p>The offer highlights Tesla’s ongoing effort to encourage drivers to experience its industry-leading charging network, which now includes over 70,000 Supercharger connectors worldwide. Once drivers trade in their gas vehicle and take delivery of a new Tesla, the company will automatically credit their account with the free mileage, allowing for cost-free charging during early ownership.</p>\n<p>“Never pay for gas again,” Tesla says in an email to customers, emphasizing the savings and simplicity of electric ownership. The promotion encourages drivers to envision cross-country trips powered entirely by electricity, supported by Tesla’s integrated navigation system and in-car entertainment features such as Caraoke, Tesla Theater, and Trip Planner.</p>\n<p>The 2,000 free miles roughly equate to around 800–1,000 kWh of electricity, depending on driving efficiency and model, providing up to 3,200 kilometres (2,000 miles) of free travel. Drivers can use these credits at any Tesla Supercharger location across the network, though the offer is time-limited, and the Supercharging miles expire two years after delivery.</p>\n<p>At this time, there is no equivalent offer for Canadian buyers, where Tesla’s trade-in and Supercharging programs operate separately. That gap may disappoint Canadian customers, but Tesla is offering us <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-3000-discount-pre-tariff-model-3-inventory-canada/\">$3,000 off inventory Model 3s</a> and <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/model-y/tesla-lowers-financing-and-lease-rates-for-model-y-in-canada/\">low-interest financing and lease rates on the Model Y</a>.</p>\n \n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

This feature transforms the six-seat electric SUV into a mobile power source capable of supplying electricity using Tesla’s Outlet Adapter, which will be released at a later, so far unannounced, date.</p>\n<p>Tesla has previously announced the Model Y Performance has the hardware to support V2L, but the feature has not yet been activated. The Model Y L is the first variant in Tesla’s global lineup to have official software support for it, suggesting that broader rollout could follow once adapter hardware becomes available.</p>\n<p>V2L allows owners to draw power directly from their vehicle’s high-voltage battery, typically offering up to 3.6 kW to 9.6 kW of output depending on configuration. Similar functionality has been included in other EVs from the likes of Hyundai and Kia, whose Ioniq 5 and EV6 models can charge e-bikes, laptops, or even other EVs.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-additional-features-in-version-2025-32-300\">Additional Features in Version 2025.32.300</h3>\n<p>Beyond V2L, the update includes several smaller but useful improvements for Chinese Model Y L owners that have already been released in North America:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Rave Cave Improvements: User profiles can now save lighting and sound configurations, automatically switching when different drivers log in.</li>\n<li>Expanded Dog Mode: The minimum temperature can now be lowered to 18°C, providing greater comfort flexibility for pets left in the car.</li>\n<li>Low Power Mode: New settings allow drivers to automatically disable power-hungry features when battery levels fall below a user-defined threshold.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "title": "Saskatoon Ends Free EV Charging, Introduces $5.35 per Hour Fee",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Saskatoon has officially pulled the plug on free electric vehicle (EV) charging at its two city-owned stations, introducing a $5.35 per hour fee that took effect Thursday. The new rate applies to the Level 2 chargers located at the Lakewood and Lawson civic centres — and it’s already raising eyebrows for being significantly higher than typical public charging costs elsewhere in Canada.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-rates-far-above-national-average\">Rates Far Above National Average</h3>\n<p>The price point has sparked debate, as SaskPower estimates that the average cost to charge at a Level 2 station is between $1 and $2.50 per hour. By comparison, other major cities charge far less: Toronto offers Level 2 charging for $2 per hour or a $3 flat overnight rate, while Calgary provides access to its 70 city-run chargers for free beyond regular parking fees.</p>\n<p>In the Vancouver area rates typically fall between $1.50 and $3 per hour. That means Saskatoon’s new rate of $5.35 per hour is roughly double to five times higher than what most EV drivers across Canada pay.</p>\n<p>At that price, a typical three-hour charging session — common for Level 2 stations — would cost about $16, compared to $4 to $8 in most other regions. The move makes Saskatoon’s chargers among the most expensive municipally operated Level 2 stations in the country.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-city-moves-to-cut-subsidy-costs\">City Moves to Cut Subsidy Costs</h3>\n<p>The change comes after Saskatoon City Council voted in August to implement the fee as part of its ongoing effort to reduce the municipal subsidy required to maintain the chargers. According to a city report, Saskatoon spent approximately $100,000 in 2023 to launch the chargers under a pilot project linked to its low-emissions community plan. The goal was to encourage EV adoption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. <em>(via <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/electric-vehicles-charging-stations-emissions-9.6960144\">CBC</a></em>)</p>\n<p>However, operating costs have proven steep. The city says it costs roughly $21,400 a year to keep the stations running — with about $12,000 of that spent on staff and maintenance. Council ultimately chose the highest of five proposed fee options, citing the need to recover as much of those costs as possible.</p>\n<p>Even with the new $5.35 per hour fee, officials estimate the city will still need to subsidize between $4,000 and $8,000 annually to operate the two sites.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-councillors-split-on-decision\">Councillors Split on Decision</h3>\n<p>Not all council members supported the steep fee increase. Councillors Jasmin Parker and Kathryn MacDonald voted against the measure, suggesting more modest rates of $2 or $3 per hour could have balanced accessibility with cost recovery.</p>\n<p>Despite the controversy, council also endorsed exploring third-party operation of the charging stations to further reduce taxpayer burden.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-growing-ev-demand-in-saskatoon\">Growing EV Demand in Saskatoon</h3>\n<p>While the new fees may discourage casual users, demand for electric vehicles in Saskatoon continues to rise. The number of registered EVs and hybrids in the city has soared from just 18 in 2018 to more than 500 by last year.</p>\n<p>The $5.35 per hour fee applies around the clock, including weekends and holidays.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

Tesla’s investigation found that in certain cases technicians mistakenly applied BetaSeal primer on the windshield and BetaPrime on the light bar itself, instead of the reverse. </p>\n<p>The improper bonding could cause partial delamination or complete detachment while driving.</p>\n<p>Owners may notice rattling noises inside the cabin, see a visible gap between the light bar and the windshield, or feel the light bar move when touched. Tesla estimates that about 10 percent of the recalled vehicles are affected by the defect.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-fix\">The Fix</h3>\n<p>Tesla Service will inspect each vehicle free of charge.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Saskatchewan’s opposition politicians are taking aim at SaskPower’s decision to spend over $100,000 on internet services from <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/starlink-offers-free-service-to-canadians-affected-by-wildfires/\">Starlink</a>. The expense was revealed in the province’s 2024–25 Crown corporation payee disclosure report released this week, which showed SaskPower paid $114,428 to Starlink Internet during the fiscal year.</p>\n<p>The revelation has drawn criticism from New Democratic Party (NDP) MLA Erika Ritchie, who questioned why a provincial Crown corporation would rely on an American company rather than supporting local providers.</p>\n<p>“We know that we have a world-class Crown corporation, SaskTel, that offers connectivity services. We’re wondering why this Crown has elected to go to a foreign company to receive services,” Ritchie said, also taking issue with Musk’s political ties in the United States.</p>\n<p>SaskPower’s parent agency, the Crown Investments Corporation (CIC), defended the use of Starlink as a necessary measure to ensure safety and communication in remote parts of the province, pointing out that SaskTel’s network cannot reach these areas. In a written statement, the CIC noted that Starlink’s satellite service plays an essential role in maintaining connectivity for workers in isolated areas, especially for emergencies such as medical situations.</p>\n<p>“Even with significant investments in broadband and 5G expansion, there are areas in Saskatchewan where SaskTel cannot provide cellular or internet service,” the statement read. “In these instances, including where life and safety could be at risk, arrangements are made to ensure employees have access to satellite services provided by Starlink.” <em>(via <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/regina/article/saskpower-paid-starlink-more-than-100000-in-2024-25-documents-show/\">CTV News</a>)</em></p>\n<p>Saskatchewan is not the first province to rely on Starlink for essential operations. Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, for instance, paid roughly $200,000 for Starlink service in 2024 as part of its communications program for remote sites. <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/british-columbia-government-utilizes-spacex-starlink-for-enhanced-connectivity/\">British Columbia is also a Starlink customer</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/quebec-adds-more-funds-to-starlink-subsidy-program/\">Quebec </a>and <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/alberta-launches-pilot-program-to-bring-starlink-internet-to-rural-communities/\">Alberta</a>.</p>\n<p>While critics argue that relying on a U.S. billionaire’s company undermines Canadian technological sovereignty, supporters point out that no domestic provider can currently match Starlink’s reach and reliability in hard-to-access areas.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

Power and cooling would already be handled by the cars’ existing systems, making the idea theoretically efficient and scalable.</p>\n<p>As with many of Musk’s forward-looking statements, the distributed AI fleet idea has drawn a variety of responses. Supporters see it as a revolutionary way to monetize idle vehicle hardware, while critics question whether owners would agree to let their cars participate in such a system.</p>\n<p>If the opportunity arose, would you be comfortable letting your car become part of a global computing network while it sits in your driveway? Let us know in the comments below.</p>\n \n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

Duffy, who is also the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, hinted that the agency could reopen the contract to allow competitors such as Blue Origin to propose faster alternatives.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-defending-progress-amid-delays\">Defending Progress Amid Delays</h3>\n<p>Despite scrutiny over delays, SpaceX defended its progress on Starship’s development, highlighting “dozens of milestones” already achieved under its $4 billion Human Landing System (HLS) contract. The company is preparing for a long-duration flight test in 2026 and continues to develop the Starship crew cabin that will eventually ferry astronauts to and from the lunar surface.</p>\n<p>Starship’s lunar missions will rely on a critical new capability: in-space refueling. This process involves multiple Starship “tanker” flights filling the lunar-bound spacecraft with fuel in orbit — a complex operation that has never been demonstrated before. </p>\n<p>SpaceX now expects to conduct this refueling test in 2026, following additional flight tests using an upgraded V3 Starship prototype.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nasa-s-race-against-time-and-rivals\">NASA’s Race Against Time and Rivals</h3>\n<p>NASA’s Artemis program aims to return astronauts to the Moon for the first time since 1972. SpaceX was selected in 2021 to provide the lander for the Artemis III and IV missions, while Blue Origin secured a separate contract for later missions. </p>\n<p>However, concerns about timeline slippage and internal political challenges have led NASA to reconsider its strategy as China accelerates its own lunar plans.</p>\n<p>Duffy’s comments last week highlighted NASA’s growing frustration with development delays, noting that the agency “cannot afford to fall behind” as other nations advance their moonshot programs. Elon Musk responded with criticism of Duffy on social media, escalating tensions between the agency and SpaceX.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-starship-s-role-in-the-artemis-program\">Starship’s Role in the Artemis Program</h3>\n<p>SpaceX maintains that Starship remains the fastest and most capable vehicle for the Artemis program. “Starship continues to simultaneously be the fastest path to returning humans to the surface of the Moon and a core enabler of the Artemis program’s goal to establish a permanent, sustainable presence on the lunar surface,” the company said.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",
