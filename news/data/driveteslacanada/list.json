            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/hyundai/\">Hyundai </a>has officially launched the ELEXIO, a new all-electric SUV designed exclusively for the Chinese market, with a starting price that undercuts nearly every major EV competitor. Priced from just US$16,800 (C$23,550), the ELEXIO combines long range, high-tech features, and family-focused practicality — but despite its appeal, North American buyers won’t be able to get one.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-designed-for-families\">Designed for Families</h3>\n<p>Built on Hyundai’s E-GMP dedicated EV platform—the same foundation used for the <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/ioniq-5/\">Ioniq 5</a> and <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/ioniq-6/\">Ioniq 6</a>—the ELEXIO blends high performance with family practicality. It comes in three trims: Fun, Smart, and Tech, each powered by a single electric motor producing up to 215 horsepower and offering between 518 and 722 kilometres (321-448 miles) of range under China’s CLTC testing cycle.</p>\n<p>The ELEXIO’s exterior features “lucky crystal” daytime running lights shaped like the number 8, symbolizing fortune in Chinese culture. The cabin is designed around a 27-inch 4K widescreen display, replacing the traditional instrument cluster entirely. Hyundai says this minimalist setup, combined with a two-tone steering wheel, Bose audio system, and Dolby Atmos support, offers a premium feel at an entry-level price.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\" data-carousel-extra='{\"blog_id\":1,\"permalink\":\"https:\\/\\/driveteslacanada.ca\\/news\\/hyundai-launches-sub-20k-elexio-electric-suv-but-north-america-wont-get-it\\/\"}'>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"mk01\" class=\"wp-image-110061\" data-attachment-id=\"110061\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-id=\"110061\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Credit: Hyundai&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"mk03\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mk03.jpg?fit=975%2C649&amp;ssl=1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mk03.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mk03.jpg?fit=1600%2C1066&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1066\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/hyundai-launches-sub-20k-elexio-electric-suv-but-north-america-wont-get-it/attachment/mk03/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"649\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mk03.jpg?resize=975%2C649&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mk03.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mk03.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mk03.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mk03.jpg?resize=1536%2C1023&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mk03.jpg?resize=998%2C665&amp;ssl=1 998w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mk03.jpg?resize=670%2C446&amp;ssl=1 670w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mk03.jpg?resize=1340%2C894&amp;ssl=1 1340w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mk03.jpg?resize=272%2C182&amp;ssl=1 272w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mk03.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" width=\"975\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Hyundai</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n<p>Additional touches like dual wireless charging pads, a panoramic sunroof, and 46 storage compartments reinforce its focus on comfort and convenience.

            "title": "Saskatoon Ends Free EV Charging, Introduces $5.35 per Hour Fee",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Saskatoon has officially pulled the plug on free electric vehicle (EV) charging at its two city-owned stations, introducing a $5.35 per hour fee that took effect Thursday. The new rate applies to the Level 2 chargers located at the Lakewood and Lawson civic centres — and it’s already raising eyebrows for being significantly higher than typical public charging costs elsewhere in Canada.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-rates-far-above-national-average\">Rates Far Above National Average</h3>\n<p>The price point has sparked debate, as SaskPower estimates that the average cost to charge at a Level 2 station is between $1 and $2.50 per hour. By comparison, other major cities charge far less: Toronto offers Level 2 charging for $2 per hour or a $3 flat overnight rate, while Calgary provides access to its 70 city-run chargers for free beyond regular parking fees.</p>\n<p>In the Vancouver area rates typically fall between $1.50 and $3 per hour. That means Saskatoon’s new rate of $5.35 per hour is roughly double to five times higher than what most EV drivers across Canada pay.</p>\n<p>At that price, a typical three-hour charging session — common for Level 2 stations — would cost about $16, compared to $4 to $8 in most other regions. The move makes Saskatoon’s chargers among the most expensive municipally operated Level 2 stations in the country.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-city-moves-to-cut-subsidy-costs\">City Moves to Cut Subsidy Costs</h3>\n<p>The change comes after Saskatoon City Council voted in August to implement the fee as part of its ongoing effort to reduce the municipal subsidy required to maintain the chargers. According to a city report, Saskatoon spent approximately $100,000 in 2023 to launch the chargers under a pilot project linked to its low-emissions community plan. The goal was to encourage EV adoption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. <em>(via <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/electric-vehicles-charging-stations-emissions-9.6960144\">CBC</a></em>)</p>\n<p>However, operating costs have proven steep. The city says it costs roughly $21,400 a year to keep the stations running — with about $12,000 of that spent on staff and maintenance. Council ultimately chose the highest of five proposed fee options, citing the need to recover as much of those costs as possible.</p>\n<p>Even with the new $5.35 per hour fee, officials estimate the city will still need to subsidize between $4,000 and $8,000 annually to operate the two sites.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-councillors-split-on-decision\">Councillors Split on Decision</h3>\n<p>Not all council members supported the steep fee increase. Councillors Jasmin Parker and Kathryn MacDonald voted against the measure, suggesting more modest rates of $2 or $3 per hour could have balanced accessibility with cost recovery.</p>\n<p>Despite the controversy, council also endorsed exploring third-party operation of the charging stations to further reduce taxpayer burden.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-growing-ev-demand-in-saskatoon\">Growing EV Demand in Saskatoon</h3>\n<p>While the new fees may discourage casual users, demand for electric vehicles in Saskatoon continues to rise. The number of registered EVs and hybrids in the city has soared from just 18 in 2018 to more than 500 by last year.</p>\n<p>The $5.35 per hour fee applies around the clock, including weekends and holidays.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Tesla has issued a rare physical recall for one of its vehicles, this time involving more than 6,000 <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/category/cybertruck/\">Cybertrucks</a> equipped with an off-road light bar that could detach while driving and create a hazard for other users on the road.</p>\n<p>According to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recall documents, 6,197 model-year 2024 Cybertrucks built at Giga Texas between November 13, 2023, and November 5, 2024 are impacted. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-issue\">The Issue</h3>\n<p>Tesla explains that the off-road light bar accessory—manufactured by Hella Romania S.R.L.—was attached to some Cybertrucks with the wrong combination of adhesive primers. Tesla’s investigation found that in certain cases technicians mistakenly applied BetaSeal primer on the windshield and BetaPrime on the light bar itself, instead of the reverse. </p>\n<p>The improper bonding could cause partial delamination or complete detachment while driving.</p>\n<p>Owners may notice rattling noises inside the cabin, see a visible gap between the light bar and the windshield, or feel the light bar move when touched. Tesla estimates that about 10 percent of the recalled vehicles are affected by the defect.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-fix\">The Fix</h3>\n<p>Tesla Service will inspect each vehicle free of charge. If the light bar shows delamination or damage, it will be replaced using adhesive tape and a new mechanical attachment bracket anchored to the vehicle structure. If the bar is intact, technicians will retrofit it with the same bracket system to prevent detachment.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-the-issue-was-discovered\">How the Issue Was Discovered</h3>\n<p>Tesla’s Field Quality team first flagged adhesion irregularities on February 3, 2025, during routine monitoring of repairs. Despite multiple service-manual updates and technician reminders through the spring, additional reports surfaced through the summer, prompting Tesla to launch an engineering study in August.</p>\n<p>Chemical analysis completed on October 14, 2025, confirmed the root cause, and Tesla voluntarily initiated the recall six days later. The automaker has documented 619 warranty claims and one field report potentially related to the defect but says it is not aware of any crashes, injuries, or fatalities.</p>\n<p>Transport Canada has not yet issued a similar recall. You can read the full NHTSA recall below.</p>\n<p>This is the second recall in as many weeks involving a lighting system for the Cybertruck.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Saskatchewan’s opposition politicians are taking aim at SaskPower’s decision to spend over $100,000 on internet services from <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/starlink-offers-free-service-to-canadians-affected-by-wildfires/\">Starlink</a>. The expense was revealed in the province’s 2024–25 Crown corporation payee disclosure report released this week, which showed SaskPower paid $114,428 to Starlink Internet during the fiscal year.</p>\n<p>The revelation has drawn criticism from New Democratic Party (NDP) MLA Erika Ritchie, who questioned why a provincial Crown corporation would rely on an American company rather than supporting local providers.</p>\n<p>“We know that we have a world-class Crown corporation, SaskTel, that offers connectivity services. We’re wondering why this Crown has elected to go to a foreign company to receive services,” Ritchie said, also taking issue with Musk’s political ties in the United States.</p>\n<p>SaskPower’s parent agency, the Crown Investments Corporation (CIC), defended the use of Starlink as a necessary measure to ensure safety and communication in remote parts of the province, pointing out that SaskTel’s network cannot reach these areas. In a written statement, the CIC noted that Starlink’s satellite service plays an essential role in maintaining connectivity for workers in isolated areas, especially for emergencies such as medical situations.</p>\n<p>“Even with significant investments in broadband and 5G expansion, there are areas in Saskatchewan where SaskTel cannot provide cellular or internet service,” the statement read. “In these instances, including where life and safety could be at risk, arrangements are made to ensure employees have access to satellite services provided by Starlink.” <em>(via <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/regina/article/saskpower-paid-starlink-more-than-100000-in-2024-25-documents-show/\">CTV News</a>)</em></p>\n<p>Saskatchewan is not the first province to rely on Starlink for essential operations. Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, for instance, paid roughly $200,000 for Starlink service in 2024 as part of its communications program for remote sites. <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/british-columbia-government-utilizes-spacex-starlink-for-enhanced-connectivity/\">British Columbia is also a Starlink customer</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/quebec-adds-more-funds-to-starlink-subsidy-program/\">Quebec </a>and <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/alberta-launches-pilot-program-to-bring-starlink-internet-to-rural-communities/\">Alberta</a>.</p>\n<p>While critics argue that relying on a U.S. billionaire’s company undermines Canadian technological sovereignty, supporters point out that no domestic provider can currently match Starlink’s reach and reliability in hard-to-access areas.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-master-plan-part-4-coming-soon-says-elon-musk/\">Elon Musk </a>is once again thinking bigger than the auto industry, proposing the idea of transforming idle Tesla vehicles into a massive “distributed inference fleet,” suggesting that the collective computing power of millions of cars could eventually rival that of some of the world’s largest data centers.</p>\n<p>During Tesla’s Q3 2025 earnings call, Musk said the idea came from realizing that Tesla’s vehicles, equipped with powerful onboard AI computers, spend much of their time parked and unused. “One of the things I thought: if we got all these cars that maybe are bored… we could actually have a giant distributed inference fleet,” he said. </p>\n<p>The Tesla CEO estimated that with 100 million vehicles each contributing roughly one kilowatt of compute capacity, the company could potentially unlock “100 gigawatts of inference” across the global fleet.</p>\n<p>The concept, in essence, would see parked Teslas lending their computing resources to perform AI workloads when not in use — a system that Musk described as a “significant asset” for the company’s future. Power and cooling would already be handled by the cars’ existing systems, making the idea theoretically efficient and scalable.</p>\n<p>As with many of Musk’s forward-looking statements, the distributed AI fleet idea has drawn a variety of responses. Supporters see it as a revolutionary way to monetize idle vehicle hardware, while critics question whether owners would agree to let their cars participate in such a system.</p>\n<p>If the opportunity arose, would you be comfortable letting your car become part of a global computing network while it sits in your driveway?

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>SpaceX is offering a revised approach for its <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/faa-clears-spacex-for-next-starship-launch/\">Starship </a>lunar lander program, promising a more streamlined mission design aimed at accelerating humanity’s return to the Moon. </p>\n<p>The company outlined its “simplified mission architecture” in a detailed <a href=\"https://www.spacex.com/updates#moon-and-beyond\">update </a>published Thursday, as NASA increases pressure on contractors to deliver results amid growing competition from China’s lunar ambitions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-simplified-path-back-to-the-moon\">A Simplified Path Back to the Moon</h3>\n<p>“In response to the latest calls, we’ve shared and are formally assessing a simplified mission architecture and concept of operations that we believe will result in a faster return to the Moon while simultaneously improving crew safety,” SpaceX said in its statement.</p>\n<p>Although the company did not elaborate on what this “simplified” plan entails, the move follows criticism from NASA’s acting administrator, Sean Duffy, who recently suggested that SpaceX was falling behind schedule. Duffy, who is also the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, hinted that the agency could reopen the contract to allow competitors such as Blue Origin to propose faster alternatives.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-defending-progress-amid-delays\">Defending Progress Amid Delays</h3>\n<p>Despite scrutiny over delays, SpaceX defended its progress on Starship’s development, highlighting “dozens of milestones” already achieved under its $4 billion Human Landing System (HLS) contract. The company is preparing for a long-duration flight test in 2026 and continues to develop the Starship crew cabin that will eventually ferry astronauts to and from the lunar surface.</p>\n<p>Starship’s lunar missions will rely on a critical new capability: in-space refueling. This process involves multiple Starship “tanker” flights filling the lunar-bound spacecraft with fuel in orbit — a complex operation that has never been demonstrated before. </p>\n<p>SpaceX now expects to conduct this refueling test in 2026, following additional flight tests using an upgraded V3 Starship prototype.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nasa-s-race-against-time-and-rivals\">NASA’s Race Against Time and Rivals</h3>\n<p>NASA’s Artemis program aims to return astronauts to the Moon for the first time since 1972. SpaceX was selected in 2021 to provide the lander for the Artemis III and IV missions, while Blue Origin secured a separate contract for later missions. </p>\n<p>However, concerns about timeline slippage and internal political challenges have led NASA to reconsider its strategy as China accelerates its own lunar plans.</p>\n<p>Duffy’s comments last week highlighted NASA’s growing frustration with development delays, noting that the agency “cannot afford to fall behind” as other nations advance their moonshot programs. Elon Musk responded with criticism of Duffy on social media, escalating tensions between the agency and SpaceX.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-starship-s-role-in-the-artemis-program\">Starship’s Role in the Artemis Program</h3>\n<p>SpaceX maintains that Starship remains the fastest and most capable vehicle for the Artemis program. “Starship continues to simultaneously be the fastest path to returning humans to the surface of the Moon and a core enabler of the Artemis program’s goal to establish a permanent, sustainable presence on the lunar surface,” the company said.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Tesla is moving full steam ahead on its next-generation autonomous vehicle, launching a major hiring spree at Gigafactory Texas while the long-awaited Cybercab has been spotted testing on public roads for the first time.</p>\n<p>Near Tesla’s engineering headquarters in Los Altos, California, the two-seat Cybercab was seen this week navigating public streets with a driver behind the wheel, a major step in its development. The sighting confirms that Tesla has entered the real-world testing phase for its upcoming robotaxi, roughly a year after the vehicle was first unveiled.</p>\n<p>While it was not captured in the photo, Tesla watcher <a href=\"https://x.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1983658949389046249\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sawyer Merritt</a> noted there was a person still in the driver’s seat as a safety precaution.</p>\n<p>The vehicle’s testing indicates Tesla is now validating its software and hardware systems outside semi-controlled environments like its Gigafactory in Austin, Texas, and in Fremont, California, the only two other locations where testing has been conducted.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>At the same time, Tesla has quietly begun a major hiring push to prepare for production. The company has posted more than 30 new roles tied directly to Cybercab manufacturing, with positions focusing on drive units, battery packs, assembly lines, and production operations. All of the jobs are located at Giga Texas, where we already knew the Cybercab will be built using Tesla’s advanced “unboxed” manufacturing process.</p>\n<p>This approach allows major components—such as the body, chassis, and interior—to be constructed in parallel before final assembly, greatly increasing production speed and efficiency.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-110025 jetpack-lazy-image\" data-attachment-id=\"110025\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jobs\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?fit=975%2C415&amp;ssl=1\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=975%2C415&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=1024%2C436&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=300%2C128&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=768%2C327&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=1536%2C654&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=2048%2C872&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?w=1950&amp;ssl=1 1950w\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?fit=300%2C128&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?fit=2472%2C1052&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2472,1052\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-ramps-up-hiring-for-cybercab-production-as-prototype-begins-real-world-testing/attachment/jobs-3/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=975%2C415&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" width=\"975\"/><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-110025\" data-attachment-id=\"110025\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jobs\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?fit=975%2C415&amp;ssl=1\" data-lazy-fallback=\"1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?fit=300%2C128&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?fit=2472%2C1052&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2472,1052\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-ramps-up-hiring-for-cybercab-production-as-prototype-begins-real-world-testing/attachment/jobs-3/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"415\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=975%2C415&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=1024%2C436&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=300%2C128&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=768%2C327&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=1536%2C654&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=2048%2C872&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?w=1950&amp;ssl=1 1950w\" width=\"975\"/></noscript></figure>\n<p>The timing of these new job postings aligns closely with Elon Musk’s recent statement that Tesla expects to begin production of the Cybercab in the second quarter of 2026, or sometime between April and June.</p>\n<p>Originally introduced as a fully autonomous robotaxi without pedals or a steering wheel, the Cybercab may also be offered in a version that includes traditional controls to make it more accessible to a wider range of customers, according to comments made by Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm this week.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

The charging port is located on the driver’s-side rear corner of the vehicle, mirroring Tesla’s design, which allows for normal parking alignment and eliminates the need to take up two or more parking spots to plug in.</p>\n<p>While the addition of Supercharger access is a major win for customers, the Slate truck and SUV are designed primarily as affordable, around-town EVs rather than long-range road-trippers. With a base 52.7-kWh battery offering lower than average driving ranges of roughly 150 miles (241 km) of range—or up to 240 miles (386 km) with the optional 84.3-kWh pack—Slate’s vehicles target urban and suburban drivers who typically charge at home.</p>\n<p>According to Slate, their EVs will support DC fast charging at up to 120 kW, allowing a 20–80 percent charge in about 30 minutes. The vehicles will also be compatible with CCS1 and J1772 chargers through adapters, broadening charging options beyond Tesla’s network.</p>\n<p>The 2-seat pickup and upcoming 5-seat SUV are expected to launch in late 2026, with starting prices projected in the mid-US$20,000 range. Although early estimates suggested that the $7,500 U.S. federal EV tax credit could have brought the effective price below US$20,000, that incentive is no longer available. </p>\n<p>Still, Slate aims to position its vehicles among the most affordable electric options on the market. Customers can already place fully refundable US$50 reservations on the company’s website.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h-will-slate-auto-be-coming-to-canada\">Will Slate Auto Be Coming to Canada?</h3>\n<p>Probably. Slate Auto has said it intends to come to Canada, but it will only happen after the U.S. launch. Launching a new automotive brand, and in particular an EV brand, is not for the faint of heart, so if the company is able to survive long enough, their EVs will eventually be offered in Canada, although there is no specific timeline for when this might happen.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",
