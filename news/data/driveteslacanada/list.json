First and foremost, the computer hardware and sensors needed to run the system, including RAM, processors, and lidar sensors, have seen a massive spike in prices due to supply chain shortages. Additionally, the physical validation costs required to approve the system across multiple jurisdictions have increased and are holding up the rollout in most areas.</p>\n<p>For <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/bmw-to-introduce-level-3-autonomous-driving-system-personal-pilot-l3-in-march-2024/\">BMW</a>, the increasing costs associated with the feature were not worth it. Plus, most 7 Series clients did not opt in for the Level 3 self-driving tech, which costs 6,000 euros.</p>\n<p>It remains unclear whether <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/bmw-offering-1000-incentive-to-tesla-and-other-ev-owners-to-switch-brands/\">BMW</a> will re-evaluate its self-driving feature and consider it in the future. The company had mapped over 160 million km with its hands-free system, with highways in Germany, the United States, and Canada covered. But for now, the 7 Series will be limited to a Level 2 autonomous driving system.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 1 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Tesla recently updated the Tesla Y owner’s manual with helpful battery maintenance tips, and one of the key points is not to rely on Superchargers all the time.</p>\n<p>To improve battery health, Tesla now explicitly advises owners to use Supercharging mainly for long road trips and Level 1 and Level 2 charging for daily runs.</p>\n<p>The update, first reported by <em><a href=\"https://www.notateslaapp.com/news/3715/teslas-new-battery-tips-regular-supercharging-is-a-no-go\">Not A Tesla App</a></em>, further explains that all EV batteries degrade, however slowly, over time. This is a result of chemical reactions that are bound to occur during charging and discharging cycles. In charging parlance, when a battery is at 85 percent health, it can now only provide 85 percent of the driving range it had when new.</p>\n<p>Tesla has installed high-tech systems to slow this natural decline. When the EV’s charge level drops to almost 0 percent, the vehicle is designed to automatically switch to a low-power consumption mode to prevent the battery from draining out completely. If not, it could damage some internal features.</p>\n<p>Other tips to slow battery wear include charging to about 80 percent for daily use. Owners should only charge to full capacity if they need the extra range, and charging should be frequent.</p>\n<p>Another pitfall drivers should avoid is the extremes. EV batteries shouldn’t be left at 0 percent or 100 percent for too long. If the car were stored for a while, an ideal point could be at 50 percent charge.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the vehicle shouldn’t be left idle with features like Sentry Mode activated or USB ports plugged in. These actions will slowly drain the battery. The automaker urged owners to take note of these points, while it would also work on improving its battery technology.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, CEO Elon Musk <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/elon-musk-says-tesla-has-solved-dry-electrode-battery-manufacturing-at-scale/\">announced a new milestone in dry electrode battery technology</a>. Compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries, these dry electrodes make battery production cheaper, faster, and more compact.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/byd/\">BYD</a> has announced that its latest Blade battery and a 1,500kW EV charger will be released on March 5, 2026. These new technologies have some exciting features.</p>\n<p>At the top of the list is the ultra-fast speed of the charger. At 1,500 kilowatts, it is faster than most public chargers today. It can run at up to 1,000 volts and 1,500 amps. This translates to adding about 400 kilometers of range in five minutes.</p>\n<p>However, that is under ideal conditions. In reality, the charging peak is closer to 1,360kW. Also, only specially designed cars can handle that much power. For most EV designs, factors such as megawatt-class charging rates, thermal management, and C-rate battery chemistry have to be considered.</p>\n<p>Another notable feature of the charger is its design. The charger has a T-shaped design, making it easier to extend the cable to the charging ports of multiple cars without dragging it awkwardly across the ground.</p>\n<p>Alongside the charger, BYD is also introducing a second-generation Blade battery. The battery will come in two versions: a higher-energy version and an ultra-fast-charging version. The former will have about 210 Wh/kg energy density and up to 3C charging, while the latter will have 160 Wh/kg and super-fast charging up to 8C (roughly eight times its capacity per hour).</p>\n<p>Compared to the first-generation Blade battery, these latest versions are expected to perform better. They will reportedly have a lifecycle of up to 3,000 charge cycles. The charger and battery will debut at a BYD event coming up on March 5, 2026.</p>\n<p>The year is shaping up well for the Chinese automaker after accounting for <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-european-sales-slide-continues-as-byd-surges-ahead-in-january-registrations/\">19.3% of all new EU vehicle registrations in January</a>. The company may soon<a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/byd-is-already-cleared-to-sell-evs-in-canada-giving-it-a-big-head-start-over-rivals/\"> expand its reach to Canada</a>.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Tesla has quietly made a major change to its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) Transfer Program, and it could have serious implications for buyers — especially those ordering the newly introduced <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/elon-musk-clarifies-10-day-59k-cybertruck-window-price-likely-to-change-based-on-demand/\" id=\"114310\" type=\"post\">$59K Cybertruck AWD.</a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Until now, the wording around Tesla’s limited-time FSD transfer offer focused on placing an order before the March 31, 2026 deadline. But on Friday night Tesla updated the eligibility rules with a critical clarification.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tesla-fsd-transfer-program-what-changed\">Tesla FSD Transfer Program: What Changed?</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tesla’s FSD (Supervised) Transfer Program allows existing owners who purchased FSD outright to move that software package from their current vehicle to a newly ordered Tesla. It’s a highly sought-after offer, especially given the high upfront cost of FSD.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Previously, the deadline required only that a vehicle be ordered by March 31, 2026. The updated eligibility language now makes it clear: delivery must occur on or before March 31, 2026.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114507\" data-attachment-id=\"114507\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"terms\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?fit=975%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?fit=300%2C85&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?fit=2213%2C624&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2213,624\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-makes-major-change-to-fsd-transfer-policy-and-march-31-deadline/attachment/terms-4/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"275\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?resize=975%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?resize=1024%2C289&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?resize=300%2C85&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?resize=768%2C217&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?resize=1536%2C433&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?resize=2048%2C577&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?w=1950&amp;ssl=1 1950w\" width=\"975\"/></figure>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-impact-on-59k-cybertruck-awd-orders\">Impact on $59K Cybertruck AWD Orders</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">This change is particularly important for buyers of the recently launched $59K Cybertruck AWD.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As we’ve reported, estimated delivery timelines for that variant have <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-59k-cybertruck-now-over-a-year-away-for-new-buyers/\">already stretched into 2027 amid surging demand</a>. Many reservation holders were planning to order now, secure their place in line, and transfer their previously purchased FSD license when the truck eventually arrived more than a year from now.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Under the updated rules, that strategy no longer works. If the vehicle is delivered after March 31, 2026, it will not qualify for the FSD transfer — even if it was ordered before the deadline.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That’s a massive blow to owners hoping to carry over a major software investment to a future vehicle. It also has impacts beyond the Cybertruck, as many vehicle orders placed within the last few days or even weeks have a delivery timeline beyond this new deadline.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-tesla-made-the-change\">Why Tesla Made the Change</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tesla hasn’t publicly explained the reasoning behind the change, but you don’t have to look far for a reason why. Demand for the $59K Cybertruck AWD has been extremely high, with delivery estimates quickly moving from <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-59k-cybertruck-now-over-a-year-away-for-new-buyers/\">June to all the way in April 2027 within a matter of days</a>. Allowing FSD transfers tied to vehicles that won’t be delivered for another year or more would effectively extend the program far beyond its intended window.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And that’s the likely reason for the change, as wait times for Tesla vehicles in the U.S. is typically a few weeks to maybe a month, not over a year into the future.  </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Whatever the reason, the change hasn’t gone over well with fans, who have rightfully called out the company’s unethical shift in policy.</p>\n<p>But as Tesla notes in the terms, which were the same before last night’s update, the program is subject to change at any time. </p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/rivian/\" id=\"187\" type=\"post_tag\">Rivian </a>is making its performance ambitions official. The California-based electric automaker has unveiled the Rivian Adventure Department, or RAD, giving a formal name to the in-house skunkworks team that has quietly been pushing its vehicles to the edge for years. </p>\n<p>While the engineers and designers behind RAD have already shaped some of Rivian’s most exciting features, the new badge signals something bigger: a clear commitment to enthusiast-focused innovation.</p>\n<p>RAD isn’t a new team—it’s a newly branded one. Its roots trace back to 2020, when a small group took early R1T prototypes on a grueling 13,000-mile journey from Patagonia to Los Angeles as part of the Long Way Up expedition. That real-world stress test helped shape Rivian’s philosophy of validating hardware and software in extreme conditions.</p>\n<p>Since then, RAD’s fingerprints have been all over Rivian’s most capable vehicles.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-pikes-peak-to-the-desert\">From Pikes Peak to the Desert</h3>\n<p>In 2023, Rivian engineer Gardner Nichols piloted his own quad-motor R1T up Pikes Peak, setting a production truck record without factory backing. A year later, with official support and updated hardware, he went even faster. Around the same time, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/rivian-r1t-becomes-first-ev-to-win-the-longest-off-road-competition-in-the-us/\" id=\"80260\" type=\"post\">Rivian entered the Rebelle Rally</a>, the all-women off-road endurance competition spanning roughly 1,500 miles. The lessons learned there directly contributed to the development of Soft Sand mode, which later rolled out to customers via an over-the-air (OTA) update.</p>\n<p>Now, with the latest quad-motor R1 models, RAD’s influence is even more visible. Features like <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/rivians-kick-turn-and-rad-tuner-features-delayed-until-year-end/\" id=\"109824\" type=\"post\">Kick Turn</a>, Desert Rally mode, and the new <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/rivians-2025-46-software-update-brings-universal-hands-free-digital-key-kick-turn-and-rad-tuner-but-not-for-everyone/\" id=\"112271\" type=\"post\">RAD Tuner</a> tool all stem from that extreme-use testing.</p>\n<p>The RAD Tuner gives quad-motor owners deep control over 10 vehicle parameters, including torque distribution, damping, steering feel, wheel slip, and brake regen.

Now, a new nationwide distribution agreement with Supply Partners Group is set to add even more momentum to that popularity.</p>\n<p>Under the deal, Supply Partners Group will handle the distribution of Tesla Powerwall units and related accessories across Australia, streamlining logistics for installers and helping meet surging demand in one of the world’s most solar-saturated markets. Inventory is expected to arrive in late February, with official sales beginning in mid-March 2026.</p>\n<p>Australia leads the world in rooftop solar adoption per capita, and battery storage is quickly becoming the next logical step for homeowners looking to maximize energy independence. With electricity prices fluctuating and government rebates available in several states, home batteries are moving from niche upgrade to mainstream investment.</p>\n<p>“We are proud to officially welcome Tesla Powerwall into the Supply Partners portfolio,” said Lliam Ricketts, Co-Founder and Director of Innovation at Supply Partners Group. “Tesla sets a high bar, and we’ve worked hard to earn the opportunity to represent a brand that customers actively ask for. This partnership reflects the strength of our logistics, technical services and customer experience, and it’s a win for installers who want premium options they can trust.”</p>\n<p>He added, “Powerwall is already a category-defining product, and what’s ahead makes it even more compelling. As pricing sharpens and capability expands, we see a clear runway for installers to confidently spec Powerwall for premium residential installs, backed by Supply Partners’ national distribution footprint and service model.”</p>\n<p><strong>Related Stories:<br/>• <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/energy/tesla-energy-plan-a-new-battery-based-retail-energy-plan-in-australia-that-includes-a-significant-powerwall-discount/\">Tesla Energy Plan – a New Battery-Based Retail Energy Plan in Australia That Includes a Powerwall Discount</a><br/>• <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-drops-powerwall-price-in-australia-again/\">Tesla drops Powerwall price in Australia again</a><br/>• <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/energy/tesla-powerwalls-and-solar-to-be-installed-on-another-3000-low-income-houses-in-australia/\">Tesla Powerwalls and Solar to be installed on another 3,000 low-income houses in Australia</a></strong></p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

Officials say the goal is to gather detailed operational data to determine how the driver-assistance system performs in everyday driving scenarios — from dense urban corridors to high-speed roadways — while maintaining a human driver behind the wheel at all times.</p>\n<p>The trials are being carried out within a structured regulatory framework designed to measure both performance and safety readiness before any potential expansion.</p>\n<p>The program is also being coordinated with the Legislation Lab at the General Secretariat of the UAE Cabinet, showing that the initiative is not just about testing technology, but about building a policy framework around advanced driver-assistance and autonomous systems.</p>\n<p>Abu Dhabi has been steadily positioning itself as a regional hub for autonomous mobility, previously expanding robotaxi operations and introducing regulatory pathways for smart vehicles. The data collected during these road trials will ultimately determine whether FSD (Supervised) is ready for broader deployment in the UAE. </p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Tesla has expanded its home and commercial charging lineup with the launch of a new <a href=\"https://shop.tesla.com/product/tall-pedestal-for-wall-connector\">Tall Pedestal for Wall Connector</a>, now available through its online store in the United States for $900. While Tesla already offers a standard pedestal option, this latest version is taller and offers improved cable management inspired by the design of public charging stations.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-taller-cleaner-charging-setup\">A Taller, Cleaner Charging Setup</h3>\n<p>Tesla’s existing “Pedestal for Wall Connector” provides a free-standing solution for situations where a wall mount isn’t practical. However, with that shorter pedestal, the charging cable is typically wrapped around the Wall Connector itself — similar to a traditional wall-mounted setup.</p>\n<p>The new Tall Pedestal changes that approach. Standing 76 inches high and constructed from aluminum, the updated design routes and secures the charging cable near the top of the post. The result is a more controlled hanging loop, similar to what you’d see at many public EV charging stations. This keeps the cable elevated and neatly organized, reducing the chance of it dragging or getting bunched up on the ground, giving the installation a more polished, commercial look.</p>\n<figure

class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-built-for-single-or-dual-charging\">Built for Single or Dual Charging</h3>\n<p>The Tall Pedestal supports both single and dual <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-owners-in-canada-can-now-earn-rewards-for-charging-at-home-through-wattsapp/\" id=\"114141\" type=\"post\">Wall Connector</a> configurations, allowing owners to charge one or two Tesla vehicles simultaneously when paired with compatible Gen 3 Wall Connectors or the Universal Wall Connector.</p>\n<p>Tesla includes the following when purchased the Tall Pedestal for Wall Connector:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>One 76-inch aluminum pedestal</li>\n<li>Two cable brackets</li>\n<li>Four wire glands for global wiring configurations</li>\n<li>Four mounting screws to secure the Wall Connector</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As with most EV infrastructure, installation is site-specific. Tesla notes that trenching and a concrete pad are typically required to properly secure the pedestal, and recommends consulting a local contractor before purchasing. The Wall Connector itself is not included.</p>\n<p>At $900, the Tall Pedestal is not cheap, but for sites seeking a cleaner, more professional free-standing charging solution — especially one that mirrors public charging design — it offers a factory-backed option that integrates seamlessly into Tesla’s ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the new Tall Pedestal was not added to the Canadian online shop. You can <a href=\"https://shop.tesla.com/product/tall-pedestal-for-wall-connector\">purchase yours in the U.S. here</a>.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",
