            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Saskatchewan’s opposition politicians are taking aim at SaskPower’s decision to spend over $100,000 on internet services from <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/starlink-offers-free-service-to-canadians-affected-by-wildfires/\">Starlink</a>. The expense was revealed in the province’s 2024–25 Crown corporation payee disclosure report released this week, which showed SaskPower paid $114,428 to Starlink Internet during the fiscal year.</p>\n<p>The revelation has drawn criticism from New Democratic Party (NDP) MLA Erika Ritchie, who questioned why a provincial Crown corporation would rely on an American company rather than supporting local providers.</p>\n<p>“We know that we have a world-class Crown corporation, SaskTel, that offers connectivity services. We’re wondering why this Crown has elected to go to a foreign company to receive services,” Ritchie said, also taking issue with Musk’s political ties in the United States.</p>\n<p>SaskPower’s parent agency, the Crown Investments Corporation (CIC), defended the use of Starlink as a necessary measure to ensure safety and communication in remote parts of the province, pointing out that SaskTel’s network cannot reach these areas. In a written statement, the CIC noted that Starlink’s satellite service plays an essential role in maintaining connectivity for workers in isolated areas, especially for emergencies such as medical situations.</p>\n<p>“Even with significant investments in broadband and 5G expansion, there are areas in Saskatchewan where SaskTel cannot provide cellular or internet service,” the statement read. “In these instances, including where life and safety could be at risk, arrangements are made to ensure employees have access to satellite services provided by Starlink.” <em>(via <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/regina/article/saskpower-paid-starlink-more-than-100000-in-2024-25-documents-show/\">CTV News</a>)</em></p>\n<p>Saskatchewan is not the first province to rely on Starlink for essential operations. Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, for instance, paid roughly $200,000 for Starlink service in 2024 as part of its communications program for remote sites. <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/british-columbia-government-utilizes-spacex-starlink-for-enhanced-connectivity/\">British Columbia is also a Starlink customer</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/quebec-adds-more-funds-to-starlink-subsidy-program/\">Quebec </a>and <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/alberta-launches-pilot-program-to-bring-starlink-internet-to-rural-communities/\">Alberta</a>.</p>\n<p>While critics argue that relying on a U.S. billionaire’s company undermines Canadian technological sovereignty, supporters point out that no domestic provider can currently match Starlink’s reach and reliability in hard-to-access areas.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-master-plan-part-4-coming-soon-says-elon-musk/\">Elon Musk </a>is once again thinking bigger than the auto industry, proposing the idea of transforming idle Tesla vehicles into a massive “distributed inference fleet,” suggesting that the collective computing power of millions of cars could eventually rival that of some of the world’s largest data centers.</p>\n<p>During Tesla’s Q3 2025 earnings call, Musk said the idea came from realizing that Tesla’s vehicles, equipped with powerful onboard AI computers, spend much of their time parked and unused. “One of the things I thought: if we got all these cars that maybe are bored… we could actually have a giant distributed inference fleet,” he said. </p>\n<p>The Tesla CEO estimated that with 100 million vehicles each contributing roughly one kilowatt of compute capacity, the company could potentially unlock “100 gigawatts of inference” across the global fleet.</p>\n<p>The concept, in essence, would see parked Teslas lending their computing resources to perform AI workloads when not in use — a system that Musk described as a “significant asset” for the company’s future. Power and cooling would already be handled by the cars’ existing systems, making the idea theoretically efficient and scalable.</p>\n<p>As with many of Musk’s forward-looking statements, the distributed AI fleet idea has drawn a variety of responses. Supporters see it as a revolutionary way to monetize idle vehicle hardware, while critics question whether owners would agree to let their cars participate in such a system.</p>\n<p>If the opportunity arose, would you be comfortable letting your car become part of a global computing network while it sits in your driveway? Let us know in the comments below.</p>\n \n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>SpaceX is offering a revised approach for its <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/faa-clears-spacex-for-next-starship-launch/\">Starship </a>lunar lander program, promising a more streamlined mission design aimed at accelerating humanity’s return to the Moon. </p>\n<p>The company outlined its “simplified mission architecture” in a detailed <a href=\"https://www.spacex.com/updates#moon-and-beyond\">update </a>published Thursday, as NASA increases pressure on contractors to deliver results amid growing competition from China’s lunar ambitions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-simplified-path-back-to-the-moon\">A Simplified Path Back to the Moon</h3>\n<p>“In response to the latest calls, we’ve shared and are formally assessing a simplified mission architecture and concept of operations that we believe will result in a faster return to the Moon while simultaneously improving crew safety,” SpaceX said in its statement.</p>\n<p>Although the company did not elaborate on what this “simplified” plan entails, the move follows criticism from NASA’s acting administrator, Sean Duffy, who recently suggested that SpaceX was falling behind schedule. Duffy, who is also the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, hinted that the agency could reopen the contract to allow competitors such as Blue Origin to propose faster alternatives.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-defending-progress-amid-delays\">Defending Progress Amid Delays</h3>\n<p>Despite scrutiny over delays, SpaceX defended its progress on Starship’s development, highlighting “dozens of milestones” already achieved under its $4 billion Human Landing System (HLS) contract. The company is preparing for a long-duration flight test in 2026 and continues to develop the Starship crew cabin that will eventually ferry astronauts to and from the lunar surface.</p>\n<p>Starship’s lunar missions will rely on a critical new capability: in-space refueling. This process involves multiple Starship “tanker” flights filling the lunar-bound spacecraft with fuel in orbit — a complex operation that has never been demonstrated before. </p>\n<p>SpaceX now expects to conduct this refueling test in 2026, following additional flight tests using an upgraded V3 Starship prototype.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nasa-s-race-against-time-and-rivals\">NASA’s Race Against Time and Rivals</h3>\n<p>NASA’s Artemis program aims to return astronauts to the Moon for the first time since 1972. SpaceX was selected in 2021 to provide the lander for the Artemis III and IV missions, while Blue Origin secured a separate contract for later missions. </p>\n<p>However, concerns about timeline slippage and internal political challenges have led NASA to reconsider its strategy as China accelerates its own lunar plans.</p>\n<p>Duffy’s comments last week highlighted NASA’s growing frustration with development delays, noting that the agency “cannot afford to fall behind” as other nations advance their moonshot programs. Elon Musk responded with criticism of Duffy on social media, escalating tensions between the agency and SpaceX.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-starship-s-role-in-the-artemis-program\">Starship’s Role in the Artemis Program</h3>\n<p>SpaceX maintains that Starship remains the fastest and most capable vehicle for the Artemis program. “Starship continues to simultaneously be the fastest path to returning humans to the surface of the Moon and a core enabler of the Artemis program’s goal to establish a permanent, sustainable presence on the lunar surface,” the company said.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

The sighting confirms that Tesla has entered the real-world testing phase for its upcoming robotaxi, roughly a year after the vehicle was first unveiled.</p>\n<p>While it was not captured in the photo, Tesla watcher <a href=\"https://x.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1983658949389046249\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sawyer Merritt</a> noted there was a person still in the driver’s seat as a safety precaution.</p>\n<p>The vehicle’s testing indicates Tesla is now validating its software and hardware systems outside semi-controlled environments like its Gigafactory in Austin, Texas, and in Fremont, California, the only two other locations where testing has been conducted.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>At the same time, Tesla has quietly begun a major hiring push to prepare for production. The company has posted more than 30 new roles tied directly to Cybercab manufacturing, with positions focusing on drive units, battery packs, assembly lines, and production operations. All of the jobs are located at Giga Texas, where we already knew the Cybercab will be built using Tesla’s advanced “unboxed” manufacturing process.</p>\n<p>This approach allows major components—such as the body, chassis, and interior—to be constructed in parallel before final assembly, greatly increasing production speed and efficiency.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-110025 jetpack-lazy-image\" data-attachment-id=\"110025\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jobs\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?fit=975%2C415&amp;ssl=1\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=975%2C415&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=1024%2C436&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=300%2C128&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=768%2C327&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=1536%2C654&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=2048%2C872&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?w=1950&amp;ssl=1 1950w\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?fit=300%2C128&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?fit=2472%2C1052&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2472,1052\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-ramps-up-hiring-for-cybercab-production-as-prototype-begins-real-world-testing/attachment/jobs-3/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=975%2C415&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" width=\"975\"/><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-110025\" data-attachment-id=\"110025\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jobs\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?fit=975%2C415&amp;ssl=1\" data-lazy-fallback=\"1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?fit=300%2C128&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?fit=2472%2C1052&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2472,1052\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-ramps-up-hiring-for-cybercab-production-as-prototype-begins-real-world-testing/attachment/jobs-3/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"415\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=975%2C415&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=1024%2C436&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=300%2C128&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=768%2C327&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=1536%2C654&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?resize=2048%2C872&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jobs.png?w=1950&amp;ssl=1 1950w\" width=\"975\"/></noscript></figure>\n<p>The timing of these new job postings aligns closely with Elon Musk’s recent statement that Tesla expects to begin production of the Cybercab in the second quarter of 2026, or sometime between April and June.</p>\n<p>Originally introduced as a fully autonomous robotaxi without pedals or a steering wheel, the Cybercab may also be offered in a version that includes traditional controls to make it more accessible to a wider range of customers, according to comments made by Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm this week.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Startup automaker Slate Auto has joined the growing list of electric vehicle manufacturers integrating with Tesla’s industry-leading <a href=\"http://driveteslacanada.ca/supercharger\">Supercharger </a>network. The Michigan-based company announced that its upcoming lineup of compact electric trucks and SUVs will feature the North American Charging Standard (NACS) port, giving drivers access to Tesla’s 25,000-plus Supercharger stalls across North America when their EVs become available late next year.</p>\n<p>Since Slate vehicles will come natively equipped with the Tesla-style connector—now standardized as <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/white-house-throws-its-support-behind-nacs-as-teslas-charging-tech-gets-closer-to-sae-standardization/\">SAE J3400</a>—owners will be able to plug in directly at Supercharger stations without needing any adapters. The charging port is located on the driver’s-side rear corner of the vehicle, mirroring Tesla’s design, which allows for normal parking alignment and eliminates the need to take up two or more parking spots to plug in.</p>\n<p>While the addition of Supercharger access is a major win for customers, the Slate truck and SUV are designed primarily as affordable, around-town EVs rather than long-range road-trippers. With a base 52.7-kWh battery offering lower than average driving ranges of roughly 150 miles (241 km) of range—or up to 240 miles (386 km) with the optional 84.3-kWh pack—Slate’s vehicles target urban and suburban drivers who typically charge at home.</p>\n<p>According to Slate, their EVs will support DC fast charging at up to 120 kW, allowing a 20–80 percent charge in about 30 minutes. The vehicles will also be compatible with CCS1 and J1772 chargers through adapters, broadening charging options beyond Tesla’s network.</p>\n<p>The 2-seat pickup and upcoming 5-seat SUV are expected to launch in late 2026, with starting prices projected in the mid-US$20,000 range. Although early estimates suggested that the $7,500 U.S. federal EV tax credit could have brought the effective price below US$20,000, that incentive is no longer available. </p>\n<p>Still, Slate aims to position its vehicles among the most affordable electric options on the market. Customers can already place fully refundable US$50 reservations on the company’s website.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h-will-slate-auto-be-coming-to-canada\">Will Slate Auto Be Coming to Canada?</h3>\n<p>Probably. Slate Auto has said it intends to come to Canada, but it will only happen after the U.S. launch. Launching a new automotive brand, and in particular an EV brand, is not for the faint of heart, so if the company is able to survive long enough, their EVs will eventually be offered in Canada, although there is no specific timeline for when this might happen.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

Based on the number of Supercharger cabinets seen at the site, the location will likely feature 12 V4 charging stalls, capable of delivering up to 325 kW of power for compatible vehicles.</p>\n<p>The construction was first spotted and reported by <a href=\"https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/members/jaslesp.183521/\">Jaslesp</a> on the TMC forum, who shared early photos from the site. Based on these photos, the underground conduit work has been completed, the Supercharger cabinets have been installed, and the V4 Supercharger posts themselves are waiting to be put in

            "title": "Las Vegas Police Unveil Fleet of Tesla Cybertrucks for Patrol Duty",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) has officially rolled out its Tesla <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/new-recall-reveals-number-of-tesla-cybertrucks-sold-in-canada-since-30000-price-hike/\">Cybertruck</a> fleet, marking one of the most significant law enforcement technology upgrades in the country. The specialized vehicles, upfitted by <em>UP.FIT</em>, are now being deployed across every area command in the city.</p>\n<p>Sheriff Kevin McMahill introduced the new trucks during a press event on Tuesday, emphasizing their durability and versatility for the region’s varied terrain. </p>\n<p>“They will be at every area command,” McMahill said. “The trucks are built tough to handle everything from Fremont Street to Red Rock Canyon.”</p>\n \n<p>The UP.FIT Patrol Cybertrucks are fully equipped for law enforcement duties, featuring specialized storage for ladders, shields, and less-lethal response tools. McMahill described the Cybertrucks as the “next evolution” in public safety, highlighting how the department continues to embrace advanced technology — from SWAT vehicles to robotics — to enhance officer effectiveness and community safety.</p>\n<p>Beyond the eye-catching looks, the Cybertruck fleet promises substantial operational savings for taxpayers. Each electric patrol vehicle is expected to save an estimated $47,540 over a typical five-year service life compared to a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) patrol truck.</p>\n<p>According to 2024 Las Vegas energy data, with gasoline averaging $3.78 per gallon and electricity at $0.21 per kWh, each Cybertruck could generate annual fuel savings between $8,800 and $12,000. Maintenance costs are also projected to drop by at least $3,540 per vehicle over five years, thanks to Tesla’s simplified all-electric drivetrain.</p>\n<figure class=\"is-layout-flex

The company has posted a new Manufacturing Engineer job opening in Fremont, California, specifically tied to developing and launching battery manufacturing equipment for the upcoming electric supercar.</p>\n<p>According to the description, the successful candidate will “ideate concepts for equipment and manufacturing systems,” “validate and optimize processes from early prototype builds through full-volume production,” and “transition products from low-volume prototypes to large-scale production.” That scope aligns with a program approaching the manufacturing validation phase — a strong indicator that Tesla is moving closer to physical production readiness.</p>\n<p>The engineer will help bring large-scale manufacturing systems from early concept through full production launch, ensuring a smooth handoff to operations teams. The company notes the position involves domestic and international travel to support equipment testing and setup across various Tesla sites, indicating cross-team collaboration typical of an early production ramp.<em> (h/t: <a href=\"https://x.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1983044415766536495\">@SawyerMerritt</a>)</em></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"roadster\" class=\"wp-image-109974 jetpack-lazy-image\" data-attachment-id=\"109974\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"roadster\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?fit=753%2C487&amp;ssl=1\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?resize=753%2C487&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?w=753&amp;ssl=1 753w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?fit=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?fit=753%2C487&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"753,487\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-roadster-production-inches-closer-with-new-job-posting/attachment/roadster-6/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"487\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?resize=753%2C487&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" width=\"753\"/><noscript><img alt=\"roadster\" class=\"wp-image-109974\" data-attachment-id=\"109974\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"roadster\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?fit=753%2C487&amp;ssl=1\" data-lazy-fallback=\"1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?fit=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?fit=753%2C487&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"753,487\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-roadster-production-inches-closer-with-new-job-posting/attachment/roadster-6/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"487\" sizes=\"(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?resize=753%2C487&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?w=753&amp;ssl=1 753w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w\" width=\"753\"/></noscript></figure></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/manufacturing-engineer-roadster-254365\">posting</a> marks one of the clearest signals yet that the Roadster is transitioning from concept to production preparation.
