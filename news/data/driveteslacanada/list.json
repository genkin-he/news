            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Canada’s DC fast-charging network is expanding at a record pace — and importantly, drivers are actually using it. A new Q4 2025 industry report from <a href=\"https://www.paren.app/reports/canadian-ev-fast-charging-q4-2025\">Paren</a>, a charging data analytics platform, paints a detailed picture of how Canada’s public DC fast charging (DCFC) infrastructure evolved over the past year. </p>\n<p>The headline number is impressive: 1,925 new fast-charging ports were added in 2025, pushing the national total to 8,804. That represents a 28% year-over-year increase, even as EV sales cooled compared to previous growth cycles.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-infrastructure-growth-outpaces-expectations\">Infrastructure Growth Outpaces Expectations</h3>\n<p>Deployment accelerated throughout the year, with Q4 setting a new quarterly record for installations. Canada also added 529 new fast-charging stations in 2025, bringing the total to 2,570 nationwide.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the number of ports is growing faster than the number of sites, meaning stations are getting larger. On average, Canadian DC fast-charging sites now host 3.42 ports per location, up slightly from 3.37 a year earlier. New sites built in 2025 averaged more than 3.6 ports each.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114452\" data-attachment-id=\"114452\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public Fast Charging Stations &amp; Ports _ Canada\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public-Fast-Charging-Stations-Ports-_-Canada.png?fit=859%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public-Fast-Charging-Stations-Ports-_-Canada.png?fit=252%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public-Fast-Charging-Stations-Ports-_-Canada.png?fit=906%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"906,1080\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-leads-as-canada-adds-nearly-2000-dc-fast-charging-ports-in-2025/attachment/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_public-fast-charging-stations-ports-_-canada/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"1024\" sizes=\"(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public-Fast-Charging-Stations-Ports-_-Canada.png?resize=859%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public-Fast-Charging-Stations-Ports-_-Canada.png?resize=859%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 859w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public-Fast-Charging-Stations-Ports-_-Canada.png?resize=252%2C300&amp;ssl=1 252w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public-Fast-Charging-Stations-Ports-_-Canada.png?resize=768%2C915&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public-Fast-Charging-Stations-Ports-_-Canada.png?w=906&amp;ssl=1 906w\" style=\"width:498px;height:auto\" width=\"859\"/></figure></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/tesla/\" id=\"21431\" type=\"post_tag\">Tesla </a>remains the largest single operator in the country, with 2,942 ports nationwide after adding 512 in 2025.

Together, they represent nearly 86% of Canada’s total DCFC infrastructure — and accounted for almost 89% of new deployments last year.</p>\n<p>Utility-backed expansion continues to play a major role. As Paren explains:</p>\n<p>“Utility-backed networks continue to anchor deployment in the two largest markets. In British Columbia, BC Hydro accounted for 38% of the province’s 614 new ports in 2025. In Quebec, Circuit Électrique represented 45% of the 610 ports added. This concentration underscores the continued role of regulated, utility-led expansion in scaling infrastructure across provinces.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-utilization-remains-stable-even-as-capacity-grows\">Utilization Remains Stable — Even as Capacity Grows</h3>\n<p>One of the most encouraging findings is that demand is keeping pace with supply. Average national utilization reached 11.9% in Q4 2025, up slightly from 11.6% in Q3. That may sound modest, but it’s notable given the surge in new deployments. In other words, new capacity is being absorbed rather than sitting idle.</p>\n<p>Major metro areas are driving much of that demand. Vancouver posted utilization near 30% in Q4, while Toronto surpassed 20%. In less densely populated provinces, utilization remains much lower — often just one or two sessions per port per day.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pricing-and-reliability\">Pricing and Reliability</h3>\n<p>The national average price for DC fast charging in Q4 was approximately $0.42/kWh before taxes, though provincial averages ranged from about $0.37 to $0.65 per kWh. Pricing models vary widely, with Canada showing a much more diverse mix than the U.S., including fixed, time-based, power-based, and time-of-use structures.</p>\n<p>Reliability remains strong nationwide, averaging 93.2% in Q4 — comparable to U.S. performance levels. Most provinces scored above 90%, though remote regions like Yukon lagged behind.</p>\n<p>Overall, 2025 marked a clear scaling year for Canada’s fast-charging ecosystem. The infrastructure is growing, utilization is holding firm, and leading markets are beginning to shift from basic corridor buildout to densification — a sign that Canada’s EV charging network is maturing, but not yet saturated.</p>\n<p>You can watch the Paren webinar discussing their report below.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ignition-responsive-embed\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"548\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jQWmG8KTofM?feature=oembed\" title=\"Paren Webinar | State of the Industry Report: Canadian EV Fast Charging - Q4 2025\" width=\"975\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p></p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

According to court spokeswoman Jutta Homann, both sides have committed not to repeat certain allegations connected to the incident until the works council elections conclude on March 4. (via <a href=\"https://www.stern.de/gesellschaft/regional/berlin-brandenburg/konflikt-tesla-und-ig-metall--tesla-und-ig-metall--vergleich-nach-streit-um-tonaufnahme-37174252.html\"><em>Stern</em></a>)</p>\n<p>The settlement follows weeks of escalating legal action between the Tesla and Germany’s largest metalworkers’ union.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dual-investigations-now-de-escalated\">Dual Investigations Now De-Escalated</h3>\n<p>The conflict began when <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-files-charges-over-alleged-recording-incident-at-giga-berlin-ig-metall-calls-claim-false/\">Tesla accused an IG Metall union secretary of secretly recording</a> a works council meeting using a laptop. The company filed a criminal complaint, prompting prosecutors to open an investigation into possible violations of confidentiality laws and the Works Constitution Act.</p>\n<p>In response, IG Metall <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-giga-berlin-manager-faces-criminal-complaint-from-ig-metall-as-dispute-escalates/\">denied the allegations and filed its own criminal complaint</a> against Tesla plant manager André Thierig, alleging defamation.</p>\n<p>With the new settlement in place, both sides appear to be stepping back from further public escalation—at least for now. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-focus-shifts-to-works-council-election\">Focus Shifts to Works Council Election</h3>\n<p>The timing of the dispute has been closely tied to the upcoming works council vote at Gigafactory Berlin, Tesla’s only European manufacturing plant, located in Grünheide near Berlin. Approximately 11,000 employees work at the facility, which produces vehicles for the European market.</p>\n<p>IG Metall district manager Jan Otto said the settlement allows attention to return to workplace priorities. “Next week’s election is about better working conditions in the Gigafactory – there is a lot to do.”</p>\n<p>The union has been pushing for a formal collective bargaining agreement at the plant, something Tesla has historically resisted. While IG Metall holds representation within the works council structure, the facility does not operate under a traditional union contract.</p>\n<p>As we told you earlier today, Elon Musk recently <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/elon-musk-warns-giga-berlin-expansion-could-stall-ahead-of-works-council-vote/\" id=\"114432\" type=\"post\">delivered a message to Gigafactory Berlin employees via a pre-recorded video</a>. In that address, Musk warned that the plant’s future expansion could be at risk if it did not remain, in his words, “free from external influences.” </p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

Referral Points can be redeemed at any time once the minimum threshold of 10,000 points is met. Charging Points, however, are redeemable annually in Q1 after charging data and associated carbon credits are verified by regulatory authorities. This reflects how Clean Fuel Regulation credits are processed and approved under the federal system.</p>\n<p>WattsApp says it will continue refining the platform as participation grows.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Tensions are rising again at Tesla’s Giga Berlin, just days before employees head to the polls to elect a new works council. In a pre-recorded video message played to staff this week, CEO Elon Musk warned that <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-giga-berlin-expansion-approved/\" id=\"91805\" type=\"post\">future expansion plans at Giga Berlin</a> could be at risk if the factory does not remain, in his words, “free from external influences.”</p>\n<p>While Musk did not directly name Germany’s metalworkers’ union, IG Metall, his comments were clearly aimed at the union’s growing role within the plant’s works council.</p>\n<p>According to accounts from employees who attended the internal screening, Musk cautioned that if outside groups were to steer Tesla off course, it would make operations significantly more difficult. He reportedly ruled out shutting down the factory, but suggested that large-scale expansion would be unlikely under such circumstances. <em>(via <a href=\"https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-musk-warnt-vor-ig-metall-und-droht-mit-expansions-stopp/100203422.html\">Handelsblatt</a>)</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-familiar-flashpoint-at-giga-berlin\">A Familiar Flashpoint at Giga Berlin</h3>\n<p>The latest remarks add fuel to an already heated debate over labour representation at Tesla’s only European factory. As <em>Drive Tesla</em> has previously reported, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-giga-berlin-manager-faces-criminal-complaint-from-ig-metall-as-dispute-escalates/\" id=\"114200\" type=\"post\">relations between management and IG Metall have been strained</a> in the lead-up to earlier works council elections, with both sides accusing the other of overreach.</p>\n<p>Currently, IG Metall is the largest faction on the works council, though it does not hold an outright majority. With elections scheduled for early March, the balance of influence inside the factory could soon shift.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-expansion-hinges-on-favourable-conditions\">Expansion Hinges on “Favourable Conditions”</h3>\n<p>Despite the warning, Musk also struck a positive tone during the video interview, which was conducted in Austin alongside Giga Berlin plant manager André Thierig and played back to employees in Germany.</p>\n<p>He praised the facility as one of Tesla’s most impressive factories globally, highlighting its cleanliness, organization, and team spirit. Musk reportedly described the site as an outstanding production facility with exceptionally high standards.</p>\n<p>Beyond labour issues, the discussion touched on future growth. Musk signalled plans to further ramp up Model Y production, particularly if regulators approve expanded Full Self-Driving (Supervised) in Europe. He also suggested that future vehicles like the Cybercab could eventually play a role at the site, alongside potential involvement in Tesla Semi and Optimus-related projects.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most notably, Musk indicated that <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-boosts-battery-production-efforts-at-giga-berlin/\" id=\"112169\" type=\"post\">battery cell production at Giga Berlin has just begun ramping</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, any large-scale expansion appears contingent on continued regulatory approval and support from the local workforce. If those conditions are met, Musk suggested Tesla could transform Giga Berlin into the largest industrial factory complex in Europe.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

According to Waymo, the vehicles are collecting mapping data and evaluating local driving conditions “to lay the early groundwork for operations in Chicago.”</p>\n<p>“We are excited to begin laying the early groundwork for our ride-hailing operations in Chicago, and look forward to serving the city in the future,” the company wrote on its blog.</p>\n<p>Waymo says its initial efforts in Chicago involve roughly 10 vehicles operating in select parts of the city. Fully autonomous robotaxi service is not yet permitted in Illinois, and city officials confirmed they were notified in advance that no driverless operations would take place.</p>\n<p>At the same time, lawmakers are actively debating autonomous vehicle legislation. State Rep. Kam Buckner has introduced a bill that would create a pilot program for self-driving vehicles in Cook County and other regions.</p>\n<p>“This progress is a vital step toward safer streets and more accessible transportation for all our neighborhoods,” Buckner said in a statement released by Waymo.</p>\n<p>The company continues to emphasize its safety record, claiming the Waymo Driver has been involved in 10 times fewer serious injury crashes and 12 times fewer pedestrian injury crashes than human drivers in cities where it operates, including Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta.</p>\n<p>While Illinois is still debating its regulatory framework, North Carolina cleared the way for autonomous vehicles nearly a decade ago. In 2017, the state passed legislation allowing fully autonomous vehicles on public roads once deemed ready and established a Fully Autonomous Vehicle Committee to oversee implementation.</p>\n<p>Waymo confirmed Wednesday that Charlotte will be its next expansion city.</p>\n<p>“Charlotte blends its historic charm with North Carolina’s economic dynamism. Uptown – the city’s sports hub – is surrounded by vibrant neighborhoods, from South End with its breweries and restaurants to the arts of NoDa. The Queen City is constantly redefining itself, and it’s this same forward-looking culture that makes us thrilled to announce Waymo’s intention to bring our safe, magic, fully autonomous ride-hailing to Charlotte, North Carolina.”</p>\n<p>Waymo says it has driven more than 200 million miles fully autonomously and completed over 20 million driverless rides, currently providing more than 400,000 fully autonomous trips per week.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

Victor Nechita, who most recently served as Vehicle Program Manager for Tesla’s purpose-built robotaxi, has announced he is leaving the company after nearly six years.</p>\n<p>Nechita shared the news in a post on LinkedIn reflecting on his journey at Tesla.</p>\n<p>“After nearly 6 years, I’ve decided to leave Tesla and start a new chapter back on the east coast. What a journey it’s been, from interning on the Model 3 production line back in 2017 to becoming the Vehicle Program Manager of Tesla’s first purpose-built AV, the Cybercab,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>Nechita first joined Tesla in 2017 during the height of the <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/category/model-3/\" id=\"22\" type=\"category\">Model 3</a> ramp — a period Elon Musk famously described as “production hell.” Starting as a technical program management intern in Fremont, Nechita helped coordinate Model 3 interior and exterior configuration releases.</p>\n<p>From there, he steadily climbed through increasingly senior roles. After a stint as a Seating Engineering Intern in 2018, he actually left Tesla to join the University of Toronto Aerospace Team before returning full-time in 2021. He then progressed through a series of technical program management roles in Vehicle Engineering, ultimately serving as a Senior Technical Program Manager overseeing cross-functional programs spanning hardware, firmware, and full-vehicle integration — including work tied to the <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/popular-youtuber-mkbhd-brands-new-model-3-a-mini-model-s/\" id=\"85536\" type=\"post\">refreshed Model 3 Highland</a>.</p>\n<p>In early 2024, Nechita stepped into the role of Robotaxi Program Manager for Cybercab. Operating under the Robotaxi Programs umbrella, he oversaw development of Tesla’s first fully dedicated autonomous vehicle platform — a clean-sheet vehicle architecture designed without a steering wheel or pedals.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on the experience, he wrote, “Leading the team through the development of Cybercab has been a humbling experience, watching so many dedicated individuals develop a product that has pushed the boundaries of efficiency, safety, and affordability.”</p>\n<p>His departure was actually shared on LinkedIn one week ago, just as the first <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-rolls-first-cybercab-off-production-line-at-giga-texas/\" id=\"114163\" type=\"post\">production Cybercab rolled off the line at Giga Texas</a> on February 17, 2026. Nechita announced his move to Boston the following day, effectively closing his Tesla chapter after seeing the vehicle through to its first production unit – “Thank you all for the ride and excited for what’s next out here in Boston!”, he wrote.</p>\n<p>Leadership transitions are common at Tesla, especially following major program milestones.

However, the judge also signaled significant doubts about whether the allegations will ultimately succeed.</p>\n<p>According to the ruling, Taub presented “just enough facts” for the case to proceed beyond the early dismissal stage, allowing the lawsuit to move into the discovery phase where additional evidence may be examined.<em> (via Reuters)</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-allegations-focus-on-engineering-hiring-practices\">Allegations Focus on Engineering Hiring Practices</h3>\n<p>Taub claims Tesla passed him over for an engineering position as part of what the lawsuit describes as a “systematic preference” for hiring visa holders. Central to the complaint is an alleged interaction with a recruiter who reportedly told him the position he applied for was “H1B only,” referring to visas commonly used by U.S. technology companies to employ highly skilled foreign workers.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit also points to <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-layoffs-trim-workforce-by-14-report/\" id=\"92823\" type=\"post\">Tesla’s workforce changes in 2024</a>, alleging the company hired approximately 1,355 H-1B visa holders during the same period it laid off more than 6,000 domestic employees, most believed to be U.S. citizens.</p>\n<p>Judge Chhabria emphasized that those statistics alone do not prove discrimination, noting they demonstrate hiring activity but not necessarily preferential treatment.</p>\n<p>“All of this causes the Court to be somewhat skeptical of Taub’s allegations,” Chhabria wrote in the order.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-second-plaintiff-s-claims-dismissed\">Second Plaintiff’s Claims Dismissed</h3>\n<p>While Taub’s claims will proceed, the court dismissed allegations brought by a second plaintiff, human resources specialist Sofia Brander. The judge said it was implausible that Tesla would favour foreign visa holders for HR positions, particularly since H-1B programs are typically associated with specialized technical roles.</p>\n<p>Brander has been given two weeks to amend and refile her complaint if she wishes to continue pursuing the case.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tesla-denies-allegations\">Tesla Denies Allegations</h3>\n<p>Tesla has strongly rejected the accusations in court filings, calling the claims “preposterous.” The company has not publicly commented further following the ruling.</p>\n<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has previously defended skilled immigration programs, arguing they are critical for maintaining competitiveness in advanced industries such as artificial intelligence and vehicle autonomy.</p>\n<p>For now, the lawsuit’s survival represents only an early procedural step. As the case moves into discovery, Tesla’s internal hiring records and communications could face closer scrutiny — a process that may ultimately determine whether the claims gain traction or are dismissed at a later stage.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

With roughly 300 kilometres separating Alberta’s two largest cities, Red Deer and the surrounding area serve as a natural midpoint for charging stops — particularly during winter months when colder temperatures can reduce driving range.</p>\n<p>The Penhold Supercharger was first added as a potential location on Tesla’s official map in September 2024, with <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-starts-construction-on-v4-supercharger-in-red-deers-gasoline-alley-alberta/\">construction starting nearly a year later</a>. Located at 135 Leva Avenue in Gasoline Alley, next to Smitty’s restaurant, the new Supercharger station features 12 V4 stalls capable of delivering up to 325kW, making it the fastest charging location in central Alberta. </p>\n<p>The station supports both Tesla vehicles and non-Tesla EVs equipped with a North American Charging Standard (NACS) adapter. According to Tesla’s Supercharger listing, charging rates at the site are C$0.55 per kWh for Tesla owners, while other EV drivers pay C$0.76 per kWh.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114409\" data-attachment-id=\"114409\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"alberta\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/alberta.png?fit=975%2C478&amp;ssl=1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/alberta.png?fit=300%2C147&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/alberta.png?fit=1902%2C932&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1902,932\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-opens-new-v4-supercharger-in-penhold-alberta/attachment/alberta-3/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"478\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/alberta.png?resize=975%2C478&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/alberta.png?resize=1024%2C502&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/alberta.png?resize=300%2C147&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/alberta.png?resize=768%2C376&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/alberta.png?resize=1536%2C753&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/alberta.png?w=1902&amp;ssl=1 1902w\" width=\"975\"/></figure>\n<p>Tesla’s <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-launches-v4-superchargers-in-china/\" id=\"105591\" type=\"post\">V4 Superchargers</a> represent the company’s newest charging technology.

With this latest addition, there are now 24 Supercharger stalls within five kilometers of each other.</p>\n<iframe height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/2/embed?mid=1fFZB69dD_4Y0dOCGycZvXhrte5VSm6Ms&amp;ehbc=2E312F\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "title": "Tesla’s European Sales Slide Continues as BYD Surges Ahead in January Registrations",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Tesla’s performance in Europe remains under pressure to start 2026, with new registration data showing the automaker trailing fast-growing competitors despite continued expansion of the region’s electric vehicle (EV) market.</p>\n<p>According to figures released by the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), Tesla registered 8,075 vehicles across Europe in January. That represents a 17% decline compared to the same period last year and marks the company’s <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-sales-decline-across-europe-continues/\" id=\"103676\" type=\"post\">13th consecutive month of year-over-year (YoY) sales declines in the region</a>.</p>\n<p>Tesla’s market share also slipped to 0.8%, down from 1.0% a year ago and significantly lower than the 3.0% share it achieved just one month earlier in December 2025.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ev-market-growing-but-tesla-losing-momentum\">EV Market Growing — But Tesla Losing Momentum</h3>\n<p>The downturn comes despite continued growth in EV adoption across Europe. Overall vehicle registrations fell 3.5% YoY in January, but battery electric vehicles (BEVs) moved in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>BEVs accounted for 19.3% of all new EU vehicle registrations during the month, up from 14.9% a year earlier, with total EV registrations increasing by nearly 14%. Plug-in hybrids also posted strong gains, while gas and diesel vehicles continued to decline sharply.</p>\n<p>Most notably, Chinese automaker BYD, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/byd-is-already-cleared-to-sell-evs-in-canada-giving-it-a-big-head-start-over-rivals/\" id=\"113606\" type=\"post\">which could soon be selling its EVs in Canada</a>, registered 18,242 vehicles in January, more than double Tesla’s total. That figure represents a massive 165% year-over-year increase and pushed BYD’s regional market share to 1.9%.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-product-strategy-and-market-pressures\">Product Strategy and Market Pressures</h3>\n<p>Several factors appear to be contributing to Tesla’s softer performance in Europe. Unlike many rivals, Tesla sells only fully electric vehicles, while competitors such as BYD offer a mix of BEVs and plug-in hybrids that appeal to buyers transitioning away from combustion vehicles.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Tesla’s lineup in Europe is mostly comprised of just two models, the Model 3 and Model Y, which continues to carry the bulk of sales while lower-cost competitors enter the market.</p>\n<p>The EU-only data shows a similar trend. Tesla registrations dipped slightly by 1.6% to 7,187 units in January, maintaining a 0.9% share of the market, while BYD surged 175% during the same period.</p>\n<p>Globally, the contrast has also emerged in annual results, with BYD’s pure EV sales growing nearly 28% in 2025 while Tesla’s declined by roughly 8.5%.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",
