            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/byd/\">BYD</a> has announced that its latest Blade battery and a 1,500kW EV charger will be released on March 5, 2026. These new technologies have some exciting features.</p>\n<p>At the top of the list is the ultra-fast speed of the charger. At 1,500 kilowatts, it is faster than most public chargers today. It can run at up to 1,000 volts and 1,500 amps. This translates to adding about 400 kilometers of range in five minutes.</p>\n<p>However, that is under ideal conditions. In reality, the charging peak is closer to 1,360kW. Also, only specially designed cars can handle that much power. For most EV designs, factors such as megawatt-class charging rates, thermal management, and C-rate battery chemistry have to be considered.</p>\n<p>Another notable feature of the charger is its design. The charger has a T-shaped design, making it easier to extend the cable to the charging ports of multiple cars without dragging it awkwardly across the ground.</p>\n<p>Alongside the charger, BYD is also introducing a second-generation Blade battery. The battery will come in two versions: a higher-energy version and an ultra-fast-charging version. The former will have about 210 Wh/kg energy density and up to 3C charging, while the latter will have 160 Wh/kg and super-fast charging up to 8C (roughly eight times its capacity per hour).</p>\n<p>Compared to the first-generation Blade battery, these latest versions are expected to perform better. They will reportedly have a lifecycle of up to 3,000 charge cycles. The charger and battery will debut at a BYD event coming up on March 5, 2026.</p>\n<p>The year is shaping up well for the Chinese automaker after accounting for <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-european-sales-slide-continues-as-byd-surges-ahead-in-january-registrations/\">19.3% of all new EU vehicle registrations in January</a>. The company may soon<a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/byd-is-already-cleared-to-sell-evs-in-canada-giving-it-a-big-head-start-over-rivals/\"> expand its reach to Canada</a>.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Tesla has quietly made a major change to its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) Transfer Program, and it could have serious implications for buyers — especially those ordering the newly introduced <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/elon-musk-clarifies-10-day-59k-cybertruck-window-price-likely-to-change-based-on-demand/\" id=\"114310\" type=\"post\">$59K Cybertruck AWD.</a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Until now, the wording around Tesla’s limited-time FSD transfer offer focused on placing an order before the March 31, 2026 deadline. But on Friday night Tesla updated the eligibility rules with a critical clarification.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tesla-fsd-transfer-program-what-changed\">Tesla FSD Transfer Program: What Changed?</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tesla’s FSD (Supervised) Transfer Program allows existing owners who purchased FSD outright to move that software package from their current vehicle to a newly ordered Tesla. It’s a highly sought-after offer, especially given the high upfront cost of FSD.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Previously, the deadline required only that a vehicle be ordered by March 31, 2026. The updated eligibility language now makes it clear: delivery must occur on or before March 31, 2026.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114507\" data-attachment-id=\"114507\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"terms\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?fit=975%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?fit=300%2C85&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?fit=2213%2C624&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2213,624\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-makes-major-change-to-fsd-transfer-policy-and-march-31-deadline/attachment/terms-4/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"275\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?resize=975%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?resize=1024%2C289&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?resize=300%2C85&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?resize=768%2C217&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?resize=1536%2C433&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?resize=2048%2C577&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/terms-1.png?w=1950&amp;ssl=1 1950w\" width=\"975\"/></figure>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-impact-on-59k-cybertruck-awd-orders\">Impact on $59K Cybertruck AWD Orders</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">This change is particularly important for buyers of the recently launched $59K Cybertruck AWD.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As we’ve reported, estimated delivery timelines for that variant have <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-59k-cybertruck-now-over-a-year-away-for-new-buyers/\">already stretched into 2027 amid surging demand</a>. Many reservation holders were planning to order now, secure their place in line, and transfer their previously purchased FSD license when the truck eventually arrived more than a year from now.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Under the updated rules, that strategy no longer works. If the vehicle is delivered after March 31, 2026, it will not qualify for the FSD transfer — even if it was ordered before the deadline.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That’s a massive blow to owners hoping to carry over a major software investment to a future vehicle. It also has impacts beyond the Cybertruck, as many vehicle orders placed within the last few days or even weeks have a delivery timeline beyond this new deadline.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-tesla-made-the-change\">Why Tesla Made the Change</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tesla hasn’t publicly explained the reasoning behind the change, but you don’t have to look far for a reason why. Demand for the $59K Cybertruck AWD has been extremely high, with delivery estimates quickly moving from <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-59k-cybertruck-now-over-a-year-away-for-new-buyers/\">June to all the way in April 2027 within a matter of days</a>. Allowing FSD transfers tied to vehicles that won’t be delivered for another year or more would effectively extend the program far beyond its intended window.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And that’s the likely reason for the change, as wait times for Tesla vehicles in the U.S. is typically a few weeks to maybe a month, not over a year into the future.  </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Whatever the reason, the change hasn’t gone over well with fans, who have rightfully called out the company’s unethical shift in policy.</p>\n<p>But as Tesla notes in the terms, which were the same before last night’s update, the program is subject to change at any time. </p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "title": "Rivian Launches RAD: A New Performance Division to Push Its EVs Even Further",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/rivian/\" id=\"187\" type=\"post_tag\">Rivian </a>is making its performance ambitions official. The California-based electric automaker has unveiled the Rivian Adventure Department, or RAD, giving a formal name to the in-house skunkworks team that has quietly been pushing its vehicles to the edge for years. </p>\n<p>While the engineers and designers behind RAD have already shaped some of Rivian’s most exciting features, the new badge signals something bigger: a clear commitment to enthusiast-focused innovation.</p>\n<p>RAD isn’t a new team—it’s a newly branded one. Its roots trace back to 2020, when a small group took early R1T prototypes on a grueling 13,000-mile journey from Patagonia to Los Angeles as part of the Long Way Up expedition. That real-world stress test helped shape Rivian’s philosophy of validating hardware and software in extreme conditions.</p>\n<p>Since then, RAD’s fingerprints have been all over Rivian’s most capable vehicles.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-pikes-peak-to-the-desert\">From Pikes Peak to the Desert</h3>\n<p>In 2023, Rivian engineer Gardner Nichols piloted his own quad-motor R1T up Pikes Peak, setting a production truck record without factory backing. A year later, with official support and updated hardware, he went even faster. Around the same time, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/rivian-r1t-becomes-first-ev-to-win-the-longest-off-road-competition-in-the-us/\" id=\"80260\" type=\"post\">Rivian entered the Rebelle Rally</a>, the all-women off-road endurance competition spanning roughly 1,500 miles. The lessons learned there directly contributed to the development of Soft Sand mode, which later rolled out to customers via an over-the-air (OTA) update.</p>\n<p>Now, with the latest quad-motor R1 models, RAD’s influence is even more visible. Features like <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/rivians-kick-turn-and-rad-tuner-features-delayed-until-year-end/\" id=\"109824\" type=\"post\">Kick Turn</a>, Desert Rally mode, and the new <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/rivians-2025-46-software-update-brings-universal-hands-free-digital-key-kick-turn-and-rad-tuner-but-not-for-everyone/\" id=\"112271\" type=\"post\">RAD Tuner</a> tool all stem from that extreme-use testing.</p>\n<p>The RAD Tuner gives quad-motor owners deep control over 10 vehicle parameters, including torque distribution, damping, steering feel, wheel slip, and brake regen. Drivers can build and save custom presets tailored to specific terrain—effectively creating personalized drive modes at the tap of a screen.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\" data-carousel-extra='{\"blog_id\":1,\"permalink\":\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/rivian-launches-rad-a-new-performance-division-to-push-its-evs-even-further/\"}'>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"rivian rad 2\" class=\"wp-image-114500\" data-attachment-id=\"114500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-id=\"114500\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"rivian rad 2\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/rivian-rad-2.png?fit=975%2C643&amp;ssl=1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/rivian-rad-2.png?fit=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/rivian-rad-2.png?fit=1181%2C779&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1181,779\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/rivian-launches-rad-a-new-performance-division-to-push-its-evs-even-further/attachment/rivian-rad-2/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"643\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/rivian-rad-2.png?resize=975%2C643&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/rivian-rad-2.png?resize=1024%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/rivian-rad-2.png?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/rivian-rad-2.png?resize=768%2C507&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/rivian-rad-2.png?w=1181&amp;ssl=1 1181w\" width=\"975\"/></figure>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"rivian rad 4\" class=\"wp-image-114499\" data-attachment-id=\"114499\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-id=\"114499\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"rivian rad 4\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/rivian-rad-4.png?fit=975%2C644&amp;ssl=1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/rivian-rad-4.png?fit=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/rivian-rad-4.png?fit=1177%2C777&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1177,777\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/rivian-launches-rad-a-new-performance-division-to-push-its-evs-even-further/attachment/rivian-rad-4/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"644\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/rivian-rad-4.png?resize=975%2C644&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/rivian-rad-4.png?resize=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/rivian-rad-4.png?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/rivian-rad-4.png?resize=768%2C507&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/rivian-rad-4.png?w=1177&amp;ssl=1 1177w\" width=\"975\"/></figure>\n</figure>\n<p>“RAD represents the living, breathing expression of the passion that defines Rivian.

Now, a new nationwide distribution agreement with Supply Partners Group is set to add even more momentum to that popularity.</p>\n<p>Under the deal, Supply Partners Group will handle the distribution of Tesla Powerwall units and related accessories across Australia, streamlining logistics for installers and helping meet surging demand in one of the world’s most solar-saturated markets. Inventory is expected to arrive in late February, with official sales beginning in mid-March 2026.</p>\n<p>Australia leads the world in rooftop solar adoption per capita, and battery storage is quickly becoming the next logical step for homeowners looking to maximize energy independence. With electricity prices fluctuating and government rebates available in several states, home batteries are moving from niche upgrade to mainstream investment.</p>\n<p>“We are proud to officially welcome Tesla Powerwall into the Supply Partners portfolio,” said Lliam Ricketts, Co-Founder and Director of Innovation at Supply Partners Group. “Tesla sets a high bar, and we’ve worked hard to earn the opportunity to represent a brand that customers actively ask for. This partnership reflects the strength of our logistics, technical services and customer experience, and it’s a win for installers who want premium options they can trust.”</p>\n<p>He added, “Powerwall is already a category-defining product, and what’s ahead makes it even more compelling. As pricing sharpens and capability expands, we see a clear runway for installers to confidently spec Powerwall for premium residential installs, backed by Supply Partners’ national distribution footprint and service model.”</p>\n<p><strong>Related Stories:<br/>• <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/energy/tesla-energy-plan-a-new-battery-based-retail-energy-plan-in-australia-that-includes-a-significant-powerwall-discount/\">Tesla Energy Plan – a New Battery-Based Retail Energy Plan in Australia That Includes a Powerwall Discount</a><br/>• <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-drops-powerwall-price-in-australia-again/\">Tesla drops Powerwall price in Australia again</a><br/>• <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/energy/tesla-powerwalls-and-solar-to-be-installed-on-another-3000-low-income-houses-in-australia/\">Tesla Powerwalls and Solar to be installed on another 3,000 low-income houses in Australia</a></strong></p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

Customers in Germany and other European markets supplied by Giga Berlin can configure the SUV with two additional rear seats for an extra €2,500 (C$4,000/US$2,950).</p>\n<p>According to the online configurator, estimated deliveries are currently slated for April to May 2026 — the same window shown for the five-seat version with the same drivetrain. </p>\n \n<p>Before the <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-model-y-refresh-codenamed-juniper-under-development/\" id=\"69192\" type=\"post\">Juniper refresh</a> rolled out across Europe in early 2025, Tesla had briefly offered a seven-seat version of the previous legacy Model Y in late 2024. That configuration was also limited to the Long Range AWD variant and was phased out when the refreshed Juniper model entered production.</p>\n<p>Now reintroduced, the seven-seat layout remains positioned as a premium upgrade.

While Tesla already offers a standard pedestal option, this latest version is taller and offers improved cable management inspired by the design of public charging stations.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-taller-cleaner-charging-setup\">A Taller, Cleaner Charging Setup</h3>\n<p>Tesla’s existing “Pedestal for Wall Connector” provides a free-standing solution for situations where a wall mount isn’t practical. However, with that shorter pedestal, the charging cable is typically wrapped around the Wall Connector itself — similar to a traditional wall-mounted setup.</p>\n<p>The new Tall Pedestal changes that approach. Standing 76 inches high and constructed from aluminum, the updated design routes and secures the charging cable near the top of the post. The result is a more controlled hanging loop, similar to what you’d see at many public EV charging stations. This keeps the cable elevated and neatly organized, reducing the chance of it dragging or getting bunched up on the ground, giving the installation a more polished, commercial look.</p>\n<figure

The lighter grey roof liner had been a longstanding feature of the Model Y, but many owners prefer the darker finish as it gives the vehicle a more refined look.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Standard Range variant continues to list the grey headliner for now.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114481\" data-attachment-id=\"114481\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"img_5839\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5839.jpg?fit=975%2C514&amp;ssl=1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5839.jpg?fit=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5839.jpg?fit=1137%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1137,600\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/img_5839/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"514\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5839.jpg?resize=975%2C514&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5839.jpg?resize=1024%2C540&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5839.jpg?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5839.jpg?resize=768%2C405&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5839.jpg?w=1137&amp;ssl=1 1137w\" width=\"975\"/></figure>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Larger 16-Inch QHD Display Confirmed</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">The configurator also confirms that all Canadian Model Y trims now come with the larger 16-inch QHD center display, replacing the previous 15.4-inch unit.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114482\" data-attachment-id=\"114482\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"img_5838\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5838.jpg?fit=975%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5838.jpg?fit=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5838.jpg?fit=1320%2C974&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1320,974\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/img_5838-2/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"720\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5838.jpg?resize=975%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5838.jpg?resize=1024%2C756&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5838.jpg?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5838.jpg?resize=768%2C567&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5838.jpg?w=1320&amp;ssl=1 1320w\" width=\"975\"/></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">Whether these two features were included for Canadian-bound vehicles was one of the biggest question marks for buyers in recent weeks. With new shipments arriving from Giga Berlin, many existing reservation holders and prospective owners were wondering whether incoming vehicles would include the updated hardware.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Based on what we have learned, it appears the first batch of Model Y Performance vehicles arriving in Canada soon will not include the black headliner or the larger 16-inch screen, as those vehicles were built before the production changeover.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What This Means for New Orders</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">With the configurator now updated, Tesla is announcing that the transition is complete for Canadian production allocations. Customers placing orders today can expect to receive vehicles built with these updated interior features.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For buyers who have pending deliveries from earlier shipments however, the features may not be included depending on build timing.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Newly obtained internal documents show that Transport Canada was aware as early as November 2024 that the iZEV rebate program was nearing the end of its funding runway. Despite those warnings, no public notice was issued until January 10, 2025 — just <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/canadas-izev-rebate-program-is-nearly-out-of-money-heres-what-you-need-to-know/\">three days before the program ran dry</a>, triggering a surge in claims and putting Tesla at the centre of the controversy.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-early-warnings-late-notice\">Early Warnings, Late Notice</h3>\n<p>According to internal records obtained through Access to Information requests by <em><a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/canada/feds-knew-ev-rebates-were-running-out-months-before-telling-public-documents-suggest/ar-AA1X72qx?ocid=msedgntp&amp;pc=U531&amp;cvid=69a0e72bd7ba4f41a0172989796b3404&amp;ei=16\">The Canadian Press</a></em>, federal officials had identified as early as November 2024 that core funding for iZEV could be depleted between late December and early January. However, the first public signal that the program was nearing its end did not come until January 10, 2025 — just days before the money was gone.</p>\n<p>Three days later, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/canadas-izev-rebate-program-officially-paused-after-running-out-of-money/\">the program was halted after a flood of rebate submissions</a>. Over a single weekend, $48 million in claims were filed, $43 million of which were from Tesla alone.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-record-demand-and-a-political-dilemma\">Record Demand — and a Political Dilemma</h3>\n<p>The iZEV program, launched in 2019, provided up to $5,000 for battery electric vehicles and $2,500 for plug-in hybrids, with a price cap of roughly $55,000. For Tesla, that meant the Model 3 and certain Model Y variants were among the most popular vehicles benefiting from the incentive.</p>\n<p>Demand surged in late 2024, driven in part by <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/quebec-pauses-ev-rebates-until-april-2025/\" id=\"99055\" type=\"post\">Quebec announcing it scaling back and temporarily pausing  its provincial rebate</a> and growing concerns that federal funding was running low. December alone saw more than $122 million in claims processed — a record burn rate.</p>\n<p>Internal emails show officials were debating how and when to alert stakeholders. One memo warned that an orderly wind-down was necessary to “limit negative impacts on industry and consumers.” Yet the communications plan was delayed as political discussions reportedly explored injecting new funding into the program.</p>\n<p>By January 8, staff were still seeking clarity on remaining funds. The answer, according to one internal message: “The program has run out of funds.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fallout-for-tesla-and-the-ev-market\">Fallout for Tesla and the EV Market</h3>\n<p>Tesla’s $43 million in submissions — representing vehicles already delivered and eligible under program rules — became a political lightning rod in the aftermath. As we previously reported, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-canada-fights-back-against-allegations-of-fraudulent-izev-claims/\">Tesla maintained its filings were compliant</a> and processed within longstanding guidelines, which in the end were <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/canada-clears-tesla-in-izev-rebate-investigation-43m-payment-unfrozen/\" id=\"105897\" type=\"post\">corrobated after an internal investigation cleared the automaker of any wrongdoing</a>, but the damage to Tesla’s brand was already done.</p>\n<p>The pause also had immediate consequences for the broader EV market, as national EV market share dropped sharply, falling from 18% in December 2024 to below 7% by February 2025 with buyers delaying purchases in hopes incentives would return.</p>\n<p>The federal government has <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/canadas-new-ev-rebate-program-is-live-everything-you-need-to-know/\" id=\"114100\" type=\"post\">since reinstated rebates</a>, again offering $5,000 for fully electric vehicles and $2,500 for plug-in hybrids, with a gradual phase-out planned through 2030 — or until funds are exhausted.</p>\n<p>Transport Minister Steven MacKinnon has pledged closer monitoring this time.</p>\n<p>“The way the process works is you get a pre-approval before you can apply the rebate at point of sale, which is obviously what we want, and we’ll make sure that the free flow of information between us and dealer networks is assured,” MacKinnon said.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",
