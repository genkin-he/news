            "title": "Slate Drivers Will Be Able to Charge at Tesla Superchargers",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Startup automaker Slate Auto has joined the growing list of electric vehicle manufacturers integrating with Tesla’s industry-leading <a href=\"http://driveteslacanada.ca/supercharger\">Supercharger </a>network. The Michigan-based company announced that its upcoming lineup of compact electric trucks and SUVs will feature the North American Charging Standard (NACS) port, giving drivers access to Tesla’s 25,000-plus Supercharger stalls across North America when their EVs become available late next year.</p>\n<p>Since Slate vehicles will come natively equipped with the Tesla-style connector—now standardized as <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/white-house-throws-its-support-behind-nacs-as-teslas-charging-tech-gets-closer-to-sae-standardization/\">SAE J3400</a>—owners will be able to plug in directly at Supercharger stations without needing any adapters. The charging port is located on the driver’s-side rear corner of the vehicle, mirroring Tesla’s design, which allows for normal parking alignment and eliminates the need to take up two or more parking spots to plug in.</p>\n<p>While the addition of Supercharger access is a major win for customers, the Slate truck and SUV are designed primarily as affordable, around-town EVs rather than long-range road-trippers. With a base 52.7-kWh battery offering lower than average driving ranges of roughly 150 miles (241 km) of range—or up to 240 miles (386 km) with the optional 84.3-kWh pack—Slate’s vehicles target urban and suburban drivers who typically charge at home.</p>\n<p>According to Slate, their EVs will support DC fast charging at up to 120 kW, allowing a 20–80 percent charge in about 30 minutes. The vehicles will also be compatible with CCS1 and J1772 chargers through adapters, broadening charging options beyond Tesla’s network.</p>\n<p>The 2-seat pickup and upcoming 5-seat SUV are expected to launch in late 2026, with starting prices projected in the mid-US$20,000 range. Although early estimates suggested that the $7,500 U.S. federal EV tax credit could have brought the effective price below US$20,000, that incentive is no longer available. </p>\n<p>Still, Slate aims to position its vehicles among the most affordable electric options on the market. Customers can already place fully refundable US$50 reservations on the company’s website.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h-will-slate-auto-be-coming-to-canada\">Will Slate Auto Be Coming to Canada?</h3>\n<p>Probably. Slate Auto has said it intends to come to Canada, but it will only happen after the U.S. launch. Launching a new automotive brand, and in particular an EV brand, is not for the faint of heart, so if the company is able to survive long enough, their EVs will eventually be offered in Canada, although there is no specific timeline for when this might happen.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

Based on the number of Supercharger cabinets seen at the site, the location will likely feature 12 V4 charging stalls, capable of delivering up to 325 kW of power for compatible vehicles.</p>\n<p>The construction was first spotted and reported by <a href=\"https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/members/jaslesp.183521/\">Jaslesp</a> on the TMC forum, who shared early photos from the site. Based on these photos, the underground conduit work has been completed, the Supercharger cabinets have been installed, and the V4 Supercharger posts themselves are waiting to be put in

            "title": "Las Vegas Police Unveil Fleet of Tesla Cybertrucks for Patrol Duty",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) has officially rolled out its Tesla <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/new-recall-reveals-number-of-tesla-cybertrucks-sold-in-canada-since-30000-price-hike/\">Cybertruck</a> fleet, marking one of the most significant law enforcement technology upgrades in the country. The specialized vehicles, upfitted by <em>UP.FIT</em>, are now being deployed across every area command in the city.</p>\n<p>Sheriff Kevin McMahill introduced the new trucks during a press event on Tuesday, emphasizing their durability and versatility for the region’s varied terrain. </p>\n<p>“They will be at every area command,” McMahill said. “The trucks are built tough to handle everything from Fremont Street to Red Rock Canyon.”</p>\n \n<p>The UP.FIT Patrol Cybertrucks are fully equipped for law enforcement duties, featuring specialized storage for ladders, shields, and less-lethal response tools. McMahill described the Cybertrucks as the “next evolution” in public safety, highlighting how the department continues to embrace advanced technology — from SWAT vehicles to robotics — to enhance officer effectiveness and community safety.</p>\n<p>Beyond the eye-catching looks, the Cybertruck fleet promises substantial operational savings for taxpayers. Each electric patrol vehicle is expected to save an estimated $47,540 over a typical five-year service life compared to a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) patrol truck.</p>\n<p>According to 2024 Las Vegas energy data, with gasoline averaging $3.78 per gallon and electricity at $0.21 per kWh, each Cybertruck could generate annual fuel savings between $8,800 and $12,000. Maintenance costs are also projected to drop by at least $3,540 per vehicle over five years, thanks to Tesla’s simplified all-electric drivetrain.</p>\n<figure class=\"is-layout-flex

The company has posted a new Manufacturing Engineer job opening in Fremont, California, specifically tied to developing and launching battery manufacturing equipment for the upcoming electric supercar.</p>\n<p>According to the description, the successful candidate will “ideate concepts for equipment and manufacturing systems,” “validate and optimize processes from early prototype builds through full-volume production,” and “transition products from low-volume prototypes to large-scale production.” That scope aligns with a program approaching the manufacturing validation phase — a strong indicator that Tesla is moving closer to physical production readiness.</p>\n<p>The engineer will help bring large-scale manufacturing systems from early concept through full production launch, ensuring a smooth handoff to operations teams. The company notes the position involves domestic and international travel to support equipment testing and setup across various Tesla sites, indicating cross-team collaboration typical of an early production ramp.<em> (h/t: <a href=\"https://x.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1983044415766536495\">@SawyerMerritt</a>)</em></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"roadster\" class=\"wp-image-109974 jetpack-lazy-image\" data-attachment-id=\"109974\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"roadster\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?fit=753%2C487&amp;ssl=1\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?resize=753%2C487&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?w=753&amp;ssl=1 753w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?fit=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?fit=753%2C487&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"753,487\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-roadster-production-inches-closer-with-new-job-posting/attachment/roadster-6/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"487\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?resize=753%2C487&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" width=\"753\"/><noscript><img alt=\"roadster\" class=\"wp-image-109974\" data-attachment-id=\"109974\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"roadster\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?fit=753%2C487&amp;ssl=1\" data-lazy-fallback=\"1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?fit=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?fit=753%2C487&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"753,487\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-roadster-production-inches-closer-with-new-job-posting/attachment/roadster-6/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"487\" sizes=\"(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?resize=753%2C487&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?w=753&amp;ssl=1 753w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/roadster.png?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w\" width=\"753\"/></noscript></figure></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/manufacturing-engineer-roadster-254365\">posting</a> marks one of the clearest signals yet that the Roadster is transitioning from concept to production preparation.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Lucid is teaming up with Nvidia to bring advanced self-driving technology to its next generation of electric vehicles (EVs). The California-based automaker announced on Tuesday that its <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/lucid-confirms-2026-launch-for-50k-midsize-electric-suv/\">upcoming midsize model</a> will feature Level 4 autonomous capability powered by Nvidia’s DRIVE AGX Thor computing platform and DriveOS software.</p>\n<p>Level 4 autonomy—described by Lucid in its press release as “eyes-off, hands-off, mind-off” driving—would allow the car to operate itself under most conditions without the driver needing to monitor the road. </p>\n<p>Lucid’s interim CEO, Marc Winterhoff, said the partnership combines the company’s “engineering excellence” with Nvidia’s artificial intelligence and computing power to create “the smartest and safest autonomous vehicles on the road.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called it a glimpse into a future where vehicles evolve into “supercomputers on wheels.”</p>\n<p>Before introducing Level 4, Lucid plans to roll out an enhanced “Level 2++” version of its <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/lucid-brings-hands-free-driving-to-dreamdrive-pro-video/\">DreamDrive Pro</a> driver-assist system in the Gravity SUV. The system will allow hands-free and point-to-point driving before the company transitions to full autonomy in its midsize lineup.</p>\n<p>The Gravity will also benefit from Nvidia’s scalable software architecture, allowing new automated features to be added through over-the-air updates. Lucid says this approach will keep its vehicles at the forefront of innovation as software continues to define the driving experience.</p>\n<p>Beyond self-driving technology, Lucid plans to use Nvidia’s Industrial AI platform to modernize its manufacturing operations. The company is developing digital twins of its production plants to simulate, test, and optimize factory layouts, aiming to cut costs, improve quality, and speed up vehicle delivery.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>The federal government in Ottawa is reportedly exploring the removal of its 100 per cent tariff on electric vehicles (EVs) imported from China.</p>\n<p>The tariff, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/canada-imposes-100-tariffs-on-chinese-made-evs/\">announced in August 2024</a> and officially introduced on October 1, effectively more than doubled import duties on Chinese-manufactured EVs—from a previous rate of 6.1 per cent to 106.1 per cent. The tariff also meant Tesla could no longer export its vehicles from Giga Shanghai to Canada, a problem which has been exacerbated by the current tariff situation with the United States. </p>\n<p>The timing of the reconsideration coincides with Prime Minister Mark Carney’s upcoming Asian tour, which includes stops at the ASEAN Leaders’ Summit in Kuala Lumpur and the APEC Summit in Gyeongju, South Korea. According to a report by <em><a href=\"https://www.thewirechina.com/2025/10/26/canada-set-to-side-with-china-on-evs/\">The Wire China</a></em>, the government is using the trip to advance what Carney has described as a “strategic relationship” with China.</p>\n<p>One of the major forces behind the potential policy shift is pressure from Canada’s agricultural sector. Provincial leaders in Manitoba and Saskatchewan have urged the federal government to drop the EV tariff, citing China’s retaliatory tariffs on Canadian canola and pork as a key obstacle. </p>\n<p>Chinese officials have reportedly suggested that lifting the EV tariff could lead to the removal of duties on Canadian agricultural exports, providing much-needed relief for farmers in Western Canada.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h-implications-for-canada-s-ev-market-and-supply-chain\">Implications for Canada’s EV Market and Supply Chain</h3>\n<p>Removing the tariff could open the Canadian market to a new wave of affordable Chinese-made electric vehicles from brands such as <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/byd-is-taking-the-first-steps-to-enter-the-canadian-market/\">BYD</a>, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/the-chinese-zeekr-001-fr-is-the-latest-tesla-model-s-plaid-challenger/\">Zeekr</a>, and <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/geely-files-for-us-ipo-of-electric-brand-zeekr-seeking-10-billion-valuation/\">Geely</a>, increasing consumer choice and accelerating EV adoption.</p>\n<p>It would also allow Tesla to import the Model 3 from Giga Shanghai, avoiding the 25% tariff on EVs imported from the United States. Tesla has been able to get around this roadblock for the <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-ships-second-batch-of-giga-berlin-model-ys-to-canada/\">Model Y by importing the electric SUV from German</a>y and its Giga Berlin factory.</p>\n<p>However, not everyone agrees with the idea of rolling back the tariffs. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has been vocal in his opposition, <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/11477482/doug-ford-ev-tariff-response-canola/\">saying earlier this month</a> there’s “no damn way” Canada should remove them. Ford argues that the tariffs are essential to protecting Ontario’s growing auto and battery manufacturing industry—one that has benefited from billions in government subsidies and is expected to create thousands of jobs.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Today marks the 15-year anniversary of the Tesla’s <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-cybercab-giga-texas-crash-tests-fremont-sighting/\">Fremont </a>manufacturing facility in California. Originally the site of the former New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI) joint venture, the plant was acquired and transformed by Tesla in 2010, quickly becoming the cornerstone of the electric revolution.</p>\n<p>Over the course of its operation, the Fremont factory has produced more than 3 million vehicles, having surpassed the <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-fremont-factory-produces-3-millionth-car/\">three-million mark by May 2024</a>. It achieved a record output of nearly 560,000 vehicles in 2023 alone, reflecting ramp-up efforts and streamlined production workflows.</p>\n<p>It has also produced <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-7-millionth-car-rolls-off-production-line-at-fremont-factory/\">Tesla’s 7 millionth car</a>, and as of October 2024, had <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/teslas-fremont-factory-builds-its-1-millionth-model-y/\">produced over 1 million Model Y vehicles</a>.</p>\n<p>According to Tesla’s latest quarterly report, the facility’s installed annual capacity is estimated at over 650,000 vehicles, with up to 550,000 of those attributed to the Model 3 and Model Y, and up to 100,000 for the Model S and Model X.</p>\n<p>The Fremont factory also has the distinction of being Tesla’s only facility that assembles four of their flagship models — the Model S, Model 3, Model X and Model Y.</p>\n<p>Beyond the vehicle production figures, the job creation and investment impact in California has also been significant. The factory now employs more than 20,000 workers in the region, making it one of the state’s largest manufacturing employers, along with billions of dollars that have been invested in plant upgrades over the years.</p>\n<p>When Tesla stepped in, the former <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-spent-10-billion-on-u-s-manufacturing-last-year-plans-another-8-billion-this-fiscal-year/\">NUMMI </a>facility marked the end of one automotive era and the start of another. Under Tesla’s leadership, the site transformed from a conventional internal-combustion vehicle plant to a high-volume EV production centre. </p>\n<p>Since beginning Model S production in 2012, followed by the launch of the mass-market Model 3 and later the Model Y, the Fremont factory has remained at the core of Tesla’s effort to scale electric-vehicle manufacturing across North America—and with well over 3 million EVs built to date, it shows no signs of slowing down.</p>\n<p><strong>Related Stories:<br/></strong>• <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-logs-50000-driverless-miles-at-giga-texas-and-fremont/\">Tesla Logs 50,000 Driverless Miles At Giga Texas and Fremont</a><br/>• <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/two-millionth-tesla-vehicle-rolls-off-fremont-factory-production-line/\">Two millionth Tesla vehicle rolls off Fremont factory production line</a><br/>• <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-spent-10-billion-on-u-s-manufacturing-last-year-plans-another-8-billion-this-fiscal-year/\">Tesla Spent $10 Billion on U.S. Manufacturing Last Year, Plans Another $8 Billion This Fiscal Year</a></p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

Ontario-based companies Magil Construction Canada Inc. and Steelcon. Magil is responsible for laying the foundation — involving over 32,000 cubic metres of concrete and nearly 5,000 tonnes of rebar — while Steelcon will handle the installation of the structural steel components that will form the backbone of the new facility.</p>\n<p>Ontario’s Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, Vic Fedeli, said the project reflects the province’s ability to attract global investment even in uncertain times. “We commend PowerCo for moving swiftly to bring this project to life and for recognizing the resilience of Ontario’s world-class workforce, as well as our strong leadership in the auto and advanced manufacturing sectors,” he said.</p>\n<p>The St. Thomas plant was <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/volkswagen-picks-st-thomas-ontario-to-build-their-first-north-america-battery-cell-factory/\">first announced in March 2023</a>, following months of negotiations between Volkswagen, PowerCo, and Canadian officials. The decision to locate in Canada was driven by access to clean energy, critical minerals like nickel and lithium, and eligibility for U.S. Inflation Reduction Act incentives through cross-border trade.</p>\n<p>PowerCo has also begun recruiting workers across southwestern Ontario, with early hiring campaigns already drawing hundreds of applications.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "title": "Elon Musk’s Leadership “Critical,” Tesla Chair Warns Ahead of $1 Trillion Pay Vote",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Tesla Board Chair <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-chairwoman-robyn-denholm-defends-elon-musk-at-trial/\">Robyn Denholm</a> has issued a warning to shareholders: CEO Elon Musk may walk away from the company if they vote against his proposed $1 trillion performance-based compensation plan. The warning came in a letter to investors on Monday, just over a week before Tesla’s annual meeting on November 6, where shareholders will decide the fate of the massive pay deal.</p>\n<p>Denholm emphasized that Musk’s continued leadership is “critical” to Tesla’s success as it accelerates its push into artificial intelligence, robotics, and autonomous driving. “Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become,” she wrote.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-proposes-1-trillion-pay-package-for-elon-musk-tied-to-ambitious-10-year-goals/\">proposed pay package</a>—considered the largest in corporate history—would grant Musk 12 tranches of stock options tied to a series of ambitious milestones. These include Tesla reaching an $8.5 trillion market capitalization, producing 20 million vehicles annually, deploying 1 million robotaxis, and delivering 1 million Optimus humanoid robots.</p>\n<p>If approved, Musk could gain more than 423 million additional shares, increasing his stake from roughly 13% to around 25%. The deal is designed to retain Musk’s focus on Tesla for at least another seven years, according to Denholm, who described it as “less about compensation and more about ensuring his voting influence over the company’s future.”</p>\n \n<p>The timing of the letter comes as pressure mounts from proxy advisory firms and investor groups urging shareholders to reject the proposal. Both Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) have criticized the “astronomical” value of the package, citing concerns about corporate governance and Musk’s growing influence over Tesla’s board.</p>\n<p>Denholm dismissed those concerns, arguing that Musk’s vision and technical expertise are irreplaceable assets as Tesla transitions from being “just another car company” to a leader in global AI and clean energy. </p>\n<p>“The opportunity for Tesla ahead is significant,” she told <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/27/tesla-musk-pay-shareholder-vote.html\">CNBC</a>, highlighting the company’s expansion into Full Self-Driving software and the Optimus robotics program.</p>\n<p>Musk, meanwhile, has publicly lashed out at proxy firms, calling them “corporate terrorists” during Tesla’s recent earnings call. He also reiterated his desire for greater control over Tesla’s direction, warning he’s uncomfortable leading the company’s AI and robotics efforts without sufficient influence.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, a Delaware court struck down Musk’s 2018 pay deal, ruling it was improperly awarded by a board too closely tied to him.</p>\n<p>Along with publishing the letter, Tesla took to the road to promote Musk’s pay package, bringing a Cybercab and Optimus robot to New York City, coinciding with Denholm’s appearance at the Nasdaq MarketSite Studio on Monday.</p>\n \n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",
