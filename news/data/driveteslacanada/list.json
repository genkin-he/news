Now, a new nationwide distribution agreement with Supply Partners Group is set to add even more momentum to that popularity.</p>\n<p>Under the deal, Supply Partners Group will handle the distribution of Tesla Powerwall units and related accessories across Australia, streamlining logistics for installers and helping meet surging demand in one of the world’s most solar-saturated markets. Inventory is expected to arrive in late February, with official sales beginning in mid-March 2026.</p>\n<p>Australia leads the world in rooftop solar adoption per capita, and battery storage is quickly becoming the next logical step for homeowners looking to maximize energy independence. With electricity prices fluctuating and government rebates available in several states, home batteries are moving from niche upgrade to mainstream investment.</p>\n<p>“We are proud to officially welcome Tesla Powerwall into the Supply Partners portfolio,” said Lliam Ricketts, Co-Founder and Director of Innovation at Supply Partners Group. “Tesla sets a high bar, and we’ve worked hard to earn the opportunity to represent a brand that customers actively ask for. This partnership reflects the strength of our logistics, technical services and customer experience, and it’s a win for installers who want premium options they can trust.”</p>\n<p>He added, “Powerwall is already a category-defining product, and what’s ahead makes it even more compelling. As pricing sharpens and capability expands, we see a clear runway for installers to confidently spec Powerwall for premium residential installs, backed by Supply Partners’ national distribution footprint and service model.”</p>\n<p><strong>Related Stories:<br/>• <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/energy/tesla-energy-plan-a-new-battery-based-retail-energy-plan-in-australia-that-includes-a-significant-powerwall-discount/\">Tesla Energy Plan – a New Battery-Based Retail Energy Plan in Australia That Includes a Powerwall Discount</a><br/>• <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-drops-powerwall-price-in-australia-again/\">Tesla drops Powerwall price in Australia again</a><br/>• <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/energy/tesla-powerwalls-and-solar-to-be-installed-on-another-3000-low-income-houses-in-australia/\">Tesla Powerwalls and Solar to be installed on another 3,000 low-income houses in Australia</a></strong></p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

Customers in Germany and other European markets supplied by Giga Berlin can configure the SUV with two additional rear seats for an extra €2,500 (C$4,000/US$2,950).</p>\n<p>According to the online configurator, estimated deliveries are currently slated for April to May 2026 — the same window shown for the five-seat version with the same drivetrain. </p>\n \n<p>Before the <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-model-y-refresh-codenamed-juniper-under-development/\" id=\"69192\" type=\"post\">Juniper refresh</a> rolled out across Europe in early 2025, Tesla had briefly offered a seven-seat version of the previous legacy Model Y in late 2024.

While Tesla already offers a standard pedestal option, this latest version is taller and offers improved cable management inspired by the design of public charging stations.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-taller-cleaner-charging-setup\">A Taller, Cleaner Charging Setup</h3>\n<p>Tesla’s existing “Pedestal for Wall Connector” provides a free-standing solution for situations where a wall mount isn’t practical. However, with that shorter pedestal, the charging cable is typically wrapped around the Wall Connector itself — similar to a traditional wall-mounted setup.</p>\n<p>The new Tall Pedestal changes that approach. Standing 76 inches high and constructed from aluminum, the updated design routes and secures the charging cable near the top of the post. The result is a more controlled hanging loop, similar to what you’d see at many public EV charging stations. This keeps the cable elevated and neatly organized, reducing the chance of it dragging or getting bunched up on the ground, giving the installation a more polished, commercial look.</p>\n<figure

owners to charge one or two Tesla vehicles simultaneously when paired with compatible Gen 3 Wall Connectors or the Universal Wall Connector.</p>\n<p>Tesla includes the following when purchased the Tall Pedestal for Wall Connector:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>One 76-inch aluminum pedestal</li>\n<li>Two cable brackets</li>\n<li>Four wire glands for global wiring configurations</li>\n<li>Four mounting screws to secure the Wall Connector</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As with most EV infrastructure, installation is site-specific. Tesla notes that trenching and a concrete pad are typically required to properly secure the pedestal, and recommends consulting a local contractor before purchasing. The Wall Connector itself is not included.</p>\n<p>At $900, the Tall Pedestal is not cheap, but for sites seeking a cleaner, more professional free-standing charging solution — especially one that mirrors public charging design — it offers a factory-backed option that integrates seamlessly into Tesla’s ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the new Tall Pedestal was not added to the Canadian online shop.

With new shipments arriving from Giga Berlin, many existing reservation holders and prospective owners were wondering whether incoming vehicles would include the updated hardware.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Based on what we have learned, it appears the first batch of Model Y Performance vehicles arriving in Canada soon will not include the black headliner or the larger 16-inch screen, as those vehicles were built before the production changeover.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What This Means for New Orders</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">With the configurator now updated, Tesla is announcing that the transition is complete for Canadian production allocations. Customers placing orders today can expect to receive vehicles built with these updated interior features.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For buyers who have pending deliveries from earlier shipments however, the features may not be included depending on build timing.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

Despite those warnings, no public notice was issued until January 10, 2025 — just <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/canadas-izev-rebate-program-is-nearly-out-of-money-heres-what-you-need-to-know/\">three days before the program ran dry</a>, triggering a surge in claims and putting Tesla at the centre of the controversy.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-early-warnings-late-notice\">Early Warnings, Late Notice</h3>\n<p>According to internal records obtained through Access to Information requests by <em><a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/canada/feds-knew-ev-rebates-were-running-out-months-before-telling-public-documents-suggest/ar-AA1X72qx?ocid=msedgntp&amp;pc=U531&amp;cvid=69a0e72bd7ba4f41a0172989796b3404&amp;ei=16\">The Canadian Press</a></em>, federal officials had identified as early as November 2024 that core funding for iZEV could be depleted between late December and early January. However, the first public signal that the program was nearing its end did not come until January 10, 2025 — just days before the money was gone.</p>\n<p>Three days later, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/canadas-izev-rebate-program-officially-paused-after-running-out-of-money/\">the program was halted after a flood of rebate submissions</a>. Over a single weekend, $48 million in claims were filed, $43 million of which were from Tesla alone.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-record-demand-and-a-political-dilemma\">Record Demand — and a Political Dilemma</h3>\n<p>The iZEV program, launched in 2019, provided up to $5,000 for battery electric vehicles and $2,500 for plug-in hybrids, with a price cap of roughly $55,000. For Tesla, that meant the Model 3 and certain Model Y variants were among the most popular vehicles benefiting from the incentive.</p>\n<p>Demand surged in late 2024, driven in part by <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/quebec-pauses-ev-rebates-until-april-2025/\" id=\"99055\" type=\"post\">Quebec announcing it scaling back and temporarily pausing  its provincial rebate</a> and growing concerns that federal funding was running low. December alone saw more than $122 million in claims processed — a record burn rate.</p>\n<p>Internal emails show officials were debating how and when to alert stakeholders. One memo warned that an orderly wind-down was necessary to “limit negative impacts on industry and consumers.” Yet the communications plan was delayed as political discussions reportedly explored injecting new funding into the program.</p>\n<p>By January 8, staff were still seeking clarity on remaining funds. The answer, according to one internal message: “The program has run out of funds.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fallout-for-tesla-and-the-ev-market\">Fallout for Tesla and the EV Market</h3>\n<p>Tesla’s $43 million in submissions — representing vehicles already delivered and eligible under program rules — became a political lightning rod in the aftermath. As we previously reported, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-canada-fights-back-against-allegations-of-fraudulent-izev-claims/\">Tesla maintained its filings were compliant</a> and processed within longstanding guidelines, which in the end were <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/canada-clears-tesla-in-izev-rebate-investigation-43m-payment-unfrozen/\" id=\"105897\" type=\"post\">corrobated after an internal investigation cleared the automaker of any wrongdoing</a>, but the damage to Tesla’s brand was already done.</p>\n<p>The pause also had immediate consequences for the broader EV market, as national EV market share dropped sharply, falling from 18% in December 2024 to below 7% by February 2025 with buyers delaying purchases in hopes incentives would return.</p>\n<p>The federal government has <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/canadas-new-ev-rebate-program-is-live-everything-you-need-to-know/\" id=\"114100\" type=\"post\">since reinstated rebates</a>, again offering $5,000 for fully electric vehicles and $2,500 for plug-in hybrids, with a gradual phase-out planned through 2030 — or until funds are exhausted.</p>\n<p>Transport Minister Steven MacKinnon has pledged closer monitoring this time.</p>\n<p>“The way the process works is you get a pre-approval before you can apply the rebate at point of sale, which is obviously what we want, and we’ll make sure that the free flow of information between us and dealer networks is assured,” MacKinnon said.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

Even without a broad marketing campaign — and despite the referral discount being removed — buyers are continuing to place orders, perhaps driven in part by the threat of a price increase.</p>\n<p>This all but proves true what we’ve been saying – Tesla finally hit the feature-set and pricing sweet spot for Cybertruck, which struggled to gain traction as sales fell roughly 50% in 2025 to just over 20,000 units, down from about 39,000 in 2024.</p>\n<p>However, this high level of demand also highlights that Tesla is currently production constrained with this trim, which for Canadians, isn’t encouraging. Unless the automaker is able to substantially increase Cybertruck production, backlog growth will continue with timelines falling deeper into 2027, so priority will almost certainly remain with the U.S. market. </p>\n<p>If that’s the case, Canadians could be in for a long wait before we see a more reasonably priced Cybertruck. This is of course also ignoring the current tariff situation, which has no signs of ending soon and has inflated Cybertruck prices to astronomical levels – the cheapest trim available north of the border is C$139,990.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Canada’s DC fast-charging network is expanding at a record pace — and importantly, drivers are actually using it. A new Q4 2025 industry report from <a href=\"https://www.paren.app/reports/canadian-ev-fast-charging-q4-2025\">Paren</a>, a charging data analytics platform, paints a detailed picture of how Canada’s public DC fast charging (DCFC) infrastructure evolved over the past year. </p>\n<p>The headline number is impressive: 1,925 new fast-charging ports were added in 2025, pushing the national total to 8,804. That represents a 28% year-over-year increase, even as EV sales cooled compared to previous growth cycles.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-infrastructure-growth-outpaces-expectations\">Infrastructure Growth Outpaces Expectations</h3>\n<p>Deployment accelerated throughout the year, with Q4 setting a new quarterly record for installations. Canada also added 529 new fast-charging stations in 2025, bringing the total to 2,570 nationwide.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the number of ports is growing faster than the number of sites, meaning stations are getting larger. On average, Canadian DC fast-charging sites now host 3.42 ports per location, up slightly from 3.37 a year earlier. New sites built in 2025 averaged more than 3.6 ports each.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114452\" data-attachment-id=\"114452\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public Fast Charging Stations &amp; Ports _ Canada\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public-Fast-Charging-Stations-Ports-_-Canada.png?fit=859%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public-Fast-Charging-Stations-Ports-_-Canada.png?fit=252%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public-Fast-Charging-Stations-Ports-_-Canada.png?fit=906%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"906,1080\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-leads-as-canada-adds-nearly-2000-dc-fast-charging-ports-in-2025/attachment/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_public-fast-charging-stations-ports-_-canada/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"1024\" sizes=\"(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public-Fast-Charging-Stations-Ports-_-Canada.png?resize=859%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public-Fast-Charging-Stations-Ports-_-Canada.png?resize=859%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 859w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public-Fast-Charging-Stations-Ports-_-Canada.png?resize=252%2C300&amp;ssl=1 252w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public-Fast-Charging-Stations-Ports-_-Canada.png?resize=768%2C915&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/69975150ff43fc583112eed2_Public-Fast-Charging-Stations-Ports-_-Canada.png?w=906&amp;ssl=1 906w\" style=\"width:498px;height:auto\" width=\"859\"/></figure></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/tesla/\" id=\"21431\" type=\"post_tag\">Tesla </a>remains the largest single operator in the country, with 2,942 ports nationwide after adding 512 in 2025.

Together, they represent nearly 86% of Canada’s total DCFC infrastructure — and accounted for almost 89% of new deployments last year.</p>\n<p>Utility-backed expansion continues to play a major role. As Paren explains:</p>\n<p>“Utility-backed networks continue to anchor deployment in the two largest markets. In British Columbia, BC Hydro accounted for 38% of the province’s 614 new ports in 2025. In Quebec, Circuit Électrique represented 45% of the 610 ports added. This concentration underscores the continued role of regulated, utility-led expansion in scaling infrastructure across provinces.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-utilization-remains-stable-even-as-capacity-grows\">Utilization Remains Stable — Even as Capacity Grows</h3>\n<p>One of the most encouraging findings is that demand is keeping pace with supply. Average national utilization reached 11.9% in Q4 2025, up slightly from 11.6% in Q3. That may sound modest, but it’s notable given the surge in new deployments. In other words, new capacity is being absorbed rather than sitting idle.</p>\n<p>Major metro areas are driving much of that demand. Vancouver posted utilization near 30% in Q4, while Toronto surpassed 20%. In less densely populated provinces, utilization remains much lower — often just one or two sessions per port per day.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pricing-and-reliability\">Pricing and Reliability</h3>\n<p>The national average price for DC fast charging in Q4 was approximately $0.42/kWh before taxes, though provincial averages ranged from about $0.37 to $0.65 per kWh. Pricing models vary widely, with Canada showing a much more diverse mix than the U.S., including fixed, time-based, power-based, and time-of-use structures.</p>\n<p>Reliability remains strong nationwide, averaging 93.2% in Q4 — comparable to U.S. performance levels. Most provinces scored above 90%, though remote regions like Yukon lagged behind.</p>\n<p>Overall, 2025 marked a clear scaling year for Canada’s fast-charging ecosystem. The infrastructure is growing, utilization is holding firm, and leading markets are beginning to shift from basic corridor buildout to densification — a sign that Canada’s EV charging network is maturing, but not yet saturated.</p>\n<p>You can watch the Paren webinar discussing their report below.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ignition-responsive-embed\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"548\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jQWmG8KTofM?feature=oembed\" title=\"Paren Webinar | State of the Industry Report: Canadian EV Fast Charging - Q4 2025\" width=\"975\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p></p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Tesla and IG Metall have reached a settlement in their <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-files-charges-over-alleged-recording-incident-at-giga-berlin-ig-metall-calls-claim-false/\">high-profile dispute</a> over an alleged unauthorized recording at Gigafactory Berlin, easing tensions just days before critical works council elections.</p>\n<p>The agreement, reached before the labour court in Frankfurt (Oder), temporarily halts further public accusations related to the controversial February 10 meeting. According to court spokeswoman Jutta Homann, both sides have committed not to repeat certain allegations connected to the incident until the works council elections conclude on March 4. (via <a href=\"https://www.stern.de/gesellschaft/regional/berlin-brandenburg/konflikt-tesla-und-ig-metall--tesla-und-ig-metall--vergleich-nach-streit-um-tonaufnahme-37174252.html\"><em>Stern</em></a>)</p>\n<p>The settlement follows weeks of escalating legal action between the Tesla and Germany’s largest metalworkers’ union.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dual-investigations-now-de-escalated\">Dual Investigations Now De-Escalated</h3>\n<p>The conflict began when <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-files-charges-over-alleged-recording-incident-at-giga-berlin-ig-metall-calls-claim-false/\">Tesla accused an IG Metall union secretary of secretly recording</a> a works council meeting using a laptop. The company filed a criminal complaint, prompting prosecutors to open an investigation into possible violations of confidentiality laws and the Works Constitution Act.</p>\n<p>In response, IG Metall <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-giga-berlin-manager-faces-criminal-complaint-from-ig-metall-as-dispute-escalates/\">denied the allegations and filed its own criminal complaint</a> against Tesla plant manager André Thierig, alleging defamation.</p>\n<p>With the new settlement in place, both sides appear to be stepping back from further public escalation—at least for now. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-focus-shifts-to-works-council-election\">Focus Shifts to Works Council Election</h3>\n<p>The timing of the dispute has been closely tied to the upcoming works council vote at Gigafactory Berlin, Tesla’s only European manufacturing plant, located in Grünheide near Berlin. Approximately 11,000 employees work at the facility, which produces vehicles for the European market.</p>\n<p>IG Metall district manager Jan Otto said the settlement allows attention to return to workplace priorities. “Next week’s election is about better working conditions in the Gigafactory – there is a lot to do.”</p>\n<p>The union has been pushing for a formal collective bargaining agreement at the plant, something Tesla has historically resisted. While IG Metall holds representation within the works council structure, the facility does not operate under a traditional union contract.</p>\n<p>As we told you earlier today, Elon Musk recently <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/elon-musk-warns-giga-berlin-expansion-could-stall-ahead-of-works-council-vote/\" id=\"114432\" type=\"post\">delivered a message to Gigafactory Berlin employees via a pre-recorded video</a>. In that address, Musk warned that the plant’s future expansion could be at risk if it did not remain, in his words, “free from external influences.” </p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",
