The lighter grey roof liner had been a longstanding feature of the Model Y, but many owners prefer the darker finish as it gives the vehicle a more refined look.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Standard Range variant continues to list the grey headliner for now.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114481\" data-attachment-id=\"114481\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"img_5839\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5839.jpg?fit=975%2C514&amp;ssl=1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5839.jpg?fit=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5839.jpg?fit=1137%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1137,600\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/img_5839/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"514\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5839.jpg?resize=975%2C514&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5839.jpg?resize=1024%2C540&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5839.jpg?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5839.jpg?resize=768%2C405&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5839.jpg?w=1137&amp;ssl=1 1137w\" width=\"975\"/></figure>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Larger 16-Inch QHD Display Confirmed</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">The configurator also confirms that all Canadian Model Y trims now come with the larger 16-inch QHD center display, replacing the previous 15.4-inch unit.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114482\" data-attachment-id=\"114482\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"img_5838\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5838.jpg?fit=975%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5838.jpg?fit=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5838.jpg?fit=1320%2C974&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1320,974\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/img_5838-2/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"720\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5838.jpg?resize=975%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5838.jpg?resize=1024%2C756&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5838.jpg?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5838.jpg?resize=768%2C567&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/img_5838.jpg?w=1320&amp;ssl=1 1320w\" width=\"975\"/></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">Whether these two features were included for Canadian-bound vehicles was one of the biggest question marks for buyers in recent weeks. With new shipments arriving from Giga Berlin, many existing reservation holders and prospective owners were wondering whether incoming vehicles would include the updated hardware.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Based on what we have learned, it appears the first batch of Model Y Performance vehicles arriving in Canada soon will not include the black headliner or the larger 16-inch screen, as those vehicles were built before the production changeover.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What This Means for New Orders</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">With the configurator now updated, Tesla is announcing that the transition is complete for Canadian production allocations. Customers placing orders today can expect to receive vehicles built with these updated interior features.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For buyers who have pending deliveries from earlier shipments however, the features may not be included depending on build timing.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Newly obtained internal documents show that Transport Canada was aware as early as November 2024 that the iZEV rebate program was nearing the end of its funding runway. Despite those warnings, no public notice was issued until January 10, 2025 — just <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/canadas-izev-rebate-program-is-nearly-out-of-money-heres-what-you-need-to-know/\">three days before the program ran dry</a>, triggering a surge in claims and putting Tesla at the centre of the controversy.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-early-warnings-late-notice\">Early Warnings, Late Notice</h3>\n<p>According to internal records obtained through Access to Information requests by <em><a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/canada/feds-knew-ev-rebates-were-running-out-months-before-telling-public-documents-suggest/ar-AA1X72qx?ocid=msedgntp&amp;pc=U531&amp;cvid=69a0e72bd7ba4f41a0172989796b3404&amp;ei=16\">The Canadian Press</a></em>, federal officials had identified as early as November 2024 that core funding for iZEV could be depleted between late December and early January. However, the first public signal that the program was nearing its end did not come until January 10, 2025 — just days before the money was gone.</p>\n<p>Three days later, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/canadas-izev-rebate-program-officially-paused-after-running-out-of-money/\">the program was halted after a flood of rebate submissions</a>. Over a single weekend, $48 million in claims were filed, $43 million of which were from Tesla alone.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-record-demand-and-a-political-dilemma\">Record Demand — and a Political Dilemma</h3>\n<p>The iZEV program, launched in 2019, provided up to $5,000 for battery electric vehicles and $2,500 for plug-in hybrids, with a price cap of roughly $55,000. For Tesla, that meant the Model 3 and certain Model Y variants were among the most popular vehicles benefiting from the incentive.</p>\n<p>Demand surged in late 2024, driven in part by <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/quebec-pauses-ev-rebates-until-april-2025/\" id=\"99055\" type=\"post\">Quebec announcing it scaling back and temporarily pausing  its provincial rebate</a> and growing concerns that federal funding was running low. December alone saw more than $122 million in claims processed — a record burn rate.</p>\n<p>Internal emails show officials were debating how and when to alert stakeholders. One memo warned that an orderly wind-down was necessary to “limit negative impacts on industry and consumers.” Yet the communications plan was delayed as political discussions reportedly explored injecting new funding into the program.</p>\n<p>By January 8, staff were still seeking clarity on remaining funds. The answer, according to one internal message: “The program has run out of funds.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fallout-for-tesla-and-the-ev-market\">Fallout for Tesla and the EV Market</h3>\n<p>Tesla’s $43 million in submissions — representing vehicles already delivered and eligible under program rules — became a political lightning rod in the aftermath. As we previously reported, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-canada-fights-back-against-allegations-of-fraudulent-izev-claims/\">Tesla maintained its filings were compliant</a> and processed within longstanding guidelines, which in the end were <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/canada-clears-tesla-in-izev-rebate-investigation-43m-payment-unfrozen/\" id=\"105897\" type=\"post\">corrobated after an internal investigation cleared the automaker of any wrongdoing</a>, but the damage to Tesla’s brand was already done.</p>\n<p>The pause also had immediate consequences for the broader EV market, as national EV market share dropped sharply, falling from 18% in December 2024 to below 7% by February 2025 with buyers delaying purchases in hopes incentives would return.</p>\n<p>The federal government has <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/canadas-new-ev-rebate-program-is-live-everything-you-need-to-know/\" id=\"114100\" type=\"post\">since reinstated rebates</a>, again offering $5,000 for fully electric vehicles and $2,500 for plug-in hybrids, with a gradual phase-out planned through 2030 — or until funds are exhausted.</p>\n<p>Transport Minister Steven MacKinnon has pledged closer monitoring this time.</p>\n<p>“The way the process works is you get a pre-approval before you can apply the rebate at point of sale, which is obviously what we want, and we’ll make sure that the free flow of information between us and dealer networks is assured,” MacKinnon said.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

Even without a broad marketing campaign — and despite the referral discount being removed — buyers are continuing to place orders, perhaps driven in part by the threat of a price increase.</p>\n<p>This all but proves true what we’ve been saying – Tesla finally hit the feature-set and pricing sweet spot for Cybertruck, which struggled to gain traction as sales fell roughly 50% in 2025 to just over 20,000 units, down from about 39,000 in 2024.</p>\n<p>However, this high level of demand also highlights that Tesla is currently production constrained with this trim, which for Canadians, isn’t encouraging. Unless the automaker is able to substantially increase Cybertruck production, backlog growth will continue with timelines falling deeper into 2027, so priority will almost certainly remain with the U.S. market. </p>\n<p>If that’s the case, Canadians could be in for a long wait before we see a more reasonably priced Cybertruck. This is of course also ignoring the current tariff situation, which has no signs of ending soon and has inflated Cybertruck prices to astronomical levels – the cheapest trim available north of the border is C$139,990.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

A new Q4 2025 industry report from <a href=\"https://www.paren.app/reports/canadian-ev-fast-charging-q4-2025\">Paren</a>, a charging data analytics platform, paints a detailed picture of how Canada’s public DC fast charging (DCFC) infrastructure evolved over the past year. </p>\n<p>The headline number is impressive: 1,925 new fast-charging ports were added in 2025, pushing the national total to 8,804.

Together, they represent nearly 86% of Canada’s total DCFC infrastructure — and accounted for almost 89% of new deployments last year.</p>\n<p>Utility-backed expansion continues to play a major role. As Paren explains:</p>\n<p>“Utility-backed networks continue to anchor deployment in the two largest markets. In British Columbia, BC Hydro accounted for 38% of the province’s 614 new ports in 2025. In Quebec, Circuit Électrique represented 45% of the 610 ports added. This concentration underscores the continued role of regulated, utility-led expansion in scaling infrastructure across provinces.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-utilization-remains-stable-even-as-capacity-grows\">Utilization Remains Stable — Even as Capacity Grows</h3>\n<p>One of the most encouraging findings is that demand is keeping pace with supply. Average national utilization reached 11.9% in Q4 2025, up slightly from 11.6% in Q3. That may sound modest, but it’s notable given the surge in new deployments. In other words, new capacity is being absorbed rather than sitting idle.</p>\n<p>Major metro areas are driving much of that demand. Vancouver posted utilization near 30% in Q4, while Toronto surpassed 20%. In less densely populated provinces, utilization remains much lower — often just one or two sessions per port per day.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pricing-and-reliability\">Pricing and Reliability</h3>\n<p>The national average price for DC fast charging in Q4 was approximately $0.42/kWh before taxes, though provincial averages ranged from about $0.37 to $0.65 per kWh. Pricing models vary widely, with Canada showing a much more diverse mix than the U.S., including fixed, time-based, power-based, and time-of-use structures.</p>\n<p>Reliability remains strong nationwide, averaging 93.2% in Q4 — comparable to U.S. performance levels. Most provinces scored above 90%, though remote regions like Yukon lagged behind.</p>\n<p>Overall, 2025 marked a clear scaling year for Canada’s fast-charging ecosystem. The infrastructure is growing, utilization is holding firm, and leading markets are beginning to shift from basic corridor buildout to densification — a sign that Canada’s EV charging network is maturing, but not yet saturated.</p>\n<p>You can watch the Paren webinar discussing their report below.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ignition-responsive-embed\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"548\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jQWmG8KTofM?feature=oembed\" title=\"Paren Webinar | State of the Industry Report: Canadian EV Fast Charging - Q4 2025\" width=\"975\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p></p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

According to court spokeswoman Jutta Homann, both sides have committed not to repeat certain allegations connected to the incident until the works council elections conclude on March 4. (via <a href=\"https://www.stern.de/gesellschaft/regional/berlin-brandenburg/konflikt-tesla-und-ig-metall--tesla-und-ig-metall--vergleich-nach-streit-um-tonaufnahme-37174252.html\"><em>Stern</em></a>)</p>\n<p>The settlement follows weeks of escalating legal action between the Tesla and Germany’s largest metalworkers’ union.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dual-investigations-now-de-escalated\">Dual Investigations Now De-Escalated</h3>\n<p>The conflict began when <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-files-charges-over-alleged-recording-incident-at-giga-berlin-ig-metall-calls-claim-false/\">Tesla accused an IG Metall union secretary of secretly recording</a> a works council meeting using a laptop. The company filed a criminal complaint, prompting prosecutors to open an investigation into possible violations of confidentiality laws and the Works Constitution Act.</p>\n<p>In response, IG Metall <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-giga-berlin-manager-faces-criminal-complaint-from-ig-metall-as-dispute-escalates/\">denied the allegations and filed its own criminal complaint</a> against Tesla plant manager André Thierig, alleging defamation.</p>\n<p>With the new settlement in place, both sides appear to be stepping back from further public escalation—at least for now. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-focus-shifts-to-works-council-election\">Focus Shifts to Works Council Election</h3>\n<p>The timing of the dispute has been closely tied to the upcoming works council vote at Gigafactory Berlin, Tesla’s only European manufacturing plant, located in Grünheide near Berlin. Approximately 11,000 employees work at the facility, which produces vehicles for the European market.</p>\n<p>IG Metall district manager Jan Otto said the settlement allows attention to return to workplace priorities. “Next week’s election is about better working conditions in the Gigafactory – there is a lot to do.”</p>\n<p>The union has been pushing for a formal collective bargaining agreement at the plant, something Tesla has historically resisted. While IG Metall holds representation within the works council structure, the facility does not operate under a traditional union contract.</p>\n<p>As we told you earlier today, Elon Musk recently <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/elon-musk-warns-giga-berlin-expansion-could-stall-ahead-of-works-council-vote/\" id=\"114432\" type=\"post\">delivered a message to Gigafactory Berlin employees via a pre-recorded video</a>. In that address, Musk warned that the plant’s future expansion could be at risk if it did not remain, in his words, “free from external influences.” </p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

This change allows users to access payouts far sooner, when redemptions previously started at 25,000 points.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Redemption\" class=\"wp-image-114449\" data-attachment-id=\"114449\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Redemption\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Redemption.jpeg?fit=513%2C630&amp;ssl=1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Redemption.jpeg?fit=244%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Redemption.jpeg?fit=513%2C630&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"513,630\" data-permalink=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/wattsapp-charging-rewards-program-cash-payouts-lower-redemption-thresholds-strong-demand/attachment/redemption/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"630\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Redemption.jpeg?resize=513%2C630&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Redemption.jpeg?w=513&amp;ssl=1 513w, https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Redemption.jpeg?resize=244%2C300&amp;ssl=1 244w\" width=\"513\"/></figure></div>\n<p>Redemption timing now also differs between the two wallets. Referral Points can be redeemed at any time once the minimum threshold of 10,000 points is met. Charging Points, however, are redeemable annually in Q1 after charging data and associated carbon credits are verified by regulatory authorities. This reflects how Clean Fuel Regulation credits are processed and approved under the federal system.</p>\n<p>WattsApp says it will continue refining the platform as participation grows. With the program now live, Tesla owners using a compatible Wall Connector can begin earning points automatically through their normal home charging routine, turning everyday charging into a potential source of annual cash rewards.</p>\n<p>You can sign up for <a href=\"http://wattsapp.ca/invite/CGXP-9RRH\">Wattsapp here</a>.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "title": "Elon Musk Warns Giga Berlin Expansion Could Stall Ahead of Works Council Vote",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Tensions are rising again at Tesla’s Giga Berlin, just days before employees head to the polls to elect a new works council. In a pre-recorded video message played to staff this week, CEO Elon Musk warned that <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-giga-berlin-expansion-approved/\" id=\"91805\" type=\"post\">future expansion plans at Giga Berlin</a> could be at risk if the factory does not remain, in his words, “free from external influences.”</p>\n<p>While Musk did not directly name Germany’s metalworkers’ union, IG Metall, his comments were clearly aimed at the union’s growing role within the plant’s works council.</p>\n<p>According to accounts from employees who attended the internal screening, Musk cautioned that if outside groups were to steer Tesla off course, it would make operations significantly more difficult. He reportedly ruled out shutting down the factory, but suggested that large-scale expansion would be unlikely under such circumstances. <em>(via <a href=\"https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-musk-warnt-vor-ig-metall-und-droht-mit-expansions-stopp/100203422.html\">Handelsblatt</a>)</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-familiar-flashpoint-at-giga-berlin\">A Familiar Flashpoint at Giga Berlin</h3>\n<p>The latest remarks add fuel to an already heated debate over labour representation at Tesla’s only European factory. As <em>Drive Tesla</em> has previously reported, <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-giga-berlin-manager-faces-criminal-complaint-from-ig-metall-as-dispute-escalates/\" id=\"114200\" type=\"post\">relations between management and IG Metall have been strained</a> in the lead-up to earlier works council elections, with both sides accusing the other of overreach.</p>\n<p>Currently, IG Metall is the largest faction on the works council, though it does not hold an outright majority. With elections scheduled for early March, the balance of influence inside the factory could soon shift.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-expansion-hinges-on-favourable-conditions\">Expansion Hinges on “Favourable Conditions”</h3>\n<p>Despite the warning, Musk also struck a positive tone during the video interview, which was conducted in Austin alongside Giga Berlin plant manager André Thierig and played back to employees in Germany.</p>\n<p>He praised the facility as one of Tesla’s most impressive factories globally, highlighting its cleanliness, organization, and team spirit. Musk reportedly described the site as an outstanding production facility with exceptionally high standards.</p>\n<p>Beyond labour issues, the discussion touched on future growth. Musk signalled plans to further ramp up Model Y production, particularly if regulators approve expanded Full Self-Driving (Supervised) in Europe. He also suggested that future vehicles like the Cybercab could eventually play a role at the site, alongside potential involvement in Tesla Semi and Optimus-related projects.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most notably, Musk indicated that <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-boosts-battery-production-efforts-at-giga-berlin/\" id=\"112169\" type=\"post\">battery cell production at Giga Berlin has just begun ramping</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, any large-scale expansion appears contingent on continued regulatory approval and support from the local workforce. If those conditions are met, Musk suggested Tesla could transform Giga Berlin into the largest industrial factory complex in Europe.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/waymo\">Waymo </a>is ramping up its U.S. expansion, confirming this week plans to begin operations in both Chicago and Charlotte.</p>\n<p>In an update shared on Wednesday, the company says it has already started deploying vehicles in Chicago — though for now, they are being driven by trained human drivers. According to Waymo, the vehicles are collecting mapping data and evaluating local driving conditions “to lay the early groundwork for operations in Chicago.”</p>\n<p>“We are excited to begin laying the early groundwork for our ride-hailing operations in Chicago, and look forward to serving the city in the future,” the company wrote on its blog.</p>\n<p>Waymo says its initial efforts in Chicago involve roughly 10 vehicles operating in select parts of the city. Fully autonomous robotaxi service is not yet permitted in Illinois, and city officials confirmed they were notified in advance that no driverless operations would take place.</p>\n<p>At the same time, lawmakers are actively debating autonomous vehicle legislation. State Rep. Kam Buckner has introduced a bill that would create a pilot program for self-driving vehicles in Cook County and other regions.</p>\n<p>“This progress is a vital step toward safer streets and more accessible transportation for all our neighborhoods,” Buckner said in a statement released by Waymo.</p>\n<p>The company continues to emphasize its safety record, claiming the Waymo Driver has been involved in 10 times fewer serious injury crashes and 12 times fewer pedestrian injury crashes than human drivers in cities where it operates, including Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta.</p>\n<p>While Illinois is still debating its regulatory framework, North Carolina cleared the way for autonomous vehicles nearly a decade ago. In 2017, the state passed legislation allowing fully autonomous vehicles on public roads once deemed ready and established a Fully Autonomous Vehicle Committee to oversee implementation.</p>\n<p>Waymo confirmed Wednesday that Charlotte will be its next expansion city.</p>\n<p>“Charlotte blends its historic charm with North Carolina’s economic dynamism. Uptown – the city’s sports hub – is surrounded by vibrant neighborhoods, from South End with its breweries and restaurants to the arts of NoDa. The Queen City is constantly redefining itself, and it’s this same forward-looking culture that makes us thrilled to announce Waymo’s intention to bring our safe, magic, fully autonomous ride-hailing to Charlotte, North Carolina.”</p>\n<p>Waymo says it has driven more than 200 million miles fully autonomously and completed over 20 million driverless rides, currently providing more than 400,000 fully autonomous trips per week.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

The first was flight ZG045, which departed Tokyo (Narita) for Incheon, South Korea on February 25, 2026, becoming the first flight in Asia powered by SpaceX’s low Earth orbit satellite network.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/spacex/japans-zipair-becomes-first-asia-pacific-airline-to-sign-up-for-starlink/\">ZIPAIR first revealed plans to adopt Starlink back in January 2023</a>, becoming the first airline in the Asia-Pacific region to sign on for Starlink Aviation. At the time, the airline said the service would “revolutionize the flying experience” by delivering internet speeds comparable to those at home.</p>\n<p>After completing technical evaluations, regulatory approvals, and engineering reviews, installations began earlier this month. The airline says the entire Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet will be equipped by spring 2026, making ZIPAIR the first airline in Asia to operate a fully Starlink-enabled fleet across its entire route network.</p>\n<p>ZIPAIR offers the Starlink-powered in-flight Wi-Fi to all passengers for free. The carrier currently serves destinations including Seoul, Bangkok, Singapore, Honolulu, Los Angeles, and San Jose.</p>\n<p>“ZIPAIR is proud to deliver on our commitment to raising the standard of the inflight experience,” said Shingo Nishida, President of ZIPAIR. “By integrating Starlink across our entire fleet by this spring, we are making free, high-speed connectivity a basic expectation of travel for every ZIPAIR passenger.”</p>\n<p>For ZIPAIR, Starlink isn’t just about faster Netflix streams for passengers. The system also powers the airline’s inflight service platform, connecting internet access, passenger services, ecommerce, and real-time payment authorization through a unified onboard network.</p>\n \n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Tesla’s <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/cybercab/\" id=\"21014\" type=\"post_tag\">Cybercab</a> program is entering its next phase just as one of its key leaders moves on. Victor Nechita, who most recently served as Vehicle Program Manager for Tesla’s purpose-built robotaxi, has announced he is leaving the company after nearly six years.</p>\n<p>Nechita shared the news in a post on LinkedIn reflecting on his journey at Tesla.</p>\n<p>“After nearly 6 years, I’ve decided to leave Tesla and start a new chapter back on the east coast. What a journey it’s been, from interning on the Model 3 production line back in 2017 to becoming the Vehicle Program Manager of Tesla’s first purpose-built AV, the Cybercab,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>Nechita first joined Tesla in 2017 during the height of the <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/category/model-3/\" id=\"22\" type=\"category\">Model 3</a> ramp — a period Elon Musk famously described as “production hell.” Starting as a technical program management intern in Fremont, Nechita helped coordinate Model 3 interior and exterior configuration releases.</p>\n<p>From there, he steadily climbed through increasingly senior roles. After a stint as a Seating Engineering Intern in 2018, he actually left Tesla to join the University of Toronto Aerospace Team before returning full-time in 2021. He then progressed through a series of technical program management roles in Vehicle Engineering, ultimately serving as a Senior Technical Program Manager overseeing cross-functional programs spanning hardware, firmware, and full-vehicle integration — including work tied to the <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/popular-youtuber-mkbhd-brands-new-model-3-a-mini-model-s/\" id=\"85536\" type=\"post\">refreshed Model 3 Highland</a>.</p>\n<p>In early 2024, Nechita stepped into the role of Robotaxi Program Manager for Cybercab. Operating under the Robotaxi Programs umbrella, he oversaw development of Tesla’s first fully dedicated autonomous vehicle platform — a clean-sheet vehicle architecture designed without a steering wheel or pedals.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on the experience, he wrote, “Leading the team through the development of Cybercab has been a humbling experience, watching so many dedicated individuals develop a product that has pushed the boundaries of efficiency, safety, and affordability.”</p>\n<p>His departure was actually shared on LinkedIn one week ago, just as the first <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-rolls-first-cybercab-off-production-line-at-giga-texas/\" id=\"114163\" type=\"post\">production Cybercab rolled off the line at Giga Texas</a> on February 17, 2026. Nechita announced his move to Boston the following day, effectively closing his Tesla chapter after seeing the vehicle through to its first production unit – “Thank you all for the ride and excited for what’s next out here in Boston!”, he wrote.</p>\n<p>Leadership transitions are common at Tesla, especially following major program milestones. In this case, Nechita departs after helping bring one of Tesla’s most ambitious projects from concept to reality.</p>\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"593\" src=\"https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:7428225387093975040?collapsed=1\" title=\"Embedded post\" width=\"504\"></iframe>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",
