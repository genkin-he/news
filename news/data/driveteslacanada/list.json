            "title": "Ontario’s Rural Broadband Expansion Delayed After $100M Starlink Contract Cancelled",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Ontario’s plan to deliver high-speed internet to every household by the end of 2025 has officially fallen behind schedule — and one major factor is the province’s decision to terminate its $100 million deal with SpaceX’s Starlink satellite service.</p>\n<p>The Ford government confirmed this week that its universal broadband target, first announced in 2021, will now be pushed back three years to 2028. The delay, officials said, stems from a mix of trade-related complications, construction slowdowns, and the absence of a viable replacement for Starlink’s network in remote northern regions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-starlink-deal-cancelled-amid-trade-dispute\">Starlink Deal Cancelled Amid Trade Dispute</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/starlink-gets-100-million-deal-to-bring-high-speed-internet-to-northern-ontario/\">Ontario’s contract with Starlink</a>, signed in November 2024, was intended to connect roughly 15,000 northern households and small businesses to reliable satellite internet. However, the <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/ontario-cancels-starlink-contract-amidst-us-tariffs/\">deal was scrapped in March 2025</a> after the U.S. administration introduced 25% tariffs on Canadian goods. Premier Doug Ford said the move was a direct response to what he called an “economic attack” on Ontario.</p>\n<p>“It’s done,” Ford declared at the time. “We’re not going back there.”</p>\n<p>The political decision to cut ties was also fueled by Ford’s criticism of Elon Musk’s close association with then-U.S. President Donald Trump. Although Musk and Trump have since had a public falling out, Ford confirmed this summer that Ontario has no plans to revive the contract, saying, “I don’t want to deal with someone who’s attacking our country.”</p>\n<p>Ending the agreement wasn’t without cost. The province <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/ontario-pays-undisclosed-fee-to-cancel-100-million-starlink-deal/\">paid an undisclosed cancellation fee to SpaceX</a>, described by insiders as “not zero” but significantly less than the original $100 million price tag.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lack-of-alternatives-leaves-rural-ontario-waiting\">Lack of Alternatives Leaves Rural Ontario Waiting</h3>\n<p>The fallout from the cancelled Starlink contract has left thousands of northern Ontario residents in limbo. A government source told <em><a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/11504865/ford-government-broadband-internet-deadlined-missed-starlink/\">Global News</a></em> there were no “feasible” alternatives that could quickly fill the gap left by Starlink. Other options — such as Rogers’ satellite service or the upcoming Telesat Lightspeed constellation — either depend on SpaceX’s infrastructure or won’t be operational until at least 2026.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, fibre-optic projects in remote regions have also faced setbacks due to difficult terrain and construction delays. To speed things up, Ontario will introduce new regulations allowing internet providers to attach fibre cables to existing hydro poles rather than installing new infrastructure.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-new-broadband-goal-2028\">New Broadband Goal: 2028</h3>\n<p>Despite missing the original deadline, officials insist Ontario remains committed to connecting every household to high-speed broadband. The $4 billion initiative remains Canada’s largest provincial internet expansion project, targeting an estimated 700,000 underserved homes.</p>\n<p>“More homes will be connected at the end of this year than ever before,” the government said in a statement, emphasizing that the overall objective hasn’t changed — only the timeline.</p>\n<p>Still, critics argue that political posturing and cancelled partnerships have slowed the province’s momentum, leaving northern and rural communities waiting even longer for reliable internet access.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-drive-tesla wp-block-embed-drive-tesla\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"wCOoN9wYti\"><a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/starlink-subscriber-count-in-canada-tops-500000/\">Starlink Subscriber Count in Canada Tops 500,000</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"wCOoN9wYti\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"338\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" scrolling=\"no\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/starlink-subscriber-count-in-canada-tops-500000/embed/#?secret=Y61xhVDnQU#?secret=wCOoN9wYti\" style=\"position: absolute; visibility: hidden;\" title=\"“Starlink Subscriber Count in Canada Tops 500,000” — Drive Tesla\" width=\"600\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Elon Musk’s SpaceX <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/spacex/\">spacex</a>is reportedly on track to receive a $2 billion contract from the U.S. Department of Defense to help develop a satellite-based defense system under President Donald Trump’s ambitious Golden Dome project. The system is designed to detect and intercept missiles and aircraft before they can reach American targets, marking one of the most significant defense technology partnerships in recent years.</p>\n<p>According to people familiar with the matter that spoke with <em><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/elon-musks-spacex-set-to-win-2-billion-pentagon-satellite-deal-c0a51325?mod=hp_lead_pos10\">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>, SpaceX will lead the development of an “air moving target indicator” satellite constellation that could eventually include as many as 600 satellites. The company is also expected to participate in two other Pentagon programs—one focused on secure communications and another on tracking ground vehicles in real time.</p>\n<p>Unveiled earlier this year at the White House, the Golden Dome project draws inspiration from Israel’s Iron Dome and aims to create a layered defense network capable of identifying and neutralizing threats from space and air. President Trump has pledged that the system will be fully operational by January 2029, with an estimated cost of $175 billion.</p>\n<p>The Golden Dome is expected to serve as a multi-layered security system that combines space-based surveillance with terrestrial missile defense platforms. It will provide continuous tracking of airborne threats, including hypersonic and cruise missiles, using a mix of optical and radar-based sensors deployed in low-Earth orbit.</p>\n<p>For SpaceX, securing this contract would further expand its footprint in national defense, adding to its <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/spacex-secures-733-million-launch-contract-from-us-space-force/\">existing portfolio of government launch services and satellite operations</a>. The company’s proven ability to mass-produce and deploy satellites through its Starlink program is seen as a major advantage in meeting the Pentagon’s aggressive timelines.</p>\n<p>With funding already approved under the administration’s latest defense spending bill, official confirmation of the SpaceX award is expected within weeks. </p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

Musk described the vehicle as featuring “crazy technology” and hinted that it might include capabilities beyond what’s expected from a traditional car.</p>\n<p>Referring to his longtime associate Peter Thiel, Musk said, “My friend Peter once reflected that the future was supposed to have flying cars, but we don’t have flying cars. If Peter wants a flying car, we should be able to buy one.” </p>\n<p>When Rogan asked if the new Roadster would actually be able to fly, Musk avoided confirming details, emphasizing that the reveal would speak for itself.</p>\n<p>Musk has previously discussed <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-roadster-with-spacex-thruster-package-will-reach-60mph-in-1-1-seconds/\">adding a SpaceX package</a> to the next-generation version, using cold-gas thrusters to improve acceleration and possibly allow the car to hover for short durations. It is not yet clear whether the upcoming demonstration will involve this technology, or something entirely different.</p>\n<p>While Musk said Tesla aims to hold the demonstration before the end of the year, he did not commit to a specific date. “Whether it’s good or bad, it will be unforgettable,” he told Rogan.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ignition-responsive-embed\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"548\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4wBUysNe2k?feature=oembed\" title=\"Joe Rogan Experience #2404 - Elon Musk\" width=\"975\"></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Tesla has introduced a new incentive for American drivers looking to switch from gasoline to electric: 2,000 free Supercharging miles when trading in a gas-powered vehicle for a new <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/tesla/\">Tesla</a>. The promotion, available for both purchases and leases, is designed to make the transition to electric mobility more appealing — though it currently applies only in the United States.</p>\n<p>The offer highlights Tesla’s ongoing effort to encourage drivers to experience its industry-leading charging network, which now includes over 70,000 Supercharger connectors worldwide. Once drivers trade in their gas vehicle and take delivery of a new Tesla, the company will automatically credit their account with the free mileage, allowing for cost-free charging during early ownership.</p>\n<p>“Never pay for gas again,” Tesla says in an email to customers, emphasizing the savings and simplicity of electric ownership. The promotion encourages drivers to envision cross-country trips powered entirely by electricity, supported by Tesla’s integrated navigation system and in-car entertainment features such as Caraoke, Tesla Theater, and Trip Planner.</p>\n<p>The 2,000 free miles roughly equate to around 800–1,000 kWh of electricity, depending on driving efficiency and model, providing up to 3,200 kilometres (2,000 miles) of free travel. Drivers can use these credits at any Tesla Supercharger location across the network, though the offer is time-limited, and the Supercharging miles expire two years after delivery.</p>\n<p>At this time, there is no equivalent offer for Canadian buyers, where Tesla’s trade-in and Supercharging programs operate separately. That gap may disappoint Canadian customers, but Tesla is offering us <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-3000-discount-pre-tariff-model-3-inventory-canada/\">$3,000 off inventory Model 3s</a> and <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/model-y/tesla-lowers-financing-and-lease-rates-for-model-y-in-canada/\">low-interest financing and lease rates on the Model Y</a>.</p>\n \n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "title": "Saskatoon Ends Free EV Charging, Introduces $5.35 per Hour Fee",
            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Saskatoon has officially pulled the plug on free electric vehicle (EV) charging at its two city-owned stations, introducing a $5.35 per hour fee that took effect Thursday. The new rate applies to the Level 2 chargers located at the Lakewood and Lawson civic centres — and it’s already raising eyebrows for being significantly higher than typical public charging costs elsewhere in Canada.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-rates-far-above-national-average\">Rates Far Above National Average</h3>\n<p>The price point has sparked debate, as SaskPower estimates that the average cost to charge at a Level 2 station is between $1 and $2.50 per hour. By comparison, other major cities charge far less: Toronto offers Level 2 charging for $2 per hour or a $3 flat overnight rate, while Calgary provides access to its 70 city-run chargers for free beyond regular parking fees.</p>\n<p>In the Vancouver area rates typically fall between $1.50 and $3 per hour. That means Saskatoon’s new rate of $5.35 per hour is roughly double to five times higher than what most EV drivers across Canada pay.</p>\n<p>At that price, a typical three-hour charging session — common for Level 2 stations — would cost about $16, compared to $4 to $8 in most other regions. The move makes Saskatoon’s chargers among the most expensive municipally operated Level 2 stations in the country.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-city-moves-to-cut-subsidy-costs\">City Moves to Cut Subsidy Costs</h3>\n<p>The change comes after Saskatoon City Council voted in August to implement the fee as part of its ongoing effort to reduce the municipal subsidy required to maintain the chargers. According to a city report, Saskatoon spent approximately $100,000 in 2023 to launch the chargers under a pilot project linked to its low-emissions community plan. The goal was to encourage EV adoption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. <em>(via <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/electric-vehicles-charging-stations-emissions-9.6960144\">CBC</a></em>)</p>\n<p>However, operating costs have proven steep. The city says it costs roughly $21,400 a year to keep the stations running — with about $12,000 of that spent on staff and maintenance. Council ultimately chose the highest of five proposed fee options, citing the need to recover as much of those costs as possible.</p>\n<p>Even with the new $5.35 per hour fee, officials estimate the city will still need to subsidize between $4,000 and $8,000 annually to operate the two sites.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-councillors-split-on-decision\">Councillors Split on Decision</h3>\n<p>Not all council members supported the steep fee increase. Councillors Jasmin Parker and Kathryn MacDonald voted against the measure, suggesting more modest rates of $2 or $3 per hour could have balanced accessibility with cost recovery.</p>\n<p>Despite the controversy, council also endorsed exploring third-party operation of the charging stations to further reduce taxpayer burden.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-growing-ev-demand-in-saskatoon\">Growing EV Demand in Saskatoon</h3>\n<p>While the new fees may discourage casual users, demand for electric vehicles in Saskatoon continues to rise. The number of registered EVs and hybrids in the city has soared from just 18 in 2018 to more than 500 by last year.</p>\n<p>The $5.35 per hour fee applies around the clock, including weekends and holidays.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Tesla has issued a rare physical recall for one of its vehicles, this time involving more than 6,000 <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/category/cybertruck/\">Cybertrucks</a> equipped with an off-road light bar that could detach while driving and create a hazard for other users on the road.</p>\n<p>According to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recall documents, 6,197 model-year 2024 Cybertrucks built at Giga Texas between November 13, 2023, and November 5, 2024 are impacted. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-issue\">The Issue</h3>\n<p>Tesla explains that the off-road light bar accessory—manufactured by Hella Romania S.R.L.—was attached to some Cybertrucks with the wrong combination of adhesive primers. Tesla’s investigation found that in certain cases technicians mistakenly applied BetaSeal primer on the windshield and BetaPrime on the light bar itself, instead of the reverse. </p>\n<p>The improper bonding could cause partial delamination or complete detachment while driving.</p>\n<p>Owners may notice rattling noises inside the cabin, see a visible gap between the light bar and the windshield, or feel the light bar move when touched. Tesla estimates that about 10 percent of the recalled vehicles are affected by the defect.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-fix\">The Fix</h3>\n<p>Tesla Service will inspect each vehicle free of charge. If the light bar shows delamination or damage, it will be replaced using adhesive tape and a new mechanical attachment bracket anchored to the vehicle structure. If the bar is intact, technicians will retrofit it with the same bracket system to prevent detachment.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-the-issue-was-discovered\">How the Issue Was Discovered</h3>\n<p>Tesla’s Field Quality team first flagged adhesion irregularities on February 3, 2025, during routine monitoring of repairs. Despite multiple service-manual updates and technician reminders through the spring, additional reports surfaced through the summer, prompting Tesla to launch an engineering study in August.</p>\n<p>Chemical analysis completed on October 14, 2025, confirmed the root cause, and Tesla voluntarily initiated the recall six days later. The automaker has documented 619 warranty claims and one field report potentially related to the defect but says it is not aware of any crashes, injuries, or fatalities.</p>\n<p>Transport Canada has not yet issued a similar recall.

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Saskatchewan’s opposition politicians are taking aim at SaskPower’s decision to spend over $100,000 on internet services from <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/starlink-offers-free-service-to-canadians-affected-by-wildfires/\">Starlink</a>. The expense was revealed in the province’s 2024–25 Crown corporation payee disclosure report released this week, which showed SaskPower paid $114,428 to Starlink Internet during the fiscal year.</p>\n<p>The revelation has drawn criticism from New Democratic Party (NDP) MLA Erika Ritchie, who questioned why a provincial Crown corporation would rely on an American company rather than supporting local providers.</p>\n<p>“We know that we have a world-class Crown corporation, SaskTel, that offers connectivity services. We’re wondering why this Crown has elected to go to a foreign company to receive services,” Ritchie said, also taking issue with Musk’s political ties in the United States.</p>\n<p>SaskPower’s parent agency, the Crown Investments Corporation (CIC), defended the use of Starlink as a necessary measure to ensure safety and communication in remote parts of the province, pointing out that SaskTel’s network cannot reach these areas. In a written statement, the CIC noted that Starlink’s satellite service plays an essential role in maintaining connectivity for workers in isolated areas, especially for emergencies such as medical situations.</p>\n<p>“Even with significant investments in broadband and 5G expansion, there are areas in Saskatchewan where SaskTel cannot provide cellular or internet service,” the statement read. “In these instances, including where life and safety could be at risk, arrangements are made to ensure employees have access to satellite services provided by Starlink.” <em>(via <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/regina/article/saskpower-paid-starlink-more-than-100000-in-2024-25-documents-show/\">CTV News</a>)</em></p>\n<p>Saskatchewan is not the first province to rely on Starlink for essential operations. Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, for instance, paid roughly $200,000 for Starlink service in 2024 as part of its communications program for remote sites. <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/british-columbia-government-utilizes-spacex-starlink-for-enhanced-connectivity/\">British Columbia is also a Starlink customer</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/quebec-adds-more-funds-to-starlink-subsidy-program/\">Quebec </a>and <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/alberta-launches-pilot-program-to-bring-starlink-internet-to-rural-communities/\">Alberta</a>.</p>\n<p>While critics argue that relying on a U.S. billionaire’s company undermines Canadian technological sovereignty, supporters point out that no domestic provider can currently match Starlink’s reach and reliability in hard-to-access areas.</p>\n\n<!-- CONTENT END 2 -->\n</div>",
