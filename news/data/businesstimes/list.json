We both have an important responsibility to promote peace and prosperity in the region and globally.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China is Japan’s largest trading partner while the US provides Tokyo with crucial security guarantees, which forces Japan into an awkward balancing act when China and the US are increasingly at loggerheads. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A number of bilateral issues also continue to simmer, including China’s increasing military activity around a disputed cluster of islands called the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, trade restrictions including on the export of rare earths, as well as concerns over maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Takaichi’s ties with politicians in Taiwan and her previous visits to a shrine in Tokyo that is associated with Japan’s past militarism add a further element of tension to the talks.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, Xi and Takaichi stuck to the diplomatic groundwork laid out in previous meetings between leaders of the two nations. At the top of the meeting, they reaffirmed the stance of pursuing “strategic and mutually beneficial ties” as well as a “constructive and stable relationship”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I have made principle and action my political creed. I would like to continue straightforward discussions with chairman Xi and deepen our relationship as leaders,” Takaichi said in the meeting, which lasted slightly less than half an hour, according to the Japanese government.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Although known for her hawkish stance on diplomacy, Takaichi appears to be taking a more pragmatic approach after becoming prime minister. In a sign of her shifting stance, she skipped her usual visit to the Yasukuni shrine.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Despite that decision, China still appears to be weighing up the new leader. In a break from recent practice, Xi has not yet publicly congratulated Takaichi on her election to the premiership, despite sending words of congratulations to her predecessors soon after they became prime minister.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The talks come in a year when China has continued to demonstrate its growing presence in the region. In June Beijing sent two aircraft carriers into the Pacific simultaneously for the first time, underscoring China’s growing military reach and increasing worries in Tokyo after they were spotted inside Japan’s exclusive economic zone.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While it’s unknown yet if Takaichi mentioned that or other territorial disputes, it is likely she touched on the issue of recent curbs on the export of critical minerals. While those were put in place as leverage in the trade war between China and the US, the slump in shipments also affected other economies including Japan, South Korea and the European Union. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The supply of rare earths, 17 elements that are crucial to the manufacturing of cars and chips, is likely to be a topic of particular interest for Takaichi, whose previous experience includes a stint as economic security minister.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even as a meeting between Xi and US President Donald Trump on Thursday resulted in the promise of a temporary reprieve in the restrictions by China, key members of Takaichi’s Cabinet spelt out Tokyo’s continued concern about the curbs.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In a call to China’s top diplomat Wang Yi, Japan’s new Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi expressed strong concern, as did Japan’s Trade Minister Ryosei Akazawa in a meeting with China’s Commerce Minister Wang Wentao on Thursday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economy Cooperation meeting in South Korea.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I expressed strong concern over the severe impact on the global supply chain, including Japan, caused by China’s export controls on rare earths. We strongly urged China to take appropriate measures,” Akazawa told reporters after the meeting.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For China, Takaichi’s visits to Taiwan, including a trip with a parliamentary delegation in April, are a likely source of concern. Beijing will also want to try to limit Tokyo’s willingness to cooperate with Washington on efforts to build supply chains not involving China and to restrict access to high-tech chip technology and supplies.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Following the call between Motegi and Wang, China’s government spokesperson said that Beijing valued statements from Takaichi that Japan did not intend to decouple from China. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">We hope Japan will “work with China to uphold the political foundation for bilateral ties and continue to improve and develop China-Japan relations in the right direction.,” spokesman Guo Jiakun added.

The liquidator, AAG Corporate Advisory, said it is unable to provide details on operations, finances or the reasons for the liquidation before obtaining the relevant information, in response to queries on Thursday by BT. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One of Twelve Cupcakes’ outlet managers told BT outside the MOM Services Centre on Friday that the decision to shutter Twelve Cupcakes came to its staff with zero warning. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We did not know anything (about this) in advance. There was no notice period at all,” he said. “With so many bills to pay, starting with our rent – what are we going to do now?” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He added that the main concern among employees now is the salaries they are owed for the month of October, on top of compensation for the sudden termination of employment, especially since a 30-day notice period was not abided by. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Others BT spoke to on Friday said this is particularly pressing as many of those affected have rent due at the end of the month. Most said they are expected to foot their rent by Friday or Saturday – or risk facing eviction or incurring late charges. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Certain landlords are very strict (with payment deadlines). This means that if we don’t have the money immediately, we have to leave,” said one worker. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Those who are foreign workers also said they have debts to repay back home; others have to pay tuition fees for their children.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Some workers noted that Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions were not credited to their accounts for October. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Specific representatives of the counter staff group were addressed by MOM staff in closed-door meetings. These workers told BT after these meetings that they were told local unions will handle all compensation-related matters. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">They added that a separate meeting with union members has been set up for next week, though a fixed date and time has yet to be confirmed. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As for S-Pass holders, no extension will be given, which means such affected workers will have 30 days to find a new job in Singapore, or they will have to return to their home country. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Affected workers who gathered at the MOM Service Centre on Friday comprised those on S-Passes, Work Permits and Long-term Visit Passes, as well as Singapore citizens. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We understand that the liquidation will take some time, but we do (at the very least) have to receive our salaries for the month of October today so we can continue covering our basic expenses in Singapore, and to feed our families,” one told BT. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the time being, the group of counter staff are putting together a page to raise donations.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We are truly hoping for the best by next week – and we hope the government can help us in our current situation,” the outlet manager said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A representative from home-grown eatery The Soup Spoon reached out to BT on Friday, offering to assist affected Twelve Cupcakes workers with available job opportunities. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The business has store openings lined up starting from next week, with several full-time and part-time positions to fill.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Food, Drinks and Allied Workers Union (FDAWU) on Thursday <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/unacceptable-and-unfair-union-raps-twelve-cupcakes-abrupt-closure-axing-80-workers\" target=\"_blank\">criticised the cupcake’s business’ abrupt closure as “unacceptable and unfair”</a>, strongly objecting to the business owner’s lack of prior consultation and advance notice. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">FDAWU said it will be assisting members and workers with salary-related claims and job-assistance support, as well as connecting them to the labour movement’s network, such as NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">BT<em> </em>has reached out to MOM and the CPF Board for comment. </p></div>",
