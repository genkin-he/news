But given that he would appeal against both the conviction and his sentence, he would continue in his roles, it added. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It is unclear when Khua filed his appeal and when it was turned down by the High Court. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Tan’s son, <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/ktl-global-ex-ceo-tan-kheng-yeow-jailed-two-years-eight-months-s1m-cbt\" target=\"_blank\">Wilson Tan Kheng Yeow</a> was a friend of Khua.

On a typical day, tankers carrying the equivalent of 20 per cent of global oil consumption pass through it with cargoes from producers such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Japanese shipping companies said they are halting operations around the Strait of Hormuz, although Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said Tokyo had not received any reports of an immediate impact on supply for Japan.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, Indian state refiners have already started scouting for alternative supplies, two refining officials said, declining to be identified.

We need to see which countries release such spot supplies then.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">South Korean refiners HD Hyundai Oilbank and GS Caltex said they are monitoring the situation. Hyundai Oilbank said it has yet to halt oil loadings in the Middle East.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China has bulked up its crude stockpiles in recent months, with imports hitting a record in December.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In Taiwan, oil and liquefied natural gas suppliers are proceeding with shipments as scheduled, the economy ministry said, adding that the portion of oil and gas imports from the Middle East has been decreasing annually.

The possibility of prolonged turmoil in the Middle East and the ripple effects of higher oil prices are giving money managers fresh reasons to sell equities and shift into safety. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Traders will be adopting the strategy of “haven first, ask questions later,” according to John Briggs, head of US rates strategy at Natixis. “The scale of the attacks and Iranian retaliation is larger than what the market expected,” he said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Briggs said Treasuries are likely to extend moves from Friday, when short-term yields sank to levels last seen in 2022. Others are watching energy chokepoints. Roundhill Financial’s Dave Mazza said he is closely tracking what happens to traffic at the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway handling about a quarter of the world’s seaborne oil trade. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This is about Hormuz risk, not retaliation. If shipping stays open, stocks can work through it,” he said. “If it doesn’t, all bets are off.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Rich valuations across global equities and credit also make it easier for investors to trim risk, said Ed Al-Hussainy, a portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.

Brent crude closed at the highest price since July, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.4 per cent on the day, capping its biggest monthly loss since March. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Strategists at Barclays warned against quickly buying any dip. Investors have grown accustomed to geopolitical flare-ups that fade fast, but this episode risks lasting longer, wrote Ajay Rajadhyaksha, the firm’s global chairman of research, citing the potential for US casualties, strikes on Iranian leadership and disruption to Hormuz traffic. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The risk-reward doesn’t seem compelling,” he said. “If equities pull back enough (say over 10 per cent in the S&amp;P 500), there is likely to come a time to buy. But not yet.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Here’s what other investors and strategists had to say: </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>Kevin Gordon, head of macro research and strategy for Charles Schwab</strong> </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“To the extent that sends oil prices higher on a somewhat sustained basis, there could be a near-term inflationary scare that spooks the equity market. I do think investors need to continue to think about the distinction between front-page risk and bottom-line risk, though. If this conflict has no meaningful downstream impacts on growth or earnings, any negative stock market response has the potential to be short-lived.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>Francis Tan, chief Asia strategist at Indosuez Wealth Management</strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“There is a high probability that Asia, and onward to Europe and the US will experience a risk-off gap down.

We don’t believe it drags on. In the context of the past four years, US Treasuries have been range bound and there is room below for yields, if investors want safe haven. Ultimately yields will be driven by the Fed and economy. This operation in Iran does not change US fundamentals.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>Frank Monkam, head of cross asset macro strategy and trading at Buffalo Bayou Commodities</strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This Iran strike over the weekend constitutes an almost a perfect sell-off catalyst for an already fragile equity market, and the recent uptick in volatility is likely to extend in the shorter term. That being said, geopolitical flare-ups typically tend to create temporary sell-offs rather than sustained bear markets, so I expect equities to eventually stabilise once Middle East developments are fully digested.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In the grander scheme, the macro question is around the potential impact of an oil shock on an economy that’s flashing signs of stagflation-lite based on recent readings. Therefore, I also expect policy volatility to move back to forefront in response over the weeks and months ahead.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>Rajeev de Mello, global macro portfolio manager at Gama Asset Management </strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“A prolonged escalation in hostilities between the US and Iran would transmit to emerging markets first and foremost through the oil complex.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The majority of large EM economies are net oil importers, and energy remains a meaningful share of both their import bills and inflation baskets. Higher crude oil prices widen current account deficits, compress real incomes, and force central banks to choose between supporting growth and containing inflation expectations. This is particularly relevant given the strong recent performance across EM risk assets: positioning and sentiment have improved, leaving less margin for an adverse terms-of-trade shock.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>Joe Gilbert, portfolio manager at Integrity Asset Management </strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Energy stocks and metals will be the leaders as well as real estate and utilities – the more classic defensive groups. Defense stocks will get a bid as well because of the increased demand for their products. Consumer discretionary stocks will be losers because of higher oil prices, which will hurt airlines and retailers.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>Madison Faller, global investment strategist, and Erik Wytenus, head of EMEA investment strategy, at JPMorgan Private Bank</strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“For investors, the ripple effects could reach across the global economy and financial system. Energy is central to these risks, with the Middle East serving as a critical hub for global oil and gas flows.

With those hubs idle, aircraft and crews remained stranded out of position, disrupting airline schedules worldwide.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“It’s the sheer volume of people and the complexity,” said UK-based aviation analyst John Strickland.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“It is not only customers, it is the crews and aircraft all over place.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Airlines across Europe, Asia and the Middle East cancelled or rerouted flights to avoid closed or restricted airspace, lengthening journeys and driving up fuel costs. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The disruption has been intensified by the loss of Iranian and Iraqi overflight routes, which had grown more important since the Russia-Ukraine war forced airlines to avoid both countries’ airspace. The Middle East airspace closures were squeezing airlines into narrower corridors, with fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan adding a further risk, said Ian Petchenik, communications director at Flightradar24.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The risk of protracted disruption is the main concern from a commercial aviation perspective,” Petchenik said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Any escalation in the conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan that results in the closure of airspace would have drastic consequences for travel between Europe and Asia.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Highlighting the scale of the disruption, Air India cancelled its flights on Sunday departing from Delhi, Mumbai and Amritsar for major cities in Europe and North America.

It isn’t capable of supporting the widespread use of AI, Nvidia said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The networks of today simply aren’t ready for the use cases of tomorrow,” said Ronnie Vasishta, who heads Nvidia’s telecommunications business and strategy. “In the AI era, everything changes. Networks will deliver intelligence, not just for humans on their phones, but for machines.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Telecommunications networks will require “hundreds of thousands of times” more efficiency because there isn’t enough radio spectrum to support the new uses, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The chipmaker, whose gear is at the centre of the AI explosion, is trying to carve out a new market and clear a potential roadblock. Nvidia already offers versions of its chips, computers and software for use in networks and hopes to expand that business. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">At the same time, the company needs AI to spread to more areas – in things termed physical AI, like robots and vehicles – to continue to fuel demand and pay for the data centres that are currently the biggest consumers of its technology. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Without wireless networks enabled for AI traffic, Nvidia’s vision of a world full of humanoid robots and self-driving cars might be slower to emerge. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Every decade or so the telecommunications business shifts to a new generation of wireless technology, the next “G.” In the run-up to setting standards that determine the parameters of new hardware and software, companies form alliances to steer the industry in a direction they believe will favour their products. That approach has a mixed record and has been undermined by competing efforts that have sometimes delayed new deployments or resulted in networks that are incompatible. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nvidia argues that new gear and software needs to be fundamentally open. Instead of locked-down devices with bespoke hardware, the radios that send and receive wireless traffic should be controlled by software that can be updated and runs on more general purpose computers. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The data traffic should be routed by AI software that’s capable of responding to rapidly changing patterns and priorities in a way that’s simply not currently possible, according to the chipmaker. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In such an environment, the telecommunications industry will be far more open to the emergence of new providers, including startups that might rapidly attain billion-US dollar valuations, Nvidia’s Vasishta said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This will be how a new telecom unicorn is born,” he said. There have been far too few new entrants into the industry over the last decade, he added. BLOOMBERG</p></div>",

Investors will look for details on how Beijing intends to support innovation and rekindle momentum in Chinese stocks, which surged last year thanks to AI but have been subdued this year. They will also be seeking concrete measures to boost domestic demand – an oft-repeated goal that’s light on specifics so far. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The policy meeting “could provide a fresh catalyst for stocks, which have been lacklustre this year amid a lack of policy support,” said Marvin Chen, a strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. He noted that cyclical and property stocks have historically delivered the strongest gains in the month following the event.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Here are the key areas traders and analysts are watching ahead of the meeting:</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Technology</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">From DeepSeek in early 2025 to a surge in robotics shares, tech stocks have powered China’s market rebound. Investors are now seeking reassurance that the rally still has further to run.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">An AI “scare trade” has rattled tech shares globally, triggered by potential disruptions to the economy. In China, the pressure has fallen on traditional Internet giants, with money moving out of Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings into smaller firms seen as more direct AI beneficiaries like MiniMax Group and Knowledge Atlas Technology.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Technology will remain a key focus for capital allocation,” according to a note by China International Capital Corp. Beyond established AI supply-chain leaders, the analysts see potential winners in cloud computing, smart driving and quantum technology.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Consumption</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Reviving domestic demand has been a consistent theme in recent high-level policy meetings. The shift comes as more countries push back against China’s cheap exports, raising the pressure on Beijing to rely less on external demand.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We see meaningful likelihood of enhanced consumption support that goes beyond consumer durables,” said Homin Lee, a senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier in Singapore.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Investors rotated into consumer sectors earlier this year amid concerns about stretched tech valuations, but the rebound proved short-lived in the absence of a sustained pickup in consumer demand and prices. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The CSI 300 Consumer Discretionary Index and CSI 300 Consumer Staples Index both rank among the least favoured sub-sector gauges in China this year.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">‘Anti-involution’</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China launched the “anti-involution” campaign in 2025 to curb cut-throat competition marked by overcapacity and price wars. The government pushed industries such as solar and electric vehicles to shift their focus towards quality and innovation, rather than mere volume.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Early signs show the drive is gaining traction. Prices in parts of the solar and materials supply chains have rebounded, and shares of photovoltaic companies have climbed to near a two-year high.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While excess capacity remains an issue, UBS Group says the campaign could help steer the economy towards a reflationary environment in 2026. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, investors will be weighing policymakers’ resolve to keep curbing excess capacity while balancing growth and employment pressures.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Property</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A multiyear property slump has been a major drag on China’s economy, and reversing that would require much stronger policy intervention. Officials will likely reaffirm support for a new development model centreed on higher-quality housing and market stabilisation, with further easing likely left to local governments, according to Citigroup Inc.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Shanghai recently eased homebuying rules, and Beijing and Shenzhen are expected to follow suit. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Morgan Stanley analysts including Stephen Cheung cautioned it may be too early to turn positive, flagging risks of policy disappointment at the NPC, more profit warnings and a renewed slide in home sales. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Bonds</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In the bond market, attention will be on the fiscal budget and how much supply pressure government issuance may create, especially at the long end. Beijing is expected to ramp up sales of ultra-long special sovereign bonds to support domestic demand and stabilise growth. Morgan Stanley estimates issuance could reach 1.5 trillion yuan (S$276.4 billion), up from 1.3 trillion yuan last year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China’s yield curve has already steepened on an accommodative monetary policy and a larger debt quota.
