The liquidator, AAG Corporate Advisory, said it is unable to provide details on operations, finances or the reasons for the liquidation before obtaining the relevant information, in response to queries on Thursday by BT. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One of Twelve Cupcakes’ outlet managers told BT outside the MOM Services Centre on Friday that the decision to shutter Twelve Cupcakes came to its staff with zero warning. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We did not know anything (about this) in advance. There was no notice period at all,” he said. “With so many bills to pay, starting with our rent – what are we going to do now?” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He added that the main concern among employees now is the salaries they are owed for the month of October, on top of compensation for the sudden termination of employment, especially since a 30-day notice period was not abided by. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Others BT spoke to on Friday said this is particularly pressing as many of those affected have rent due at the end of the month. Most said they are expected to foot their rent by Friday or Saturday – or risk facing eviction or incurring late charges. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Certain landlords are very strict (with payment deadlines). This means that if we don’t have the money immediately, we have to leave,” said one worker. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Those who are foreign workers also said they have debts to repay back home; others have to pay tuition fees for their children.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Some workers noted that Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions were not credited to their accounts for October. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Specific representatives of the counter staff group were addressed by MOM staff in closed-door meetings. These workers told BT after these meetings that they were told local unions will handle all compensation-related matters. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">They added that a separate meeting with union members has been set up for next week, though a fixed date and time has yet to be confirmed. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As for S-Pass holders, no extension will be given, which means such affected workers will have 30 days to find a new job in Singapore, or they will have to return to their home country. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Affected workers who gathered at the MOM Service Centre on Friday comprised those on S-Passes, Work Permits and Long-term Visit Passes, as well as Singapore citizens. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We understand that the liquidation will take some time, but we do (at the very least) have to receive our salaries for the month of October today so we can continue covering our basic expenses in Singapore, and to feed our families,” one told BT. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the time being, the group of counter staff are putting together a page to raise donations.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We are truly hoping for the best by next week – and we hope the government can help us in our current situation,” the outlet manager said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A representative from home-grown eatery The Soup Spoon reached out to BT on Friday, offering to assist affected Twelve Cupcakes workers with available job opportunities. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The business has store openings lined up starting from next week, with several full-time and part-time positions to fill.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Food, Drinks and Allied Workers Union (FDAWU) on Thursday <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/unacceptable-and-unfair-union-raps-twelve-cupcakes-abrupt-closure-axing-80-workers\" target=\"_blank\">criticised the cupcake’s business’ abrupt closure as “unacceptable and unfair”</a>, strongly objecting to the business owner’s lack of prior consultation and advance notice. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">FDAWU said it will be assisting members and workers with salary-related claims and job-assistance support, as well as connecting them to the labour movement’s network, such as NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">BT<em> </em>has reached out to MOM and the CPF Board for comment. </p></div>",

Sister brand Porsche scaling back its EV ambitions added to the strains, Audi said on Friday (Oct 31).</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The situation remains very demanding,” chief financial officer Jürgen Rittersberger said on a call with reporters, noting that the brand is expecting a US$1.5 billion hit from tariffs this year. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The luxury-car maker also needs to find a solution for models it had planned to build on a joint EV platform with Porsche that has now been delayed, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Delivering on the financial goals will also depend on sourcing enough semiconductors as part of the disruption to the supply of chips made by Nexperia, Audi said, echoing VW’s warning on Thursday. Manufacturers are at risk of production shutdowns after the little-known chipmaker in the Netherlands emerged in the crossfire of a dispute with China. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Aside from renewed supply chain risk, the VW unit is seeking to streamline its business to cut costs, while working on a record model offensive. Audi, historically a major profit driver for its parent, has been hit hard by tariffs in the US and sliding market share in China. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">During the third quarter, the Audi brand posted an operating margin of 2 per cent for a profit of 280 million euros (S$421.4 million). That compares with a slightly negative result last year when the brand booked costs related to the closure of its Brussels factory.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CFO Rittersberger said Audi is still considering a range of options to start making cars in the US. A decision will be made before the end of the year, he told reporters on a call. BLOOMBERG</p></div>",

            "title": "Why a six-wheel Lexus, Japan’s Rolls-Royce and an incomplete car matter so much to Toyota",
            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[TOKYO] Toyota brought the biggest cars to the Japan Mobility Show 2025, and was arguably also at the heart of the biggest story there. Its chairman, Akio Toyoda, grew visibly emotional as he unveiled the Century Coupe concept, a sleek yet hulking fastback from a new brand created to tempt buyers away from Rolls-Royce and Bentley.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Japan as a nation seems to have lost some of its energy and dynamism, along with our presence in the world,” he said to the press on Wednesday (Oct 29). “I believe now more than ever, we need the Century.” The new luxury label would “bring the pride of Japan out into the world”, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Toyoda’s press conference provided a dramatic opening to the event, which runs until Nov 9 and is expected to draw more than a million visitors to the sprawling halls of the Tokyo Big Sight exhibition space. Here was the chairman of the world’s largest carmaker acknowledging that Japan – and perhaps by extension its car industry – needs to reclaim some lost mojo.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With its lurid orange bodywork (courtesy of 60 layers of paint), handcrafted parts and sumptuous interior, the Century Coupe already carries a nameplate loaded with meaning. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The original Century, launched in 1967 to honour the 100th anniversary of Toyota founder Sakichi Toyoda’s birth, wore an emblem with Japan’s phoenix, a mythical bird that serves as an imperial symbol of peace, prosperity and renewal. “I believe this car was born carrying Japan on its shoulders,” Toyoda said of that first model.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Wholesale reset</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Century’s launch is part of a wholesale reset that will see Toyota reorganise its sprawling product line-up into five standalone brands, which also include Toyota itself, Lexus, Daihatsu and Gazoo Racing (its performance and motorsport division).</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The group announced on Oct 13 that Century will sit at the pinnacle, giving Lexus room to evolve and “to be adventurous and innovative”, according to chief branding officer Simon Humphries.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That adventurousness showed up on six wheels, in the form of the LS Concept, a rectilinear people mover that looks like a rolling lounge. Ironically, the concept car takes the form of a huge box precisely to exemplify some out-of-the-box thinking from a brand that Toyota launched to disrupt British and German luxury carmakers.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Inside, bamboo slats provide privacy, fine woodworking lines the cabin and the space feels genuinely palatial. The six-wheel layout wasn’t a provocation for its own sake, according to Koichiro Suga, general manager, Lexus Design Division. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Instead, it came about because four small rear wheels reduce intrusion into the passenger compartment. “Interior space comes first,” he told <em>The Business Times</em>. “The first idea is to provide a sanctuary for the owner.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Lexus also showed an LS Coupe Concept, a tall-riding four-door, to suggest that one nameplate can stretch across wildly different forms. It’s a necessary evolution because, as Humphries put it, executive sedans are “fighting a losing battle” against sport utility vehicles, and luxury brands can no longer pin their identities to a single body style.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In fact, nothing seems sacred at Lexus. The division recently announced it would discontinue the LS, the ultra-refined “Luxury Sedan” that served as its seminal car. The move seemed like heresy, akin to Mercedes-Benz no longer making the S-Class. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But with the letters now standing for “Luxury Space”, the message in Tokyo was that the next Lexus flagship could come in any shape or form – the brand also showed off a single-person autonomous machine designed like a jewel box called the LS Micro. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Something for everyone</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While Lexus toyed with wild ideas, Toyota’s core brand displayed a back-to-basics sensibility. A concept version of the Corolla, still the single best-selling car of all time, showed that the next iteration will offer electric, hybrid, plug-in hybrid and internal combustion options to ensure that there is something for everyone.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Toyota’s IMV Origin, a commercial vehicle designed for villagers in rural Africa, takes that idea to a bizarre place. Toyota’s idea is to ship the car out only 70 per cent finished. The customer completes the remaining 30 per cent with simple tools, configuring it to suit his needs. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Will it carry people or cargo? Will the cargo be boxes or something else?” Toyota chief executive Koji Sato said. “We just build the base. From there, each customer completes the vehicle to fit their needs.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Toyota often looms large over the Japan Mobility Show, and this year was no different. Of the 15 brands present, five were foreign, meaning Toyota alone accounted for four of the 10 domestic names there. (Gazoo Racing was conspicuous by its absence, but Toyoda has promised a major announcement for the brand in December.)</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But the domestic players didn’t have the entire field to themselves. Chinese giant BYD unveiled the Racco, a boxy electric vehicle (EV) developed specifically for Japan’s keijidosha class – small cars that don’t require owners in some parts of Tokyo to prove they have a parking space.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With sliding rear doors (a first for any kei EV) and two battery options for daily use or longer trips, the Racco is less car than declaration of war. Until now, foreign car brands have kept out of the kei-car market, which makes up nearly 40 per cent of Japanese car sales, and BYD clearly sees an opening. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Shaken into action</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While the EV race has finally come to Japan’s backyard, the outside world’s ongoing shift to electrification has shaken some domestic players into action. Honda, for example, displayed no fewer than six prototype electric cars at Tokyo. Subaru launched one in concept form and displayed a near-production crossover. Suzuki rolled out the Vision e-Sky, a kei EV that will go into production in 2026.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even as Japan’s car industry picks up its electrification pace, Toyota chief Sato believes that one thing should stay constant. “Wanting to drive a car that looks cool. I think that many of us share such a desire,” he said while presenting the Corolla concept. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Whether it’s a battery EV, plug-in hybrid, hybrid, or internal combustion engine vehicle, whatever the power source, let’s make good-looking cars that everyone will want to drive.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Presumably, that goal applies whether a vehicle has four wheels or six.</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[BEIJING/TAIPEI] Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has suspended supplies of wafers to its Chinese assembly plant, according to a letter addressed to its customers that was reviewed by Reuters, which could exacerbate a supply squeeze that is worrying automakers worldwide.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The letter, which was dated Oct 29 and signed by Nexperia interim CEO Stefan Tilger, said the company imposed the suspension on supplies to its plant in Dongguan, in southern China’s Guangdong province, on October 26, saying it was “a direct consequence of the local management’s recent failure to comply with the agreed contractual payment terms.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Since earlier this month, Nexperia has been locked in a dispute with its Chinese unit after the Dutch government took control of Nexperia from its Chinese owner Wingtech Technology on Sep 30. It also removed its Chinese CEO, citing concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nexperia’s move came after the Dutch chipmaker’s Chinese unit resumed supplying semiconductors to local customers but stipulated that all sales to distributors would need to be settled using the Chinese renminbi. Previously, transactions had been settled with foreign currencies like the US dollar.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The company produces large volumes of chips in the Netherlands that are widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries. Some 70 per cent of the Netherlands-produced chips are packaged in China and sold mostly to distributors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“While we have maintained shipments for as long as commercially feasible, continuing the current flow of supply from our front-end sites is no longer justifiable,” the letter said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Unless these contractual obligations are fully satisfied, we cannot resume wafer supply to the site. Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or from the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution to the problem.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nexperia said it is financially independent of Wingtech and it does not raise capital from Wingtech, the letter showed.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nexperia confirmed that it sent the letter but said it could not comment further. Nexperia China and Wingtech did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Court filings showed that the seizure by the Dutch government came as US pressure was rising on Nexperia after Wingtech was placed on a restricted-export list, though Dutch authorities say governance shortcomings were the trigger.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Oct 4, China’s commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips from China.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Industry bodies have sounded the alarm over the possible impact on production, with Stellantis saying on Thursday that it had set up a “war room” to monitor the situation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Japanese automaker Nissan said it had enough chips at the moment to last until the first week of November without disruption.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Some Nexperia products that used to cost just a few Chinese cents have gone up in price to two or three yuan each over the past two weeks, more than 10 times their original cost, according to a source familiar with the matter.
