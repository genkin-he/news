The nature of the crime is unknown.\n\nIn Singapore, the syndicate allegedly operated by the Ng brothers with the aid from their relative, duped victims by posing as bank officers or regulators.

Metsera has given Pfizer until Tuesday to raise its offer. Pfizer wants Metsera’s scheduled shareholder vote to take place on Nov 13.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The legal action comes as Pfizer received early antitrust clearance for its proposed US$7.3 billion acquisition of Metsera from the US Federal Trade Commission. It granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, more than a week ahead of the Nov 7 deadline.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Pfizer’s claims against Novo Nordisk are meritless, and we will vigorously defend ourselves in any litigation,” a Novo spokesperson said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Metsera said in a statement that it disagreed with Pfizer’s allegations and would address them in court.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Pfizer and Novo talks with Metsera began in 2024 </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The lawsuit details a tussle for Metsera that began with discussions between the company and potential acquirers in early 2024, with both Pfizer and Novo Nordisk expressing interest.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy and Ozempic, is trying to regain ground in the obesity drug race after losing market share to Eli Lilly. Metsera is working on experimental therapies that analysts say could generate US$5 billion in sales.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pfizer, which does not currently sell a weight-loss drug, is betting on Metsera to help it enter the US$150 billion obesity market and offset falling Covid-related revenue and looming patent expirations.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pfizer claimed Novo’s bid was an illegal attempt by a dominant player to suppress competition in the fast-growing obesity drug market.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Novo made its first formal offer on Jan 23, 2025, valuing Metsera at US$2 billion, which the board rejected due to regulatory risks and low valuation, the lawsuit said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pfizer entered the process with a US$30 per share non-binding proposal on Jun 2, followed by a series of improved bids. Metsera’s board rejected the proposal but was determined to continue negotiations with Pfizer.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Novo made additional bids that were rejected by Metsera’s board and, by September, both parties had submitted revised proposals. Pfizer says Novo’s last bid, made on Sep 20, involved a complex structure with non-voting shares and a dividend, which Metsera’s board deemed too risky.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Antitrust concerns and foreign ownership </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even before Novo Nordisk formally renewed its bid for Metsera on Oct 25, Pfizer alleged that both Novo and Metsera were quietly preparing for the transaction.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">According to the complaint, Novo Nordisk representatives had begun reaching out to government officials to discuss regulatory issues, suggesting pre-coordination.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, Metsera’s lead law firm requested a conflict waiver from Pfizer just days before Novo’s proposal was submitted - despite having negotiated opposite Pfizer for months without raising any conflict concerns.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pfizer argues this timing indicates that discussions were underway before the bid was made public, potentially in violation of the merger agreement’s non-solicitation provisions.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pfizer’s lawsuit emphasised its role as a leading US corporation, and Novo Nordisk as a foreign competitor.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A Wednesday letter to Metsera from Pfizer’s lawyers that was disclosed in the lawsuit repeatedly described Pfizer as “an American company” and said a Novo Nordisk deal “may draw scrutiny from CFIUS,” a reference to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The government body reviews foreign investment in the US, which can give the US president ultimate authority over a transaction.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pfizer is asking the court for a declaration that Novo’s proposal is not a superior offer under the merger agreement, as well as damages and injunctive relief.

News of the agreement on Nexperia was first reported by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The move is likely to ease worries about chip shipments that had threatened auto production in Europe and elsewhere amid a broader trade fight pitting China against the US and its allies that had roiled markets.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Beijing this month blocked Nexperia, a key supplier of chips used by the automotive and consumer electronics industries, from exporting from its facilities in China. The move was in response to the Dutch government seizing control of the Chinese-owned chipmaker and highlighted worsening trade relations between China and the West. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Carmakers around the world have been bracing for production cuts or all-out stoppages as a consequence of the export freeze. Europe’s auto industry has been working around the clock to prevent the conflict from triggering production outages, and suppliers have been reining in production of components for major automakers such as Volkswagen and BMW. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Last week, the largest vehicle supplier association in the US warned that the American auto industry was two-to-four weeks away from production stoppages, and Ford Motor’s chief executive called it an “industry-wide issue” in need of a political solution.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The framework to resume chip shipments will be detailed in a fact sheet from the administration highlighting the terms of the trade agreement secured by Trump and Xi at their summit in South Korea. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That pact, following their first face-to-face meeting since 2019, saw China agree to delay sweeping controls on rare-earth magnets and resume purchases of American soybeans and other agricultural products. The US in turn pledged to halve a fentanyl-related tariff on China and to hold-off on a threatened 100 per cent levy on Chinese goods Trump threatened to impose starting in November. The US is also pausing some reciprocal tariffs on Beijing for an additional year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The standoff over Nexperia appeared to escalate earlier Friday (Oct 31), when the company halted supplies to its China factory over disagreements with the site’s management, escalating a standoff that’s already impacting automotive production in Europe and beyond.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Dutch manufacturer provides high volumes of transistors and logic chips that are used across the automotive and consumer electronics industries.

Aside from the assembly and testing site in China, it also has facilities in the Philippines and Malaysia. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Semiconductors have held an outsized importance in the trade fight between the US and China with Trump looking to restrict Chinese access to advanced chips in a race between the countries for technological supremacy in artificial intelligence and other fields. Beijing in turn has used their dominance in rare-earth production as a bargaining chip, threatening to curb access to minerals necessary for high-tech manufacturing of widely used consumer products.

But genAI is also capable of rapidly destroying value, and this is driving VCs to experiment with new fund structures and strategies.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This breakneck pace is revising VC playbooks. Here’s why rigid timelines no longer work and what flexible alternatives are emerging.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">On the clock </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Historically, VC funds have operated on a 10-year term model. The first three to five years are spent deploying capital, while the next ones are focused on scaling a firm’s portfolio companies before seeking exits in the second half of the fund’s life.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, AI is compressing this timeline.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While an ecommerce business or software-as-a-service company may need years to reach immense scale, an AI-native firm can do this in a matter of months.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This is partly due to the hype behind the AI gold rush, which has been pumping investment into firms. But there’s another factor at work: AI products can be deployed globally at near-zero marginal cost, improve with data, and spread virally through developer and user networks.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For example, Mistral AI reached a valuation of US$2 billion just seven months after it was founded in April 2023. Thinking Machines Lab, meanwhile, secured a monster seed round of US$2 billion this July at a US$10 billion valuation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While a huge valuation may seem like a positive for an investor, the speed at which AI firms reach these dizzying heights puts intense pressure on the 10-year fund cycle.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">These sizable valuations can delay IPOs as they set such high expectations for public market performance. After all, why would a founder or investor risk going public at an inflated valuation and see the value of the company drop? </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This dynamic is forcing VCs to seek liquidity through other channels like mergers and acquisitions or secondary sales to lock in returns.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That’s the value creation side of the coin, but the value destruction AI causes is equally swift as the tech is evolving at breathtaking speed.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For instance, if a new, highly efficient open-source AI model is released in a specific sector, incumbents that have proprietary models could see their competitive moats destroyed overnight.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A good example is the rise of DeepSeek Coder V2, an open-source model that has outperformed several proprietary models on coding benchmarks. This kind of disruption forces VCs to constantly reconsider the long-term viability of their portfolio companies.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Flexibility at a premium </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This shift towards quick cycles has led some VC firms to change how they operate. Rather than sticking to strict, multiyear plans and being purely early-stage backers, they have become portfolio strategists who proactively manage their holdings.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">VCs taking this approach, however, need flexibility, mainly to buy and sell stakes on the secondary markets. By reselling their shares in private companies to other investors in this market, VCs can gain liquidity instead of waiting for an IPO or new funding round for an exit.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In contrast, there is a mismatch between the rigidity of a 10-year lifecycle fund and how swiftly AI firms scale. The explosive early growth of AI companies is often followed by longer periods of business model validation and delayed exit events. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This means a 10-year fund’s fixed timeline can expire just as an AI firm is entering its most value-creating phase. This forces investors to exit prematurely and miss out on long-term upside.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The solution for some fund managers is permanent capital vehicles (PCVs). These offer open-ended investment horizons, allowing managers to hold onto generational winners for longer to maximize returns.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This structure also provides more flexibility so investors can enter or exit at different times instead of being locked into a single cycle.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While PCVs are not yet the norm, leading firms are moving in this direction. For instance, Sequoia Capital transformed its fund structure into the evergreen Sequoia Fund, a more flexible model well-suited for the AI era. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This structure allows the firm to hold public and private assets in a single vehicle, eliminating the artificial timeline pressures of a 10-year fund.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">What this means for VCs and founders</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">DeepSeek’s impact on Nvidia, where a single innovation triggered a valuation drop of some US$600 billion, is a stark reminder of how market dynamics can shift so suddenly. This evolving landscape presents new challenges and opportunities for both investors and founders.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">VCs have rethink their fund structure, as the traditional 10-year model may be too rigid for the fast-paced AI industry. PCVs or funds with explicit authorization for secondary market activity may be the way to go.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">VCs must also have a strong technical edge to understand the AI companies they invest in as surface-level due diligence won’t cut it. VCs need in-house technical expertise to evaluate an AI startup’s technology, data sources, and go-to-market strategy so they can see how sturdy its moat is. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Finally, active portfolio management is crucial and trumps the “invest and wait” approach. VCs must become hands-on and be prepared to help their portfolio companies navigate rapid competitive shifts and be ready to exit positions quickly to de-risk investments.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Founders, meanwhile, should seek investors who understand the nimble pace of AI development and can give them structural flexibility. This support could involve participating in a secondary sale to get early liquidity or committing for over a decade to help build a generational company. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Open-source innovation in AI is moving fast, and that means a powerful business model isn’t enough. Founders must focus on not just building a defensible moat, but also creating a durable competitive advantage through proprietary data, a strong user community, network effects, or a unique distribution channel.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Founders should look beyond public listings to exit. Being open to strategic acquisitions and secondary sales can provide returns for their team and investors while continuing to scale the business.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The jury is still out on which new models will prevail, but one thing is clear: GenAI is rewriting the VC playbook. Adaptability, strategic liquidity, and long-term vision are now the essential tools for creating and preserving value in this new market reality. <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/ai-forcing-vcs-rethink-timelines\" target=\"_blank\">TECH IN ASIA</a> </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">I WAS recently deepfaked.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Photographs and videos fabricated by artificial intelligence (AI) – deepfakes purporting to be me in suggestive poses – appeared on TikTok and showed up on the feed of a colleague, who alerted me immediately. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One synthetic video showed this AI-generated version of “me” coquettishly manoeuvring into a sitting position on the floor, barely hiding what was under the micro miniskirt. Readers who remember the iconic scene in the movie <em>Basic Instinct</em>, where Sharon Stone crosses and uncrosses her legs, will get the idea.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">All the deepfake photos and videos were manipulated from authentic photos of me taken from TSMP’s corporate website or legitimate publications where I had appeared. I counted six offending images. On my son’s feed, he found 11. A screenshot of the offending TikTok account sent by my colleague showed yet more deepfaked images that did not appear on my device.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">I’m a woman lawyer in her 50s. I am not active on TikTok, barely share anything on Instagram, have a disabled Telegram account, and mainly use Linkedin to discuss business and community issues. In short, I am not a “high-risk” Internet user; I do not indiscriminately share revealing images that would supposedly make someone a more likely target for such assaults. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">If this can happen to me, it can happen to anyone with an online presence.  </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">The survivor’s reaction</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">I do volunteer work in the area of online harms. Three years ago, I founded SG Her Empowerment (SHE) which established Singapore’s – and Asia’s – first dedicated support centre for victims of online harms, providing counselling support, pro bono legal advice and direct assistance in reporting harms to Internet companies. SHE also conducts research into survivor experience. All this is to say that I am not unfamiliar with the deep psychological impact that such harms can have.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But that didn’t stop the feeling of dread when I learnt about the deepfakes of me circulating on the Internet. Or the slight catch of breath as I hit “play” on my phone and waited for the video to load. Then came palpable relief that there was no nudity.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The strongest, and most enduring, reaction was the feeling of being violated – violent and visceral. Who would do this? Is this some jerk’s idea of funny?</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">We tell survivors it is never their fault. They didn’t ask for this. But the self-blame followed quickly: “It’s your fault for putting yourself out there”. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">And finally, the question of who. Was it someone who hates me? Or was it just a bot randomly picking photos off the Internet and using them for clickbait? As horrible as the thought was that someone out there bore me this degree of animus, that would almost be better than the alternative: my image pimped out by a machine to garner views. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">What to do if it happens to you</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Chances are the offending post has breached community guidelines of the social media platform. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">To start the content removal process, go to the post and choose “Report”. On TikTok, pull-down menus asked for the reason. In my case, it was Misinformation. Do this for all the offending posts. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Get your friends to do the same to multiply the number of reports the platform receives. Internet companies use technology and algorithms to sift through the millions of in-app reports they get daily. The more reports they get on a post, the faster the reaction time. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Next, I sought the help of SHE, which is a “trusted flagger” with the major Internet companies and helps survivors make reports directly to them. Reports made by the SHECARES Centre on behalf of complainants will be dealt with by a human being at the Internet company, and not just an algorithm, speeding up the response.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, it took four days for the offending content to be taken down, and the user account to be disabled. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">And that doesn’t wipe the images from the Internet. A search on Google still showed the images even after the TikTok account had been removed and pictures were no longer accessible there. Now you have to send a report to Google to ask for the offending images to be removed from search results. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Bystanders’ response</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As our society grapples with the growing scourge of and surge in online harms, how the community reacts is crucial.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Thankfully, I had friends who knew how to offer support.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This is awful. I’m so sorry it has happened to you. You didn’t ask for this and it’s not your fault. Here’s how to make an immediate in-app report to start the take-down process. I will also report on my end so that the platform gets multiple points of feedback that the image is deepfaked.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A good friend who had reminded me how to start the take-down process sent me this message: “I hang my head in shame that my first instinct was to fix the problem and not ask how you are doing. I’m so sorry.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">First responders play an important part in framing the survivor’s mindset and rebuilding their self-confidence.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But sometimes, the response from others can make things worse.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">I had written about the incident on Linkedin. Victims of online assaults report an overwhelming loss of agency. Writing about my experience, hoping it would help others, was a way to regain some of that control.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">I received an e-mail a few days later. A local journalist had read my Linkedin post and posed some questions. The e-mail did not explain how the article would be crafted and ended with an instruction: “Please keep my colleagues copied in your reply”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Perhaps the journalist was so direct because by posting about the experience on Linkedin, I had put myself “out there”. Or, there is a sense that online attacks are not as harmful as physical ones. Both are common bystander responses, and both are untrue. If this is what survivors go through, it would explain their hesitation to engage with the media. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Survivors’ remedies</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Apart from the actions I took, there are no legal remedies currently available to someone who has been deepfaked. The law was written in a time before Internet harms had sprung into malignant life. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">If TikTok had not removed the content, there is little I could have done about it. And even if there was an avenue of legal recourse, without knowing the identity of the person who had posted the content, I have no one to hold legally accountable.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But the law is changing. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Online Safety (Relief and Accountability) Bill (OSRA) is currently making its way through Parliament. If passed, someone in my position will have new avenues of recourse.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">First, if appropriate action is not taken by the Internet company in a timely manner, the survivor could then bring the case to the Online Safety Commission (OSC), a new government agency to be set up. The OSC has power to direct the Internet platform to take down the offending content within a certain time frame. Hopefully, this means that the four days my images stayed publicly accessible could be reduced. SHE’s studies show that speed of content removal is the most pressing concern of survivors. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The OSC can also order the Internet platform to provide details within its possession of the identity of the user behind the account where the content was uploaded, and make that information available to the survivor.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The new Act will create statutory torts, making certain online actions a civil wrong, for which the complainant can sue the perpetrator. These include intimate image abuse, image-based child abuse and online impersonation. In my case, I would have an action under the new tort of inauthentic material abuse and could seek civil remedies, applying to the OSC to obtain information about the person(s) behind the faceless user account.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">This is only the beginning</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">What happened to me was not a one-off. On the same site, another woman professional from Singapore whom I know had a similarly doctored video of her. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">According to a study by Italian cybersecurity company DeepTrace in 2019, 96 per cent of online deepfake videos were pornographic and nonconsensual. US cybersecurity firm, Home Security Heroes, reported in a 2023 study that deepfake porn constitutes 98 per cent of all deepfake videos online, with 99 per cent of them targeting women. The study found 95,820 deepfake videos online, a 550 per cent increase from 2019. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Deepfakes are a good business proposition for bad actors. How easy would it be to program a bot to trawl the net for images of individuals with means, and send them a pornographic video with a threat of posting it publicly unless an extortion payment is made? This can be done in seconds, with little human intervention, targeting multiple individuals. If the quantum is small, people might be scared into paying off the perpetrators. Leaders in business, government and the community might command higher ransoms. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Singapore’s forward-thinking laws are a welcome move to improve cyber accountability but policing the Internet is a quagmire. OSRA, progressive as it is, will be hard to enforce overseas or against anyone hiding behind a VPN (virtual private network). An Internet company with no Singapore operations may not comply with the OSC’s directions. For a long time, even governments could not contact the operators of a heavily used messenger app. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Countries adopting differing approaches to tackling online harms means fragmented enforcement. Also, legal enforcement necessarily happens after the harm has occurred, so victims still suffer the mental and emotional toll. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Having OSRA spell out the categories of wrongful online activity will help the community define where the line between acceptable and harmful is drawn, but clarity in moral standards will not deter intentional bad actors. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Internet should be a great equaliser – providing access to information and learning for the less advantaged. But if harmful activity starts to pull people back from engaging on the Internet, that promise of progress suffers. Fixing this is a tall order but if we don’t try, the bad guys win. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>The writer is joint managing partner, TSMP Law Corp, and chairperson of SG Her Empowerment</strong></p></div>",

Put the two together – ageing populations with automation/AI – and there are clusters of investment opportunity.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">We all know that advanced economies face a rise in dependency ratios – the number of retirees to workers.

Happily, as these demographic pressures increase, automation technology and AI are beginning to reshape productivity.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Yet, investors need to note that the process will not happen everywhere, or in every sector. Three factors need to align.

The liquidator, AAG Corporate Advisory, said it is unable to provide details on operations, finances or the reasons for the liquidation before obtaining the relevant information, in response to BT queries on Thursday.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One of Twelve Cupcakes’ outlet managers told BT outside the MOM Services Centre on Friday that the decision to shutter the company came to its staff with zero warning. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We did not know anything (about this) in advance.

Most said they are expected to foot their rent by Friday or Saturday – or risk facing eviction or incurring late charges.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Those who are foreign workers also said they have debts to repay back home; others have to pay tuition fees for their children.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Some workers noted that Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions were not credited to their accounts for October. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Specific representatives of the counter staff group were addressed by MOM staff in closed-door meetings. These workers told BT after these meetings that they were informed that local unions would handle all compensation-related matters. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">They added that a separate meeting with union members has been set up for next week, though a fixed date and time have yet to be confirmed. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As for S-Pass holders, no extension will be given, which means such affected workers will have 30 days to find a new job in Singapore, or they will have to return to their home country. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Affected workers who gathered at the MOM Service Centre on Friday comprised those on S-Passes, Work Permits and Long-term Visit Passes, as well as Singapore citizens. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We understand that the liquidation will take some time, but we do (at the very least) have to receive our salaries for the month of October today so we can continue covering our basic expenses in Singapore, and to feed our families,” one told BT. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the time being, the group of counter staff are putting together a page to raise donations.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We are truly hoping for the best by next week – and we hope the government can help us in our current situation,” the outlet manager said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A representative from home-grown eatery The Soup Spoon reached out to BT on Friday, offering to assist affected Twelve Cupcakes workers with available job opportunities. The business has store openings lined up starting from next week, with several full-time and part-time positions to fill.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Food, Drinks and Allied Workers Union (FDAWU) on Thursday <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/unacceptable-and-unfair-union-raps-twelve-cupcakes-abrupt-closure-axing-80-workers\" target=\"_blank\">criticised the cupcake’s business’ abrupt closure as “unacceptable and unfair”</a>, strongly objecting to the business owner’s lack of prior consultation and advance notice. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">FDAWU said it will be assisting members and workers with salary-related claims and job-assistance support, as well as connecting them to the labour movement’s network, such as NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">MOM issued a joint statement with CPF Board (CPFB) on Friday evening, noting that the actions of Twelve Cupcakes in this case were “irresponsible” and not aligned with the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Despite being a unionised company under the FDAWU, Twelve Cupcakes did not engage the union early, before affected employees were notified,” they explained. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Taskforce for Responsible Retrenchment and Employment Facilitation, which comprises MOM, Workforce Singapore, the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), and NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute (e2i), is working closely with Twelve Cupcakes and the FDAWU to support the affected employees, said MOM and CPFB. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This will include working with Twelve Cupcakes to provide job matching support and career coaching for these employees.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management will also assist employees of Twelve Cupcakes who need to file a Proof of Debt for their salary and other employment claims with the liquidator. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CPFB, in addition, will be filing a Proof of Debt with the liquidator to recover the outstanding CPF contributions for September and October this year. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">MOM also stated that it is investigating the company’s non-payment of salaries and other potential breaches of the Employment Act. </p></div>",
