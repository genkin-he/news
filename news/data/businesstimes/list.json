A year later, the curtain was finally pulled back to reveal Gaudi Room, a small “hidden” bar.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For founders Antonio Miscellaneo and Carlos Montobbio, having a separate area for cocktails within Carlitos was always on the cards. “We actually designed the restaurant with space to build this bar from the opening,” says Miscellaneo.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He recounts customers at his other restaurant – La Bottega Enoteca, just a few doors down – asking him for “follow-up experiences” after dinner. “I had nowhere to send them anywhere nearby, but opening a bar on its own is <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/consumer-healthcare/prive-eggslut-fb-closures-2025\" target=\"_blank\">difficult to sustain</a>, so this was the best way.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The duo, however, decided to launch Carlitos before Gaudi Room so they could take more time to perfect the speakeasy’s look and feel.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Inspired by and named after Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi, the bar’s design features his signature organic shapes, including rounded pilasters that transition seamlessly into the walls, as well as custom-carved wood fittings and two long tables.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Explaining why they focused on Gaudi Room only after operations at Carlitos were “fairly stable”, Miscellaneo says: “We knew it would take longer, especially for the level of detail we wanted.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Emulating Gaudi’s “quirky” style added an extra layer of complexity, he adds: “It’s not just a room, tiles, a couple of pieces of furniture; we needed time.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Everything in the 23-seater space was chosen or even made by the founders, down to the ceramic tile mosaic tabletops and the matching upholstery on a bench that anchors a corner. In all, putting the bar together took around four months.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">A new experience</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With Gaudi Room being both Miscellaneo’s and Montobbio’s first cocktail bar, they faced a steep learning curve, particularly when it came to developing the menu. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Montobbio, who is also the chef-owner of Esquina in Chinatown, notes that mixology requires a high level of precision; after all, each drink is only so many ounces of liquid, which leaves little room for error.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“When we taste a cocktail, we may feel it needs a little sweetness; then we add two drops of sugar syrup, and the cocktail is completely changed,” he explains. “It’s not as forgiving as food.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">After working with a consultant on an initial draft for the menu, Miscellaneo and Montobbio set to work on fine-tuning things, infusing each drink with “Spanish and Latin touches”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Among the cocktails in the final line-up is the Margarita de La Vera – Montobbio’s favourite – which includes an infusion of smoked paprika sourced from the county in western Spain from which the drink gets its name.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Another of Montobbio’s top picks is the La Sagrada Paloma: a spicy, Asian-inspired iteration of the classic paloma that includes togarashi and a kimchi base, named for the still-unfinished Barcelona church that is perhaps the architect’s most famous creation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For Miscellaneo, meanwhile, bourbon-based The Smoking Architect was a fast favourite.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I drink cocktails very fast… I usually gulp them down, and in one second – gone,” he says with a laugh. “But with The Smoking Architect, I can pace it a little more; the drink develops and gets rounder as the ice melts.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Also on Gaudi Room’s menu is the Veneno de la Pasion, a Spanish riff on a porn star martini served with a sidecar of cava instead of the usual champagne. Then there’s the Gaudoni Negroni, which adds cassis and cacao to the traditional negroni for a bold, almost dessert-like concoction.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Miscellaneo and Montobbio intend to continually refresh the menu with their team, further refining existing drinks and introducing new ones to keep things interesting.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In line with the speakeasy theme, the duo has opted to let news of the bar spread mostly through word of mouth.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“If you come, a friend brings you over, you have a good time and the drinks are good… you will come back with another bunch of friends,” Montobbio concludes. “There’s no better marketing than that.”</p></div>",

This brought its FY2025 earnings to 8.6 billion yuan, 30.2 per cent higher than the previous year’s 6.6 billion yuan. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its revenue rose 15.8 per cent on the year to 15.6 billion yuan for the half-year, and climbed 7.4 per cent to 28.5 billion yuan for the full-year. The topline growth was fuelled by the progressive construction of vessels secured at higher newbuild prices. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CGSI in a Friday report maintained its “add” call for Yangzijiang Shipbuilding, citing the group’s earnings growth – backed by a US$22.4 billion orderbook – and an attractive nine times forward price-to-earnings ratio.<strong> </strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The brokerage raised its target price for the counter from S$4.51 to S$4.95, a premium of 14.1 per cent above the stock’s Friday closing price.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CGSI analyst Lim Siew Khee noted that the shipbuilder’s final dividend of S$0.20 per share for FY2025, an increase from S$0.12 per share in FY2024, implies a 50 per cent payout ratio which is a “positive surprise”. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Similarly, DBS said on Thursday that it would likely maintain its “buy” call on the counter, with its S$3.80 target price under review. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">DBS analyst Ho Pei Hwa noted that the stock’s FY2025 net profit beat consensus by 3 to 4 per cent, and that the roughly US$290 million worth of new orders secured by the group in December brings its full-year order wins to around US$2.5 billion. </p></div>",

This was primarily due to weaker healthcare sales, as consumer confidence softened amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Conversely, the company recorded lower expenses during the period. The cost of sales fell 18.9 per cent to S$46.3 million, in line with the lower revenue. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Distribution and marketing expenses shrank by 40.3 per cent to S$15.4 million, mainly driven by reduced activities for the healthcare segment. Finance expenses also dropped by 29.1 per cent, largely due to lower borrowing rates.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As a result of these factors, Haw Par’s gross margin remained stable at 55.3 per cent in the second half of 2025, sitting slightly above the 55 per cent margin in the corresponding period of the preceding year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the full year, Haw Par’s profit rose 16.3 per cent to S$265.5 million. This bottom-line growth occurred despite a 6.1 per cent decrease in full-year revenue to S$230 million, which was dragged down by the drop in demand for healthcare in the second half of the year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its healthcare segment revenue contracted 6.9 per cent to S$210.4 million. Haw Par attributed this drop primarily to lower sales in Asia, noting that consumers have become increasingly cautious in their spending amid weaker sentiment in certain markets. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, tighter cost management on operating expenses helped improve the operating margin. Consequently, the healthcare segment’s operating profit grew by 7.2 per cent to S$67.1 million in 2025.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Revenue from its other segments, which comprise Leisure and Property, improved by 4 per cent to S$19.6 million. This growth was supported by better performance at Underwater World Pattaya, which welcomed more visitors during the year; the group’s Singapore investment properties enjoyed improved average occupancy. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The higher revenue translated into a 3.7 per cent increase in operating profit for these segments, rising to S$10.6 million.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Haw Par expects global economic growth to remain uneven, and to slow down even further if geopolitical tensions escalate. The company stated that this uncertainty “may dampen consumer confidence and discretionary spending, potentially affecting demand for the group’s products and services”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Shares of Haw Par Group rose 1.9 per cent to close S$0.31 higher at S$16.70, before the results were announced.</p></div>",
