The music industry is littered with the wreckage of acts that arrived on a wave of hype, collected their awards and quietly disappeared when the tide went out. The Darkness were supposed to be one of them.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Instead, more than two decades on, Justin Hawkins and his band are back selling out venues across four continents, scoring their highest chart position in decades, and preparing to play Singapore for the very first time on Mar 11. For fans who have followed the group since their barnstorming debut more than two decades ago, it has been a long time coming.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We have been to Singapore, but only momentarily passing through the airport and it looks so dazzling and opulent and lovely,” singer Justin Hawkins says over a Zoom call recently, “So when they asked us if we wanted to play, we were like yes, of course we do and hopefully it’ll be the first of many.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Darkness were formed by brothers Justin and guitarist Dan Hawkins in Lowestoft, Suffolk, in 2000. Three years of relentless gigging later, they released their debut album, <em>Permission to Land</em>. Despite being so brazenly unfashionable and defiantly in thrall to the chest-baring excess of 1970s hard rock, the record went quadruple platinum. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It earned the band three Brit Awards including Best British Group and Best Album. It also produced one of the most recognisable rock songs of the decade: I Believe in a Thing Called Love, with its galloping riff and Justin Hawkins’ glass-shattering falsetto. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Internal tensions led to a hiatus and a revolving door of line-up changes, before a full reunion in 2011 with a renewed sense of purpose. They have been recording and touring near-continuously ever since, releasing six more studio albums on independent labels.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Justin Hawkins is not bothered radio doesn’t embrace the kind of music The Darkness plays. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Apart from our first record, I don’t think we’ve had much in the way of airplay. We’re not playing very fashionable music and a lot of the time I listen to the radio and think: Do I really want to be on it with that music playing anyway?”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Their eighth album, <em>Dreams on Toast</em>, released in early 2025, peaked at No 2 on the UK Albums Chart – their strongest chart position since <em>Permission to Land</em> – and The Darkness are set to see 2026 out with a UK arena tour and the opening slot for Iron Maiden at Knebworth. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Justin Hawkins credits the band’s ongoing success to the intensely loyal fanbase, many of whom still buy vinyl, CDs, even cassettes. “They want to make sure the money they spend goes to the band, so that we can keep touring.”</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">No algorithms, no AI</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Offstage, Justin Hawkins has cultivated a second life as one of rock music’s most engaging YouTubers, amassing a large subscriber base with his candid opinions on music and the industry. The channel, <em>Justin Hawkins Rides Again</em>, began accidentally, born out of Covid boredom and a suggestion from his tattoo artist. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I was very sceptical. I didn’t think it was going to work. But I tried it, and it sort of caught fire.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The experience of analysing other people’s music has sharpened his own instincts, pushing him towards what he describes as deliberate strangeness of abandoning conventional song structure, experimenting with microtonal tuning, refusing auto-tune in a genre increasingly addicted to it. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“One of my great campaigns is to try and abandon auto tune, because whenever I hear that in rock, I just think that’s embarrassing,” he explains. “Rock singers sing flat to add despair and sing sharp to add excitement. Robert Plant, for example, never sang on the note, nor did Nick Cave.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He adds: “They sang sharp or flat – always has, always will – and these, these are the real heroes for me, because it’s like you have the courage to show your own voice in a musical climate where everything’s auto tuned and it just sounds like pop music.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On artificial intelligence (AI), he is unequivocal. He refuses to use it for songwriting, for social media, for anything. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I happen to believe that if you write a song with the assistance of AI, there’ll be some sort of audit, and they’ll look back and say: You used AI to help write that hit, so you shouldn’t be earning on it. And I actually agree with that. If a computer wrote the song, why are you making money?” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">And in an era saturated with reunion tours and heritage nostalgia, The Darkness occupy a quietly radical position: a band that never really stopped. Justin Hawkins is gently scathing about acts that disappear for years and then return expecting a hero’s welcome.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Don’t have a break,” he says, “because it gives people an opportunity to see it in a cynical way. If you just keep going, you have longevity by default.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><em>The Darkness plays Capitol Theatre on Mar 11.

Coupang said it would “take all necessary steps to prevent further harm and continue strengthening safeguards to prevent a recurrence”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Harold Rogers, the interim head of Coupang’s South Korean business, said the company has not detected a misuse of customer data attributable to the incident and has found no evidence to date of “any secondary harm”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Rogers added that the breach stemmed from a targeted attack carried out by a former employee who leveraged inside knowledge of Coupang’s systems, citing the findings of a cybersecurity firm’s investigation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, South Korea’s Science Ministry said this month that the breach stemmed from management failures at Coupang rather than a sophisticated cyberattack.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Since the incident, its rivals have jumped in to lure shoppers away from the platform.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It also faces headwinds from a proposed regulatory change that could increase competition in ultra-fast overnight deliveries, which have been a cornerstone of its market dominance.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Separately, earlier on Thursday, South Korea’s antitrust regulator fined Coupang 2.2 billion won (S$1.9 million) for pressuring suppliers to cut prices and shoulder additional costs to meet profit margins, as well as for delaying payments to vendors.

            "title": "‘A geostrategic tectonic plate rupture’: Dr Balakrishnan says agency, partnerships are key amid shifting world order",
            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[SINGAPORE] Singapore’s only option in the evolving world order is to continue to determine its national interests and exercise agency to chart its own path, said Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan on Friday (Feb 27). “This is not just a small tremor. This is geostrategic tectonic plate rupture.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We thrived as a ‘global metropolis’ in an age of globalisation,” he said during his ministry’s Committee of Supply debate in Parliament. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But anti-globalisation sentiments have now not only manifested in domestic policy but undermined support for the international order, he added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Rules and consensus no longer drive international relations, he warned. This is a more dangerous world for small countries such as Singapore, which have no “strategic heft” to buffer against turbulence – but it has agency, resilience and resources.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We have never been naive,” said Dr Balakrishnan. “There is a deep vein of realism in the way we view the world and the way we operate.”</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Prioritising Singapore</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The city-state must objectively assess its national interests, he said. These are: to safeguard its sovereignty, independence and national unity; to secure access to essential supplies and freedom of navigation; to strengthen its role as a global hub; and to support a rules-based multilateral approach wherever possible.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As Singapore faces more strategic dilemmas and difficult choices, it must retain its “ability to say ‘no’”, said Dr Balakrishnan, the loss of which would result in a loss of relevance and independence.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He highlighted examples of Singapore’s ability to disagree with its partners, speaking out when Russia invaded Ukraine, when the US implemented tariffs that violated the Most Favoured Nation principle, and during the Israel-Gaza conflict.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“These positions we have taken and explicitky stated over the last few years have not been universally welcomed, and even domestically, have elicted active debate” Dr Balakrishnan said. “(But this) aligns with furthering our national interests. Articulating these positions is part of exercising agency.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He laid out five priorities for the ministry.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">First, to engage all great powers constructively and give them a stake in the stability and prosperity of the region. This balance of power gives small states such as Singapore room to manoeuvre, he said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Second, to buttress a wider network of middle-power partnerships for greater stability. Third, to strengthen a stable and integrated Asean, which has “great potential”. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Fourth, to create greater synergy between Singapore and its immediate neighbours. Fifth, to reinforce a rules-based international architecture despite the current headwinds.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Strengthening partnerships</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Singapore’s relationship with major powers, Dr Balakrishnan noted the significance of its partnerships with both the US and China. It wants to work with both countries “where our interests coincide”, he said, noting that all countries must find “creative ways” to do so.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He updated that the government is still assessing the US ’ invitation to formally join the Board of Peace.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Singapore will also strengthen its partnerships with middle powers and regional blocs, the minister said. It upgraded its partnerships with Australia, France, India, New Zealand and Vietnam in 2025, and established a partnership with South Korea. It also signed the EU-Singapore Digital Trade Agreement.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">To deepen relations with more like-minded partners, the ministry is expanding its global footprint in Africa and Latin America, establishing new missions in Mexico and Ethiopia to support this.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Amid these partnerships, Asean remains the cornerstone of Singapore’s foreign policy, “and a salient platform from which we engage the wider world”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With Singapore assuming chairmanship of the bloc in 2027, during its 60th anniversary, Dr Balakrishnan said it will use its role to pursue deeper integration, promote external partnerships, and keep Asean open and committed to peace, stability and cooperation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the bloc to remain relevant, it must become more cohesive, united and credible, through deeper regional integration, Dr Balakrishnan said. This is why it is pushing hard on key initiatives – such as the Asean Power Grid and Asean Digital Economy Framework Agreement – that bind its economies closer together.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He also emphasised the importance of giving major powers a stake in the region’s stability and prosperity, and ensuring Asean stays the partner of choice.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The more countries invest in Asean’s collective progress, the more stable Asean will be,” he said, noting that the balance of power and interest allows more room to manouevre than single-power dominance.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The bedrock of Asean cohesion is strong neighbourly relationships, Dr Balakrishnan continued.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With Indonesia, Singapore is exploring projects in energy, food security, education and healthcare, discussing cross-border electricity trade, carbon capture and storage, and establishing a Sustainable Industrial Zone across the Bintan-Batam-Karimun corridor. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With Malaysia, Singapore is deepening economic and people-to-people ties with East Malaysia through the establishment of consulates in Sabah and Sarawak, and managing complex outstanding bilateral issues.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Maintaining multilateralism</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Despite the challenges of building consensus in a fractured world, Dr Balakrishnan said that Singapore remains committed to the rules-based multilateral system, which provides “the architecture of norms, standards and institutions that protect the global commons and give all small states a say”. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We must continue to do our best to build overlapping, flexible circles of plurilateral partnerships with like-minded countries,” he said, highlighting the Joint Statement Initiative on E-commerce Agreement as one example, which began with Singapore, Australia, and Japan and now has 72 co-sponsors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Recognising that Singaporeans will have different views on foreign policy issues, Dr Balakrishnan said that they do not need to agree on foreign policy stances, but must agree that these are matters “to be discussed and decided by Singaporeans alone”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While foreign actors will try to push their narratives and deepen internal divisions, Singapore – with its diverse population that is vulnerable to becoming polarised and fractured – must guard against this, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">We do not expect a stable new equilibrium to take shape in 2026, or frankly, even the next couple of years” warned Dr Balakrishnan. But he added that, conpared to when Singapoe unexpectedly became indepenedent, the country is in a far better position, in terms of tools and resources.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It has three prerequisites for success, he said: domestic unity, where it inoculates itself from foreign influence; economic relevance, where its value as a hub is accentuated by the more fractious world; and its ability to defend itself, through National Service and steady investment.</p></div>",
