            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[BERLIN] SAP’s new bonus system ended up rewarding underperforming managers while holding lower-ranking workers to a higher standard for their payouts, prompting an outcry from employees and leaders alike at the German software company, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">SAP has since set aside millions of euros to appease angered staff and improve the new global system, which wound up rewarding senior-level employees who did not meet all expectations in their roles, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg and people familiar with the situation. The people asked not to be identified because the matter isn’t public. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The compensation programme riled SAP employees, who have already signalled in surveys that they are losing trust in the company’s executive board amid job cuts and a restructuring process that dragged on for months. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As artificial intelligence tools threaten traditional enterprise software models, SAP’s stock has lost about 135 billion euros (S$201.7 billion) in value after reaching an all-time-high a year ago. SAP reported on Thursday (Feb 26) that chief executive officer Christian Klein made 16.2 million euros in 2025, about 14 per cent below his compensation a year earlier. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">SAP confirmed that it had introduced a new performance-based compensation framework. During the rollout, the firm “identified additional areas for refinement related to stock-based compensation for non-executives,” a company spokesperson said. The topics were reviewed and addressed “to the extent possible prior to the process finalisation,” he added, saying that “fair and competitive compensation for performance is a priority for SAP.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Klein had set a goal of overhauling the employee reward system in 2023 to better incentivise high performance. He put chief people officer Gina Vargiu-Breuer in charge of the development of the new stock incentive plan, which was rolled out to employees this month, two of the people said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Klein told Vargiu-Breuer’s team to rework the system after employees and managers complained that it was unfair, the two people said. The fallout could threaten her future at the company after her contract ends in early 2027, they said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“As is standard practice, SAP does not comment on individual personnel or contractual matters,” a company spokesperson said by email. Gina Vargiu-Breuer did not respond to a request for comment sent through SAP.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">SAP categorised its general staff in five levels, ranging from the lowest (T1) to managers or senior employees (T5), the documents reviewed by Bloomberg show. While the three bottom ranks had to surpass expectations to receive stock-based bonuses, T4 and T5 employees who did not meet all their benchmarks still qualified for incentives, according to the documents and people familiar with the situation. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">SAP has seen high executive board turnover in the past six years, and several contracts were terminated prematurely, costing the firm millions of euros in payouts. Klein’s co-CEO Jennifer Morgan left after months in the role in 2020. Starting in 2023, chief financial officer Luka Mucic and executive board members Sabine Bendiek, Scott Russell, Julia White and Jürgen Müller also departed. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Separately, Muhammad Alam, who leads product engineering, does not plan to renew his contract when it ends next year, the people said. Alam did not respond to a request for comment, and SAP declined to comment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In an internal survey in November, 59 per cent of employees said they trusted the executive board, down six percentage points from half a year earlier, according to an internal email sent by Vargiu-Breuer and seen by Bloomberg News. In April 2021, more than 80 per cent of employees said they trusted the executive team.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The turnover at the top level has added another layer of instability as SAP works to rearrange its business around the threats of the new AI era. Some early users of the company’s flagship AI assistant, Joule – designed to help users navigate complex SAP systems and make tasks like coding easier – have been disappointed, customers and partners have said, asking to not be identified discussing their relationship with the vendor.

The sales of the Ransome’s Wharf site in London and the office component of Suzhou Hong Leong City Center in China also boosted revenue.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Notably, the hotel operations segment saw a 1.7 per cent increase in revenue and improvements in revenue per available room, said CDL. This was supported by new additions including The Mayfair Hotel Christchurch, acquired in January 2025, and the Hilton Paris Opera, acquired in May 2024. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The group noted that the increase in gross profits for H2 and FY2025 was marginal, despite its revenue growth.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its overall gross profit margin fell to 41 per cent for H2 and FY2025, from 45 per cent for both periods in 2024, as it was impacted by an S$80.5 million allowance for foreseeable losses that was made in relation to China development properties.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As at Dec 31, CDL maintained strong cash reserves of S$2.1 billion.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The board proposed a final dividend of S$0.25 per share, payable on May 19, after the record date of May 4.

The music industry is littered with the wreckage of acts that arrived on a wave of hype, collected their awards and quietly disappeared when the tide went out. The Darkness were supposed to be one of them.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Instead, more than two decades on, Justin Hawkins and his band are back selling out venues across four continents, scoring their highest chart position in decades, and preparing to play Singapore for the very first time on Mar 11. For fans who have followed the group since their barnstorming debut more than two decades ago, it has been a long time coming.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We have been to Singapore, but only momentarily passing through the airport and it looks so dazzling and opulent and lovely,” singer Justin Hawkins says over a Zoom call recently, “So when they asked us if we wanted to play, we were like yes, of course we do and hopefully it’ll be the first of many.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Darkness were formed by brothers Justin and guitarist Dan Hawkins in Lowestoft, Suffolk, in 2000. Three years of relentless gigging later, they released their debut album, <em>Permission to Land</em>.

The music industry is littered with the wreckage of acts that arrived on a wave of hype, collected their awards and quietly disappeared when the tide went out. The Darkness were supposed to be one of them.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Instead, more than two decades on, Justin Hawkins and his band are back selling out venues across four continents, scoring their highest chart position in decades, and preparing to play Singapore for the very first time on Mar 11. For fans who have followed the group since their barnstorming debut more than two decades ago, it has been a long time coming.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We have been to Singapore, but only momentarily passing through the airport and it looks so dazzling and opulent and lovely,” singer Justin Hawkins says over a Zoom call recently, “So when they asked us if we wanted to play, we were like yes, of course we do and hopefully it’ll be the first of many.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Darkness were formed by brothers Justin and guitarist Dan Hawkins in Lowestoft, Suffolk, in 2000. Three years of relentless gigging later, they released their debut album, <em>Permission to Land</em>. Despite being so brazenly unfashionable and defiantly in thrall to the chest-baring excess of 1970s hard rock, the record went quadruple platinum. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It earned the band three Brit Awards including Best British Group and Best Album.
