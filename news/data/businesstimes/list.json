Sister brand Porsche scaling back its EV ambitions added to the strains, Audi said on Friday (Oct 31).</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The situation remains very demanding,” chief financial officer Jürgen Rittersberger said on a call with reporters, noting that the brand is expecting a US$1.5 billion hit from tariffs this year. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The luxury-car maker also needs to find a solution for models it had planned to build on a joint EV platform with Porsche that has now been delayed, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Delivering on the financial goals will also depend on sourcing enough semiconductors as part of the disruption to the supply of chips made by Nexperia, Audi said, echoing VW’s warning on Thursday. Manufacturers are at risk of production shutdowns after the little-known chipmaker in the Netherlands emerged in the crossfire of a dispute with China. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Aside from renewed supply chain risk, the VW unit is seeking to streamline its business to cut costs, while working on a record model offensive. Audi, historically a major profit driver for its parent, has been hit hard by tariffs in the US and sliding market share in China. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">During the third quarter, the Audi brand posted an operating margin of 2 per cent for a profit of 280 million euros (S$421.4 million). That compares with a slightly negative result last year when the brand booked costs related to the closure of its Brussels factory.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CFO Rittersberger said Audi is still considering a range of options to start making cars in the US. A decision will be made before the end of the year, he told reporters on a call. BLOOMBERG</p></div>",

            "title": "Why a six-wheel Lexus, Japan’s Rolls-Royce and an incomplete car matter so much to Toyota",
            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[TOKYO] Toyota brought the biggest cars to the Japan Mobility Show 2025, and was arguably also at the heart of the biggest story there. Its chairman, Akio Toyoda, grew visibly emotional as he unveiled the Century Coupe concept, a sleek yet hulking fastback from a new brand created to tempt buyers away from Rolls-Royce and Bentley.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Japan as a nation seems to have lost some of its energy and dynamism, along with our presence in the world,” he said to the press on Wednesday (Oct 29). “I believe now more than ever, we need the Century.” The new luxury label would “bring the pride of Japan out into the world”, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Toyoda’s press conference provided a dramatic opening to the event, which runs until Nov 9 and is expected to draw more than a million visitors to the sprawling halls of the Tokyo Big Sight exhibition space. Here was the chairman of the world’s largest carmaker acknowledging that Japan – and perhaps by extension its car industry – needs to reclaim some lost mojo.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With its lurid orange bodywork (courtesy of 60 layers of paint), handcrafted parts and sumptuous interior, the Century Coupe already carries a nameplate loaded with meaning. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The original Century, launched in 1967 to honour the 100th anniversary of Toyota founder Sakichi Toyoda’s birth, wore an emblem with Japan’s phoenix, a mythical bird that serves as an imperial symbol of peace, prosperity and renewal. “I believe this car was born carrying Japan on its shoulders,” Toyoda said of that first model.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Wholesale reset</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Century’s launch is part of a wholesale reset that will see Toyota reorganise its sprawling product line-up into five standalone brands, which also include Toyota itself, Lexus, Daihatsu and Gazoo Racing (its performance and motorsport division).</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The group announced on Oct 13 that Century will sit at the pinnacle, giving Lexus room to evolve and “to be adventurous and innovative”, according to chief branding officer Simon Humphries.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That adventurousness showed up on six wheels, in the form of the LS Concept, a rectilinear people mover that looks like a rolling lounge. Ironically, the concept car takes the form of a huge box precisely to exemplify some out-of-the-box thinking from a brand that Toyota launched to disrupt British and German luxury carmakers.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Inside, bamboo slats provide privacy, fine woodworking lines the cabin and the space feels genuinely palatial. The six-wheel layout wasn’t a provocation for its own sake, according to Koichiro Suga, general manager, Lexus Design Division. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Instead, it came about because four small rear wheels reduce intrusion into the passenger compartment. “Interior space comes first,” he told <em>The Business Times</em>. “The first idea is to provide a sanctuary for the owner.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Lexus also showed an LS Coupe Concept, a tall-riding four-door, to suggest that one nameplate can stretch across wildly different forms. It’s a necessary evolution because, as Humphries put it, executive sedans are “fighting a losing battle” against sport utility vehicles, and luxury brands can no longer pin their identities to a single body style.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In fact, nothing seems sacred at Lexus. The division recently announced it would discontinue the LS, the ultra-refined “Luxury Sedan” that served as its seminal car. The move seemed like heresy, akin to Mercedes-Benz no longer making the S-Class. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But with the letters now standing for “Luxury Space”, the message in Tokyo was that the next Lexus flagship could come in any shape or form – the brand also showed off a single-person autonomous machine designed like a jewel box called the LS Micro. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Something for everyone</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While Lexus toyed with wild ideas, Toyota’s core brand displayed a back-to-basics sensibility. A concept version of the Corolla, still the single best-selling car of all time, showed that the next iteration will offer electric, hybrid, plug-in hybrid and internal combustion options to ensure that there is something for everyone.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Toyota’s IMV Origin, a commercial vehicle designed for villagers in rural Africa, takes that idea to a bizarre place. Toyota’s idea is to ship the car out only 70 per cent finished. The customer completes the remaining 30 per cent with simple tools, configuring it to suit his needs. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Will it carry people or cargo? Will the cargo be boxes or something else?” Toyota chief executive Koji Sato said. “We just build the base. From there, each customer completes the vehicle to fit their needs.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Toyota often looms large over the Japan Mobility Show, and this year was no different. Of the 15 brands present, five were foreign, meaning Toyota alone accounted for four of the 10 domestic names there. (Gazoo Racing was conspicuous by its absence, but Toyoda has promised a major announcement for the brand in December.)</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But the domestic players didn’t have the entire field to themselves. Chinese giant BYD unveiled the Racco, a boxy electric vehicle (EV) developed specifically for Japan’s keijidosha class – small cars that don’t require owners in some parts of Tokyo to prove they have a parking space.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With sliding rear doors (a first for any kei EV) and two battery options for daily use or longer trips, the Racco is less car than declaration of war. Until now, foreign car brands have kept out of the kei-car market, which makes up nearly 40 per cent of Japanese car sales, and BYD clearly sees an opening. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Shaken into action</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While the EV race has finally come to Japan’s backyard, the outside world’s ongoing shift to electrification has shaken some domestic players into action. Honda, for example, displayed no fewer than six prototype electric cars at Tokyo. Subaru launched one in concept form and displayed a near-production crossover. Suzuki rolled out the Vision e-Sky, a kei EV that will go into production in 2026.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even as Japan’s car industry picks up its electrification pace, Toyota chief Sato believes that one thing should stay constant. “Wanting to drive a car that looks cool. I think that many of us share such a desire,” he said while presenting the Corolla concept. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Whether it’s a battery EV, plug-in hybrid, hybrid, or internal combustion engine vehicle, whatever the power source, let’s make good-looking cars that everyone will want to drive.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Presumably, that goal applies whether a vehicle has four wheels or six.</p></div>",

Previous champions including the late Kyi Hla Han (1994), Adam Scott (2005, 2006, 2010), Jeev Milkha Singh (2008), Ian Poulter (2009), Sergio Garcia (2018), Matt Kuchar (2020) and Sadom Kaewkanjana (2022).</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Cho, who has worked with the Asian Tour since 2007 and became CEO in 2019, described the Singapore Open as a “signature event”. It is making its debut on the International Series – 10 premier events on the Asian Tour that have higher prize money and a pathway for golfers to play in the LIV Golf league.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The four-day tournament this year has Kweichow Moutai as the title sponsor, with the event known as the Moutai Singapore Open. A total of US$2 million in prize money is up for grabs.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We are restarting from an extremely strong position. We are delighted it’s now back on the schedule thanks to the support of the title sponsor, and we see this as an opportunity for it to return to the forefront of golf in the region,” Cho said in an interview with<em> BT Weekend</em>.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Moving forward, the only way is up. We will aim to increase the prize money, further strengthen the field and ensure the event returns to the pinnacle of tournament golf on the Asian Tour.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Some of the world’s top-ranked golfers and an array of stars from the continent will be in town for the Singapore Open.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Leading the charge will be Englishman Paul Casey, who returns to Singapore after one of the strongest LIV Golf seasons so far. The 15-time European Tour winner and Ryder Cup veteran played a key role in steering Crushers GC to a second-place finish in the 2025 team standings.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Other LIV Golf players competing are Americans Talor Gooch, Peter Uihlein and Anthony Kim.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Growth of the Tour</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Cho said the aim is to add more events on both the Asian Tour and the Asian Development Tour, with the target of staging a total of 40 to 42 events in total.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“It has been an incredible turnaround for the Asian Tour since the global Covid-19 pandemic. We have enjoyed the most significant and transformative period in our history,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With the Asian Tour being a springboard for players who aspire to compete globally, Cho said there are many pathways for top-ranked players to participate on golf’s grandest stages, such as the Majors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“For instance, the winner of The International Series Rankings earns a place on the LIV Golf league, and the winner of the Link Hong Kong Open will gain an exemption to the US Masters for the first time,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He pointed out that the Asian Tour’s Order of Merit winner also earns a place at the US PGA Championship and The Open through a special category on the Official World Golf Ranking.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Overall, Cho said the larger scale and geography of the Asian Tour also presented several challenges he had to overcome.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“One challenge that we have been facing over the last few seasons is a shift in consumer behaviour, where fans are viewing golf in a much different manner than before,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We have had to pivot away from a heavy reliance on the full live television broadcast and place more emphasis on short-form digital media.”</p></div>",

It also removed its Chinese CEO, citing concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nexperia’s move came after the Dutch chipmaker’s Chinese unit resumed supplying semiconductors to local customers but stipulated that all sales to distributors would need to be settled using the Chinese renminbi. Previously, transactions had been settled with foreign currencies like the US dollar.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The company produces large volumes of chips in the Netherlands that are widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries. Some 70 per cent of the Netherlands-produced chips are packaged in China and sold mostly to distributors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“While we have maintained shipments for as long as commercially feasible, continuing the current flow of supply from our front-end sites is no longer justifiable,” the letter said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Unless these contractual obligations are fully satisfied, we cannot resume wafer supply to the site. Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or from the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution to the problem.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nexperia said it is financially independent of Wingtech and it does not raise capital from Wingtech, the letter showed.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nexperia confirmed that it sent the letter but said it could not comment further. Nexperia China and Wingtech did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Court filings showed that the seizure by the Dutch government came as US pressure was rising on Nexperia after Wingtech was placed on a restricted-export list, though Dutch authorities say governance shortcomings were the trigger.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Oct 4, China’s commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips from China.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Industry bodies have sounded the alarm over the possible impact on production, with Stellantis saying on Thursday that it had set up a “war room” to monitor the situation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Japanese automaker Nissan said it had enough chips at the moment to last until the first week of November without disruption.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Some Nexperia products that used to cost just a few Chinese cents have gone up in price to two or three yuan each over the past two weeks, more than 10 times their original cost, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Alibaba, which operates the Ele.me food-delivery app, followed suit, ramping up investment in the segment.\r</p><div class=\"w-screen bg-gray-125 transition-all duration-300 border-gray-175 min-h-0 border-y-0 bg-none py-0\" style=\"max-width:0px;margin-left:calc(-1*(0px - 100%) / 2 );height:0;margin-bottom:0\"><div class=\"container px-3 sticky top-[120px]\" data-component=\"component-container\"><div class=\"relative mx-auto w-full md:w-10/12 md:px-8 lg:w-8/12\"><div class=\"ad-placeholder no-print flex flex-col items-center justify-center\" data-ad-article-id=\"7479032\" data-ad-article-tags=\"china economy,e-commerce,alibaba,meituan,jd.com\" data-ad-gs-channels=\"\" data-ad-index=\"0\" data-ad-type=\"midarticlespecial\" data-testid=\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\" id=\"dfp-ad-midarticlespecial\"></div></div></div></div><p class=\"mb-4 md:mb-6 leading-8 -tracking-5%\" data-story-element=\"paragraph\" data-testid=\"paragraph-component\">All three firms have pledged billions of US dollars to win market share. Analysts at Nomura estimate industry-wide cash burn exceeded US$4 billion in the second quarter alone.\r</p><p class=\"mb-4 md:mb-6 leading-8 -tracking-5%\" data-story-element=\"paragraph\" data-testid=\"paragraph-component\">“The landscape is increasingly challenging, resembling a high-stakes ‘game of chicken,’ where the early investments of whichever player yields first could end up wasted. We expect this intense competition to continue at least through the [Singles’ Day] shopping festival in November,” said Kenneth Fong, UBS Investment Bank’s head of Internet research in China.\r</p><p class=\"mb-4 md:mb-6 leading-8 -tracking-5%\" data-story-element=\"paragraph\" data-testid=\"paragraph-component\">S&amp;P Global analysts forecast Meituan, JD.com and Alibaba will spend at least 160 billion yuan (S$28.9 billion) over the next 12-to-18 months to defend or grow market share in food delivery and instant retail. They warned of “significant downward revisions” to profits, saying margins are unlikely to recover over the next 12-24 months.</p><div class=\"my-8 md:my-12 w-screen bg-gray-125 transition-all duration-300 border-gray-175 min-h-0 border-y-0 bg-none py-0\" style=\"max-width:0px;margin-left:calc(-1*(0px - 100%) / 2 );height:0;margin-bottom:0\"><div class=\"container px-3 sticky top-[120px]\" data-component=\"component-container\"><div class=\"mx-auto w-full md:w-10/12 md:px-8 lg:w-8/12\"><div class=\"ad-placeholder no-print flex flex-col items-center justify-center\" data-ad-article-id=\"7479032\" data-ad-article-tags=\"china economy,e-commerce,alibaba,meituan,jd.com\" data-ad-gs-channels=\"\" data-ad-index=\"0\" data-ad-type=\"imu2\" data-testid=\"dfp-ad-imu2\" id=\"dfp-ad-imu2\"></div></div></div></div><p class=\"mb-4 md:mb-6 leading-8 -tracking-5%\" data-story-element=\"paragraph\" data-testid=\"paragraph-component\">Meituan is expected to be hit the hardest, as food delivery contributes most to its revenue. JD.com’s food-delivery losses nearly wiped out its second-quarter profit, while Alibaba is less exposed, with instant retail forming a smaller part of its business, the analysts said.\r</p><h2 class=\"mb-4 md:mb-6 text-[21px] md:text-4xl -tracking-5% font-lucida font-bold\" data-story-element=\"sub_head\" data-testid=\"sub-heading-component\">Long-term gain</h2><p class=\"mb-4 md:mb-6 leading-8 -tracking-5%\" data-story-element=\"paragraph\" data-testid=\"paragraph-component\">PDD’s domestic platform, Pinduoduo, has largely stayed out of the instant retail fray, but its low-cost advantage is being eroded by rivals’ discounting.\r</p><p class=\"mb-4 md:mb-6 leading-8 -tracking-5%\" data-story-element=\"paragraph\" data-testid=\"paragraph-component\">“We do not believe this quarter’s profit levels are sustainable and expect fluctuations in profits in future quarters,” said co-CEO Zhao.\r</p><p class=\"mb-4 md:mb-6 leading-8 -tracking-5%\" data-story-element=\"paragraph\" data-testid=\"paragraph-component\">Contributing to the margin squeeze in the current quarter will be difficulties maintaining e-commerce revenues from the quarter to the end of June, which included a boost from China’s mid-year ‘618’ shopping festival.\r</p><p class=\"mb-4 md:mb-6 leading-8 -tracking-5%\" data-story-element=\"paragraph\" data-testid=\"paragraph-component\">Still, companies are betting the short-term pain will be worth the long-term gain, with Jiang Fan, chief executive at Alibaba’s e-commerce business group, projecting the instant retail segment could add one trillion yuan in annualised incremental gross merchandise volume for Alibaba over the next three years.\r</p><p class=\"mb-4 md:mb-6 leading-8 -tracking-5%\" data-story-element=\"paragraph\" data-testid=\"paragraph-component\">Key metrics to watch in the second half include those showing instant retail users migrating to core e-commerce platforms. JD.com’s quarterly active customers rose more than 40 per cent year on year in Q2, while Alibaba’s Taobao app saw monthly active users jump 25 per cent in the first three weeks of August, helped by food-delivery-user conversion.</p><p class=\"mb-4 md:mb-6 leading-8 -tracking-5%\" data-story-element=\"paragraph\" data-testid=\"paragraph-component\">While the companies seem ready to dig in for a long-term battle, there is also a chance these price wars might be halted by external powers.\r</p><p class=\"mb-4 md:mb-6 leading-8 -tracking-5%\" data-story-element=\"paragraph\" data-testid=\"paragraph-component\">Regulators have repeatedly warned platforms against a “race to the bottom” price competition, leading Meituan, Alibaba and JD.com to release statements in July pledging to curb price wars.\r</p><p class=\"mb-4 md:mb-6 leading-8 -tracking-5%\" data-story-element=\"paragraph\" data-testid=\"paragraph-component\">“We expect the companies’ stated commitments to the government’s anti-involution measures to gradually rationalise competitive dynamics,” said Ying Wang, senior analyst at Moody’s Ratings.
