His visit to Corpus Christi placed him near several competitive US House of Representatives districts where Hispanic voters, an important constituency for Republicans nationally, could determine the outcome in November’s midterm elections.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump, wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat, spoke to several hundred supporters at a waterfront rally in front of a ship he said had carried oil from the United States’ “new friend and partner” Venezuela.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump boasted about his single-minded determination to increase production of fossil fuels blamed for climate change, saying his policies had led to lower petrol prices and helped boost economic growth. Gas prices are about 4 per cent lower since January last year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We’re witnessing a historic American energy boom like we’ve never seen,” Trump said.

But first, Republicans in the deeply conservative state of Texas must settle on who they want to represent them in November’s general election.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Public opinion polls show Senator John Cornyn, in office since 2002, trailing two challengers - Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and US Representative Wesley Hunt - in Texas’ most cutthroat contest.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump told reporters on Friday that he had “pretty much” decided who to support but would not share the name.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">During the rally, Trump revelled in the three-way competition. “It’s going to be an interesting one,” Trump said, taking time to shout out each candidate in attendance.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As he has done several times before, Trump also raised the prospect of seeking an unconstitutional third term as president.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>Can forced restricting rescue Republicans?</strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">At the president’s urging last year, Texas Republicans launched a redistricting fight aimed at improving the party’s prospects in US House races.

This has led him to announce plans to put up his agency for sale. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While Wasserman remains in charge of the organising committee of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, there are widespread calls for him to step down. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Deutsche Bank</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Germany’s largest lender banked Epstein from 2013 to 2018 and processed hundreds of transactions for him.

Net sales edged up to US$3.68 million from US$3.62 million in 2024.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Founded by Trump and known for its Truth Social platform aimed at conservative audiences, TMTG has faced challenges scaling its media business amid competition from larger social networks and uneven user growth.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It is now seeking to reposition itself beyond its core Truth Social platform and tap investor interest in emerging energy technologies.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">TMTG said no definitive agreement has been reached on the spin-off and discussions are ongoing. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In December, TMTG agreed to merge with TAE in an all-stock deal valued at more than US$6 billion, marking a pivot toward fusion energy and the creation of a publicly traded company focused on developing utility-scale power plants to help meet rising electricity demand, including from AI data centres.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">TAE Technologies is a California-based private company developing advanced nuclear fusion technology that has raised more than US$1 billion from investors, including Alphabet’s Google and Chevron.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The startup focuses on a form of fusion designed to produce electricity without releasing large amounts of neutron radiation, reducing radioactive waste. REUTERS</p></div>",

If Anthropic does not help with the transition, Trump said, he would use “the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Spokespeople for Anthropic, which won up to US$200 million from the Pentagon in a contract last year, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The planned designation as a supply-chain risk, announced by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, means that contractors could be barred from deploying Anthropic’s AI as part of work for the Pentagon. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The defence industrial base includes tens of thousands of contractors, including major public companies. The designation is typically reserved for suppliers from adversary nations. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Such action was taken to remove Chinese tech giant Huawei from the Pentagon’s supply chains: Starting in 2017, the US restricted Defense Department use of Huawei equipment, prohibited federal agencies from purchasing its technology, and halted federal grant and loan funds for Huawei equipment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Anthropic could launch a court challenge to the designation, which poses an existential threat to its business with the government and may harm its private-sector relationships, according to Franklin Turner, an attorney who specialises in government contracts.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Blacklisting Anthropic is the contractual equivalent of nuclear war,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>Weapons, surveillance concerns</strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Pentagon had set a Friday deadline to resolve an escalating feud with San Francisco-based Anthropic over how the military could use AI at war. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">AI leader Anthropic has raced to win fierce competition to sell novel technology to businesses and government, particularly for national security, ahead of a widely expected initial public offering. The company has said it has not finalised an IPO decision.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">At the same time, the battle over technological guardrails had raised concerns that the Defense Department would follow US law but few other constraints when deploying AI for national-security missions, regardless of safety or ethics terms required by the technology’s developers.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Anthropic had sought guarantees that its AI would not be used for fully autonomous weapons or for mass domestic surveillance - applications in which the Pentagon has said it had no interest.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Anthropic was the first frontier AI lab to put its models on classified networks via cloud provider Amazon.com and the first to build customised models for national security customers, the startup has said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its product Claude is in use across the intelligence community and armed services.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">US Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat and vice-chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, criticised the action taken by Trump, a Republican.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The president’s directive to halt the use of a leading American AI company across the federal government, combined with inflammatory rhetoric attacking that company, raises serious concerns about whether national security decisions are being driven by careful analysis or political considerations.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Tech companies and the Pentagon have repeatedly locked horns since at least 2018, when employees at Alphabet’s Google protested against the Pentagon’s use of the company’s AI to analyse drone footage. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A rapprochement ensued with companies including Amazon and Microsoft jousting for defence business, while several big-tech CEOs pledged cooperation last year with the Trump administration.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But theoretical “killer robots” have remained a concern held by human-rights and technology activists. At the same time, Ukraine and Gaza have become theatres for increasingly automated systems on the battlefield. REUTERS</p></div>",

US West Texas Intermediate crude finished at US$67.02 a barrel, up $1.81, or 2.78 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The two sides agreed to extend indirect negotiations into next week but traders grew skeptical that an agreement between US President Donald Trump’s administration and Iran was possible.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The likelihood Iran is going to agree to what the Trump administration wants doesn’t seem possible,” said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures Group. “There’s got to be an endgame to this and the market seems to think that’s where we are headed.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>Oil benchmarks on track for weekly gains</strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Brent and WTI benchmarks were trading at their highest since July and August, respectively, and were poised to register weekly gains well above 1 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Uncertainty prevails, fear is pushing prices higher today,” said Tamas Varga, an oil analyst at brokerage PVM. “It is completely driven by the outcome of the Iranian nuclear talks and possible military action the US might take against Iran.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The United States and Iran held indirect talks in Geneva on Thursday after Trump ordered a military buildup in the region.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Oil prices gained more than a dollar a barrel during the talks, on media reports indicating that discussions had stalled over US insistence on zero enrichment of uranium by Iran. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, prices eased after the Omani mediator said the two sides had made progress. They plan to resume negotiations with technical-level discussions scheduled next week in Vienna, Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi said on X.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We think the latest round of talks offers some hope on chances of a peaceful resolution, but military strikes are in no way out of the equation,” said DBS analyst Suvro Sarkar. Trump said on Feb 19 that Iran must make a deal over its nuclear programme within 10 to 15 days or “really bad things” will happen.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Geopolitical risk premiums of US$8 to US$10 a barrel have been built into oil prices on fears that a conflict will disrupt Middle East supply through the Strait of Hormuz, where about 20 per cent of global oil supply passes, Sarkar said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">To cushion the impact from a possible strike, UAE oil producer Abu Dhabi is set to export more of its flagship Murban crude in April, two trade sources said on Friday. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Earlier this week, other sources said Saudi Arabia would also increase oil production. Additionally, Saudi Arabia may raise its April crude price to Asia for the first time in five months due to higher demand from India to replace Russian supplies, potentially raising it by about US$1 a barrel. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Producer group Opec+, meanwhile, is likely to consider raising oil output by 137,000 barrels per day for April at its March 1 meeting, sources said, after suspending production increases in the first quarter.
