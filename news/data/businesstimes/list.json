The lower DPU came on the back of lower distributable income, with the amount to be distributed to unitholders falling 74.5 per cent year-on-year to S$326,000.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Reit reported a decline in revenue in the second half of 2025, amounting to S$27 million – down 8.8 per cent. Lower property operating expenses during the period, down 11.4 per cent to S$13 million, partially offset this, but NPI still experienced a year-on-year decrease of 6.2 per cent to S$14 million from S$15 million in H2 FY2024.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Reit’s finance costs fell 14.8 per cent to S$7.9 million in H2 FY2025, from S$9.3 million in the same period a year earlier, mainly due to lower interest expenses on floating rate loans and the repayment of loan principal.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the full year, the income to be distributed to unitholders fell 42.8 per cent to S$1.5 million, while DPU slipped to S$0.0029 from S$0.0050 in FY2024.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The manager attributed the weaker distribution mainly to one-time expenses incurred during the syndication loan roll-over in March 2025.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the full year, revenue fell 9.6 per cent to S$55.1 million, while NPI slipped 11.6 per cent to S$29 million. Finance costs were down 16.7 per cent in FY2025, falling to S$16.1 million from S$19.3 million in FY2024. The total loss for the year after taxation attributable to unitholders was S$1.8 million, an improvement from the S$2.3 million loss reported in FY2024.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Chan Iz-Lynn, chief executive officer of the manager, noted that the manager remains focused on maintaining portfolio stability. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The manager will continue to execute its strategy of proactive asset management, prudent capital management and sustainable value creation for unitholders,” she said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The portfolio occupancy rate stood at 93.4 per cent as at Dec 31, 2025, lower than 95.8 per cent a year earlier.

This decrease was primarily because the group and the Reit successfully rolled over their offshore secured borrowing facilities of S$252 million. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The new facilities will mature in March 2028 and March 2030, successfully moving these obligations from current to non-current liabilities.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Net asset value per unit fell to S$0.68 as at December 2025, from S$0.72 a year earlier.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Units of BHG Retail Reit rose 1.1 per cent to close S$0.005 at S$0.445.</p></div>",

This brought its FY2025 earnings to 8.6 billion yuan, 30.2 per cent higher than the previous year’s 6.6 billion yuan. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its revenue rose 15.8 per cent on the year to 15.6 billion yuan for the half-year, and climbed 7.4 per cent to 28.5 billion yuan for the full-year. The topline growth was fuelled by the progressive construction of vessels secured at higher newbuild prices. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CGSI in a Friday report maintained its “add” call for Yangzijiang Shipbuilding, citing the group’s earnings growth – backed by a US$22.4 billion orderbook – and an attractive nine times forward price-to-earnings ratio.<strong> </strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The brokerage raised its target price for the counter from S$4.51 to S$4.95, a premium of 14.1 per cent above the stock’s Friday closing price.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CGSI analyst Lim Siew Khee noted that the shipbuilder’s final dividend of S$0.20 per share for FY2025, an increase from S$0.12 per share in FY2024, implies a 50 per cent payout ratio which is a “positive surprise”. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Similarly, DBS said on Thursday that it would likely maintain its “buy” call on the counter, with its S$3.80 target price under review. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">DBS analyst Ho Pei Hwa noted that the stock’s FY2025 net profit beat consensus by 3 to 4 per cent, and that the roughly US$290 million worth of new orders secured by the group in December brings its full-year order wins to around US$2.5 billion. </p></div>",

This was primarily due to weaker healthcare sales, as consumer confidence softened amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Conversely, the company recorded lower expenses during the period. The cost of sales fell 18.9 per cent to S$46.3 million, in line with the lower revenue. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Distribution and marketing expenses shrank by 40.3 per cent to S$15.4 million, mainly driven by reduced activities for the healthcare segment. Finance expenses also dropped by 29.1 per cent, largely due to lower borrowing rates.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As a result of these factors, Haw Par’s gross margin remained stable at 55.3 per cent in the second half of 2025, sitting slightly above the 55 per cent margin in the corresponding period of the preceding year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the full year, Haw Par’s profit rose 16.3 per cent to S$265.5 million. This bottom-line growth occurred despite a 6.1 per cent decrease in full-year revenue to S$230 million, which was dragged down by the drop in demand for healthcare in the second half of the year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its healthcare segment revenue contracted 6.9 per cent to S$210.4 million. Haw Par attributed this drop primarily to lower sales in Asia, noting that consumers have become increasingly cautious in their spending amid weaker sentiment in certain markets. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, tighter cost management on operating expenses helped improve the operating margin. Consequently, the healthcare segment’s operating profit grew by 7.2 per cent to S$67.1 million in 2025.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Revenue from its other segments, which comprise Leisure and Property, improved by 4 per cent to S$19.6 million. This growth was supported by better performance at Underwater World Pattaya, which welcomed more visitors during the year; the group’s Singapore investment properties enjoyed improved average occupancy. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The higher revenue translated into a 3.7 per cent increase in operating profit for these segments, rising to S$10.6 million.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Haw Par expects global economic growth to remain uneven, and to slow down even further if geopolitical tensions escalate. The company stated that this uncertainty “may dampen consumer confidence and discretionary spending, potentially affecting demand for the group’s products and services”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Shares of Haw Par Group rose 1.9 per cent to close S$0.31 higher at S$16.70, before the results were announced.</p></div>",

The company paid the government RM32 billion in dividends last year. Muhammad Taufik said Petronas expects to pay RM20 billion this year – the lowest since 2017 – reflecting a need for the firm to ensure sufficient cash flow.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“(The dividend) is always going to be governed by our affordability,” he said. Petronas last year embarked on a “right-sizing” exercise, aiming to cut about 5,000 employees to ensure its long-term survival. Muhammad Taufik said on Friday the process was expected to conclude by August.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Crude oil prices were expected to trade rangebound between US$65-US$70 per barrel over the next five years, with the firm allocating RM2 billion annually for exploration in the same period, Petronas said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Capital investments slipped to RM41.6 billion in 2025 compared with RM54.2 billion in 2024, the company said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Petronas’ upstream business saw a decline in post-tax profit to RM26.2 billion in 2025. Its gas and maritime business saw profit rise to RM20.9 billion, while its downstream segment posted a loss after tax of RM1.9 billion. Petronas reported a 2.2 per cent increase in carbon emissions in 2025 to 56.95 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, attributed mainly to the transfer of operations for two production sharing contracts.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The firm also reported a 72 per cent reduction in methane emissions, exceeding its target of 50 per cent.

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[SEOUL] Global investors offloaded a record amount of South Korean equities on Friday (Feb 27), in a sign of profit taking after the equity benchmark rallied nearly 50 per cent this year. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Foreign funds sold a net 6.8 trillion won (S$6 billion) worth of Kospi stocks during the regular session, according to data by the Korea Exchange. The Kospi Index fell 1 per cent to snap a six-day winning streak. Local institutions and retail investors, meanwhile, were net buyers. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Korean stocks have been on a tear, trouncing other markets as the benchmark soared 170 per cent since an April low. Home to Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, the country has been a direct beneficiary of the memory boom, sidestepping turbulence even as the so-called “AI scare trade” rattled investors elsewhere. Yet the relentless rally driven by a handful of stocks has started to look precarious to some.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“A large sell number tells you sentiment is being reset and positioning is being cleaned up,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets. “Memory upcycle has been a clear narrative, so when volatility rises, the quickest move is to reduce exposure in crowded trades. That can create big flow prints even if fundamentals are intact.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The gauge soared past the 6,000 threshold this week, just a month after surpassing President Lee Jae-myung’s political goal of 5,000. The country’s market valuation even exceeded that of European heavyweights Germany and France. The frenzy to gain exposure to Korean names caused abnormal moves and volumes in exchange-traded funds listed overseas.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Despite the massive selling by foreigners, few see this as a bearish turning point. Kospi still trades at 10.4 times forward earnings estimates, compared to S&amp;P 500’s 21.3 and MSCI Asia-Pacific at 15.3. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The corporate governance reform is also making headway. The parliament this week approved a long-debated legal revision requiring companies to cancel treasury shares. A day later, the president urged a revamp in inheritance tax rules to keep boosting capital markets. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A month-end rebalancing of benchmarks and profit-taking after the breakneck rally triggered the pullback, said Kim Namho, a fund manager at Timefolio Investment Management in Seoul. “Even so, consensus holds that Korean equities remain undervalued, with ample upside after this pause.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Yuanta Securities said MSCI’s rebalancing scheduled for Friday would trigger weight adjustments in funds such as the US-listed iShares MSCI South Korea ETF after Samsung Electronics’ weight exceeded the 25 per cent cap set by regulators. Samsung shares have surged 80 per cent so far this year.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Retail participation is also accelerating, suggesting further upside potential. Investor deposits at the nation’s brokerages – cash available for stock purchases – rose to a new all-time high of 119.5 trillion won, according to Korea Financial Investment Association data. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“There will be opportunities in South Korea amidst any extended sell-off, and we’ll be there as long-term investors,” said Vikas Pershad, an Asian equities portfolio manager at M&amp;G Investments.
