Another S$430 million was placed in GIP-select funds investing in Singapore-based companies.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Qualified investors may apply for the GIP through three options: investing at least S$10 million in a Singapore-based business; placing at least S$25 million in a GIP-select fund; or establishing a single family office with at least S$200 million in assets under management, of which at least S$50 million must be deployed in Economic Development Board (EDB)-specified investments.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">About half of the investors invested directly in Singapore-based businesses, 40 per cent placed money in GIP-select funds, and the remaining 10 per cent set up single family offices.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“EDB works with the GIP recipients to ensure that they continue to fulfil the government’s specified economic and residency commitments during their stay,” said Gan, in response to questions from Workers’ Party MP Fadli Fawzi.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Qualified investors are required to submit evidence of the Singapore-based companies that they have invested in.

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[LONDON] Vegetarian diets are linked with a lower risk of several cancers, including pancreatic, breast and prostate, according to a study that found no similar benefit – and even a higher chance of colon cancer – among vegans.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Researchers found people on vegetarian diets had a lower risk of five cancers compared with their meat-eating counterparts, though vegetarians had nearly double the risk of a cancer in the oesophagus called squamous cell carcinoma. The pioneering study, published on Friday (Feb 27) in the <em>British Journal of Cancer</em>, looked at pooled data from more than 1.8 million people across three continents.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The findings come at a time of renewed focus on diet after the US President Donald Trump’s administration updated US nutrition guidelines with an emphasis on animal-based protein. Concerns around the impact of ultra-processed foods, which the study did not look at, are also growing in the US and globally.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Though the study did not probe the cause of a higher or lower risk of certain cancers, researchers hypothesised that diets higher in fruit, vegetables, fibre and without processed meat could lower risks. The lack of meat is likely to be the reason for the different risk, according to Tim Key, emeritus professor of epidemiology at Oxford Population Health and co-investigator of the study.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Perhaps the biggest surprise was the finding for vegans. Red meat intake has long been associated with bowel cancer, yet vegans – who eat no meat or dairy – had a higher risk of this cancer in the study.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That may have been because many of the meat eaters in the study only ate moderate amounts of processed meat, according to the researchers. There were also relatively few overall cases of colon cancer among the vegans.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, the researchers said dairy might hold the key. “We are postulating that it could be because vegans have no dairy intake,” said Yashvee Dunneram, first author of the study. “Their calcium intake are really low in this consortium.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The reduction in key vitamins and minerals might also be in play when it comes to the significantly higher risk among vegetarians of squamous cell carcinoma. “It may be related with a low intake of riboflavin,” said Aurora Perez Cornago, principal investigator of the study, while stressing that this was just a hypothesis. Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is found in foods such as beef liver, eggs, fortified cereals, and milk.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Vegetarians in the study did have a lower risk of pancreatic, breast, prostate, kidney and multiple myeloma. One possible factor is weight. The vegetarians in the study had a lower body mass index, and while the researchers adjusted for this in the results, they hypothesised that this weight difference could still be behind the lower risk of breast cancer, for example.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">People on pescatarian diets, meaning they eat seafood and dairy but do not eat meat, also showed a lower risk of colon, breast and kidney cancer in the study.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One thing missing from the study was a comparison to a diet based on guidelines from the UK’s National Health Service, where meat and fish are consumed but only in moderation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That provides important nutrients and may be the optimum diet for reducing the risk of diet-associated cancer, according to Jules Griffin, director of the Rowett Institute at the University of Aberdeen, who was not involved in the study.

It’s a very long, considered process, carefully chosen.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We have a six-year agreement with StarHub, one of the two providers out there. “So from next season onwards, Premier League Plus – rather than Premflix – finally, it’s going to happen.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">StarHub holds the Premier League rights in Singapore from 2022 to 2028, showing all 380 matches per season.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Reporting on the development,<em> The Athletic </em>of <em>The New York Times</em> noted that the move means that the EPL has finally decided to cut out the middleman by launching its own direct-to-consumer streaming channel in Singapore – a move that may signal the end of a decades-old broadcasting model.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In its report, Masters was quoted as saying: “It will be a new app that you can download on your smart TV or laptop. You’ll be able to watch 380 games a season, with lots of shoulder content and a 24/7 dedicated channel.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Will it be replicable elsewhere? That’s what we are going to find out.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In 2020, the Premier League boss first revealed that the league was looking into plans to sell content via a direct streaming platform in a move that could see lower subscription costs for fans. This would eliminate the middleman and allow the league to provide content straight to viewers, rather than via rights sales to TV broadcasters.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Premier League Plus model could be similar to the National Basketball Association’s (NBA) subscription service, which offers annual and monthly plans for fans here to watch matches on the official app. <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/english-premier-league-set-to-launch-direct-to-consumer-streaming-in-singapore?ref=top-stories\" target=\"_blank\">THE STRAITS TIMES</a></p></div>",
