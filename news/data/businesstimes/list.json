But “the persistent underlying inflation argues against the ECB further lowering its key interest rates”, he added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The ECB expects inflation to dip below 2 per cent next year, followed by a re-acceleration to approach the target in 2027. Fresh quarterly forecasts in December will feature 2028 for the first time, potentially reigniting discussions on whether further monetary easing is necessary. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For now, officials are signalling little reason to act. “From a monetary policy point of view, we are in a good place,” Lagarde reiterated.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Economic growth data in recent days supported that stance. Euro area output rose 0.2 per cent in the third quarter, more than analysts had predicted, in a sign of resilience to the trade disruptions unleashed by US President Donald Trump. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The economy was boosted in particular by France, where companies and households defied political turmoil over its budget. Germany and Italy stagnated, narrowly avoiding recessions.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The ECB warned that a stronger euro and the tariff fallout could still dampen inflation more than expected. On the other hand, prices could be boosted if trade disruptions cause supply chain snarls.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">An ECB document summarising its recent contacts with companies showed some manufacturers see downward pressure on prices – partly because US tariffs are causing more goods from elsewhere to be diverted to the currency bloc. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The impact on activity was also assessed as negative.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In the run-up to Thursday’s meeting, policymakers had offered varying assessments of such scenarios. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While some had emphasised the risks that could pull inflation lower, others had highlighted those that drive it in the other direction. BLOOMBERG</p></div>",

It represents a continuation of PIF’s efforts during the current five-year plan and marks an evolving focus on making Saudi companies more international, the people said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The strategy for portfolio companies has been agreed and is likely to be made public in the first quarter of next year, the people said, declining to be identified as the information is private. The PIF declined to comment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The fund is still working out how exactly it will approach international investments, the people said. After the review is complete, allocations to global deals may increase slightly as portfolio companies are expected to become more active as they look to expand overseas, they added. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Since its inception, the PIF has established about 100 companies in sectors ranging from tourism to AI. The goal is to focus on growing firms in six key areas outlined this week by governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan, in what he called a “sneak peek” of the investment strategy.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The plan will lean on consolidation to create more companies that are able to raise their own financing and draw in foreign investment, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The PIF has already been encouraging portfolio companies to tap financing independently, leveraging their balance sheets and growth plans, Bloomberg News has reported. It has also listed some of these entities on the local bourse.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Foreign direct investment is another key priority for the kingdom, which drew about US$32 billion of FDI in 2024, and the fund’s move would support Riyadh’s goal of attracting US$100 billion annually by 2030.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The PIF is the main entity tasked with driving Crown Prince Mohammed  Salman’s Vision 2030 programme, which includes building dozens of mega projects geared toward diversifying the economy away from crude oil. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That mission is becoming more challenging in recent years, with the government facing a fiscal squeeze that has limited its ability to invest more in the economy. In one sign of the challenges of diversification, the PIF cut the value of major projects on its books, including Neom, by US$8 billion last year. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, in his opening speech at Riyadh’s annual Future Investment Initiative, Al-Rumayyan lauded progress made on Vision 2030. “You can see the results everywhere – new cities, new industries, new ecosystems and supply chains,” he said. He later singled out Neom as one of the six areas of focus for the 2026-2030 investment roadmap, though didn’t offer further details. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The wealth fund is currently reviewing the overall plan for Neom and there’s yet to be clarity on the exact path forward for projects there, including The Line, according to people familiar with matter. Other projects in the crown prince’s plan, including the tourism resorts of Red Sea Global and the entertainment city of Qiddiya, are expected to have more priority going forward, the people said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Overall, the PIF deployed nearly US$57 billion across priority sectors last year and international investments made up 17% of its portfolio. It plans to boost total annual deployment to US$70 billion a year after 2025, and its investments in absolute dollar terms will continue to rise abroad even as it focuses at home.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its recent role in what stands to be the biggest leveraged buyout in history underscores that those deals abroad may just now be a bit more strategic. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The US$55 billion deal for Electronic Arts would boost investment in the US as part of a pledge made by the Saudi crown prince to US President Donald Trump, while also driving ambitions to create a home-grown gaming industry.

Chevron completed the acquisition of Hess in July, which gave the company access to a prolific oilfield in Guyana operated by larger rival Exxon Mobil. The deal puts Chevron in a better position to weather oil price volatility with a source of profitable production, investors have said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note that Chevron’s earnings report was strong, with every business and region beating market expectations.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We expect the market to take this positively, as it highlights continued momentum in its base business, as well as growth coming through from the newly acquired barrels, all of which are contributing to cash generation,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Chevron will host an investor day on Nov 12 to provide updated financial guidance to shareholders following the Hess deal. The new combined company produced 4.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the third quarter, a record high and up from Chevron’s standalone production of 3.4 million boepd in the same quarter last year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The results were also buoyed by lower costs, as Chevron is on pace to reach US$2 billion to US$3 billion in cost reductions next year, Bonner said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Those are the catalysts that are coming together to give us this high confidence in free cash flow growth with lower execution risks, given that all these major milestones are behind us,” she said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Upstream earnings totalled US$3.3 billion, a 28 per cent decline from the same period last year due to lower oil prices. Chevron’s profit from the downstream business jumped 91 per cent over the same time frame to US$1.1 billion, driven by higher refining margins and lower operating expenses in the US.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Chevron paid US$3.4 billion in dividends and bought back US$2.6 billion worth of shares during the quarter. The company said capital expenditure, which totalled US$4.4 billion in the third quarter, rose from the same period last year because of spending on legacy Hess assets. Benchmark Brent crude prices averaged US$68.17 over the third quarter, down about 13 per cent from the same period last year and up 2 per cent from the second quarter. The Opec+ group of oil producers increased its output throughout the year, raising fears about oversupply and hampering crude prices.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Average US natural gas prices during the quarter rose about 38 per cent compared with the year-ago quarter.

Affected employees earlier told <em>The Business Times </em>that they were informed of the closure via WhatsApp at 8 pm on Wednesday, with a termination letter accompanying the message. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">No further details were provided by Twelve Cupcakes on the matter. The liquidator, AAG Corporate Advisory, said it is unable to provide details on operations, finances or the reasons for the liquidation before obtaining the relevant information, in response to BT queries on Thursday.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One of Twelve Cupcakes’ outlet managers told BT outside the MOM Services Centre on Friday that the decision to shutter the company came to its staff with zero warning. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We did not know anything (about this) in advance. There was no notice period at all,” he said. “With so many bills to pay, starting with our rent – what are we going to do now?” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He added that the main concern among employees now is the salaries they are owed for October, on top of compensation for the sudden termination of employment, especially since the 30-day notice period was not abided by. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Others BT spoke to on Friday said this is particularly pressing as many affected have rent due at the end of the month. Most said they are expected to foot their rent by Friday or Saturday – or risk facing eviction or incurring late charges.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Those who are foreign workers also said they have debts to repay back home; others have to pay tuition fees for their children.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Some workers noted that Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions were not credited to their accounts for October. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Specific representatives of the counter staff group were addressed by MOM staff in closed-door meetings. These workers told BT after these meetings that they were informed that local unions would handle all compensation-related matters. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">They added that a separate meeting with union members has been set up for next week, though a fixed date and time have yet to be confirmed. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As for S-Pass holders, no extension will be given, which means such affected workers will have 30 days to find a new job in Singapore, or they will have to return to their home country. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Affected workers who gathered at the MOM Service Centre on Friday comprised those on S-Passes, Work Permits and Long-term Visit Passes, as well as Singapore citizens. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We understand that the liquidation will take some time, but we do (at the very least) have to receive our salaries for the month of October today so we can continue covering our basic expenses in Singapore, and to feed our families,” one told BT. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the time being, the group of counter staff are putting together a page to raise donations.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We are truly hoping for the best by next week – and we hope the government can help us in our current situation,” the outlet manager said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A representative from home-grown eatery The Soup Spoon reached out to BT on Friday, offering to assist affected Twelve Cupcakes workers with available job opportunities. The business has store openings lined up starting from next week, with several full-time and part-time positions to fill.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Food, Drinks and Allied Workers Union (FDAWU) on Thursday <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/unacceptable-and-unfair-union-raps-twelve-cupcakes-abrupt-closure-axing-80-workers\" target=\"_blank\">criticised the cupcake’s business’ abrupt closure as “unacceptable and unfair”</a>, strongly objecting to the business owner’s lack of prior consultation and advance notice. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">FDAWU said it will be assisting members and workers with salary-related claims and job-assistance support, as well as connecting them to the labour movement’s network, such as NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">MOM issued a joint statement with CPF Board (CPFB) on Friday evening, noting that the actions of Twelve Cupcakes in this case were “irresponsible” and not aligned with the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Despite being a unionised company under the FDAWU, Twelve Cupcakes did not engage the union early, before affected employees were notified,” they explained. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Taskforce for Responsible Retrenchment and Employment Facilitation, which comprises MOM, Workforce Singapore, the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), and NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute (e2i), is working closely with Twelve Cupcakes and the FDAWU to support the affected employees, said MOM and CPFB. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This will include working with Twelve Cupcakes to provide job matching support and career coaching for these employees.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management will also assist employees of Twelve Cupcakes who need to file a Proof of Debt for their salary and other employment claims with the liquidator. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CPFB, in addition, will be filing a Proof of Debt with the liquidator to recover the outstanding CPF contributions for September and October this year. MOM also stated that it is investigating the company’s non-payment of salaries and other potential breaches of the Employment Act. </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[SINGAPORE] Chinese President Xi Jinping warned against “breaking supply chains”, in his first public remarks after a landmark meeting with US President Donald Trump that secured a one-year truce in the world’s biggest trade fight.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Countries should “jointly maintain stable and smooth industrial and supply chains”, Xi said during a speech on Friday (Oct 31) at the leaders’ summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) grouping in Gyeongju, South Korea. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We must adhere to the principle of joining hands rather than letting go, and extending rather than breaking supply chains,” he said, while calling on those gathered to practise “genuine multilateralism”. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Xi’s appeal was delivered to an audience featuring US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has spearheaded Trump’s trade negotiations this year, along with a host of world leaders grappling with America’s highest tariffs since the 1930s. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The more turbulent the times, the more we must work together,” said Xi.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">His remarks came a day after he sealed an agreement with Trump that saw America roll back some tariffs and export controls and Beijing commit to buying US soybeans and pause fresh rare earth curbs. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump described their sitdown at an air base in Busan as “amazing”, while Xi said that dialogue is always better than confrontation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Adding to that flurry of diplomacy, defence chiefs from the world’s largest economies held their first in-person talks on Friday morning, in another sign of stabilising ties. US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth sat down with Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun at a gathering in Kuala Lumpur.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The trade truce is poised to resolve – at least for now – months of trade brinkmanship in which the US and China threatened a series of levies and export controls on their products that had the potential to disrupt global supply chains and hurt the world economy. Still, it fell short of a comprehensive agreement to address issues at the heart of US-China economic competition. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Both countries appear determined on further decoupling during the one-year stopgap. Trump used his swing through Asia to bolster relations with key allies such as Japan and South Korea and win investments from them in ship-building and rare earths – areas that would put him in a stronger position to negotiate with Xi a year from now. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Xi touted the attractiveness of China’s economy to the Apec ensemble, trumpeting some US$700 billion in foreign investment he said that his nation had attracted over the past half decade. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While exports to nations outside the US have surged this year, a slump in Chinese factory activity in October extended to its longest decline in nearly a decade, raising questions around the sustainability of that trend.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Xi also talked up his nation’s efforts to open its economy by removing barriers to foreign investment, widening a visa-free programme and opening 22 pilot free-trade zones. Those claims stand in contrast to complaints from leaders in the European Union, for example, who have criticised Beijing for offering preferential treatment to its own companies.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China’s decision to weaponise its rare earth supply chain that is critical to manufacturing everything from cars to chips, has also raised tensions with trading partners beyond the US. That fallout has led to a broad push for countries to reduce their dependency on the Asian nation for such magnets.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China is similarly moving to become less dependent on the US for core technology. The Communist Party recently unveiled a blueprint for its five-year plan focused primarily on achieving key tech breakthroughs, particularly in high-end chips, as China moves to create supply chains independent of the US. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China is set to host the Apec meetings next year.
