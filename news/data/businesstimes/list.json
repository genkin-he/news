Analysts from Barclays also said prices could rise to US$100.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Croft said the market impact from any large Opec output increase will be limited due to a lack of actual production capabilities outside Saudi Arabia.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The meeting on Sunday will start at 1100 GMT and will involve only eight members of Opec+ – Saudi Arabia, Russia, the UAE, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Iraq, Algeria and Oman. Opec+ groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies like Russia but most production changes in the past years have been done by the eight members.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The eight members raised production quotas by about 2.9 million bpd from April through December 2025, roughly 3 per cent of global demand, before pausing increases for January to March 2026 due to seasonal weakness.

He has since expanded into new ventures such as vinegar-making and herb sales, as well as learnt skills such as sales strategies, marketing and money management.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">His income after joining PSC has surged to US$2,300 a month from US$62. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As his business grew, he employed four persons with disabilities (PWDs) and now supports local farmers by getting his supplies from them, as well as trains aspiring organic farmers.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Kuala Lumpur-based social enterprise focuses on beneficiaries with no or low income, and is on a mission to eradicate poverty around South-east Asia. It has already done so for nearly 115,000 families as at February. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Raymond Gabriel, co-founder and executive director of PSC, said: “Through an intervention that (takes) six months to a year, we build the capabilities of the people that we empower through entrepreneurship training, financial-literacy training and mentoring, to raise their incomes… and get them out of poverty.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He added that PSC has a “high” success rate: About 70 per cent of beneficiaries record an income increase of between 100 and 400 per cent in the short term. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We also look at how we have improved their access to education, utilities and healthcare, their confidence and knowledge improvement, and how they are helping their communities after they have come up. So it’s a pay-it-forward model.”</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Key programmes</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">More than 20 years ago, Gabriel volunteered as a social worker to help the homeless in KL. While there were many organisations running programmes to provide basic needs, he realised that it would be more effective to tackle the root problem of poverty.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In 2008, when PSC was established, it was involved in a programme with Microsoft and Up Foundation to help 120 YWCA beneficiaries in Malaysia. PSC taught them soft skills such as financial literacy and building confidence to complement their vocational training. Ultimately, 90 per cent of them landed a job afterwards, or started their own business.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“In rural areas of Malaysia, sometimes jobs are scarce, so it’s good for (them) to start their own business and empower the local community by giving them jobs as well,” Gabriel said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He started developing and testing PSC’s own programmes. It partners government ministries to source for beneficiaries.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">PSC also has a long-term partnership with Maybank. The Rise programme was piloted in 2014 and has since expanded to Singapore, Indonesia and other Asean markets. It is an entrepreneurship and financial-empowerment programme for disadvantaged communities – particularly for PWDs.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Just like PSC’s own programmes, Rise covers topics to help beneficiaries run a business, such as operations planning, and includes ongoing mentoring. As at end-2025, it had more than 51,000 participants.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">PSC’s standard entrepreneurship programme, which is free for beneficiaries, runs for three days and includes lessons in finance and money management. This is followed by six months of mentoring, where beneficiaries learn about digital marketing and customer service.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“They have to take action on the fourth day (after training)... We have a very rigorous profiling system to make sure that the people who join are serious about starting something,” Gabriel noted, adding that partners and government agencies fund the programmes as they “want to see economic uplift” within certain communities.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In addition, PSC runs programmes on financial education, employability and youth empowerment.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Expansion into Singapore, new programmes</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">PSC has branches in Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos, the Philippines and Indonesia, and expanded to Singapore in December 2024.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Gabriel said: “Singapore has good employment policies and there’re jobs for everyone, but not everyone is qualified or educated enough to get a high-paying job. Some people have an innate entrepreneurial spirit, and we can tap into that.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">There are three targeted beneficiary groups in Singapore: PWDs and people with mental health issues; people who want to supplement their income; and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">PSC currently partners social service agencies such as SG Enable and Touch Community Services to reach beneficiaries.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Gabriel added: “We have developed programmes for SMEs looking at going regional and how they can tap different markets, because we have so much experience working in Asean. There’s a lot that we can share with them to enable them to grow faster, from corporate structures to building local systems in place.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Earlier this year, PSC launched a tech entrepreneurship programme for those looking to build an online or app-based business.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In PSC’s pipeline is an environmental-focused programme to teach entrepreneurs about carbon reduction. </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[BARCELONA] Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company, is throwing its weight behind an effort to make sure the forthcoming 6G phone networks provide a strong platform for services and devices that take advantage of artificial intelligence. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nvidia is teaming up with a group of telecommunications companies including Nokia, SoftBank Group and T-Mobile US that will commit to building sixth-generation networks based on computers and software capable of using AI to help direct radio traffic safely and efficiently. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The change is necessary because of myriad devices that will be attached to networks in the future and their more complex requirements, Nvidia said on Sunday (Mar 1) in a statement timed for the opening of a telecom industry conference in Barcelona. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The current generation, 5G, was designed to connect people via voice and data and provide them with retrieved information. It isn’t capable of supporting the widespread use of AI, Nvidia said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The networks of today simply aren’t ready for the use cases of tomorrow,” said Ronnie Vasishta, who heads Nvidia’s telecommunications business and strategy. “In the AI era, everything changes. Networks will deliver intelligence, not just for humans on their phones, but for machines.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Telecommunications networks will require “hundreds of thousands of times” more efficiency because there isn’t enough radio spectrum to support the new uses, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The chipmaker, whose gear is at the centre of the AI explosion, is trying to carve out a new market and clear a potential roadblock. Nvidia already offers versions of its chips, computers and software for use in networks and hopes to expand that business. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">At the same time, the company needs AI to spread to more areas – in things termed physical AI, like robots and vehicles – to continue to fuel demand and pay for the data centres that are currently the biggest consumers of its technology. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Without wireless networks enabled for AI traffic, Nvidia’s vision of a world full of humanoid robots and self-driving cars might be slower to emerge. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Every decade or so the telecommunications business shifts to a new generation of wireless technology, the next “G.” In the run-up to setting standards that determine the parameters of new hardware and software, companies form alliances to steer the industry in a direction they believe will favour their products. That approach has a mixed record and has been undermined by competing efforts that have sometimes delayed new deployments or resulted in networks that are incompatible. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nvidia argues that new gear and software needs to be fundamentally open. Instead of locked-down devices with bespoke hardware, the radios that send and receive wireless traffic should be controlled by software that can be updated and runs on more general purpose computers. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The data traffic should be routed by AI software that’s capable of responding to rapidly changing patterns and priorities in a way that’s simply not currently possible, according to the chipmaker. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In such an environment, the telecommunications industry will be far more open to the emergence of new providers, including startups that might rapidly attain billion-US dollar valuations, Nvidia’s Vasishta said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This will be how a new telecom unicorn is born,” he said. There have been far too few new entrants into the industry over the last decade, he added. BLOOMBERG</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[BEIJING] China kicks off its most important annual political meeting next week, with investors seeking clarity on how Beijing intends to press ahead with its tech ambitions while reviving a fragile consumer economy.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">At the weeklong gathering of the National People’s Congress starting Mar 5, officials are expected to set a 2026 growth target of 4.5 to 5 per cent, down from around 5 per cent in recent years – a sign leaders may tolerate slower expansion as a property slump and deflation continue.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The meeting takes on added importance as policymakers will outline priorities tied to a new five-year plan. Investors will look for details on how Beijing intends to support innovation and rekindle momentum in Chinese stocks, which surged last year thanks to AI but have been subdued this year. They will also be seeking concrete measures to boost domestic demand – an oft-repeated goal that’s light on specifics so far. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The policy meeting “could provide a fresh catalyst for stocks, which have been lacklustre this year amid a lack of policy support,” said Marvin Chen, a strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. He noted that cyclical and property stocks have historically delivered the strongest gains in the month following the event.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Here are the key areas traders and analysts are watching ahead of the meeting:</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Technology</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">From DeepSeek in early 2025 to a surge in robotics shares, tech stocks have powered China’s market rebound. Investors are now seeking reassurance that the rally still has further to run.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">An AI “scare trade” has rattled tech shares globally, triggered by potential disruptions to the economy. In China, the pressure has fallen on traditional Internet giants, with money moving out of Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings into smaller firms seen as more direct AI beneficiaries like MiniMax Group and Knowledge Atlas Technology.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Technology will remain a key focus for capital allocation,” according to a note by China International Capital Corp. Beyond established AI supply-chain leaders, the analysts see potential winners in cloud computing, smart driving and quantum technology.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Consumption</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Reviving domestic demand has been a consistent theme in recent high-level policy meetings. The shift comes as more countries push back against China’s cheap exports, raising the pressure on Beijing to rely less on external demand.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We see meaningful likelihood of enhanced consumption support that goes beyond consumer durables,” said Homin Lee, a senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier in Singapore.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Investors rotated into consumer sectors earlier this year amid concerns about stretched tech valuations, but the rebound proved short-lived in the absence of a sustained pickup in consumer demand and prices. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The CSI 300 Consumer Discretionary Index and CSI 300 Consumer Staples Index both rank among the least favoured sub-sector gauges in China this year.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">‘Anti-involution’</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China launched the “anti-involution” campaign in 2025 to curb cut-throat competition marked by overcapacity and price wars. The government pushed industries such as solar and electric vehicles to shift their focus towards quality and innovation, rather than mere volume.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Early signs show the drive is gaining traction. Prices in parts of the solar and materials supply chains have rebounded, and shares of photovoltaic companies have climbed to near a two-year high.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While excess capacity remains an issue, UBS Group says the campaign could help steer the economy towards a reflationary environment in 2026. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, investors will be weighing policymakers’ resolve to keep curbing excess capacity while balancing growth and employment pressures.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Property</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A multiyear property slump has been a major drag on China’s economy, and reversing that would require much stronger policy intervention. Officials will likely reaffirm support for a new development model centreed on higher-quality housing and market stabilisation, with further easing likely left to local governments, according to Citigroup Inc.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Shanghai recently eased homebuying rules, and Beijing and Shenzhen are expected to follow suit. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Morgan Stanley analysts including Stephen Cheung cautioned it may be too early to turn positive, flagging risks of policy disappointment at the NPC, more profit warnings and a renewed slide in home sales. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Bonds</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In the bond market, attention will be on the fiscal budget and how much supply pressure government issuance may create, especially at the long end. Beijing is expected to ramp up sales of ultra-long special sovereign bonds to support domestic demand and stabilise growth. Morgan Stanley estimates issuance could reach 1.5 trillion yuan (S$276.4 billion), up from 1.3 trillion yuan last year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China’s yield curve has already steepened on an accommodative monetary policy and a larger debt quota. The spread between 30- and 10-year government bond yields widened to more than 40 basis points at the end of 2025, from 24 basis points a year earlier, reflecting concerns about supply-demand imbalances in longer-dated debt.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Renminbi internationalisation</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Communist Party’s proposal for the next five-year plan through 2030 included a pledge to “push forward the internationalisation of the renminbi.” That’s a bolder stance compared with the previous plan, which called for advancing the goal in a “stable and prudent” manner.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Investors will look for signals on how China plans to capitalise on waning confidence in the US dollar and advance Xi’s ambition for a “powerful currency.” The onshore renminbi remains near a three-year high against the greenback, despite a modest pullback after the People’s Bank of China’s latest effort to cool the rally.

class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Several loud blasts were heard for a second day on Sunday in regional business hub Dubai and over Qatar’s capital of Doha, witnesses said, after Iran launched retaliatory strikes on the neighbouring Gulf states.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Puffs of white smoke from missile interceptions were glimpsed in the skies over Dubai, while billows of dark smoke rose over its port of Jebel Ali, one of the busiest in the Middle East.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Iran, which has said it would target US bases if attacked, hit a range of other targets, keeping the major oil-producing Gulf on edge.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Air raid sirens sounded

Videos posted on social media, which Reuters was unable to immediately verify, also showed celebrations in other locations.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The explosions during the strikes caused widespread panic across Iran. “We are scared, we are terrified.

This reduces their total interest to 81.53 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The sale attracted strong participation from long-only institutional investors, and was handled by OCBC as placement agent.

This was driven by strong growth across its pawnbroking, jewellery retail and money-lending businesses. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Reflecting on the improved earnings, the board proposed a total dividend of S$0.0388 per share, a 44.8 per cent increase year on year, alongside a strengthened balance sheet with net assets of S$611.8 million and a conservative 1.43 times debt-to-equity ratio.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The average daily turnover of the stock has grown from S$39,000 in 2024 to S$190,000 in 2025 to S$799,000 in Q1 2026 to Feb 25.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Despite more than S$17 million of net institutional outflows from Singapore-listed consumer cyclical stocks in January, Valuemax Group was one of three gold-linked financial retailers that bucked the trend, attracting a combined S$8.5 million of inflows.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">CapitaLand India Trust</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Feb 24, Clint announced a fully underwritten private placement that subsequently raised about S$150 million through a private placement of 124.2 million new units at S$1.208 each, which was around 2.6 times covered, reflecting strong institutional demand. The issue price represented a modest discount to market volume weighted average price, balancing investor appeal with capital discipline.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On an illustrative historical pro forma basis, the trustee-manager expects the placement to be distribution per unt (DPU)-accretive by 5.1 per cent and to reduce gearing to 36.8 per cent after deployment of proceeds, while also potentially improving trading liquidity through a larger unitholder base.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For FY2025 (ended Dec 31), Clint’s DPU increased 15 per cent from FY 2024, to S$0.0787, while H2 FY2025 DPU rose 22 per cent to S$0.0390, supported by improved operating performance and higher interest income from forward purchase assets under development. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The valuations as at Dec 31 reported a 19 per cent year-on-year increase in Clint’s portfolio property value to 266.4 billion rupees (S$3.8 billion) on a like-for-like basis, excluding the divestments of CyberVale, Chennai and CyberPearl, Hyderabad.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The management said disciplined capital recycling, a visible development pipeline and balance sheet optimisation position the trust to support steady and resilient growth into FY 2026 and beyond.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Marco Polo Marine</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Feb 24, Marco Polo Marine announced a proposed placement of up to 144.9 million new shares at S$0.145 apiece, raising up to about S$21 million in gross proceeds. With Maybank Securities as placement agent, the new shares represent about 3.9 per cent of existing issued share capital. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Net proceeds are intended to be used entirely for capex tied to business expansion, including but not limited to fleet expansion and renewal, and the placement also aims to broaden the shareholder base to potentially improve liquidity; it is offered to institutional and accredited investors and excludes directors and substantial shareholders.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Marco Polo Marine highlighted that the placement has a positive impact on net tangible assets (NTA) per share, as the new equity is being raised at a premium to existing net assets. With the S$0.145 placement price sitting well above the S$0.0636 NTA per share, the issuance lifts NTA per share to S$0.0664 cents on a pro forma basis. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As a result, the equity injection more than offsets dilution, lifting net tangible assets per share even as earnings are diluted, and strengthening the balance sheet ahead of planned fleet expansion. As at Sep 30, the group was already in a net cash position of S$9.3 million, providing balance-sheet flexibility even before the placement.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Feb 16, Marco Polo Marine reported a strong start to its FY2026 (ended Dec 31), with Q1 FY2026 revenue rising 27 per cent, from Q1 FY2025, to S$32.8 million. This was primarily driven by a sharp expansion in its ship chartering operations following recent fleet additions. Gross profit for the quarter increased 32 per cent to S$14 million, with gross margin improving by two percentage points to 43 per cent. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The group noted that this reflected a more favourable revenue mix with a higher contribution from chartering, which carries structurally higher margins than shipyard activities. Moreover, the ship chartering segment drove Q1 FY2026 growth, with revenue rising 53 per cent year on year to S$23.2 million. This was supported by the deployment of the CSOV MP Wind Archer flagship and three additional crew transfer vessels, which lifted fleet utilisation to around 76 per cent from 71 per cent amid sustained offshore wind demand. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In February, the CSOV MP Wind Archer won the Offshore Energy Vessel of the Year Award 2026, at the Annual Offshore Support Journal Conference, Awards and Exhibition in London.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Marco Polo Marine also said that FY2026 will see a full-year contribution from the CSOV and three crew transfer vessels, compared with partial contributions in FY2025, supporting stronger topline and earnings momentum. The group also expects two new anchor handling tug supply vessels to join the fleet in 2026, expanding capacity and optionality across oil and gas, and offshore wind.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Marco Polo Marine’s pivot from shipbuilding and repair to ship chartering has more than doubled the latter’s contribution to the topline over the past decade. The Q1 FY2026 revenue mix of 71 per cent chartering and 29 per cent shipyard compared with less than 40 per cent and more than 60 per cent respectively in FY2016, underscoring the structural shift in the business. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even so, the shipbuilding segment remains meaningful, anchored by an NT$4.68 billion (S$188 million) contract to build a 4,000 gross tonnage oceanographic research vessel for Taiwan’s National Academy of Marine Research. It is the largest shipbuilding project undertaken by the group to date.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Feb 19, Maybank Research maintained its “buy” call on the stock with a S$0.20 target price, citing a multiyear growth phase from FY2026 to FY2030 driven by fleet expansion, offshore wind exposure and potential shipbuilding wins. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Maybank’s head of small-mid caps research, Jarick Seet, sees Q1 FY2026 as the start of a seasonal uptrend, with Q2 FY2026 expected to beat Q1 FY2026, and Q3 FY2026 likely the peak given seasonality and rising utilisation, before a typical softening in Q4.

Initial negotiations valued Sparrow Tech at US$50 million, contingent on the company obtaining a major payment institution licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) by March 2022.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As that condition was not met, the original deal fell apart, and Sparrow Tech gave one month’s notice to LinkChina to terminate their contract in May 2022.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Distressed sale</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">By then, Sparrow Tech’s position had deteriorated sharply in the wake of the crypto market crash beginning in late 2021.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The company also found itself with about US$17.1 million in crypto assets that were frozen by Vauld, a crypto lending platform that suspended all withdrawals in July 2022. With shareholders unwilling to inject fresh capital, Sparrow Tech faced a severe liquidity crunch.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It was under these circumstances that the company approached Amber Group again to revive deal talks. Also, by this point, MAS had in June 2022 granted Sparrow in-principle approval for the major payment institution licence.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A new share purchase agreement was signed in July 2022 and completed in November 2022 – less than three months after LinkChina’s contract had been terminated. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The final deal came in well below the original US$50 million valuation. The consideration was structured as US$16.9 million minus third-party indebtedness, plus two contingent payments linked to whatever could eventually be recovered from the frozen Vauld assets.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Disputed fees</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">When LinkChina learned of the completed transaction, it invoiced Sparrow Tech for US$1.6 million, based on a claimed enterprise value of US$54.8 million. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Sparrow Tech refused to pay, arguing that no fee was owed because Sparrow Tech and Amber Group had never expressly agreed on the enterprise value.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Senior Judge Lee rejected the argument, ruling that it could not have been the parties’ intention for the fee to depend on an explicit written agreement between buyer and seller on the enterprise value figure.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Instead, he said that the enterprise value was to be determined objectively from the financial terms of the share purchase agreement and the company’s accounts, by adding Sparrow Tech’s equity value and total debt and subtracting cash.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Senior Judge Lee argued that the purchase consideration under the share purchase agreement was the best measure of equity value, favouring it over theoretical valuation models. “No academic postulation can be better than that situation where parties put their money where their mouths are in an arm’s length transaction.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Working through the share purchase agreement components – US$16.9 million minus third-party indebtedness of US$21.6 million, plus confirmed Vauld recoveries of US$6.1 million and a maximum contingent payment of US$4 million – the court arrived at an equity value of US$5.4 million. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Adding total debt of US$21.6 million and subtracting cash of US$0.2 million, the enterprise value came to US$26.8 million, yielding a success fee of US$803,663.83. Interest was ordered at 5.33 per cent per annum from the date of the writ, along with costs.</p></div>",

The result was better than the median analyst estimate of a 1 per cent year-on-year increase, with revenue returning to 81.3 per cent of the pre-pandemic level in 2019. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Macau ramped up entertainment offerings during the nine-day Chinese New Year break in mainland China – its largest source of visitors – staging float parades, drone and firework shows, markets and concerts. That helped draw tourists and supported strong spending by premium players.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Macau casinos are facing a squeeze on profit margins due to intense competition for mass-market players that has seen operators lavishing out perks and incentives, pushing up operating costs.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The shift followed China’s crackdown on high rollers to curb capital outflow, which diminished the city’s VIP sector that used to contribute about half of its gaming income.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The VIP clients were brought in by junket agents who afforded their own marketing costs, which eased operating pressure on casino operators. Most of the junkets have ceased operation after a gaming law revision rendered their model unfeasible.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Reining in costs while still maintaining their appeal to gamblers will be one of the key challenges for casino operators this year. Gaming revenue may also see limited room for further growth as China’s broader economy remains weighed down by a property market slump, high youth unemployment rate and global trade conflicts.

Had US President Donald Trump, fresh off the snatching of Venezuela’s ex-president Nicolas Maduro in January, bitten off too much? Would there be another bloody morass in the Middle East?  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Khamenei, one of the most evil people in history, is dead,” Trump posted some 13 hours after the bombing of Iran began in the wee hours of Feb 28.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The news of the death of the Iranian Supreme Leader, responsible for brutal repression and policies that devastated Iran while fuelling regional chaos, suddenly overturned predictions of another quicksand in the Middle East.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Comparisons of Trump’s Operation Epic Fury to the Iraqi misadventure in 2003 began to sound hollow.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This is the greatest chance for Iranians to take back their country,” Trump said in the post, two months after large protests in Iran led him to promise that help was at hand and build up the largest concentration of US military in the Middle East in decades.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Although Trump has promised to continue the bombing throughout the week, in coordination with Israel, it seemed like victory was a foregone conclusion. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While the possibility of another hardliner cleric coming to power cannot be discounted, the US seems to be banking on Iranians, who protested in force two months ago, to overthrow the regime.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">If the military operation results in regime change with no cost to the US in blood – and no American casualty has been reported thus far – it will count as a major political victory with Trump’s Make America Great Again supporters. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It is certain to boost the chances of the Republican Party at the Nov 3 midterm elections that will determine whether Trump retains control of Congress.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Speaking to <em>The Straits Times</em>, Professor Ben Radd, an expert on politics and international relations at University of California, Los Angeles, said it counted as a major political and foreign policy win.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Democrats rattled</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“He can now claim to have done something that no US president in 47 years has been able to do. An Iranian government that had for 47 years been saying ‘Death to the United States’ is now no more,” Prof Radd said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The moment will rattle the Democrats, who have tried to press advantage by pointing out that the strikes were unauthorised by Congress and, thus, illegal.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Iranians in Iran and the diaspora in the US are celebrating, it makes the Democrats look like they are on the side of the Islamic regime,” Prof Radd said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It is too early to have a sense of the public reaction at home, cautioned Professor Michael Traugott, an expert on campaigns and elections at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We don’t have polling results yet. And Trump promised during the campaign to reduce or eliminate foreign engagements, and this action runs contrary to that,” he told ST.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He added that the Iran attack could also worsen the affordability crisis in the US by raising the price of oil. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“It remains to be seen who Iran’s new leaders will be and how different that government’s policies will be. Enough damage has been done and will continue in the next few days that there is probably going to be some effect on oil prices in the near term,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The situation is still playing out but it is capable of transforming the look and feel of the Middle East, said Prof Radd.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We’ve seen an end to the Syrian dictatorship. We’ve seen relationships between Israel and Arab states solidified. And now we’re seeing the possibility of regime change in Iran. These are fever dreams that many would have had, that no one thought were doable.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">These events also position the US as the top dog among geopolitical rivals.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This weakens Russia, which had invested heavily in Iran and Syria. And the Chinese have not been able to expand in the Middle East. These are things that Trump can legitimately point to as foreign policy accomplishments,” Prof Radd added.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Trump will go to Beijing strong</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The attack came at a delicate moment for US-China relations, with Trump due in Beijing on Mar 31 for a three-day visit to discuss tariffs, rare earths, AI chips and other nettlesome subjects.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The White House has not provided updates on the high-stakes summit, but analysts have wondered if the strikes would sharpen the great power rivalry even as it tests both sides’ realpolitik.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Former US diplomat David Meale, now with Eurasia Group, said the trip would proceed because Trump is “capable of managing the Iran situation while keeping focus on broader foreign policy goals”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Professor Dennis Wilder, a former White House Asia hand who now teaches at Georgetown University, went further. “Xi will respect Trump’s boldness. Trump will arrive in Beijing from a position of strength,” he told ST.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">From China’s perspective, though, the Iran strikes are an unwelcome distraction.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“With the critical Two Sessions next week, the Iran crisis is about the last thing China needs as it gets its house in order,” said Han Lin, the China managing director for The Asia Group, referring to annual meetings of China’s top advisory and legislative bodies that kick off on Mar 4 and Mar 5 respectively.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China has refrained from coming out in support of Iran, its strategic partner. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs mainly called for an immediate cessation of military operations in a Feb 28 statement.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Lin said China might suggest to Iran via back channels that it should refrain from closing the Strait of Hormuz to avoid disruptions of oil shipments.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China stands to benefit from the unfolding situation by portraying itself as the chief defender of global stability while the US is trying to reorder the world by force. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Both powers are increasingly aware that every regional crisis is also a proxy test of their global rivalry,” Lin told ST.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It would not be in Beijing’s interest to see a regime collapse in Teheran that would be replaced by a Western-aligned government.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China is Iran’s largest oil customer, buying over 80 per cent of its crude in 2025, often at steep discounts. Iran is also a key node for China’s Belt and Road Initiative, providing land and sea corridors across the Middle East.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The two nations signed a 25-year strategic agreement in 2021 and China is reportedly supplying air defence systems, anti-ship and ballistic missile components that support Iran’s own missile and drone capabilities.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But Prof Wilder dismissed the ties as non-consequential.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Iran is a marriage of convenience, not a strategic ally to China. Beijing is the ultimate realist,” he said.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Slowdown in arms shipments to Asia</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For some US allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific, the attack on Iran could mean a slowdown in US arms shipments.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Despite the Trump administration’s insistence that the Americas and Indo-Pacific are their top regional priorities, we are once again seeing military action in the Middle East,” said Dr Zack Cooper, an expert on US policy in Asia at the American Enterprise Institute.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This will use up stocks of some critical munitions and once again distract the US government from the focus on Asia favoured by many experts and officials,” he told ST.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Analysts estimate the US has already burned through a significant share of air- and missile-defence interceptors like the Patriot and THAAD systems and faces supply chain bottlenecks and workforce gaps in ramping up production.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">’You don’t fire this many surface-to-air missiles in the Middle East and Ukraine without straining a very small production capacity,” said Prof Wilder, the former White House official.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Asia would still get attention from the Trump administration, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“But it delays such things as arms transfers to Taiwan and Japan under existing contracts,” he added. <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/iran-attack-a-major-triumph-for-trump-strengthening-his-hand-ahead-of-china-visit\" target=\"_blank\">THE STRAITS TIMES</a></p></div>",
