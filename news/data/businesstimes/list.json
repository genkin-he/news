It described Longines as Swatch’s “main problem child,” citing high management turnover and reliance on China.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Among its numerous criticisms of the report, Swatch – which does not give a detailed breakdown of its brands’ performances – countered that Longines reported “a profit of 16.6 per cent on net sales” in 2025. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Oliver Mueller, head of Switzerland’s LuxeConsult, and Morgan Stanley had no immediate comment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Swatch’s operating profit margin tumbled by more than half to 2.1 per cent in 2025, it reported last month, as the company grappled with weak demand in China and the fallout from President Donald Trump’s tariffs in the US. The watchmaker’s policy of maintaining jobs, production and inventory to be ready for an upturn has also faced criticism from investors for keeping costs high.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Shares of Swatch have rebounded more than 20 per cent since the company gave a more optimistic outlook for the current fiscal year, though they are still well below their level in the post-pandemic boom that lifted luxury brands.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">They fell as much as 3.1 per cent on Friday.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In the report, Morgan Stanley also said revenue for Swatch’s Omega brand had stagnated at around 2.2 billion Swiss francs (S$3.6 billion) for more than a decade, and was overtaken by Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet last year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Swatch described the report’s conclusions and the rankings of watch brands as “questionable.” It also said that unlike Morgan Stanley, LuxeConsult did not disclose potential conflicts of interest. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Occasionally, the research even produces defamatory and potentially damaging statements,” Swatch said, adding “legal action should be considered.” BLOOMBERG</p></div>",

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI gaining 0.3 per cent after a previously reported 0.5 per cent increase in December.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A 0.8 per cent jump in services accounted for the rise in the PPI. That reflected a 2.5 per cent increase in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers. There was a 14.4 per cent surge in margins for professional and commercial equipment wholesaling, suggesting businesses were passing on tariffs.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Prices also increased for apparel, footwear and accessories retailing, as well as chemicals and allied products wholesaling, bundled wired telecommunications access services, health, beauty and optical goods retailing, and food and alcohol retailing.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In the 12 months through January, the PPI increased 2.9 per cent after rising 3.0 per cent in December. The moderation in the year-on-year producer inflation rate reflected last year’s high readings dropping out of the calculation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The report was delayed by the brief shutdown of the federal government early this month</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Producer goods prices fell 0.3 per cent, with the cost of energy declining 2.7 per cent and food decreasing 1.5 per cent. Excluding food and energy, goods prices soared 0.7 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Some of the components in the PPI report go into the calculation of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Indexes, the inflation measures tracked by the Federal Reserve for its 2 per cent target.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Prior to the PPI data, economists estimated that core PCE inflation increased by as much as 0.5 per cent in January, which would translate to a year-on-year advance of 3.1 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Core PCE inflation rose 0.4 per cent in December and increased 3.0 per cent year-on-year.
