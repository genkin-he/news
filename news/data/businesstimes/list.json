They also need to use personal loans rather than mortgages and have to go through the company if they want to resell.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Alvarez, a prospective buyer who declined to give his first name, said Habitacion.com offered to help him get a personal 10-year loan from a regional bank at 6 per cent interest, twice the regular mortgage average, but in the end could not find any rooms in Madrid where he lives.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He also said the scheme, while a good option in general for young people with not enough savings, “loses all appeal if I can’t live with my partner.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, in London, developer Fairview has a “Buddy Up” scheme, offering to connect friends with a broker and solicitor and covering up to £2,000 (S$S$3,406) towards legal fees if they decide to buy property together in the capital or its surroundings.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Banks in Britain, France, Germany and Italy are also reviving low or zero-deposit mortgages that vanished after the 2008 financial crisis. They come with higher costs and typically require applicants to present high, stable income, but while still rare offer an option for those unable to save up for a downpayment but desperate for a home of their own.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Natalie and Martin Walker from West Yorkshire in northern England say an eviction notice served when their baby was one month old drove them to take up a zero-deposit mortgage last year to buy a house after four years of renting.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The sense of stability that it brings you, that’s the biggest delight for me,” said Natalie.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Back in Spain, Carlos Sempere, a 36-year-old industrial engineer who rents a flat in central Madrid, where properties are selling for around one million euros – far out of his reach – bought a rental property in southern Spain instead via an investment company PropHero.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Either it helps me pay the rent, or I sell it in the future,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For those who cannot afford a whole property, PropHero also offers stakes in rental apartment buildings in Spain and Ireland for as little as 20,000 euros.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Ultimately, it is the dire market conditions that make prospective first-time buyers look past legal complexities and cost of new schemes, says real estate consultant and head of alternative investments at AIRE Partners Patricio Palomar.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“All these housing solutions serve to show how people are getting poorer.” REUTERS</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">THE Trump administration is seeking to delay court proceedings over whether it must refund importers billions of dollars in tariffs recently struck down by the US Supreme Court, marking a contentious start to the next phase of the legal fight.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The government wants to wait as long as four months before reviving litigation before the US Court of International Trade on the refund question, according to a filing by the Justice Department late Friday. DOJ lawyers criticised lawyers for companies in one of the lead cases for pressing to reopen the legal wrangling as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Complexity in the future counsels appropriately careful process, not breakneck speed,” the government said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Justice Department appeared to acknowledge that there will be a refund process after its loss in the Supreme Court, warning that “the coming process will take time” and noting the example of an earlier mass refund situation that took years to play out.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But the government’s filing didn’t offer a full-throated assurance that the administration would commit to refunding all importers the full amount of tariffs they paid. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The DOJ lawyers wrote that a delay wouldn’t hurt companies because “monetary loss is a classic harm that can be remedied by payment of money with appropriate interest.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Last year, the government successfully argued for judges to allow the administration to continue collecting tariffs while the legal fight was pending, at one point telling the trade court that the plaintiffs “will assuredly receive payment on their refund with interest” if they won.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Importers had paid approximately US$170 billion in the contested duties by the time the justices ruled, according to Bloomberg Economics analysis.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Sara Albrecht, chairperson of Liberty Justice Center, which has represented companies in the case before the Supreme Court, said in a statement that “the government cannot have it both ways.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“It cannot argue there is no harm because refunds are available — and then delay when the time comes to return the money,” she said. “American businesses paid money the government had no authority to collect. That money does not belong to Washington. It belongs to the American people who earned it.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision on Feb 20 was silent on the refund question, meaning it will go back to the New York-based trade court to resolve. But that next phase is in limbo until the Supreme Court and US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit formally close out their proceedings, which hasn’t happened yet.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Over the past week, lawyers for companies seeking refunds have asked the Federal Circuit to swiftly take steps to finish its phase of the case and urged the trade court to move quickly to establish a schedule for the next round.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Justice Department, by contrast, wants the Federal Circuit to wait until the Supreme Court finalises its judgment, which can take up to 32 days. After that happens, the government is then arguing for another 90-day delay, saying that it would “allow the political branches an opportunity to consider options.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The administration accused the companies of pushing for a speedy schedule out of an “apparent desire to be the center of attention” in the future proceedings before the trade court.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The latest filing also referred to Trump’s move to impose new global tariffs under a different legal authority after the Supreme Court ruled, citing the fact that the levies declared unlawful by the Supreme Court “have been replaced by vigorous new tariffs.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The government didn’t elaborate on the relationship between the new duties and the question of whether businesses should be refunded for money they already paid.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump signalled the administration might contest refunds shortly after the Supreme Court announced its decision, telling reporters “I guess it has to get litigated.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In a social media post on Friday, he appeared to refer to potential refunds as an “undeserved ‘windfall’” and asked, “Is a Rehearing or Readjudication of this case possible???”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">More than 2,000 tariff lawsuits have been filed so far, nearly all of which were lodged in the trade court after the Supreme Court heard arguments in November. The trade court paused all of the cases until the Supreme Court ruled.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Only importers are eligible to seek refunds directly from customs authorities, but consumers recently joined the fray as well, filing a handful of proposed class actions this week to recoup the higher prices they paid as businesses passed on the cost of the levies.

Nvidia and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Reuters earlier this month reported OpenAI is unsatisfied with the speed at which Nvidia’s hardware can spit out answers to ChatGPT users for specific types of problems such as software development and AI communicating with other software.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It needs new hardware that would eventually provide about 10 per cent of OpenAI’s inference computing needs in the future, one of the sources told Reuters.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The ChatGPT maker has discussed working with startups including Cerebras and Groq to provide chips for faster inference, two sources said. But Nvidia struck a US$20-billion licensing deal with Groq that shut down OpenAI’s talks, one of the sources told Reuters.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In September, Nvidia said it intended to pour as much as US$100 billion into OpenAI as part of a deal that gave the chipmaker a stake in the startup and gave OpenAI the cash it needed to buy the advanced chips.

According to Pollack, this requires the case to be dismissed.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores were both forcibly removed from Venezuela by US forces in January. Days later they appeared in court in New York where both pleaded not guilty. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Because Maduro and Venezuela are under US sanctions, Pollack requires a license from the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control to send funds for the ousted president’s defence, the lawyer said. But OFAC “appears unwilling” or “has been instructed” not to issue such a license.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A spokesman for the Manhattan US Attorney’s office, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Treasury department didn’t respond to requests for comment. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pollack said Venezuelan law requires the government in Caracas to pay Maduro’s legal fees, and officials there are willing to do so.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I have relied on this expectation and cannot afford to pay for my own legal defence,” Maduro said in a signed declaration accompanying the court filing.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pollack told the court that counsel for Maduro and Flores both applied for OFAC licenses on Jan 7. They were issued two days later, but OFAC amended the Maduro license, within hours and without explanation, to bar payments from Venezuela.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The United States government, even while authorising myriad commercial transactions with Venezuela, is prohibiting counsel from receiving untainted funds from the government of Venezuela, despite Venezuela’s obligation to fund Mr Maduro’s defence,” Pollack said in the court filing.

His wife, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, testified before the same panel on Thursday. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The former president signalled that some of his answers might frustrate lawmakers, cautioning that he would not speculate about events from decades ago. “You’ll often hear me say that I don’t recall,” he said. “I’m not going to say something I’m not sure of.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Hillary Clinton told reporters after her own deposition, which she said spanned topics like UFOs and the so-called PizzaGate conspiracy theory, that she is confident her husband knew nothing about Epstein’s crimes.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">House Oversight Chair James Comer said the committee planned to question Clinton on flights the former president took on Epstein’s private plane and visits the financier made to the White House during the Clinton presidency. After the hours-long questioning, Comer called it a “very productive deposition.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I do think that we picked up some new facts,” Comer added. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Representative Robert Garcia, the panel’s top-ranking Democrat, told reporters during an afternoon break in the questioning that Clinton was “very cooperative” and “answering the questions fairly, to the best of his ability.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">President Donald Trump and his allies have sought to put a spotlight on Epstein’s connections to Democrats, including the Clintons, amid public attention on the sex offender’s ties to the president and his associates, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and former senior adviser Steve Bannon.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Representative Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican and one of the lawmakers on the panel, said earlier that Clinton would “be thoroughly asked about” photographs of him featured in the first tranche of Epstein files released by the Justice Department in December. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Those photos, including one of the former president soaking in a jacuzzi and another swimming with Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, garnered significant media attention. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Mace said the panel questioned Hillary Clinton about the photos on Thursday but she re-directed the questions to her husband.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Since I am under oath, I will not falsely state that I am looking forward to your questions. But I am ready to answer them,” the former president said in his opening statement.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Garcia told reporters before the deposition began that Democrats “have real questions, questions that deserve serious answers from former President Clinton” but “what we do not want today is a sideshow.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Bill Clinton took several trips on Epstein’s private plane before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to Florida state charges that included procurement of a minor to engage in prostitution. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Epstein also donated US$1,000 to Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign and US$20,000 to Hillary Clinton’s 2000 US Senate campaign. A charity controlled by Epstein contributed US$25,000 to the Clintons’ private foundation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In an interview with the BBC in mid-February, Hillary Clinton said her husband had flown on Epstein’s private jet “for his charitable work” and she didn’t recall ever meeting Epstein. She said she had met Maxwell “on a few occasions.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of recruiting girls for sexual abuse and participating in some of the assaults. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Bill Clinton has said that he parted ways with Epstein many years before the financier’s 2019 death in a New York jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Authorities ruled the death a suicide.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Clintons yielded to Republican demands to appear before a House committee investigating Epstein after GOP lawmakers threatened to hold them both in contempt of Congress if they didn’t testify.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Clintons said they’d offered to send sworn statements to the House committee as others who’d been subpoenaed to testify had done, but the Republican-led panel turned them down.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Democratic lawmakers said the panel should follow the precedent set with Clinton and subpoena Trump to testify under oath.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“President Trump was in the Epstein files almost more than anyone else besides Ghislaine Maxwell,” Garcia told reporters. “Answer our questions. This is not a hoax. He has not been exonerated.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that Trump had been “totally exonerated on anything relating to Epstein” and has “done more for Epstein’s victims than anyone before him.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump has denied any knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activities.
