Affected employees earlier told <em>The Business Times </em>that they were informed of the closure via WhatsApp at 8 pm on Wednesday, with a termination letter accompanying the message. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">No further details were provided by Twelve Cupcakes on the matter. The liquidator, AAG Corporate Advisory, said it is unable to provide details on operations, finances or the reasons for the liquidation before obtaining the relevant information, in response to BT queries on Thursday.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One of Twelve Cupcakes’ outlet managers told BT outside the MOM Services Centre on Friday that the decision to shutter the company came to its staff with zero warning. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We did not know anything (about this) in advance. There was no notice period at all,” he said. “With so many bills to pay, starting with our rent – what are we going to do now?” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He added that the main concern among employees now is the salaries they are owed for October, on top of compensation for the sudden termination of employment, especially since the 30-day notice period was not abided by. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Others BT spoke to on Friday said this is particularly pressing as many affected have rent due at the end of the month. Most said they are expected to foot their rent by Friday or Saturday – or risk facing eviction or incurring late charges.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Those who are foreign workers also said they have debts to repay back home; others have to pay tuition fees for their children.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Some workers noted that Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions were not credited to their accounts for October. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Specific representatives of the counter staff group were addressed by MOM staff in closed-door meetings. These workers told BT after these meetings that they were informed that local unions would handle all compensation-related matters. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">They added that a separate meeting with union members has been set up for next week, though a fixed date and time have yet to be confirmed. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As for S-Pass holders, no extension will be given, which means such affected workers will have 30 days to find a new job in Singapore, or they will have to return to their home country. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Affected workers who gathered at the MOM Service Centre on Friday comprised those on S-Passes, Work Permits and Long-term Visit Passes, as well as Singapore citizens. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We understand that the liquidation will take some time, but we do (at the very least) have to receive our salaries for the month of October today so we can continue covering our basic expenses in Singapore, and to feed our families,” one told BT. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the time being, the group of counter staff are putting together a page to raise donations.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We are truly hoping for the best by next week – and we hope the government can help us in our current situation,” the outlet manager said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A representative from home-grown eatery The Soup Spoon reached out to BT on Friday, offering to assist affected Twelve Cupcakes workers with available job opportunities. The business has store openings lined up starting from next week, with several full-time and part-time positions to fill.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Food, Drinks and Allied Workers Union (FDAWU) on Thursday <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/unacceptable-and-unfair-union-raps-twelve-cupcakes-abrupt-closure-axing-80-workers\" target=\"_blank\">criticised the cupcake’s business’ abrupt closure as “unacceptable and unfair”</a>, strongly objecting to the business owner’s lack of prior consultation and advance notice. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">FDAWU said it will be assisting members and workers with salary-related claims and job-assistance support, as well as connecting them to the labour movement’s network, such as NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">MOM issued a joint statement with CPF Board (CPFB) on Friday evening, noting that the actions of Twelve Cupcakes in this case were “irresponsible” and not aligned with the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Despite being a unionised company under the FDAWU, Twelve Cupcakes did not engage the union early, before affected employees were notified,” they explained. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Taskforce for Responsible Retrenchment and Employment Facilitation, which comprises MOM, Workforce Singapore, the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), and NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute (e2i), is working closely with Twelve Cupcakes and the FDAWU to support the affected employees, said MOM and CPFB. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This will include working with Twelve Cupcakes to provide job matching support and career coaching for these employees.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management will also assist employees of Twelve Cupcakes who need to file a Proof of Debt for their salary and other employment claims with the liquidator. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CPFB, in addition, will be filing a Proof of Debt with the liquidator to recover the outstanding CPF contributions for September and October this year. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">MOM also stated that it is investigating the company’s non-payment of salaries and other potential breaches of the Employment Act. </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[HOUSTON] Oil prices settled slightly higher after a wild trading session on Friday (Oct 31), popping up as media reports said US air strikes on Venezuela could begin within hours and then retreating after US President Donald Trump issued a denial on social media. Brent crude futures settled at US$65.07 a barrel, up 7 cents, or 0.11. US West Texas Intermediate crude finished  at US$60.98 a barrel, up 41 cents, or 0.68 per cent. “Is this Donald Trump’s trick or treat?“ said Phil Flynn, senior analyst for Price Futures Group. He noted that earlier this year, Trump denied reports of a planned attack on Iran before carrying out airstrikes against the Islamic Republic.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“There definitely was an impact on the market when the first report of a planned attack on Venezuela came out,” Flynn said. “If there is an attack over the weekend, prices will spike on Monday.” The US has deployed a task force centered around the nation’s largest aircraft carrier, Gerald Ford, off the coast of Venezuela, far beyond the needs of attacking drug traffickers on small boats, the focus of US naval activity in the Caribbean in recent weeks. “It’s pretty clear something is afoot there,” said John Kilduff, partner with Again Capital LLC. “For oil traders, it’s a classic situation of buy now and ask questions later.” The US dollar was near three-month highs against major currencies, making purchases of dollar-denominated commodities such as oil more expensive. Meanwhile, sources told Reuters that Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, may reduce its December crude price for Asian buyers to multi-month lows, sounding a bearish note. Oil slipped after an official survey showed China’s factory activity shrank for a seventh month in October.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Brent and WTI are set to fall 2.6 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively, in October with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and major non-Opec producers ramping up output. More supply will also cushion the impact of Western sanctions disrupting Russian oil exports to its top buyers China and India. A Reuters survey forecast Brent will average US$67.99 per barrel in 2025, about 38 cents above last month’s estimate. WTI is expected to average US$64.83, slightly above September’s estimate of US$64.39. Opec+ is leaning toward a modest output boost in December, people familiar with the talks said ahead of the group’s meeting on Sunday. Kilduff said most of the Opec+ members except for Saudi Arabia were unable to add much to their production.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Pretty much there is nothing they can add that is going to be meaningful beyond what the Saudis can do,” Kilduff said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In August, Saudi Arabia’s crude exports hit a six-month high of 6.407 million bpd, data from the Joint Organization Data Initiative showed. A US Energy Information Administration report also showed record production of 13.6 million bpd last week.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump said on Thursday that China has agreed to begin the process of purchasing US energy and that a very large-scale transaction may take place involving the purchase of oil and gas from Alaska.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, analysts remained skeptical as to whether the US-China trade deal will boost Chinese demand for US energy.

But elsewhere in megacap companies, Apple’s shares closed down 0.4 per cent after its forecast for iPhone holiday quarter sales surpassed Wall Street expectations was clouded by CEO Tim Cook’s flagging of  supply constraints. And in remarks that cooled investor hopes for policy easing, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said on Friday that a December rate cut was not locked in despite market expectations for a cut.

This matched the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A measure of underlying pressures that strips out volatile components unexpectedly held at 2.4 per cent as the closely watched services component quickened to 3.4 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The reading comes a day after the ECB kept interest rates at 2 per cent for a third meeting, judging that policy settings are appropriate to keep price gains around their target over the medium term. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">President Christine Lagarde said on Thursday (Oct 30) that the assessment of the inflation outlook was broadly unchanged, though it remained more uncertain than usual. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">National reports this week showed price pressures building in Spain, easing less than expected in Germany, and remaining well below target in France and Italy.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“At first glance, the inflation problem in the eurozone appears to be solved,” said Dr Joerg Kraemer, chief economist at Commerzbank. But “the persistent underlying inflation argues against the ECB further lowering its key interest rates”, he added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The ECB expects inflation to dip below 2 per cent next year, followed by a re-acceleration to approach the target in 2027. Fresh quarterly forecasts in December will feature 2028 for the first time, potentially reigniting discussions on whether further monetary easing is necessary. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For now, officials are signalling little reason to act. “From a monetary policy point of view, we are in a good place,” Lagarde reiterated.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Economic growth data in recent days supported that stance. Euro area output rose 0.2 per cent in the third quarter, more than analysts had predicted, in a sign of resilience to the trade disruptions unleashed by US President Donald Trump. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The economy was boosted in particular by France, where companies and households defied political turmoil over its budget. Germany and Italy stagnated, narrowly avoiding recessions.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The ECB warned that a stronger euro and the tariff fallout could still dampen inflation more than expected. On the other hand, prices could be boosted if trade disruptions cause supply chain snarls.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">An ECB document summarising its recent contacts with companies showed some manufacturers see downward pressure on prices – partly because US tariffs are causing more goods from elsewhere to be diverted to the currency bloc. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The impact on activity was also assessed as negative.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In the run-up to Thursday’s meeting, policymakers had offered varying assessments of such scenarios. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While some had emphasised the risks that could pull inflation lower, others had highlighted those that drive it in the other direction. BLOOMBERG</p></div>",
