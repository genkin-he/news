The fund manages RM1.41 trillion and has more than 18 million members, about 60 per cent of whom contributed money in the past 12 months.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Resilient equity markets were the main driver of EPF’s income, supported by stable returns from fixed income and the well diversified nature of the portfolio,” Chairman Mohd Zuki Ali said in the statement.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The fund expects the global economy will remain resilient thanks to abating inflation and monetary easing, and that continued investment inflows, especially into technology, will help offset possible uneven growth among major economies.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The latest dividend compares with 2024 dividends of 6.3 per cent for both its conventional and Sharia accounts — the latter being investments made in line with Islamic principles.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For 2025, EPF recorded total distributable income of RM82.7 billion, up 9.5 per cent from a year earlier.

They also need to use personal loans rather than mortgages and have to go through the company if they want to resell.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Alvarez, a prospective buyer who declined to give his first name, said Habitacion.com offered to help him get a personal 10-year loan from a regional bank at 6 per cent interest, twice the regular mortgage average, but in the end could not find any rooms in Madrid where he lives.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He also said the scheme, while a good option in general for young people with not enough savings, “loses all appeal if I can’t live with my partner.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, in London, developer Fairview has a “Buddy Up” scheme, offering to connect friends with a broker and solicitor and covering up to £2,000 (S$S$3,406) towards legal fees if they decide to buy property together in the capital or its surroundings.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Banks in Britain, France, Germany and Italy are also reviving low or zero-deposit mortgages that vanished after the 2008 financial crisis. They come with higher costs and typically require applicants to present high, stable income, but while still rare offer an option for those unable to save up for a downpayment but desperate for a home of their own.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Natalie and Martin Walker from West Yorkshire in northern England say an eviction notice served when their baby was one month old drove them to take up a zero-deposit mortgage last year to buy a house after four years of renting.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The sense of stability that it brings you, that’s the biggest delight for me,” said Natalie.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Back in Spain, Carlos Sempere, a 36-year-old industrial engineer who rents a flat in central Madrid, where properties are selling for around one million euros – far out of his reach – bought a rental property in southern Spain instead via an investment company PropHero.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Either it helps me pay the rent, or I sell it in the future,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For those who cannot afford a whole property, PropHero also offers stakes in rental apartment buildings in Spain and Ireland for as little as 20,000 euros.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Ultimately, it is the dire market conditions that make prospective first-time buyers look past legal complexities and cost of new schemes, says real estate consultant and head of alternative investments at AIRE Partners Patricio Palomar.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“All these housing solutions serve to show how people are getting poorer.” REUTERS</p></div>",
