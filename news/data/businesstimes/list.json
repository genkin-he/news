LBC rates were increased for residential, commercial, industrial and place of worship/civic and community institution uses. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Developers pay an LBC for the right to enhance the use of some sites or to build bigger projects on them. The rates are stated according to use groups across 118 geographical sectors in Singapore.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">LBC rates for non-landed residential use have been raised by 4.1 per cent on average. LBC rates in 114 sectors have been raised by around 3 to 23 per cent. There are no changes in the other four sectors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For landed residential use, LBC rates have risen by 4 per cent on average. Rates have been upped for 93 sectors by around 3 to 10 per cent, with no changes in the other 25 sectors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">LBC rates for industrial use have been raised by 3.2 per cent on average. All 118 sectors saw increases ranging from around 2 to 9 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">LBC rates for commercial use have gone up by 0.5 per cent on average. Twenty of the 118 geographical sectors will see increases of around 3 to 4 per cent, with no change for the remaining 98 sectors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the place of worship/civic and community institution use group, LBC rates have increased by 3 per cent on average across all 118 sectors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Commenting on the broad-based increases in LBC rates, JLL’s head of research and consultancy for South-east Asia Chua Yang Liang said: “Persistent strong results at government land sales (GLS) tenders would have motivated the chief valuer (CV) to adjust the LBC rates accordingly.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Some of the adjustments were also motivated by the residual gap between recent market transactions and the implied land value based on Sep 1, 2025, LBC  rates for that use group and location.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">LBC rates are announced twice a year, on Mar 1 and Sep 1, following a review by the Singapore Land Authority in consultation with the taxman’s CV.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For non-landed residential use, the biggest LBC rate hike of 22.7 per cent was in Sector 97 which includes the Bedok South area. JLL’s analysis showed that the S$1,330 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr) top bid for the Bedok Rise GLS site in November 2025 was about 36 per cent above the implied land value based on the Sep 1, 2025, LBC rate for non-landed residential use in the sector.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Also in November, a GLS tender for a site next to Newton MRT interchange station fetched a top bid of nearly S$1,820 psf ppr. This was 16 per cent above the implied land value based on the Sep 1, 2025, LBC rate for non-landed residential use in that location, which is in Sector 37, where the LBC rate is being raised by 10.2 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Huttons Asia chief executive officer Mark Yip noted that the 4.1 per cent rise on average for non-landed residential use LBC rates is the biggest increase since September 2022. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He added: “The strong take-up at private residential project launches in 2025 renewed the need among developers to replenish their land banks. As well, reduced borrowing costs for developers boosted their ability to pay more for GLS sites amid the increased competition.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On industrial LBC rates being raised across all 118 sectors by about 2 to 9 per cent, Wong Shanting, research head for Singapore at Newmark, noted: “This broad-based uplift reflects an active industrial market, underpinned by several high-value transactions that have driven land costs higher.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">An example would be 680 Upper Thomson Road, which was sold in October 2025 for about S$665 psf ppr. Based on JLL’s analysis, this was a 190 per cent premium to the land value implied by the Sep 1, 2025, industrial LBC rate for the area, which is in Sector 107; the LBC rate for the sector has been raised by 9.3 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Summing up, Dr Chua of JLL said: “The refreshed LBC rates should not have any significant drag on the market trend or dampen developers’ and investors’ longer-term confidence in the underlying property market.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, CBRE’s research head for Singapore and South-east Asia Tricia Song pointed out: “The increase in residential LBC rates could further increase acquisition costs for developers, and dampen an already-weak collective sale market.”</p></div>",

This weighed down its second-half net profit.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But group president and chief executive officer Vincent Chong noted on Friday (Feb 27) at ST Engineering’s full-year results briefing that activity is picking up in 2026, with more orders secured and cost cuts under way as the company focuses on turning the business around.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Our priority remains supporting customers, executing the turnaround, and evaluating the strategic path forward for the satcom business,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even as it evaluates “strategic actions” for the business, ST Engineering has implemented S$43 million in annualised cost savings for the satcom unit. It has more plans to bring these savings up to S$63 million.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For satcom, the group is targeting H1 revenue that is stronger year on year (yoy), following its dive in net profit for H2 FY2025.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The urban solutions and satcom segment sank into the red with a S$567.7 million loss in H2, reversing from earnings of S$31.1 million in the year-ago period.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, the segment’s H2 revenue rose 6 per cent yoy to S$1.1 billion, from S$1 billion the previous year. Urban solutions drove the improvement, which was partially offset by lower satcom contributions.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">ST Engineering reported a net profit of S$59.9 million for H2 FY2025, an 83.6 per cent decline from S$365.7 million in the previous corresponding period.

The segment’s revenue increased 23 per cent to S$2.6 billion, from S$2.2 billion the previous year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This growth was contributed by stronger sales from engines, MRO (maintenance, repair and operations) and nacelles,” said Cedric Foo, group chief financial officer of ST Engineering.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The defence and public security segment reported S$551.4 million in H2 earnings, up from S$311.9 the previous year. Its revenue stood at S$2.7 billion, rising 5 per cent on the year from S$2.6 billion.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the full year, commercial aerospace accounted for 40 per cent of the group’s revenue, and defence and public security made up 43 per cent.
