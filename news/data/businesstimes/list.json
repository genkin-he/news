They can receive income while continuing to accumulate wealth. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">During each policy year in the payout period, income is distributed based on index performance up to the selected annual target. Any additional gains within the same year are automatically reinvested to support continued policy value growth.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">From the 11th policy year onwards, a guaranteed loyalty bonus adds an extra 0.7 per cent per annum crediting rate to the index account.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For legacy planning, the plan allows the life assured to be changed up to five times, allowing the plan to be transferred across generations. It also offers guaranteed acceptance without requiring medical underwriting. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Other features of Singlife’s latest UL plan include lifelong protection against death and terminal illness, penalty-free partial withdrawals during key life events, and the option to spread premiums allocated to the index account over 12 months to manage the impact of market volatility.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Growing demand for UL plans</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The launch comes amid growing demand for UL plans, fuelled by rising wealth creation across Asia-Pacific. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">These policies have long been a mainstay of high-net-worth (HNW) insurance, which emphasises multigenerational wealth and legacy planning. Insurers have <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/indexed-universal-life-plans-hit-sweet-spot-among-wealthy-and-mass-affluent-clients\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> increasing take-up of indexed universal life (IUL) policies with larger sums assured.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In 2024, Singlife launched the Singlife Legacy Indexed Universal Life, marking its earlier foray into the indexed UL segment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Traditional UL plans, which have been in the market for decades, generate returns via a fixed crediting rate. However, interest in such structures has waned, giving way to IULs, which aim to offer a blend of capital stability and market-linked upside.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Typically, premiums are divided into two accounts: a fixed account earning a crediting rate of about 2 per cent per annum, and an index account where clients select their preferred market exposure.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, IULs are not just for the ultra-wealthy. While some insurers require a minimum sum assured of US$1 million to US$2 million, Singlife and Great Eastern set theirs at US$250,000.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Wong Lu Ping, head of savings and investments at Singlife, noted that its latest UL plan can complement guaranteed retirement income sources such as CPF Life payouts and endowment plans by providing an additional income stream linked to the performance of globally-recognised indices.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Rising life expectancy, escalating living costs and global uncertainties make it increasingly important for individuals to have multiple diverse income streams to support their retirement years,” she added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Singlife’s Legacy Indexed Income plan comes amid similar product launches in the market. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Last month, HSBC Life Singapore introduced HSBC Life Indexed Flexi Income, an IUL plan designed to provide lifetime income, wealth accumulation and protection across life stages.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The plan offers guaranteed lifetime increasing income options up to age 120 and also allows policyholders to determine when payouts begin, with flexibility to pause or resume distributions. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Similar to Singlife’s plan, HSBC Life Indexed Flexi Income supports legacy planning through succession features that allow transfers across up to five generations. Its index account also provides access to global benchmarks, including the S&amp;P 500 Index, Nasdaq-100 Index, S&amp;P Global Diversified Index and S&amp;P U.S. Tactical Multi-Asset Index.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The plan is said to build on HSBC Life Singapore’s ongoing efforts to “broaden its suite of integrated protection, accumulation, retirement and legacy planning solutions to meet increasingly complex wealth needs”, said the insurer. </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[SINGAPORE] The world’s largest asset managers who collectively oversee more than US$20 trillion of assets are bullish across emerging-market equities, currencies, domestic bonds and credit.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This is according to a report from Citigroup which reviewed the funds’ published outlooks and found that money managers had added to long positions in equities across Asia, Latin America, as well as Europe, the Middle East and Africa. They also favour emerging currencies against the US dollar. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Investors’ bullishness remained on full display on Thursday (Feb 26), with MSCI’s main emerging equity index rising to a fresh record high, bringing year-to-date gains to 15 per cent. A similar gauge for emerging-market currencies advanced for a fifth straight day, hitting a new all-time high.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The shift is a consequence of policy uncertainty and blowout fiscal deficit in the US, which has led investors to try and diversify exposure away from the US dollar. But there are also concerns over spending increases in Japan and Germany, lifting bond yields across many developed nations. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Wall Street was also rattled this week by renewed concerns around how artificial intelligence might disrupt swathes of the economy, yet most tech-heavy Asian bourses shrugged off the wobble, as their companies make the hardware used for building AI networks. On Thursday, South Korean stocks added another 3.8 per cent, having already leapfrogged French and German markets to become the ninth largest in size globally. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On bonds, Citi said fund managers have emerging debt for their top duration call, in contrast with short positions in US Treasuries and core European sovereign debt. Emerging debt carries the biggest credit overweight too, while US investment-grade bonds remain a popular underweight, the bank said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A Bloomberg gauge of EM local currency government bonds has returned 2.2 per cent so far in 2026, following last year’s 8.5 per cent gain which was the best since 2017. A similar index tracking sovereign US dollar bonds is up 1.7 per cent in 2026, after a 13 per cent increase last year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While fund managers have flocked to emerging debt for the higher yields on offer, many also point to policymaking improvements, in particular on controlling inflation and debt levels. South Africa’s budget, for instance, showed debt and debt-service costs peaking this year, pushing yields on its local-currency securities to decade lows. The rand is trading close to three-year highs to the US dollar. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Bond investors are giving the benefit of the doubt even to countries with signs of fiscal slippage. On Thursday they lent US$4.5 billion to Indonesia, enabling the nation to pull off its biggest global bond sale since at least 2017.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But for all the rallies of recent months, investors say there is room for more, pointing out that emerging assets still are cheaply valued relative to developed counterparts, and global funds’ allocations to the sector remain low.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Investors haven’t missed the move yet,” said Jean-Louis Nakamura, managing director at Vontobel Asset Management in Zurich. “Even a modest normalisation in global allocations could drive substantial inflows.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, many emerging economies in Africa and Latin America are also getting a boost from the commodity bullrun that’s lifted industrial as well as precious metals to record highs. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Citi said fund managers had added positions in precious metals during the recent rally, citing strong central bank demand and the weaker US dollar outlook. Gold in particular is popular as a source of stability, Citi said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Overall, EM assets and gold stand out as the most popular consensus trades,” the bank added.

They had predicted a median 12.1 per cent expansion in a Bloomberg poll. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Excluding the volatile biomedical manufacturing cluster, industrial production surged 24.1 per cent year on year, compared with December’s revised 13.1 per cent increase.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Maybank economists Chua Hak Bin and Brian Lee expect manufacturing and export growth to remain “robust” for at least the first half of 2026, due to the sustained AI investment boom.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As they see it, President Donald Trump’s higher US tariff threats are unlikely to affect the AI boom and strong electronics demand.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The timeline for implementing his previously threatened 15 per cent tariffs is uncertain and may not materialise for all countries,” they said.<strong> </strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">They reiterated Maybank’s 2026 gross domestic product growth forecast of 3.6 per cent, which stands at the upper end of the Ministry of Trade and Industry’s official forecast range of 2 to 4 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Similarly, UOB associate economist Jester Koh expects AI-related tailwinds to sustain through H1 2026 at least, underpinned by an estimated 30 per cent increase in capital expenditure by major technology firms.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">OCBC chief economist Selena Ling noted that January’s factory output figures marked the largest surge since November 2025, but said this was due to a low base effect stemming from the Chinese New Year (CNY) holidays taking place in January last year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">She said February’s industrial production prints are likely to lean lower “towards 5 per cent” as a result of the CNY holidays falling in February this year. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, she expects manufacturing momentum in Q1 2026 to stay resilient at 9.4 per cent year on year, while full-year manufacturing growth could come in at 3 per cent or even higher, depending on how long the AI boom lasts.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The latest prints come after Singapore’s manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) rose to 50.5 last month – its highest reading in 10 months – arriving on the back of sustained demand for AI related products. The electronics sector registered its eighth consecutive month of expansion.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A reading above 50 on the index indicates growth from the previous month.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Cluster performance</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">All clusters recorded growth in factory output in January, except general manufacturing and biomedical manufacturing.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The linchpin electronics sector rose 44 per cent for the month, more than doubling December’s 19.6 per cent increase. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Growth was led by the segments of other electronic modules and components, as well as semiconductors, with the latter supported by strong AI-related demand.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Maybank’s Dr Chua and Lee pointed out that semiconductor exports remain exempt from US tariffs. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Many of Singapore’s trading partners are also facing lower tariff rates for the time being with the Supreme Court’s repeal of US President Donald Trump’s International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)-based reciprocal tariffs, they noted.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Therefore, they think Asian exporters could step up frontloading to the US to capitalise on the temporarily lower tariff rates, in anticipation of fresh country-specific or product-specific tariffs. This would in turn benefit Singapore’s manufacturing sector and exports.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, DBS senior economist Chua Han Teng noted that electronics firms remain optimistic about the near-term outlook, as indicated in the recent PMI and EDB’s business expectations survey.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Of the clusters, transport engineering was the next best-performing, growing 25.2 per cent year on year. This was driven by the aerospace segment, which saw higher production of aircraft parts and sustained maintenance, repair and overhaul jobs.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Next was precision engineering, with output jumping 13.2 per cent. The cluster recorded growth in the segments of precision modules and components, as well as machinery and systems.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The chemicals cluster edged up a marginal 2.3 per cent for the month. While the other chemicals and petroleum segments recorded gains, these were partially offset by declines in the petrochemicals segment – due to weak demand and plant shutdowns – and the specialties segment, such as industrial gases.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In contrast,<strong> </strong>biomedical manufacturing recorded the biggest decline at 33.1 per cent in January. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The pharmaceuticals segment contracted on lower production of biological products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, while the medical technology segment fell due to softer demand for medical devices. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">General manufacturing declined 2.6 per cent for the month, as gains in the miscellaneous industries and printing segments were offset by declines in the food, beverages and tobacco segment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, factory output rose 5.3 per cent in January, in a turnaround from December’s 0.3 per cent decline. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Excluding biomedical manufacturing, output rose 10.8 per cent on the month, reversing from the previous month’s 2.5 per cent decline. </p></div>",
