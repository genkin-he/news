The improved showing came on the back of “higher selling prices and increased volume” in its plantation and edible oils and fats (EOF) divisions.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">At the same time, the group’s other operating expenses fell, while foreign exchange gains rose; these offset a slight decline in gross profit caused by higher palm production costs.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Earnings per share for H2 FY2025 rose to 668 rupiah from 588 rupiah previously.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The plantation segment’s revenue climbed 14 per cent amid “higher sales volume and selling prices of palm products”. However, its operating profit declined 5 per cent “due to higher palm production costs and lower fair-value gains on biological assets”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The EOF segment, meanwhile, clocked 23 per cent revenue growth through “competitive pricing strategies” and higher sales. Its operating profit fell 4 per cent year on year; the group said this was “largely due to lower income from the sale of export allocation rights”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the full year, Indofood Agri’s net profit rose 13.5 per cent to 1.3 trillion rupiah; revenue grew 31.9 per cent to 21.1 trillion rupiah.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A first and final dividend was recommended for FY2025, with details to be “announced at a later date”.

This marked a turnaround from a net loss of S$535,000 in the corresponding period the year before. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This came despite a 3.8 per cent decline in H2 revenue to S$53.1 million, down from S$55.2 million in the year-ago period. The return to profitability for the half-year was buoyed by stronger margins, as gross profit surged 34.3 per cent to S$8.7 million.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Earnings per share for the half-year stood at S$0.0127, compared to a loss per share of S$0.0055 previously.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the full year, however, the group’s net profit plunged 76.2 per cent to S$484,000, from S$2.04 million in FY2024. Full-year revenue fell 6.2 per cent to S$102 million, from S$108.7 million. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The top-line decline was mainly due to lower sales across its car sales, financing, and rental segments, though this was partially offset by higher revenue in its automobile after-sales segment. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Car sales revenue, the group’s largest contributor, fell 7.4 per cent to S$80.9 million, driven by a sharp decline in dealer floor stock sales and a slight drop in pre-owned car sales.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The sharp drop in full-year earnings was heavily weighed down by a 29.1 per cent jump in administrative expenses to S$11.1 million. This was primarily driven by S$1.1 million in one-off listing expenses related to its <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/vins-holdings-closes-16-6-above-ipo-price-sgxs-first-listing-2025\" target=\"_blank\">SGX Catalist debut in April 2025</a>, alongside higher staff costs due to an increased headcount.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Excluding the one-off listing expenses, the group said it would have recorded a profit before tax of approximately S$1.9 million for the year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">An increase in net allowance for expected credit losses also dragged on profitability, rising 36.7 per cent to S$1.1 million due to specific provisions made on certain loan exposures.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">No dividend was declared for FY2025, as the group intends to retain its earnings for capital expenditure and working capital requirements.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It expects the operating landscape to stay competitive, noting that heightened competition has increased pressure on vehicle pricing and margins. Nevertheless, management remains cautiously optimistic, citing industry tailwinds such as an anticipated increase in certificate of entitlement supply and rising consumer acceptance of electrified vehicles.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its counter ended Friday (Feb 27) unchanged at S$0.265 before the results were released.</p></div>",

The carbon footprint for manufacturing each one is around 30 per cent smaller than that for a conventional battery.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Paper batteries are also safer as they are fire-resistant; conventional batteries are made from flammable and reactive materials. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As Flint’s batteries are composed of cellulose, manganese and zinc, their production does not depend on the supply chains for the scarce resources used to manufacture conventional batteries, such as lithium and cobalt. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This allows the process to be decentralised from places where batteries are typically produced – an especially critical feature when the global battery supply chain has turned into a flashpoint for trade tensions. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Therefore, even a small country lacking natural resources such as Singapore can manufacture paper batteries, said Flint co-founder Carlo Charles. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With companies looking to move their supply chains out of China, he noted that geopolitical developments have boosted demand for Flint’s products. A large proportion of its clients, from sectors such as tech and electronics, hail from Europe and North America.  </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Supporting the clean energy transition</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In January, Flint was among more than 30 Singapore companies that showcased their products at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas – a milestone for the startup. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Flint began in 2019 as a passion project, driven by Charles’ desire to create a more sustainable alternative to conventional batteries, which are key components in the world’s transition to green energy. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“One of the most important aspects for climate change is clean energy, and to… transition (the world) to green energy, you really need to use a lot of batteries,” he said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“(The fact that) the batteries that we’re using today are not green themselves is such an irony.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Flint was incorporated in 2021 and today counts household names such as Amazon and Logitech among its clients. It is run by a 10-strong team and operates from an 8,000-square-foot space at 8 CleanTech Loop. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The company takes on projects to build batteries for specific applications based on customers’ requests, including energy storage systems, toys and consumer electronics such as mobile phones, tablets and laptops, Charles said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Within the next five years, Flint intends to scale its production and get its batteries into every device that requires them, the co-founder added, noting that it hopes to develop batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“EVs are like the holy grail that we want... but we are not focusing on that yet.” He said that EV battery production requires gigafactories that need considerable amounts of money, resources and capital to be built. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For now, manufacturing constraints present a barrier to scalability. “The harsh truth of building a hard-tech company (is that) it really boils down to production.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Flint makes batteries at its office and lab in Singapore, where around five million units can be produced each year. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Charles said that the startup is looking to build a facility in Europe that will expand its production to around 300 million batteries a year. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Profitability on the horizon </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With Flint expected to reach profitability this year, the goal is for the company to sustain its own growth, he said, although he is not closed off to funding. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He noted that Flint has completed its seed and pre-Series A rounds of fundraising, and now has sufficient funds to scale. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I guess the key reason is we don’t want to dilute ourselves too much. As a founder, I want to focus on what matters, (which is) the products and the innovation.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Going public is not off the table either, but the company has no plans for an initial public offering anytime soon, he added. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Plans beyond batteries  </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In the longer term, his vision is for Flint to venture beyond batteries and tackle other environmental issues. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“In the next 10 years, our goal is to really focus on other problems that the world has, and to try to solve those... The main reason I started (this) was to combat climate change with technology, and batteries are really just the first step.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He said the areas the company could explore next are carbon capture and storage technology, or problems such as plastic pollution and ocean acidification. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“There’s a lot of things that we can focus on, but I guess I’m trying my best to not get diverted and lose focus. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I have a lot of ideas that I’m just keeping in my journal, but at the end of the day, I’m 100 per cent focused on Flint’s strategy for batteries today.” </p></div>",
