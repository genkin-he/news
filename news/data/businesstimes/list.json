This weighed down its second-half net profit.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But group president and chief executive officer Vincent Chong noted on Friday (Feb 27) at ST Engineering’s full-year results briefing that activity is picking up in 2026, with more orders secured and cost cuts under way as the company focuses on turning the business around.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Our priority remains supporting customers, executing the turnaround and evaluating the strategic path forward for the Satcom business,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even as it evaluates “strategic actions” for the business, ST Engineering has implemented S$43 million in annualised cost savings for the Satcom unit.

Urban solutions drove the improvement, which was partially offset by lower Satcom contributions.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">ST Engineering reported a net profit of S$59.9 million for H2 FY2025, an 83.6 per cent decline from S$365.7 million in the previous corresponding period.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The group’s revenue came in at S$6.4 billion for the half-year, up from S$5.8 billion in H2 FY2024.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Earnings per share for FY2025 stood at S$0.1484. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Growth driven by defence and aerospace</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As the group irons out its urban solutions and Satcom business, its other two segments – commercial aerospace, and defence and public security – posted higher profits in FY2025.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">ST Engineering’s commercial aerospace profits for H2 rose to S$319 million, from S$210.5 million in the year-ago period. The segment’s revenue increased 23 per cent to S$2.6 billion, from S$2.2 billion the previous year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This growth was contributed by stronger sales from engines, MRO (maintenance, repair and operations) and nacelles,” said Cedric Foo, group chief financial officer of ST Engineering.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The defence and public security segment reported S$551.4 million in H2 earnings, up from S$311.9 the previous year. Its revenue stood at S$2.7 billion, rising 5 per cent on the year from S$2.6 billion.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the full year, commercial aerospace accounted for 40 per cent of the group’s revenue, and defence and public security made up 43 per cent. The urban solutions and Satcom segment contributed 16 per cent of the revenue.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Overall, ST Engineering’s revenue stood at S$12.3 billion for FY2025, up 9.5 per cent from S$11.3 billion in FY2024.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Full-year net profit fell 34.1 per cent year on year to S$462.8 million, from S$702.3 million. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nonetheless, the group’s fiscal outlook remains positive.

In 2025 alone, the number jumped to 135, with about 16 per cent of them complaints about issues such as shipment delays and increased regulatory burdens. The rate of complaints nearly doubled in early 2026.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The actual number of queries from exporters is likely to be orders of magnitude larger as there are several private channels these companies can use, including contacting provincial and municipal commerce bureaux, many of which do not have public query platforms like the central government’s commerce ministry.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The official responses to the queries from Chinese exporters have been vague and formulaic, stopping short of confirming whether any individual product, from rare-Earth magnets to medical materials, required a licence.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The enforcement push is also legal and bureaucratic. Since China enacted its Export Control Law in October 2020, it has introduced or expanded export control measures 29 times, compared to just six times between 2015-2020.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Recruitment documents show 45 commerce ministry posts available in this year’s national civil-service examination could be assigned to export-control-related work, compared with 11 such vacancies in both 2022 and 2023.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Dozens of provincial and municipal governments have organised compliance seminars and policy briefings over the past year, while Beijing has convened national export-control work conferences bringing officials from across the country to the capital.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Beijing’s October 2025 revision to its rare-Earth export-control regime reflected lessons from the US Foreign Direct Product Rule, which allows Washington to assert jurisdiction over certain foreign-made goods produced with American technology.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“China’s use of rare earths as leverage is completely learned from the West – especially the US,” said Li Xing, professor at the Guangdong Institute for International Strategies, a think tank in Guangzhou.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China dominates the processing of rare earths, the conversion of ore into refined oxides and metals used in electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence systems, a chokepoint deeper in the supply chain than mining itself.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its new licensing system reaches into processing and downstream incorporation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This is not just a supply chain shortage.
