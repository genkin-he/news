            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">I WAS recently deepfaked.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Photographs and videos fabricated by artificial intelligence (AI) – deepfakes purporting to be me in suggestive poses – appeared on TikTok and showed up on the feed of a colleague, who alerted me immediately. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One synthetic video showed this AI-generated version of “me” coquettishly manoeuvring into a sitting position on the floor, barely hiding what was under the micro miniskirt. Readers who remember the iconic scene in the movie <em>Basic Instinct</em>, where Sharon Stone crosses and uncrosses her legs, will get the idea.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">All the deepfake photos and videos were manipulated from authentic photos of me taken from TSMP’s corporate website or legitimate publications where I had appeared. I counted six offending images. On my son’s feed, he found 11. A screenshot of the offending TikTok account sent by my colleague showed yet more deepfaked images that did not appear on my device.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">I’m a woman lawyer in her 50s. I am not active on TikTok, barely share anything on Instagram, have a disabled Telegram account, and mainly use Linkedin to discuss business and community issues. In short, I am not a “high-risk” Internet user; I do not indiscriminately share revealing images that would supposedly make someone a more likely target for such assaults. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">If this can happen to me, it can happen to anyone with an online presence.  </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">The survivor’s reaction</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">I do volunteer work in the area of online harms. Three years ago, I founded SG Her Empowerment (SHE) which established Singapore’s – and Asia’s – first dedicated support centre for victims of online harms, providing counselling support, pro bono legal advice and direct assistance in reporting harms to Internet companies. SHE also conducts research into survivor experience. All this is to say that I am not unfamiliar with the deep psychological impact that such harms can have.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But that didn’t stop the feeling of dread when I learnt about the deepfakes of me circulating on the Internet. Or the slight catch of breath as I hit “play” on my phone and waited for the video to load. Then came palpable relief that there was no nudity.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The strongest, and most enduring, reaction was the feeling of being violated – violent and visceral. Who would do this? Is this some jerk’s idea of funny?</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">We tell survivors it is never their fault. They didn’t ask for this. But the self-blame followed quickly: “It’s your fault for putting yourself out there”. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">And finally, the question of who. Was it someone who hates me? Or was it just a bot randomly picking photos off the Internet and using them for clickbait? As horrible as the thought was that someone out there bore me this degree of animus, that would almost be better than the alternative: my image pimped out by a machine to garner views. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">What to do if it happens to you</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Chances are the offending post has breached community guidelines of the social media platform. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">To start the content removal process, go to the post and choose “Report”. On TikTok, pull-down menus asked for the reason. In my case, it was Misinformation. Do this for all the offending posts. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Get your friends to do the same to multiply the number of reports the platform receives. Internet companies use technology and algorithms to sift through the millions of in-app reports they get daily. The more reports they get on a post, the faster the reaction time. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Next, I sought the help of SHE, which is a “trusted flagger” with the major Internet companies and helps survivors make reports directly to them. Reports made by the SHECARES Centre on behalf of complainants will be dealt with by a human being at the Internet company, and not just an algorithm, speeding up the response.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, it took four days for the offending content to be taken down, and the user account to be disabled. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">And that doesn’t wipe the images from the Internet. A search on Google still showed the images even after the TikTok account had been removed and pictures were no longer accessible there. Now you have to send a report to Google to ask for the offending images to be removed from search results. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Bystanders’ response</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As our society grapples with the growing scourge of and surge in online harms, how the community reacts is crucial.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Thankfully, I had friends who knew how to offer support.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This is awful. I’m so sorry it has happened to you. You didn’t ask for this and it’s not your fault. Here’s how to make an immediate in-app report to start the take-down process. I will also report on my end so that the platform gets multiple points of feedback that the image is deepfaked.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A good friend who had reminded me how to start the take-down process sent me this message: “I hang my head in shame that my first instinct was to fix the problem and not ask how you are doing. I’m so sorry.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">First responders play an important part in framing the survivor’s mindset and rebuilding their self-confidence.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But sometimes, the response from others can make things worse.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">I had written about the incident on Linkedin. Victims of online assaults report an overwhelming loss of agency. Writing about my experience, hoping it would help others, was a way to regain some of that control.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">I received an e-mail a few days later. A local journalist had read my Linkedin post and posed some questions. The e-mail did not explain how the article would be crafted and ended with an instruction: “Please keep my colleagues copied in your reply”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Perhaps the journalist was so direct because by posting about the experience on Linkedin, I had put myself “out there”. Or, there is a sense that online attacks are not as harmful as physical ones. Both are common bystander responses, and both are untrue. If this is what survivors go through, it would explain their hesitation to engage with the media. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Survivors’ remedies</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Apart from the actions I took, there are no legal remedies currently available to someone who has been deepfaked. The law was written in a time before Internet harms had sprung into malignant life. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">If TikTok had not removed the content, there is little I could have done about it. And even if there was an avenue of legal recourse, without knowing the identity of the person who had posted the content, I have no one to hold legally accountable.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But the law is changing. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Online Safety (Relief and Accountability) Bill (OSRA) is currently making its way through Parliament. If passed, someone in my position will have new avenues of recourse.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">First, if appropriate action is not taken by the Internet company in a timely manner, the survivor could then bring the case to the Online Safety Commission (OSC), a new government agency to be set up. The OSC has power to direct the Internet platform to take down the offending content within a certain time frame. Hopefully, this means that the four days my images stayed publicly accessible could be reduced. SHE’s studies show that speed of content removal is the most pressing concern of survivors. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The OSC can also order the Internet platform to provide details within its possession of the identity of the user behind the account where the content was uploaded, and make that information available to the survivor.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The new Act will create statutory torts, making certain online actions a civil wrong, for which the complainant can sue the perpetrator. These include intimate image abuse, image-based child abuse and online impersonation. In my case, I would have an action under the new tort of inauthentic material abuse and could seek civil remedies, applying to the OSC to obtain information about the person(s) behind the faceless user account.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">This is only the beginning</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">What happened to me was not a one-off. On the same site, another woman professional from Singapore whom I know had a similarly doctored video of her. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">According to a study by Italian cybersecurity company DeepTrace in 2019, 96 per cent of online deepfake videos were pornographic and nonconsensual. US cybersecurity firm, Home Security Heroes, reported in a 2023 study that deepfake porn constitutes 98 per cent of all deepfake videos online, with 99 per cent of them targeting women. The study found 95,820 deepfake videos online, a 550 per cent increase from 2019. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Deepfakes are a good business proposition for bad actors. How easy would it be to program a bot to trawl the net for images of individuals with means, and send them a pornographic video with a threat of posting it publicly unless an extortion payment is made? This can be done in seconds, with little human intervention, targeting multiple individuals. If the quantum is small, people might be scared into paying off the perpetrators. Leaders in business, government and the community might command higher ransoms. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Singapore’s forward-thinking laws are a welcome move to improve cyber accountability but policing the Internet is a quagmire. OSRA, progressive as it is, will be hard to enforce overseas or against anyone hiding behind a VPN (virtual private network). An Internet company with no Singapore operations may not comply with the OSC’s directions. For a long time, even governments could not contact the operators of a heavily used messenger app. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Countries adopting differing approaches to tackling online harms means fragmented enforcement. Also, legal enforcement necessarily happens after the harm has occurred, so victims still suffer the mental and emotional toll. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Having OSRA spell out the categories of wrongful online activity will help the community define where the line between acceptable and harmful is drawn, but clarity in moral standards will not deter intentional bad actors. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Internet should be a great equaliser – providing access to information and learning for the less advantaged. But if harmful activity starts to pull people back from engaging on the Internet, that promise of progress suffers. Fixing this is a tall order but if we don’t try, the bad guys win. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>The writer is joint managing partner, TSMP Law Corp, and chairperson of SG Her Empowerment</strong></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[SINGAPORE] About 15 counter staff of Twelve Cupcakes met at the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) Services Centre at Bendemeer Road on Friday (Oct 31) morning to ask about outstanding salaries and payments owed to them by the shuttered cupcake business. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This comes a day after Twelve Cupcakes <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/twelve-cupcakes-shutters-bakery-chain-provisional-liquidation\" target=\"_blank\">announced it had closed down</a> and has gone into provisional liquidation. Affected employees earlier told <em>The Business Times </em>that they were informed of the closure via WhatsApp at 8 pm on Wednesday, with a termination letter accompanying the message. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">No further details were provided by Twelve Cupcakes on the matter. The liquidator, AAG Corporate Advisory, said it is unable to provide details on operations, finances or the reasons for the liquidation before obtaining the relevant information, in response to BT queries on Thursday.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One of Twelve Cupcakes’ outlet managers told BT outside the MOM Services Centre on Friday that the decision to shutter the company came to its staff with zero warning. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We did not know anything (about this) in advance. There was no notice period at all,” he said. “With so many bills to pay, starting with our rent – what are we going to do now?” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He added that the main concern among employees now is the salaries they are owed for October, on top of compensation for the sudden termination of employment, especially since the 30-day notice period was not abided by. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Others BT spoke to on Friday said this is particularly pressing as many affected have rent due at the end of the month. Most said they are expected to foot their rent by Friday or Saturday – or risk facing eviction or incurring late charges.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Those who are foreign workers also said they have debts to repay back home; others have to pay tuition fees for their children.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Some workers noted that Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions were not credited to their accounts for October. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Specific representatives of the counter staff group were addressed by MOM staff in closed-door meetings. These workers told BT after these meetings that they were informed that local unions would handle all compensation-related matters. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">They added that a separate meeting with union members has been set up for next week, though a fixed date and time have yet to be confirmed. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As for S-Pass holders, no extension will be given, which means such affected workers will have 30 days to find a new job in Singapore, or they will have to return to their home country. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Affected workers who gathered at the MOM Service Centre on Friday comprised those on S-Passes, Work Permits and Long-term Visit Passes, as well as Singapore citizens. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We understand that the liquidation will take some time, but we do (at the very least) have to receive our salaries for the month of October today so we can continue covering our basic expenses in Singapore, and to feed our families,” one told BT. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the time being, the group of counter staff are putting together a page to raise donations.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We are truly hoping for the best by next week – and we hope the government can help us in our current situation,” the outlet manager said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A representative from home-grown eatery The Soup Spoon reached out to BT on Friday, offering to assist affected Twelve Cupcakes workers with available job opportunities. The business has store openings lined up starting from next week, with several full-time and part-time positions to fill.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Food, Drinks and Allied Workers Union (FDAWU) on Thursday <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/unacceptable-and-unfair-union-raps-twelve-cupcakes-abrupt-closure-axing-80-workers\" target=\"_blank\">criticised the cupcake’s business’ abrupt closure as “unacceptable and unfair”</a>, strongly objecting to the business owner’s lack of prior consultation and advance notice. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">FDAWU said it will be assisting members and workers with salary-related claims and job-assistance support, as well as connecting them to the labour movement’s network, such as NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">MOM issued a joint statement with CPF Board (CPFB) on Friday evening, noting that the actions of Twelve Cupcakes in this case were “irresponsible” and not aligned with the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Despite being a unionised company under the FDAWU, Twelve Cupcakes did not engage the union early, before affected employees were notified,” they explained. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Taskforce for Responsible Retrenchment and Employment Facilitation, which comprises MOM, Workforce Singapore, the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), and NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute (e2i), is working closely with Twelve Cupcakes and the FDAWU to support the affected employees, said MOM and CPFB. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This will include working with Twelve Cupcakes to provide job matching support and career coaching for these employees.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management will also assist employees of Twelve Cupcakes who need to file a Proof of Debt for their salary and other employment claims with the liquidator. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CPFB, in addition, will be filing a Proof of Debt with the liquidator to recover the outstanding CPF contributions for September and October this year. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">MOM also stated that it is investigating the company’s non-payment of salaries and other potential breaches of the Employment Act. </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[HOUSTON] Oil prices settled slightly higher after a wild trading session on Friday (Oct 31), popping up as media reports said US air strikes on Venezuela could begin within hours and then retreating after US President Donald Trump issued a denial on social media. Brent crude futures settled at US$65.07 a barrel, up 7 cents, or 0.11. US West Texas Intermediate crude finished  at US$60.98 a barrel, up 41 cents, or 0.68 per cent. “Is this Donald Trump’s trick or treat?“ said Phil Flynn, senior analyst for Price Futures Group. He noted that earlier this year, Trump denied reports of a planned attack on Iran before carrying out airstrikes against the Islamic Republic.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“There definitely was an impact on the market when the first report of a planned attack on Venezuela came out,” Flynn said. “If there is an attack over the weekend, prices will spike on Monday.” The US has deployed a task force centered around the nation’s largest aircraft carrier, Gerald Ford, off the coast of Venezuela, far beyond the needs of attacking drug traffickers on small boats, the focus of US naval activity in the Caribbean in recent weeks. “It’s pretty clear something is afoot there,” said John Kilduff, partner with Again Capital LLC. “For oil traders, it’s a classic situation of buy now and ask questions later.” The US dollar was near three-month highs against major currencies, making purchases of dollar-denominated commodities such as oil more expensive. Meanwhile, sources told Reuters that Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, may reduce its December crude price for Asian buyers to multi-month lows, sounding a bearish note. Oil slipped after an official survey showed China’s factory activity shrank for a seventh month in October.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Brent and WTI are set to fall 2.6 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively, in October with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and major non-Opec producers ramping up output. More supply will also cushion the impact of Western sanctions disrupting Russian oil exports to its top buyers China and India. A Reuters survey forecast Brent will average US$67.99 per barrel in 2025, about 38 cents above last month’s estimate. WTI is expected to average US$64.83, slightly above September’s estimate of US$64.39. Opec+ is leaning toward a modest output boost in December, people familiar with the talks said ahead of the group’s meeting on Sunday. Kilduff said most of the Opec+ members except for Saudi Arabia were unable to add much to their production.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Pretty much there is nothing they can add that is going to be meaningful beyond what the Saudis can do,” Kilduff said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In August, Saudi Arabia’s crude exports hit a six-month high of 6.407 million bpd, data from the Joint Organization Data Initiative showed. A US Energy Information Administration report also showed record production of 13.6 million bpd last week.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump said on Thursday that China has agreed to begin the process of purchasing US energy and that a very large-scale transaction may take place involving the purchase of oil and gas from Alaska.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, analysts remained skeptical as to whether the US-China trade deal will boost Chinese demand for US energy.
