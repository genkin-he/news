            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">HOUSTON – Is the US economy in hot water or is it the “hottest economy in the world”, as President Donald Trump likes to say in nearly every speech?</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That is a key question now that Mr Trump has invoked a law designed to be used when the US economy is in serious crisis, in order to impose  a new global tariff of 10 per cent  on nearly all goods imported into the US – including from Singapore.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">These tariffs – imposed in the wake of a US Supreme Court ruling on Feb 20 that declared most of Mr Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs illegal – have been imposed under Section 122 of the US Trade Act of 1974. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It is a power granted by Congress as a remedy – the tariffs can only last for up to 150 days – when the US economy experiences “large and serious balance-of-payments deficits” or faces “imminent and significant depreciation of the dollar”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Except, most economists concur that the US is facing no such crisis. And legal experts predict imminent suits in the Court of International Trade in Washington, challenging the use of a statute that no president has invoked until now. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The tariff is especially jarring when it comes to Singapore, a free trade partner and one of the few Asian economies with which the US has consistently run a trade surplus. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The US-Singapore trade relationship speaks to US export strength in high-value items like semiconductors, aircraft parts and pharmaceuticals, and adds nothing to the US$1.2 trillion trade deficit that is a sore point for Mr Trump.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The US surplus with Singapore actually helps its balance of payments, and Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry said it would engage US counterparts to seek clarity on the new tariffs.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Experts also question if Section 122 is a blunt tool that allows for a uniform global surcharge.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Most trade professionals do not see Section 122 as a blanket tariff as is now being applied,” said Mr Frank Lavin, the US ambassador to Singapore from 2001 to 2005 who played a key role in negotiating the 2004 US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“So I do not see Section 122 applying in general, and it would be very hard to make the case it should apply to Singapore,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The law does not take into account country-specific realities, like the goods trade surplus of US$3.6 billion the US racked up with Singapore in 2025, said Mr Manu Bhaskaran, a partner of Centennial Group International and the founding director and chief executive of Centennial Asia Advisors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I could be wrong, but I think Section 122 allows tariffs against all countries in the event of a balance of payments crisis, whether that country has a deficit or surplus with the US,” he said, calling it “collateral damage” for Singapore in the current period of trade turbulence.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The US has frequently claimed that the Singapore exchange rate is undervalued, he pointed out. “That claim could still be used against Singapore, even though it is debatable,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Monetary Authority of Singapore adjusts the Singapore dollar’s trading band against a basket of currencies to control imported inflation and keep exports affordable, which is crucial for a small, open economy where trade exceeds 300 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The US Treasury has sometimes questioned this approach.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In the event that Section 122 is eventually struck down by courts, problems may remain.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For instance, the US could double up on sectoral tariffs. “Such tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals would hurt Singapore,” Mr Bhaskaran said, adding that there is little likelihood of a return to the FTA days of zero duties, given the current political trends in the US.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Mr Lavin, the former US ambassador to Singapore, is now a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and said a court victory may not be very meaningful.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Even if the courts disallow it, the tariff will be intact for a number of months and it lets Trump side-step the defeat (handed by) the Supreme Court ruling,” he said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But the Trump administration could well be preparing to give some ground, he added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“My sense is that the administration is internally wrestling with the point – do we back down from policy rigidity or do we have the appetite for more friction?</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“They still have to come to terms with the Supreme Court rebuke and the likelihood of new tariffs also being declared illegal,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“And I suspect Trump is looking for a way to move away from this issue without appearing to back down. Trump tends to begin with confrontation but then he adjusts to reality.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Can the US ever be in a payments crisis?</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Is the US really in a serious balance-of-payment crisis of the kind seen in Asia?</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Sri Lanka was the most recent country to face a full-blown balance-of-payments crisis, defaulting on external debt in April 2022 amid depleted foreign exchange reserves, soaring inflation and an inability to finance imports.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">No East Asian territory has come close since the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, when the Thai baht collapsed and the contagion spread quickly to Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea and Hong Kong.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But in pursuing Section 122 tariffs, the US contends it actually is in crisis.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In his Feb 20 proclamation, Mr Trump laid the basis for tariffs this way: “I have been informed by my advisers that the US balance-of-payments position, under any reasonable understanding of the term in the context of section 122, is currently a large and serious deficit.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Simply put, a balance-of-payments crisis happens when a country runs out of foreign money to pay for imports, debts or other overseas bills.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Countries earn foreign exchange from their exports, tourism or through overseas investors. They spend it on imports, repaying loans or sending money abroad for instance as investments or remittances. If the spending keeps outpacing earnings, problems begin to build up.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A balance-of payments crisis is triggered when lenders suddenly pull back, refusing new loans. Or a country’s foreign reserves dwindle to a point that crashes its currency.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Mr Trump’s contention is that the US is in such a scenario. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The US runs a trade deficit, does not currently make a net income from the capital and labour that it deploys abroad and experiences more transfer payments, on net, flowing out of the country than into the country,” he said in the proclamation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A trade deficit contributes to a balance-of-payments crisis by creating a drain on a country’s foreign exchange reserves when imports exceed exports over time.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Mr Trump noted that the “large, persistent and serious” annual US goods trade deficit has grown by over 40 per cent in the past 5 years alone, reaching $1.2 trillion in 2024 and remaining there in 2025.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This deficit contributes to the fundamental international payments problems facing the US,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He also spoke about other trends he said can endanger the ability of the US to finance its spending, erode investor confidence in the economy and distress the financial markets.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He noted changes in the country’s current account that shows its net transactions with the rest of the world in goods, services, primary income (like investment earnings) and secondary income (like remittances or aid).</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The annual balance on the primary income turned negative in 2024 for the first time since at least 1960, he noted. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“From 1960 to 2023, the US ran a surplus in its annual balance on primary income. That positive balance on primary income served as a stabilising force for the US balance-of-payments position even in the face of large and persistent trade deficits,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“In 2024, however, the balance on primary income turned negative and thus ceased to serve as a counterweight to the trade deficit in the US current account,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The current account deficit was at 4 per cent of GDP in 2024, the biggest since 2008, Mr Trump noted.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Mr Bhaskaran said while US goods trade deficits have been around for a long time, the US does better on services trade, which means the current account is in only a small deficit as a percentage of GDP. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">And this current account deficit is usually offset by large capital inflows so that the overall balance of payments is not in deficit and certainly not in a crisis, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“There is no evidence of a crisis – the dollar is not collapsing, holders of US dollar assets are not selling in a panic, and foreign investment in US hard assets as well as financial assets continues,” said Mr Bhaskaran.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In the US, it is difficult to imagine balance-of-payment crises taking place, said Dr Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, an audit, tax and advisory services firm that has an affiliate in Singapore.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“When the US dollar was pegged to gold, one could end up in a significant balance-of-payment crisis. But when the US went off gold and then abrogated the Bretton Woods arrangements in 1973, it moved to a floating regime where you don’t have a balance of payments crisis,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This is because a floating currency automatically adjusts to imbalances, preventing reserve depletion.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Moreover, global finance runs on US dollars. At the end of each day, banks worldwide need up to US$13 trillion in short-term cash, he said. They get it by using US treasuries, dollar bonds, as collateral. “So, the US has enormous structural power that makes the idea of a balance-of- payments crisis a non-starter,” he added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nor is an outsized, steep depreciation of the dollar happening or about to happen, he said, rebutting Mr Trump’s other claim.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Dollar dominance is for real, he said, with the US dollar accounting for about 60 per cent of global currency reserves and 90 per cent of forex trades.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We have US$9 trillion churn every single day in global currency markets. The US dollar is around 90 per cent of those trades,” he said. <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/hard-to-make-the-case-for-new-us-global-tariffs-to-apply-to-singapore-ex-us-envoy\" target=\"_blank\">THE STRAITS TIMES</a></p></div>",

This will be probably your only chance for generations.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The U.S. military initiated a series of strikes against targets in Iran, two U.S. officials told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. The scope of the air and sea operations was not immediately clear. The campaign is expected to last for multiple days, said a U.S. official.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Iran was preparing a crushing retaliation, an Iranian official told Reuters.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump had built up a vast U.S. military presence in the region to try to force Tehran to make concessions in nuclear talks.
