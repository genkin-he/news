It will automatically compute the estimated LBC from key inputs and allow for scenario testing under different development options. This will give developers “greater certainty” when working out their costs, Tong said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Rates are announced twice a year following a review by SLA, in consultation with the taxman’s chief valuer. They are based on the chief valuer’s assessment of land values and take into account recent land sales. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The LBC framework has also been refined to provide solar operators with greater transparency and certainty, said Tong. Since Sep 1, 2025, solar deployments have been classified under utility use, allowing charges to be calculated using the table of rates instead of spot valuations. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Authorities have moved up the start of the valuation process for cases requiring a spot assessment. The change was in response to feedback on longer timelines for such cases, and could cut project timelines by up to six months, said Tong. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">SLA will continue to review and update its core processes to reduce processing times and administrative burden for developers, landowners and the broader real estate sector, Tong added. </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[BENGALURU] E-commerce giant Coupang swung to a fourth-quarter loss on Thursday (Feb 26)and reported revenue below analysts’ estimates, hurt by the fallout from a data breach in South Korea.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Coupang Korea, which generates more than 90 per cent of the group’s total revenue, has faced a public backlash following the disclosure of a data breach in November involving some 34 million customers.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The company’s revenue for the October to December period came in at US$8.8 billion, compared with an US$8.9 billion forecast from LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted towards analysts who are more consistently accurate.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The company swung to a loss of US$26 million in the fourth quarter from a year-earlier profit. Coupang’s New York-listed shares closed up 1.9 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On an earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Gaurav Anand said active customers in its product commerce segment rose 8 per cent from a year earlier to 24.6 million in the fourth quarter, though they fell from 24.7 million in the previous quarter, which appeared to be related to the data breach.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We are seeing stabilisation since the end of the fourth quarter, with a large number of customers reactivating their accounts and improving trends in customer growth,” Anand said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He added that constant-currency growth in its product commerce segment likely reached its lowest level in January, at about 4 per cent, before showing signs of improvement in February. For the first quarter, Coupang expects consolidated constant-currency revenue growth of 5 to 10 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Anand said that growth and profitability would remain muted over the next few months, reflecting the lingering fallout from the data breach, though the impact should gradually diminish over the course of the year.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Data breach downfall</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The company has said that the breach exposed users’ names, phone numbers, and shipping addresses, although payment details or login credentials were not compromised. Coupang said it would “take all necessary steps to prevent further harm and continue strengthening safeguards to prevent a recurrence”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Harold Rogers, the interim head of Coupang’s South Korean business, said the company has not detected a misuse of customer data attributable to the incident and has found no evidence to date of “any secondary harm”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Rogers added that the breach stemmed from a targeted attack carried out by a former employee who leveraged inside knowledge of Coupang’s systems, citing the findings of a cybersecurity firm’s investigation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, South Korea’s Science Ministry said this month that the breach stemmed from management failures at Coupang rather than a sophisticated cyberattack.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Since the incident, its rivals have jumped in to lure shoppers away from the platform.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It also faces headwinds from a proposed regulatory change that could increase competition in ultra-fast overnight deliveries, which have been a cornerstone of its market dominance.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Separately, earlier on Thursday, South Korea’s antitrust regulator fined Coupang 2.2 billion won (S$1.9 million) for pressuring suppliers to cut prices and shoulder additional costs to meet profit margins, as well as for delaying payments to vendors. The fine is unrelated to the data breach. REUTERS</p></div>",

This will give them confidence in pursuing real estate as a major and long-term career path, said Redas.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Speaking at the association’s annual Spring Festival lunch on Friday (Feb 27), Redas president Tan Swee Yiow said around 40 organisations – from public agencies and developers, to financial institutions, trade associations and consultants – have already expressed interest to participate in the programme. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">These include the Building and Construction Authority,<!-- --> <!-- --> City Developments Limited<!-- --> <!-- -->,<!-- --> <!-- --> DBS<!-- --> <!-- -->, <!-- --> <!-- -->Frasers Property<!-- --> <!-- -->, <!-- --> <!-- -->GuocoLand<!-- --> <!-- --> and <!-- --> <!-- -->Keppel<!-- --> <!-- -->.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Over 50 internship opportunities have been committed to date, Tan said. Roles offered cover asset management, commercial leasing, fintech, project development and more. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This sends a strong signal that the industry is united and committed about investing in future talent,” said Tan. “We hope more organisations can join us in the months ahead… We also welcome other institutes of higher learning to roll out similar programmes.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The move comes amid declining enrolment in real estate studies. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In a letter to Redas members dated Feb 9, Tan and his predecessor Chia Ngiang Hong noted that the real estate major has been in direct competition with other business disciplines for student interest since being folded into the NUS Business School. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This has raised concerns about the real estate programme’s long-term sustainability, as well as the pipeline of formally trained graduates for the sector. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The issue is pressing as students are set to select their majors in May, they said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“While we recognise that individual organisations may already have their own talent programmes, we hope that by consolidating the opportunities across the industry, Redas can present a clearer, more coordinated signal,” said the two.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“This effort will help students better appreciate the scale, diversity and long-term career pathways within the real estate sector.” </p></div>",
