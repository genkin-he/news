US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth also met with defence ministers from both countries on Friday.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The accord, essentially a joint declaration, reaffirmed both countries’ commitment to resolving their border dispute through established bilateral mechanisms and outlined concrete steps to rebuild trust, including the withdrawal of heavy and destructive weapons from border areas.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said the agreement was an important outcome that would lay the groundwork for lasting peace and help mend bilateral ties. Cambodian leader Hun Manet said his country was committed to implementing the joint declaration to ensure peace. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Friday, Cambodia and Thailand signed an agreement on the removal of heavy and destructive weapons and equipment, and both parties reaffirmed their strong commitment to fully and effectively implementing the outcome document, according to Maly Socheata, a spokeswoman for Cambodia’s defence ministry. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Cambodia hoped this positive step would contribute to the joint efforts of both countries to promote peace, stability, and a return to normalcy in the near future, she said in a statement. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Five days of intense fighting between Thai and Cambodian forces in July, involving fighter jets, missiles, and heavy artillery, killed more than 40 people and displaced hundreds of thousands from border areas in both countries. Land crossings that serve as vital trade routes have also remained restricted. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Although a ceasefire was reached in July, the two sides had continued to station troops and weaponry along their roughly 800-kilometre  border. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Thai-Cambodian conflict traces its roots to long-standing tensions stemming from colonial-era maps and treaties that defined their shared border. Relations had remained relatively stable after 2011 clashes that left dozens dead, before erupting again in the intense fighting in July.  BLOOMBERG</p></div>",

Its earnings recovered in the latest quarter, driven by conventional memory chip demand.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This week it said it sells its current-generation HBM3E chips to “all related customers”, indicating it has joined rivals in supplying the latest 12-layer HBM3E chips to Nvidia.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The launch of HBM4 chips will be a major test of Samsung’s ability to regain its edge in the market, analysts said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">HBM – a type of dynamic random access memory (Dram) standard first produced in 2013 – involves stacking chips vertically to save space and reduce power consumption, as well as helping to process the large volume of data generated by complex AI applications.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Investors are watching for whether Samsung’s HBM4 can cut SK Hynix’s lead in advanced memory chips.

It also snaps a brief stabilisation in sales seen a month earlier. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China’s housing slump has dragged on for more than four years, with sales falling further since the second quarter.

Transactions by value may drop another 7 to 10 per cent next year, she added. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A group of academics led by an adviser to the country’s central bank last month urged Beijing to stabilise important traditional sectors including real estate, including using fiscal support, echoing calls of other prominent economists. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, the prospect of a strong easing package is growing dim after Asia’s largest economy expanded faster than expected in the third quarter, laying a foundation for achieving policymakers’ full-year expansion goal. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Real estate policies could “focus on risk prevention through market forces, execution of local easing and urban renewals,” Citigroup analysts led by Griffin Chan wrote in an October report.

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[SINGAPORE] Metal manufacturer Nam Lee Pressed Metal Industries’ managing director, Eric Yong, was interviewed by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB), the company said in a bourse filing on Friday (Oct 31).</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The interview was over a whistle-blowing report which concerned certain allegations against Yong, which the company did not disclose. Yong has not been charged and his passport has not impounded. He has been informed by CPIB that he is free to travel.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Based on information provided by Yong, “it appears that” the allegations are the same as what was previously raised in a whistle-blowing report received by the Audit Committee (AC) in FY2024 ended Sep 30, Nam Lee said. The AC had referred it to the internal auditors who concluded that nothing has surfaced or indicated a need for further investigation. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, in the course of the internal auditors’ investigations, procedural lapses and control gaps in operational matters were uncovered and reported to the AC, said the company. The AC then highlighted the issues to management, and the required remedial actions have been undertaken, it added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">These actions were done in the course of reviewing the whistle-blowing report back in 2024, and two different independent professional services firms were appointed to review the work and findings. RSM SG Risk Advisory was the internal auditor and EY was the external auditor for Nam Lee.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Guided by these, the independent directors were unanimously of the view that the 2024 review had adequately addressed the allegations raised in the 2024 whistle-blowing report, and that no further action on the 2024 review was warranted,” said Nam Lee.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In light of the CPIB interview, Yong has recused himself from deliberations and decisions of the nominating committee (NC), of which he, as an executive director, is a member. Yong is also the cousin of executive director Adrian Yong and chairman Joanna Yong. Adrian Yong has also recused himself from the NC relating to this announcement.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The NC has concluded that Eric Yong can continue in his role as the managing director, with “no new factual information” that would cast doubt on his character or integrity, said Nam Lee. The company does not expect the present allegations to lead to a material financial impact.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The NC thus considers that there is no immediate necessity to implement any particular precautionary steps in respect of managing director at this juncture,” said Nam Lee.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Shares of Nam Lee closed unchanged at S$0.565 on Friday, before the announcement.</p></div>",
