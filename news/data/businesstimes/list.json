According to Pollack, this requires the case to be dismissed.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores were both forcibly removed from Venezuela by US forces in January. Days later they appeared in court in New York where both pleaded not guilty. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Because Maduro and Venezuela are under US sanctions, Pollack requires a license from the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control to send funds for the ousted president’s defence, the lawyer said. But OFAC “appears unwilling” or “has been instructed” not to issue such a license.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A spokesman for the Manhattan US Attorney’s office, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Treasury department didn’t respond to requests for comment. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pollack said Venezuelan law requires the government in Caracas to pay Maduro’s legal fees, and officials there are willing to do so.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I have relied on this expectation and cannot afford to pay for my own legal defence,” Maduro said in a signed declaration accompanying the court filing.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pollack told the court that counsel for Maduro and Flores both applied for OFAC licenses on Jan 7. They were issued two days later, but OFAC amended the Maduro license, within hours and without explanation, to bar payments from Venezuela.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The United States government, even while authorising myriad commercial transactions with Venezuela, is prohibiting counsel from receiving untainted funds from the government of Venezuela, despite Venezuela’s obligation to fund Mr Maduro’s defence,” Pollack said in the court filing.

His wife, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, testified before the same panel on Thursday. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The former president signalled that some of his answers might frustrate lawmakers, cautioning that he would not speculate about events from decades ago. “You’ll often hear me say that I don’t recall,” he said. “I’m not going to say something I’m not sure of.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Hillary Clinton told reporters after her own deposition, which she said spanned topics like UFOs and the so-called PizzaGate conspiracy theory, that she is confident her husband knew nothing about Epstein’s crimes.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">House Oversight Chair James Comer said the committee planned to question Clinton on flights the former president took on Epstein’s private plane and visits the financier made to the White House during the Clinton presidency. After the hours-long questioning, Comer called it a “very productive deposition.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I do think that we picked up some new facts,” Comer added. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Representative Robert Garcia, the panel’s top-ranking Democrat, told reporters during an afternoon break in the questioning that Clinton was “very cooperative” and “answering the questions fairly, to the best of his ability.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">President Donald Trump and his allies have sought to put a spotlight on Epstein’s connections to Democrats, including the Clintons, amid public attention on the sex offender’s ties to the president and his associates, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and former senior adviser Steve Bannon.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Representative Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican and one of the lawmakers on the panel, said earlier that Clinton would “be thoroughly asked about” photographs of him featured in the first tranche of Epstein files released by the Justice Department in December. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Those photos, including one of the former president soaking in a jacuzzi and another swimming with Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, garnered significant media attention. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Mace said the panel questioned Hillary Clinton about the photos on Thursday but she re-directed the questions to her husband.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Since I am under oath, I will not falsely state that I am looking forward to your questions. But I am ready to answer them,” the former president said in his opening statement.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Garcia told reporters before the deposition began that Democrats “have real questions, questions that deserve serious answers from former President Clinton” but “what we do not want today is a sideshow.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Bill Clinton took several trips on Epstein’s private plane before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to Florida state charges that included procurement of a minor to engage in prostitution. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Epstein also donated US$1,000 to Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign and US$20,000 to Hillary Clinton’s 2000 US Senate campaign. A charity controlled by Epstein contributed US$25,000 to the Clintons’ private foundation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In an interview with the BBC in mid-February, Hillary Clinton said her husband had flown on Epstein’s private jet “for his charitable work” and she didn’t recall ever meeting Epstein. She said she had met Maxwell “on a few occasions.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of recruiting girls for sexual abuse and participating in some of the assaults. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Bill Clinton has said that he parted ways with Epstein many years before the financier’s 2019 death in a New York jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Authorities ruled the death a suicide.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Clintons yielded to Republican demands to appear before a House committee investigating Epstein after GOP lawmakers threatened to hold them both in contempt of Congress if they didn’t testify.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Clintons said they’d offered to send sworn statements to the House committee as others who’d been subpoenaed to testify had done, but the Republican-led panel turned them down.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Democratic lawmakers said the panel should follow the precedent set with Clinton and subpoena Trump to testify under oath.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“President Trump was in the Epstein files almost more than anyone else besides Ghislaine Maxwell,” Garcia told reporters. “Answer our questions. This is not a hoax. He has not been exonerated.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that Trump had been “totally exonerated on anything relating to Epstein” and has “done more for Epstein’s victims than anyone before him.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trump has denied any knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activities.

A Virgin Group spokesperson has said that contact between Branson and Epstein took place on a few occasions. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">According to the <em>Financial Times</em>, Epstein offered donations to Virgin Unite, the nonprofit arm of Branson’s Virgin Group, but the foundation blocked Epstein’s money after carrying out due diligence.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Peter Mandelson and Global Counsel</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The former UK cabinet minister faces allegations of suspected misconduct in public office.

His lawyers claimed that his arrest resulted from “baseless” suspicions of intent to abscond. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">JPMorgan Chase and Jamie Dimon </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">America’s biggest bank has faced several lawsuits over its troubled relationship with Epstein, who was a client of 15 years – from 1998 to 2013 – before being kicked out. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In 2019, JPMorgan flagged more than US$1 billion in suspicious transactions linked to Epstein, who had moved hundreds of millions of dollars through the lender to Russian banks. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">JPMorgan chief executive officer and Wall Street veteran Jamie Dimon has claimed he did not know of Epstein’s activities until news broke of the criminal operations in 2019.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, top executives at the New York-based bank were actively involved with Epstein, and some staff even kept in contact with him after he shifted his accounts to Deutsche Bank.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">JPMorgan deputies linked to Epstein include its former private banking chief Jes Staley and its current asset and wealth-management chief Mary Erdoes, who was aware of his sex-offender status. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In 2023, JPMorgan agreed to pay the US Virgin Islands – where Epstein’s island is located – a US$75 million settlement for a lawsuit that accused the bank of enabling Epstein’s sex trafficking. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That same year, it reached a US$290 million settlement with Epstein’s victims. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Wasserman Group leader, Hollywood talent agent Casey Wasserman</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Hollywood talent agent Casey Wasserman came under fire after flirtatious e-mails he exchanged in 2003 with Epstein’s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell – who is now serving a 20-year prison sentence – surfaced from the Epstein files. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">His talent agency has lost high-profile clients, including pop star Chappell Roan and former US football player Abby Wambach. This has led him to announce plans to put up his agency for sale. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While Wasserman remains in charge of the organising committee of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, there are widespread calls for him to step down. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Deutsche Bank</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Germany’s largest lender banked Epstein from 2013 to 2018 and processed hundreds of transactions for him. These included payments to victims and suspected accomplices.   </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">New York state regulators accused the Frankfurt-based bank of failing to properly vet Epstein’s transactions despite publicly available data of his sexual offences. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Deutsche Bank agreed to pay regulators a US$150 million settlement for compliance failures involving Epstein. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Morgan Stanley </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The investment bank continued to secure banking relationships with entities linked to Epstein following his conviction, opening accounts for his trusts from 2015 to 2019. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Documents showed Morgan Stanley had notified Epstein that it would cease its banking relationship with him after closing a trust account in 2017. However, it subsequently opened another account linked to him in 2019; this was closed shortly afterwards. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Former WEF chief Borge Brende</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The president of the World Economic Forum (WEF) announced his resignation on Thursday after the organisation opened an independent probe into his relationship with Epstein. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Brende, who was previously Norwegian foreign minister, dined with Epstein thrice at business dinners and corresponded with him via e-mail and text messages. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He claims to have been unaware of Epstein’s criminal activity before the two met in 2018.

It comes after twin bankruptcies of auto parts supplier First Brands and car dealership Tricolor last year and follows troubles at Blue Owl, which emerged late last year when it moved to limit withdrawals from a fund. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We’re starting to continue to see these types of things pop up, which is definitely a problem,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-head of Equity Trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey, adding that he was concerned how deep problems went. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Shares in Jefferies fell nearly 10 per cent in US trading, adding to Thursday’s 3.5 per cent decline, as reports of the New York-based bank’s exposure to MFS rattled investors. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Barclays shares were down 4.2 per cent, underperforming the broader FTSE 100 index, which rose 0.6 per cent.

The sentiment hit banking shares more broadly with S&amp;P 500 bank index down 4 per cent on Friday.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">London-based MFS specialised in complex property-backed loans. It had applied for administration, a form of UK insolvency protection, after it ran into difficulties, according to previous media reports and court documents seen by Reuters. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Creditors who successfully applied to have the company put into administration on Wednesday cited financial irregularities and mismanagement in court documents.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The administrators said in court documents for Wednesday’s hearing that they had support for putting MFS into administration from “major international financial institutions and/or their legal counsel”. The institutions’ names were redacted in court documents provided to Reuters.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">MFS may have been “double pledging” assets and there could be a collateral shortfall of £930 million (S$1.58 billion), administrators working on behalf of creditors warned in documents submitted to London’s High Court this week. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The collapse raises further questions on the practice of asset-based financing, which involves loans that are backed by collateral such as hard assets, while also putting the spotlight on double-pledging that was at the heart of the twin bankruptcies of auto parts supplier First Brands and car dealership Tricolor.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For loans to MFS totalling £1.16 billion, there was only £230 million of “true value” available in the collateral accounts, they said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>Another blow for Jefferies</strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The collapse of MFS marks a double whammy for Jefferies, which was already in the spotlight due to its prominent role in the implosion of First Brands. Apart from Jefferies, others including Barclays, Santander, Wells Fargo, and Apollo-backed Atlas are among the lenders to MFS, which had borrowed more than £2 billion (S$3.4 billion), according to the court documents.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The banks declined to comment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Atlas said it has roughly £400 million of exposure to the mortgage provider, or about 1 per cent of its balance sheet. Atlas is one of the senior creditors to MFS, alongside other bank lenders.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Following a breach of contractual terms by Market Financial Solutions, Atlas proactively put two warehouses into default last week and is pursuing all legal avenues to maximize recoveries,” a spokesperson for Atlas said in a statement to Reuters, referring to two so-called warehouse loans.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Shares of Apollo and other asset managers were down on Friday on broader investor concerns around stress in the private credit industry. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Investors are on the alert for any sign of deteriorating lending standards and cracks appearing in credit markets, with some of those fears centred on a boom in private credit, in which specialist funds lend directly to companies. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The collapse last year of First Brands and Tricolor heightened those concerns, although traditional banks were among the most exposed. Jefferies disclosed last year that its Leucadia Asset Management division, through its credit fund Point Bonita, held about US$715 million in receivables linked to First Brands, although it later said its exposure was limited.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Some experts played down concerns over wider losses at Jefferies. The bank’s total exposure to MFS has been estimated at roughly £100 million, “but the entire balance is unlikely at risk,” BMO Capital Markets said in a note on Friday.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>Latest ’cockroach’ </strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The implosion of MFS comes months after JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that more “cockroaches” could emerge from pockets of Wall Street’s multitrillion-dollar credit machinery, following the bankruptcies of First Brands and Tricolor.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">MFS, based in London’s Mayfair, described itself as a specialist provider of buy-to-let mortgage lending and bridging finance, with net assets of £15.9 million and 149 employees as of Dec 31, 2024, according to its most recently filed accounts.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The company, founded by CEO Paresh Raja, said it had a loan book of £2.4 billion at the end of 2024, the accounts show. MFS did not respond to a request for comment.
