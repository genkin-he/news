But I think… these wide trends are likely to continue not just in America but across the world,” said PM Wong.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Similarly, asked about the broader state of multilateralism after the conclusion of the Apec Summit, the prime minister replied: “These things will not change with one meeting.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It is hard to tell how things will evolve month by month or year by year, he added, though the longer-term trend seems to be for more economic fragmentation if no actions are taken.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, he pointed out that countries “also have agency” and “are not passive bystanders”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">If countries can do more, such as in the Apec Summit and through other areas of cooperation, then these structural trends can be tackled, he said.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Still pro-trade</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Apec’s founding mission was to promote open and free trade in the region, PM Wong noted. Today, leaders still talk about trade, but with different modifiers: not just “open and free”, but sometimes “fair and balanced”, “suggesting that it wasn’t in the past”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Security is also increasingly discussed alongside trade, he added. Once used sparingly in trade agreements, security carve-outs are now used “very liberally” – not just for defence, but also economic, supply chain and technology security.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In this environment, and given different views across economies, “it’s still very good that in this Apec meeting, we were able to achieve a consensus amongst the leaders and ministers on the direction forward for Apec”, said PM Wong.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This is “generally still pro-trade, despite all the different modifiers” – and this is important for Singapore, he added. “Trade is existential for us.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">PM Wong said Singapore must continue to support Apec and the momentum for trade liberalisation on multiple fronts.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This includes reform of the World Trade Organization (WTO); bringing different regional groupings closer together; and pursuing new initiatives such as the <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/economy-policy/singapore-chile-new-zealand-launch-negotiations-green-economy-partnership\" target=\"_blank\">Green Economy Partnership Agreement</a>, for which negotiations were launched on the sidelines of this summit.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On specific Apec outcomes for Singapore businesses, PM Wong noted efforts to advance paperless trade, to make things more seamless and convenient for businesses.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While this “may not seem like very big news” such as tariffs or big policy changes, such reductions of frictions for trade should be pursued, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As for a question on Singapore’s growth forecast, PM Wong said he would “leave that to the forecasters” in the Ministry of Trade and Industry. But he added that making short-term forecasts about Singapore’s economy “is really about forecasting what happens in the world” – which is very difficult.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As for his meeting with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent a day earlier, PM Wong – who is also minister for finance – said that they discussed issues in finance such as fintech, digital assets, tax policies and action against organised crime.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Trade was touched on only briefly, he noted, as trade talks are chiefly between Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong and US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“But (Bessent) is aware of the conversation, so I updated him on Singapore’s positions and where we stand, and hopefully he will update and share that with his colleagues in the government too, and we can continue to make progress on our trade negotiations.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Following the conclusion of the Apec Economic Leaders’ Meeting, the leaders of the 21 Apec economies issued the Gyeongju Declaration, reaffirming their “longstanding commitment to strengthened cooperation and concrete actions to enable economic growth that benefits all”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">They recognised the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and demographic shifts that are reshaping labour markets with “profound and long-term implications”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Separately, Apec ministers issued a joint statement underscoring efforts to strengthen regional connectivity. They recognised the importance of comprehensive reform of the WTO, and noted the benefits of digitalisation to enhance and facilitate trade.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China is set to host next year’s Apec meeting. Speaking at the summit’s closing ceremony, Xi said this would take place in the southern city Shenzhen.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">PM Wong now heads to Seoul for an official visit at the invitation of South Korean President Lee Jae-myung.</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[SAN FRANCISCO] A clutch of Federal Reserve bank presidents on Friday (Oct 31) aired their discomfort with the US central bank’s decision to cut interest rates this week, even as influential Fed Governor Christopher Waller made the case for more policy easing to shore up a weakening labour market.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This yawning divide within the Fed’s policymaking ranks poses a challenge for Jerome Powell in forging a consensus in his final six months as the chair.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While it is not unusual for Fed policymakers to differ on policy, particularly when the economic data is mixed, the frank expression of that disagreement and the explicit focus on what the Fed ought to do at its next meeting, on Dec 9 to Dec 10, was striking. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">To cut or not to cut </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I did not see a need to cut rates this week,” Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan told a banking conference. “I’d find it difficult to cut rates again in December unless there is clear evidence that inflation will fall faster than expected or that the labour market will cool more rapidly.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Given the move that we just made, I think we’re right around my estimate of neutral: I think we’re barely restrictive if at all,” Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said at the same conference. Like Logan, she does not have a vote on policy this year but opposed this week’s rate cut; both will have a vote next year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I do think we need to maintain some amount of restriction to help bring inflation back down to target,” Hammack said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Waller, who has a permanent vote and is among the candidates US President Donald Trump is considering naming Fed chair when Powell’s term is up in May, told the very opposite story. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The biggest concern we have right now is the labour market,” he told Larry Kudlow on Fox Business Network. “We know inflation is going to come back down, so this is why I’m still advocating that we cut policy rates in December, because that’s what all the data is telling me to do.”</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">No data fog </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Waller and Logan both said Trump’s tariffs are unlikely to cause a jump in inflation, but while Waller felt that adds to the case for rate cuts, Logan said she was still worried about services prices.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">They also agreed that the lack of official economic data during the government shutdown does not create a fog of uncertainty that Powell signalled earlier this week could be a reason for pausing rate cuts.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Logan said private-sector data, state-level unemployment claims and the Fed’s own business and community surveys gave “visibility” into the state of the economy, and back her view that the labour market is not cooling fast enough to need the Fed’s support, particularly with inflation too high and taking too long to come down toward the Fed’s 2 per cent target.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The fog story has just got to stop: it might tell you to slow down, it doesn’t tell you to pull over to the side of the road,” Waller said. “You may be careful, but it doesn’t mean to stop. And the right thing to do with policy is to continue cutting.”</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">‘Strongly differing’ views on display </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Wednesday, after the Fed’s policy-setting committee voted 10 to two to lower its benchmark interest rate to the 3.75 per cent to 4 per cent range, Powell delivered an unusually clear warning to markets: given “strongly differing views” about how to proceed in December, he said, a rate cut was “not a foregone conclusion, far from it”. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he was glad the chair had added those words. “I thought that the chair pretty accurately reflected the range of views that are on the committee, and that was information that needed to be out into the public domain,” said Bostic, whose turn to vote at the Fed policymaking table next comes in 2027.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Financial markets pared what had been near-certain pricing for a December rate cut after Powell’s remarks, although bets still reflect twice as high a chance of a rate cut as none.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Bostic had said for most of this year he felt the Fed would need to cut just once this year, as it did in September. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Bostic a reluctant supporter of rate cut </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Of the rate cut this week, “I eventually got behind it ... because I still think we’re in restrictive territory, and that to me is the most important thing: we can’t really signal or forget that inflation is a significant problem,” Bostic said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“But with each step, we get closer and closer to neutral in ways that make me uncomfortable.” Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, one of two dissenters against this week’s move, explained on Friday in a written release that he feels that any labour market weakness is “more likely than not” due to structural changes in technology and demographics rather than slowing underlying demand.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I do not think a 25-basis-point reduction in the policy rate will do much to address stress in the labour market,” Schmid said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A cut, however, “could have a longer-lasting effect on inflation if the Fed’s commitment to its 2 per cent inflation target comes into question,” he said. Fed Governor Stephen Miran also dissented this week, as the lone policymaker in favour of a larger half-percentage-point cut. Miran is on leave from his job as White House economic advisor. Trump has called all year for lower rates and intends to install a Fed chair who agrees.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Labour market risks remain, but inflation a bigger problem </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Logan and Hammack notably both said they were sensitive to the risk of labour market weakness, and both said they were watching whether recent announcements of large layoffs by major companies could set a trend.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The risks to the labour market do lie mainly to the downside,” Logan said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But “the remaining risks to employment are ones we can monitor closely and respond to if they are becoming more likely to materialise, not ones that currently warrant further preemptive action,” she said.

The stock was worth about US$865 million when he started selling in late June, but has climbed over 40 per cent since then amid unquenchable demand for artificial intelligence (AI) processors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Santa Clara, California-based company became the first to reach US$5 trillion in market value Wednesday after announcing a flurry of new partners, just four months after it cracked the US$4 trillion threshold.

He’s also donated shares worth more than US$300 million this year to his foundation and a donor-advised fund.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nvidia didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Huang isn’t the only company insider riding the AI wave to greater riches. His sales were surpassed in the third quarter by Arista Networks CEO Jayshree Ullal, who sold US$861 million of stock, and was ranked only behind Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos in terms of top company insider sellers. Insiders at CoreWeave sold more than US$1 billion in the last quarter after its initial public offering lockup. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nvidia insider sellers, including Huang, unloaded nearly US$1.5 billion of stock through the third quarter, according to Washington Service data, which tracks such sales. In 2024, Nvidia insiders sold more than US$2 billion, up from US$462 million in 2023.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While many companies have benefited from the AI gold rush, Nvidia stands alone in a virtually unheard-of feat of wealth creation with seven billionaires, including Huang, among its ranks.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In recent months, chief financial officer Colette Kress and Jay Puri, who oversees sales and marketing as executive vice president of worldwide field operations, gained 10-figure fortunes with net worths of about US$1.2 billion each, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nvidia board member Tench Coxe recently joined the list of the world’s 500 richest people with a net worth of US$7.5 billion. Fellow director Mark Stevens ranks 247th with a US$12.5 billion fortune, made up of Nvidia stock and partial ownership of the Golden State Warriors. Harvey Jones, another director, holds a US$1.5 billion position.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Seawell is the most recent addition to the club and, along with his heirs, has a net worth of US$1.1 billion, he confirmed in an email.

While the Republic cannot create leading-edge AI foundation models itself, it can use them to develop and create “applications with the biggest impact, in areas like finance, logistics, healthcare and advanced manufacturing”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“But we can’t do this work alone, and we are very keen to cooperate and exchange best practices with other Apec economies,” said PM Wong.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He suggested ways to unlock the potential of AI while fostering the responsible use and development of it.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One such step is to “keep data corridors open, because data is what powers AI models”, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“That’s why we support the Apec Cross-Border Privacy Rules, which facilitate the free flow of data with trust, in order to promote AI innovation.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He added that trade agreements such as the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement – between Singapore, Chile, New Zealand and South Korea – can also enable seamless data flows. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Preparing workers, building trust</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Another step is to prepare the workforce for AI through reskilling and job redesign, he said. “By doing so, we can ensure that the returns from AI investments will accrue not just to the owners of capital, but also to workers, and importantly to all our people.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Apec economies must also continue to build trust in AI, he said. That is why Singapore plays an active role in global efforts to advance AI standards: to have an overall framework for innovation, and so users know that they are using responsibly-developed systems.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He noted that Singapore set up the <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/startups/singapore-launches-foundation-promote-responsible-ai\" target=\"_blank\">AI Verify Foundation</a>, which has over 170 members, to set such standards in partnership with the private sector. The Republic also convened experts to formulate the Singapore Consensus on Global AI Safety Research Priorities.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">PM Wong commended South Korea for convening the first Apec Digital and AI Ministerial Meeting this year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He also highlighted the Apec AI Initiative, which will promote cooperation on AI through policy exchanges and capacity-building projects, and foster investments in AI infrastructure.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Singapore looks forward to working with Apec economies to ensure that our societies benefit from AI,” he concluded. “Together, we can put AI to work on the problems that matter most, so that our people can prosper together.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In the same session, South Korean President Lee Jae-myung similarly urged Apec member economies to embrace the opportunities afforded by AI.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He said that South Korea hopes to work with Apec members to tackle issues related to AI and demographic change.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With the Apec Summit wrapping up on Saturday, <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/kl-gyeongju-pm-wong-heads-south-korea-attend-apec-summit\" target=\"_blank\">PM Wong heads to Seoul in the afternoon</a> to begin his official visit at the invitation of President Lee.</p></div>",

All seven have been placed on the wanted list for arrest and further investigation,” said Federal Police Criminal Investigation Department director M. Kumar in a late-night statement on Oct 31.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The move comes after Singapore police <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/27-singaporeans-7-malaysians-wanted-suspected-links-cambodia-scam-ring\" target=\"_blank\">issued arrest warrants for the seven Malaysians and 27 Singaporeans</a> linked to a syndicate accused of duping hundreds of victims, with losses exceeding S$41 million through impersonation scams.\n\nAllegedly coordinated from Phnom Penh, the operation marks one of Singapore’s largest overseas scam probes, underscoring the rapid spread of transnational fraud networks in South-east Asia.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Singapore had earlier moved against the network.

The nature of the crime is unknown.\n\nIn Singapore, the syndicate allegedly operated by the Ng brothers with the aid from their relative, duped victims by posing as bank officers or regulators.

Metsera has given Pfizer until Tuesday to raise its offer. Pfizer wants Metsera’s scheduled shareholder vote to take place on Nov 13.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The legal action comes as Pfizer received early antitrust clearance for its proposed US$7.3 billion acquisition of Metsera from the US Federal Trade Commission. It granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, more than a week ahead of the Nov 7 deadline.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Pfizer’s claims against Novo Nordisk are meritless, and we will vigorously defend ourselves in any litigation,” a Novo spokesperson said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Metsera said in a statement that it disagreed with Pfizer’s allegations and would address them in court.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Pfizer and Novo talks with Metsera began in 2024 </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The lawsuit details a tussle for Metsera that began with discussions between the company and potential acquirers in early 2024, with both Pfizer and Novo Nordisk expressing interest.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy and Ozempic, is trying to regain ground in the obesity drug race after losing market share to Eli Lilly. Metsera is working on experimental therapies that analysts say could generate US$5 billion in sales.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pfizer, which does not currently sell a weight-loss drug, is betting on Metsera to help it enter the US$150 billion obesity market and offset falling Covid-related revenue and looming patent expirations.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pfizer claimed Novo’s bid was an illegal attempt by a dominant player to suppress competition in the fast-growing obesity drug market.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Novo made its first formal offer on Jan 23, 2025, valuing Metsera at US$2 billion, which the board rejected due to regulatory risks and low valuation, the lawsuit said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pfizer entered the process with a US$30 per share non-binding proposal on Jun 2, followed by a series of improved bids. Metsera’s board rejected the proposal but was determined to continue negotiations with Pfizer.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Novo made additional bids that were rejected by Metsera’s board and, by September, both parties had submitted revised proposals. Pfizer says Novo’s last bid, made on Sep 20, involved a complex structure with non-voting shares and a dividend, which Metsera’s board deemed too risky.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Antitrust concerns and foreign ownership </h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even before Novo Nordisk formally renewed its bid for Metsera on Oct 25, Pfizer alleged that both Novo and Metsera were quietly preparing for the transaction.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">According to the complaint, Novo Nordisk representatives had begun reaching out to government officials to discuss regulatory issues, suggesting pre-coordination.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, Metsera’s lead law firm requested a conflict waiver from Pfizer just days before Novo’s proposal was submitted - despite having negotiated opposite Pfizer for months without raising any conflict concerns.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pfizer argues this timing indicates that discussions were underway before the bid was made public, potentially in violation of the merger agreement’s non-solicitation provisions.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pfizer’s lawsuit emphasised its role as a leading US corporation, and Novo Nordisk as a foreign competitor.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A Wednesday letter to Metsera from Pfizer’s lawyers that was disclosed in the lawsuit repeatedly described Pfizer as “an American company” and said a Novo Nordisk deal “may draw scrutiny from CFIUS,” a reference to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The government body reviews foreign investment in the US, which can give the US president ultimate authority over a transaction.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Pfizer is asking the court for a declaration that Novo’s proposal is not a superior offer under the merger agreement, as well as damages and injunctive relief.

The US in turn pledged to halve a fentanyl-related tariff on China and to hold-off on a threatened 100 per cent levy on Chinese goods Trump threatened to impose starting in November. The US is also pausing some reciprocal tariffs on Beijing for an additional year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The standoff over Nexperia appeared to escalate earlier Friday (Oct 31), when the company halted supplies to its China factory over disagreements with the site’s management, escalating a standoff that’s already impacting automotive production in Europe and beyond.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Dutch manufacturer provides high volumes of transistors and logic chips that are used across the automotive and consumer electronics industries. It operates wafer fabrication plants in Germany and the UK. Aside from the assembly and testing site in China, it also has facilities in the Philippines and Malaysia. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Semiconductors have held an outsized importance in the trade fight between the US and China with Trump looking to restrict Chinese access to advanced chips in a race between the countries for technological supremacy in artificial intelligence and other fields. Beijing in turn has used their dominance in rare-earth production as a bargaining chip, threatening to curb access to minerals necessary for high-tech manufacturing of widely used consumer products.
