The S$834 million transaction yielded a S$465 million gain.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Sherman Kwek, CDL’s group chief executive officer, said that strong residential sales in Singapore and accelerated capital recycling drove a “significant uplift” to the group’s earnings, despite the company facing a “challenging environment with ongoing economic uncertainties” in 2025.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“To maximise shareholder returns, we are actively reviewing our growth strategy, portfolio structures and capital allocation priorities,” Kwek said. “We have taken decisive steps to unlock value from mature and non-core assets while selectively redeploying capital to drive growth.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In early 2025, Kwek was embroiled in a public feud with his father and CDL executive chairman Kwek Leng Beng, but the matter was settled subsequently.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the second half, CDL posted an earnings per share (EPS) of S$0.598, versus S$0.121 in the year-ago period. EPS for the full year rose to S$0.694, from S$0.213 in the previous financial year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Revenue for H2 stood at S$1.9 billion, up 11.1 per cent on the year from S$1.7 billion.

The sales of the Ransome’s Wharf site in London and the office component of Suzhou Hong Leong City Center in China also boosted revenue.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Notably, the hotel operations segment saw a 1.7 per cent increase in revenue and improvements in revenue per available room, said CDL. This was supported by new additions including The Mayfair Hotel Christchurch, acquired in January 2025, and the Hilton Paris Opera, acquired in May 2024. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The group noted that the increase in gross profits for H2 and FY2025 was marginal, despite its revenue growth.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its overall gross profit margin fell to 41 per cent for H2 and FY2025, from 45 per cent for both periods in 2024, as it was impacted by an S$80.5 million allowance for foreseeable losses that was made in relation to China development properties.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As at Dec 31, CDL maintained strong cash reserves of S$2.1 billion.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The board proposed a final dividend of S$0.25 per share, payable on May 19, after the record date of May 4.

Three years of relentless gigging later, they released their debut album, <em>Permission to Land</em>. Despite being so brazenly unfashionable and defiantly in thrall to the chest-baring excess of 1970s hard rock, the record went quadruple platinum. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It earned the band three Brit Awards including Best British Group and Best Album.

The channel, <em>Justin Hawkins Rides Again</em>, began accidentally, born out of Covid boredom and a suggestion from his tattoo artist. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I was very sceptical. I didn’t think it was going to work. But I tried it, and it sort of caught fire.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The experience of analysing other people’s music has sharpened his own instincts, pushing him towards what he describes as deliberate strangeness of abandoning conventional song structure, experimenting with microtonal tuning, refusing auto-tune in a genre increasingly addicted to it. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“One of my great campaigns is to try and abandon auto tune, because whenever I hear that in rock, I just think that’s embarrassing,” he explains. “Rock singers sing flat to add despair and sing sharp to add excitement. Robert Plant, for example, never sang on the note, nor did Nick Cave.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He adds: “They sang sharp or flat – always has, always will – and these, these are the real heroes for me, because it’s like you have the courage to show your own voice in a musical climate where everything’s auto tuned and it just sounds like pop music.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On artificial intelligence (AI), he is unequivocal. He refuses to use it for songwriting, for social media, for anything. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I happen to believe that if you write a song with the assistance of AI, there’ll be some sort of audit, and they’ll look back and say: You used AI to help write that hit, so you shouldn’t be earning on it. And I actually agree with that. If a computer wrote the song, why are you making money?” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">And in an era saturated with reunion tours and heritage nostalgia, The Darkness occupy a quietly radical position: a band that never really stopped. Justin Hawkins is gently scathing about acts that disappear for years and then return expecting a hero’s welcome.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Don’t have a break,” he says, “because it gives people an opportunity to see it in a cynical way.

We’re not playing very fashionable music and a lot of the time I listen to the radio and think: Do I really want to be on it with that music playing anyway?”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Their eighth album, <em>Dreams on Toast</em>, released in early 2025, peaked at No 2 on the UK Albums Chart – their strongest chart position since <em>Permission to Land</em> – and The Darkness are set to see 2026 out with a UK arena tour and the opening slot for Iron Maiden at Knebworth. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Justin Hawkins credits the band’s ongoing success to the intensely loyal fanbase, many of whom still buy vinyl, CDs, even cassettes. “They want to make sure the money they spend goes to the band, so that we can keep touring.”</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">No algorithms, no AI</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Offstage, Justin Hawkins has cultivated a second life as one of rock music’s most engaging YouTubers, amassing a large subscriber base with his candid opinions on music and the industry. The channel, <em>Justin Hawkins Rides Again</em>, began accidentally, born out of Covid boredom and a suggestion from his tattoo artist. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I was very sceptical. I didn’t think it was going to work. But I tried it, and it sort of caught fire.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The experience of analysing other people’s music has sharpened his own instincts, pushing him towards what he describes as deliberate strangeness of abandoning conventional song structure, experimenting with microtonal tuning, refusing auto-tune in a genre increasingly addicted to it. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“One of my great campaigns is to try and abandon auto tune, because whenever I hear that in rock, I just think that’s embarrassing,” he explains. “Rock singers sing flat to add despair and sing sharp to add excitement. Robert Plant, for example, never sang on the note, nor did Nick Cave.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He adds: “They sang sharp or flat – always has, always will – and these, these are the real heroes for me, because it’s like you have the courage to show your own voice in a musical climate where everything’s auto tuned and it just sounds like pop music.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On artificial intelligence (AI), he is unequivocal. He refuses to use it for songwriting, for social media, for anything. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I happen to believe that if you write a song with the assistance of AI, there’ll be some sort of audit, and they’ll look back and say: You used AI to help write that hit, so you shouldn’t be earning on it. And I actually agree with that. If a computer wrote the song, why are you making money?” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">And in an era saturated with reunion tours and heritage nostalgia, The Darkness occupy a quietly radical position: a band that never really stopped. Justin Hawkins is gently scathing about acts that disappear for years and then return expecting a hero’s welcome.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Don’t have a break,” he says, “because it gives people an opportunity to see it in a cynical way. If you just keep going, you have longevity by default.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><em>The Darkness plays Capitol Theatre on Mar 11.

In the banking sector, institutions are seeking to pursue AI initiatives in ways that minimise significant workforce reductions as they face labour shortages.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Mizuho has about 15,000 clerical positions at its core banking units and other group companies, and affected employees will be transferred to other roles, the bank said. The <em>Yomiuri </em>newspaper reported the plans earlier. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Global banks are heavily investing in AI to improve operations ranging from product development to risk management. JPMorgan Chase spends about US$2 billion annually on developing AI technology, an investment that it says also saves about the same amount each year. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Japan’s bank chiefs have been trying to ease concerns that AI will take away jobs. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I don’t think humans will lose their value,” Mizuho chief executive officer Masahiro Kihara said in October. “They can aim for more value-added work.” BLOOMBERG</p></div>",
