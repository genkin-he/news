It will automatically compute the estimated LBC from key inputs and allow for scenario testing under different development options. This will give developers “greater certainty” when working out their costs, Tong said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Rates are announced twice a year following a review by SLA, in consultation with the taxman’s chief valuer. They are based on the chief valuer’s assessment of land values and take into account recent land sales. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The LBC framework has also been refined to provide solar operators with greater transparency and certainty, said Tong. Since Sep 1, 2025, solar deployments have been classified under utility use, allowing charges to be calculated using the table of rates instead of spot valuations. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Authorities have moved up the start of the valuation process for cases requiring a spot assessment.

Coupang’s New York-listed shares closed up 1.9 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On an earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Gaurav Anand said active customers in its product commerce segment rose 8 per cent from a year earlier to 24.6 million in the fourth quarter, though they fell from 24.7 million in the previous quarter, which appeared to be related to the data breach.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We are seeing stabilisation since the end of the fourth quarter, with a large number of customers reactivating their accounts and improving trends in customer growth,” Anand said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He added that constant-currency growth in its product commerce segment likely reached its lowest level in January, at about 4 per cent, before showing signs of improvement in February. For the first quarter, Coupang expects consolidated constant-currency revenue growth of 5 to 10 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Anand said that growth and profitability would remain muted over the next few months, reflecting the lingering fallout from the data breach, though the impact should gradually diminish over the course of the year.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Data breach downfall</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The company has said that the breach exposed users’ names, phone numbers, and shipping addresses, although payment details or login credentials were not compromised. Coupang said it would “take all necessary steps to prevent further harm and continue strengthening safeguards to prevent a recurrence”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Harold Rogers, the interim head of Coupang’s South Korean business, said the company has not detected a misuse of customer data attributable to the incident and has found no evidence to date of “any secondary harm”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Rogers added that the breach stemmed from a targeted attack carried out by a former employee who leveraged inside knowledge of Coupang’s systems, citing the findings of a cybersecurity firm’s investigation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, South Korea’s Science Ministry said this month that the breach stemmed from management failures at Coupang rather than a sophisticated cyberattack.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Since the incident, its rivals have jumped in to lure shoppers away from the platform.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It also faces headwinds from a proposed regulatory change that could increase competition in ultra-fast overnight deliveries, which have been a cornerstone of its market dominance.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Separately, earlier on Thursday, South Korea’s antitrust regulator fined Coupang 2.2 billion won (S$1.9 million) for pressuring suppliers to cut prices and shoulder additional costs to meet profit margins, as well as for delaying payments to vendors. The fine is unrelated to the data breach. REUTERS</p></div>",

This is geostrategic tectonic plate rupture.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We thrived as a ‘global metropolis’ in an age of globalisation,” he said during his ministry’s Committee of Supply debate in Parliament. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But anti-globalisation sentiments have now not only manifested in domestic policy but undermined support for the international order, he added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Rules and consensus no longer drive international relations, he warned. This is a more dangerous world for small countries such as Singapore, which have no “strategic heft” to buffer against turbulence – but it has agency, resilience and resources.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We have never been naive,” said Dr Balakrishnan. “There is a deep vein of realism in the way we view the world and the way we operate.”</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Prioritising Singapore</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The city-state must objectively assess its national interests, he said. These are: to safeguard its sovereignty, independence and national unity; to secure access to essential supplies and freedom of navigation; to strengthen its role as a global hub; and to support a rules-based multilateral approach wherever possible.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As Singapore faces more strategic dilemmas and difficult choices, it must retain its “ability to say ‘no’”, said Dr Balakrishnan, the loss of which would result in a loss of relevance and independence.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He highlighted examples of Singapore’s ability to disagree with its partners, speaking out when Russia invaded Ukraine, when the US implemented tariffs that violated the Most Favoured Nation principle, and during the Israel-Gaza conflict.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“These positions we have taken and explicitky stated over the last few years have not been universally welcomed, and even domestically, have elicted active debate” Dr Balakrishnan said. “(But this) aligns with furthering our national interests. Articulating these positions is part of exercising agency.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He laid out five priorities for the ministry.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">First, to engage all great powers constructively and give them a stake in the stability and prosperity of the region. This balance of power gives small states such as Singapore room to manoeuvre, he said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Second, to buttress a wider network of middle-power partnerships for greater stability. Third, to strengthen a stable and integrated Asean, which has “great potential”. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Fourth, to create greater synergy between Singapore and its immediate neighbours. Fifth, to reinforce a rules-based international architecture despite the current headwinds.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Strengthening partnerships</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On Singapore’s relationship with major powers, Dr Balakrishnan noted the significance of its partnerships with both the US and China. It wants to work with both countries “where our interests coincide”, he said, noting that all countries must find “creative ways” to do so.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He updated that the government is still assessing the US ’ invitation to formally join the Board of Peace.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Singapore will also strengthen its partnerships with middle powers and regional blocs, the minister said. It upgraded its partnerships with Australia, France, India, New Zealand and Vietnam in 2025, and established a partnership with South Korea. It also signed the EU-Singapore Digital Trade Agreement.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">To deepen relations with more like-minded partners, the ministry is expanding its global footprint in Africa and Latin America, establishing new missions in Mexico and Ethiopia to support this.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Amid these partnerships, Asean remains the cornerstone of Singapore’s foreign policy, “and a salient platform from which we engage the wider world”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With Singapore assuming chairmanship of the bloc in 2027, during its 60th anniversary, Dr Balakrishnan said it will use its role to pursue deeper integration, promote external partnerships, and keep Asean open and committed to peace, stability and cooperation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the bloc to remain relevant, it must become more cohesive, united and credible, through deeper regional integration, Dr Balakrishnan said. This is why it is pushing hard on key initiatives – such as the Asean Power Grid and Asean Digital Economy Framework Agreement – that bind its economies closer together.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He also emphasised the importance of giving major powers a stake in the region’s stability and prosperity, and ensuring Asean stays the partner of choice.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The more countries invest in Asean’s collective progress, the more stable Asean will be,” he said, noting that the balance of power and interest allows more room to manouevre than single-power dominance.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The bedrock of Asean cohesion is strong neighbourly relationships, Dr Balakrishnan continued.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With Indonesia, Singapore is exploring projects in energy, food security, education and healthcare, discussing cross-border electricity trade, carbon capture and storage, and establishing a Sustainable Industrial Zone across the Bintan-Batam-Karimun corridor. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With Malaysia, Singapore is deepening economic and people-to-people ties with East Malaysia through the establishment of consulates in Sabah and Sarawak, and managing complex outstanding bilateral issues.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Maintaining multilateralism</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Despite the challenges of building consensus in a fractured world, Dr Balakrishnan said that Singapore remains committed to the rules-based multilateral system, which provides “the architecture of norms, standards and institutions that protect the global commons and give all small states a say”. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We must continue to do our best to build overlapping, flexible circles of plurilateral partnerships with like-minded countries,” he said, highlighting the Joint Statement Initiative on E-commerce Agreement as one example, which began with Singapore, Australia, and Japan and now has 72 co-sponsors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Recognising that Singaporeans will have different views on foreign policy issues, Dr Balakrishnan said that they do not need to agree on foreign policy stances, but must agree that these are matters “to be discussed and decided by Singaporeans alone”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While foreign actors will try to push their narratives and deepen internal divisions, Singapore – with its diverse population that is vulnerable to becoming polarised and fractured – must guard against this, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">We do not expect a stable new equilibrium to take shape in 2026, or frankly, even the next couple of years” warned Dr Balakrishnan. But he added that, conpared to when Singapoe unexpectedly became indepenedent, the country is in a far better position, in terms of tools and resources.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It has three prerequisites for success, he said: domestic unity, where it inoculates itself from foreign influence; economic relevance, where its value as a hub is accentuated by the more fractious world; and its ability to defend itself, through National Service and steady investment.</p></div>",

He has raised his target price on the counter to S$3.73, from S$2.95.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On a whole, the analysts expect core Patmi and revenue margins to stay strong in FY2026. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Capacity expansion should continue to drive top-line growth, while improving sales mix and operational efficiencies are expected to support margins going forward,” noted the UOBKH analysts.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Some risks to such forecasts include a disruption in operations due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the negative effect of a change in the value of the ruble and other countries’ currencies, Yeo from RHB Group Research said.  </p></div>",
