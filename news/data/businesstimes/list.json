The company paid the government RM32 billion in dividends last year. Muhammad Taufik said Petronas expects to pay RM20 billion this year – the lowest since 2017 – reflecting a need for the firm to ensure sufficient cash flow.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“(The dividend) is always going to be governed by our affordability,” he said. Petronas last year embarked on a “right-sizing” exercise, aiming to cut about 5,000 employees to ensure its long-term survival. Muhammad Taufik said on Friday the process was expected to conclude by August.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Crude oil prices were expected to trade rangebound between US$65-US$70 per barrel over the next five years, with the firm allocating RM2 billion annually for exploration in the same period, Petronas said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Capital investments slipped to RM41.6 billion in 2025 compared with RM54.2 billion in 2024, the company said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Petronas’ upstream business saw a decline in post-tax profit to RM26.2 billion in 2025. Its gas and maritime business saw profit rise to RM20.9 billion, while its downstream segment posted a loss after tax of RM1.9 billion. Petronas reported a 2.2 per cent increase in carbon emissions in 2025 to 56.95 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, attributed mainly to the transfer of operations for two production sharing contracts.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The firm also reported a 72 per cent reduction in methane emissions, exceeding its target of 50 per cent.

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[SEOUL] Global investors offloaded a record amount of South Korean equities on Friday (Feb 27), in a sign of profit taking after the equity benchmark rallied nearly 50 per cent this year. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Foreign funds sold a net 6.8 trillion won (S$6 billion) worth of Kospi stocks during the regular session, according to data by the Korea Exchange. The Kospi Index fell 1 per cent to snap a six-day winning streak. Local institutions and retail investors, meanwhile, were net buyers. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Korean stocks have been on a tear, trouncing other markets as the benchmark soared 170 per cent since an April low. Home to Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, the country has been a direct beneficiary of the memory boom, sidestepping turbulence even as the so-called “AI scare trade” rattled investors elsewhere. Yet the relentless rally driven by a handful of stocks has started to look precarious to some.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“A large sell number tells you sentiment is being reset and positioning is being cleaned up,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets. “Memory upcycle has been a clear narrative, so when volatility rises, the quickest move is to reduce exposure in crowded trades. That can create big flow prints even if fundamentals are intact.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The gauge soared past the 6,000 threshold this week, just a month after surpassing President Lee Jae-myung’s political goal of 5,000. The country’s market valuation even exceeded that of European heavyweights Germany and France. The frenzy to gain exposure to Korean names caused abnormal moves and volumes in exchange-traded funds listed overseas.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Despite the massive selling by foreigners, few see this as a bearish turning point. Kospi still trades at 10.4 times forward earnings estimates, compared to S&amp;P 500’s 21.3 and MSCI Asia-Pacific at 15.3. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The corporate governance reform is also making headway. The parliament this week approved a long-debated legal revision requiring companies to cancel treasury shares. A day later, the president urged a revamp in inheritance tax rules to keep boosting capital markets. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A month-end rebalancing of benchmarks and profit-taking after the breakneck rally triggered the pullback, said Kim Namho, a fund manager at Timefolio Investment Management in Seoul. “Even so, consensus holds that Korean equities remain undervalued, with ample upside after this pause.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Yuanta Securities said MSCI’s rebalancing scheduled for Friday would trigger weight adjustments in funds such as the US-listed iShares MSCI South Korea ETF after Samsung Electronics’ weight exceeded the 25 per cent cap set by regulators. Samsung shares have surged 80 per cent so far this year.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Retail participation is also accelerating, suggesting further upside potential. Investor deposits at the nation’s brokerages – cash available for stock purchases – rose to a new all-time high of 119.5 trillion won, according to Korea Financial Investment Association data. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“There will be opportunities in South Korea amidst any extended sell-off, and we’ll be there as long-term investors,” said Vikas Pershad, an Asian equities portfolio manager at M&amp;G Investments.

The team hammered Inter in the first leg of the matchup in Norway and kept it at arm’s length in the second. Despite producing less possession (71 per cent to 29 per cent) and fewer shots (30 to seven) in Milan, Bodo never looked in real danger.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This is Bodo’s first season in the Champions League, having come through the qualifiers to reach the league phase, but it also looked likely to go out rather quietly at that stage: After six of its eight games, it stood at 32nd in the standings, having not recorded a win. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It had to beat Manchester City and then Atletico Madrid to stand a chance of even reaching these playoffs, which it somehow managed, but surely the Norwegian team would not be able to pull off another upset? As it turns out, it very much could.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Can you believe it?” Knutsen said after the game, his eyes wide with wonder at what his team had achieved. “I can’t actually believe it. The players were amazing. I’m so proud.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It is also worth pointing out that Bodo is playing in its offseason: The Norwegian league finished in November, and while the end of the domestic season coincided with the team’s revival in Europe, and it has not lost since, it goes against conventional wisdom that a team can succeed without the rhythm of regular football  matches.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“It sounds not true,” said Jens Petter Hauge, the winger who started at Bodo but then left for Inter’s rivals AC Milan in 2020. He returned to Bodo in 2024. “What we have done, I’m so proud of the group. We’re all in this together, and we believe so much in this project.”</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Effective strategy</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Bodo’s success has not come because of some wealthy benefactor. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This is more organic, broadly explained by Knutsen’s adherence to high-intensity, high-energy football and a recruitment strategy that not only finds players who fit that approach, but also identifies those with raw talent and an X-factor – one single outstanding quality that everyone else might have overlooked because the player might be raw and unpolished.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This strategy has worked in recent years, when the team was merely bloodying the noses of the big boys in European football’s two lesser competitions, the Europa League and the Conference League, and it is still working at the highest level, and with some gusto.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Is this win over Inter the biggest upset in the history of the Champions League knockout stages? </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It could well be. Other nominations might include Dynamo Kyiv beating Real Madrid in 1999; Deportivo La Coruna producing an astonishing comeback to beat Milan in 2003-04; or maybe Monaco beating Manchester City in 2016-17. Bodo’s achievement is different from all of those.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It is certainly one of the more extraordinary runs of form the Champions League has ever seen. It is also, as the data firm Opta pointed out, the first time since 1972 that a team from outside the top five European leagues – England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France – has won four consecutive games against teams from those nations in the Champions League or its predecessor, the European Cup. That team in 1972 was Ajax Amsterdam, which went on to win the whole thing.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This is not the first time Bodo/Glimt has made an Italian giant look small: In 2021, it hammered Jose Mourinho’s Roma 6-1 in the Europa Conference League. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Up next for the Norwegian club is either Sporting Lisbon or Manchester City. You would not bet on it being their last miracle, either. NYTIMES</p></div>",

In particular, revenue from its public transport business was 8.2 per cent higher at S$1.7 billion. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This was attributed to the commencement of UK Metroline Manchester contracts, UK London bus contracts renewed at improved margins and increased Singapore rail fare revenues, though these were partially offset by the transfer of the Jurong West bus package.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, operating profit from the public transport segment rose 35.3 per cent to S$101.5 million.

However, operating profit for this segment fell 25.2 per cent to S$53.9 million. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This decline was mainly attributed to lower revenue contributions in Singapore, alongside higher amortisation expenses of intangible assets arising from the A2B and Addison Lee acquisitions.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the second half, revenue from its other private transport segment grew 7.5 per cent to S$250.2 million, contributed by CMAC in the UK, but offset by lower contributions from Australia non-emergency patient transport.

A short circuit may happen if large amounts of water enter the rear door opener switch, such as during a car wash, after its seal – a protective barrier around the switch – degrades over time.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">If the door is shut with force, water may seep into the switch. Should the water contain detergent, it could trigger the switch and cause the rear doors to open.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Rectification work has already begun, and the repair can be completed within the same day.
