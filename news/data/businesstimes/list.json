Chevron completed the acquisition of Hess in July, which gave the company access to a prolific oilfield in Guyana operated by larger rival Exxon Mobil. The deal puts Chevron in a better position to weather oil price volatility with a source of profitable production, investors have said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note that Chevron’s earnings report was strong, with every business and region beating market expectations.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We expect the market to take this positively, as it highlights continued momentum in its base business, as well as growth coming through from the newly acquired barrels, all of which are contributing to cash generation,” he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Chevron will host an investor day on Nov 12 to provide updated financial guidance to shareholders following the Hess deal. The new combined company produced 4.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the third quarter, a record high and up from Chevron’s standalone production of 3.4 million boepd in the same quarter last year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The results were also buoyed by lower costs, as Chevron is on pace to reach US$2 billion to US$3 billion in cost reductions next year, Bonner said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Those are the catalysts that are coming together to give us this high confidence in free cash flow growth with lower execution risks, given that all these major milestones are behind us,” she said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Upstream earnings totalled US$3.3 billion, a 28 per cent decline from the same period last year due to lower oil prices. Chevron’s profit from the downstream business jumped 91 per cent over the same time frame to US$1.1 billion, driven by higher refining margins and lower operating expenses in the US.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Chevron paid US$3.4 billion in dividends and bought back US$2.6 billion worth of shares during the quarter. The company said capital expenditure, which totalled US$4.4 billion in the third quarter, rose from the same period last year because of spending on legacy Hess assets. Benchmark Brent crude prices averaged US$68.17 over the third quarter, down about 13 per cent from the same period last year and up 2 per cent from the second quarter. The Opec+ group of oil producers increased its output throughout the year, raising fears about oversupply and hampering crude prices.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Average US natural gas prices during the quarter rose about 38 per cent compared with the year-ago quarter.

Affected employees earlier told <em>The Business Times </em>that they were informed of the closure via WhatsApp at 8 pm on Wednesday, with a termination letter accompanying the message. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">No further details were provided by Twelve Cupcakes on the matter. The liquidator, AAG Corporate Advisory, said it is unable to provide details on operations, finances or the reasons for the liquidation before obtaining the relevant information, in response to BT queries on Thursday.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One of Twelve Cupcakes’ outlet managers told BT outside the MOM Services Centre on Friday that the decision to shutter the company came to its staff with zero warning. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We did not know anything (about this) in advance. There was no notice period at all,” he said. “With so many bills to pay, starting with our rent – what are we going to do now?” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He added that the main concern among employees now is the salaries they are owed for October, on top of compensation for the sudden termination of employment, especially since the 30-day notice period was not abided by. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Others BT spoke to on Friday said this is particularly pressing as many affected have rent due at the end of the month. Most said they are expected to foot their rent by Friday or Saturday – or risk facing eviction or incurring late charges.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Those who are foreign workers also said they have debts to repay back home; others have to pay tuition fees for their children.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Some workers noted that Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions were not credited to their accounts for October. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Specific representatives of the counter staff group were addressed by MOM staff in closed-door meetings. These workers told BT after these meetings that they were informed that local unions would handle all compensation-related matters. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">They added that a separate meeting with union members has been set up for next week, though a fixed date and time have yet to be confirmed. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As for S-Pass holders, no extension will be given, which means such affected workers will have 30 days to find a new job in Singapore, or they will have to return to their home country. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Affected workers who gathered at the MOM Service Centre on Friday comprised those on S-Passes, Work Permits and Long-term Visit Passes, as well as Singapore citizens. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We understand that the liquidation will take some time, but we do (at the very least) have to receive our salaries for the month of October today so we can continue covering our basic expenses in Singapore, and to feed our families,” one told BT. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the time being, the group of counter staff are putting together a page to raise donations.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We are truly hoping for the best by next week – and we hope the government can help us in our current situation,” the outlet manager said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A representative from home-grown eatery The Soup Spoon reached out to BT on Friday, offering to assist affected Twelve Cupcakes workers with available job opportunities. The business has store openings lined up starting from next week, with several full-time and part-time positions to fill.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Food, Drinks and Allied Workers Union (FDAWU) on Thursday <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/unacceptable-and-unfair-union-raps-twelve-cupcakes-abrupt-closure-axing-80-workers\" target=\"_blank\">criticised the cupcake’s business’ abrupt closure as “unacceptable and unfair”</a>, strongly objecting to the business owner’s lack of prior consultation and advance notice. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">FDAWU said it will be assisting members and workers with salary-related claims and job-assistance support, as well as connecting them to the labour movement’s network, such as NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">MOM issued a joint statement with CPF Board (CPFB) on Friday evening, noting that the actions of Twelve Cupcakes in this case were “irresponsible” and not aligned with the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Despite being a unionised company under the FDAWU, Twelve Cupcakes did not engage the union early, before affected employees were notified,” they explained. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Taskforce for Responsible Retrenchment and Employment Facilitation, which comprises MOM, Workforce Singapore, the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), and NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute (e2i), is working closely with Twelve Cupcakes and the FDAWU to support the affected employees, said MOM and CPFB. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This will include working with Twelve Cupcakes to provide job matching support and career coaching for these employees.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management will also assist employees of Twelve Cupcakes who need to file a Proof of Debt for their salary and other employment claims with the liquidator. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CPFB, in addition, will be filing a Proof of Debt with the liquidator to recover the outstanding CPF contributions for September and October this year.

US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth sat down with Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun at a gathering in Kuala Lumpur.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The trade truce is poised to resolve – at least for now – months of trade brinkmanship in which the US and China threatened a series of levies and export controls on their products that had the potential to disrupt global supply chains and hurt the world economy. Still, it fell short of a comprehensive agreement to address issues at the heart of US-China economic competition. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Both countries appear determined on further decoupling during the one-year stopgap. Trump used his swing through Asia to bolster relations with key allies such as Japan and South Korea and win investments from them in ship-building and rare earths – areas that would put him in a stronger position to negotiate with Xi a year from now. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Xi touted the attractiveness of China’s economy to the Apec ensemble, trumpeting some US$700 billion in foreign investment he said that his nation had attracted over the past half decade. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While exports to nations outside the US have surged this year, a slump in Chinese factory activity in October extended to its longest decline in nearly a decade, raising questions around the sustainability of that trend.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Xi also talked up his nation’s efforts to open its economy by removing barriers to foreign investment, widening a visa-free programme and opening 22 pilot free-trade zones. Those claims stand in contrast to complaints from leaders in the European Union, for example, who have criticised Beijing for offering preferential treatment to its own companies.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China’s decision to weaponise its rare earth supply chain that is critical to manufacturing everything from cars to chips, has also raised tensions with trading partners beyond the US. That fallout has led to a broad push for countries to reduce their dependency on the Asian nation for such magnets.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China is similarly moving to become less dependent on the US for core technology. The Communist Party recently unveiled a blueprint for its five-year plan focused primarily on achieving key tech breakthroughs, particularly in high-end chips, as China moves to create supply chains independent of the US. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China is set to host the Apec meetings next year.

Its earnings recovered in the latest quarter, driven by conventional memory chip demand.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This week it said it sells its current-generation HBM3E chips to “all related customers”, indicating it has joined rivals in supplying the latest 12-layer HBM3E chips to Nvidia.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The launch of HBM4 chips will be a major test of Samsung’s ability to regain its edge in the market, analysts said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">HBM – a type of dynamic random access memory (Dram) standard first produced in 2013 – involves stacking chips vertically to save space and reduce power consumption, as well as helping to process the large volume of data generated by complex AI applications.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Investors are watching for whether Samsung’s HBM4 can cut SK Hynix’s lead in advanced memory chips. The chipmaker, which is also a leading smartphone maker, said in July that it had provided HBM4 samples to customers, with plans to begin supplying next year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Samsung’s share price has risen nearly 60 per cent since July as investors expect the chipmaker to benefit from the current uptrend in memory prices and advance in the AI race.

That represents a 41.9 per cent drop from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also snaps a brief stabilisation in sales seen a month earlier. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China’s housing slump has dragged on for more than four years, with sales falling further since the second quarter. Mild easing of buying restrictions in some of the biggest cities failed to revive sentiment immediately as the country’s labour market is souring, hurting demand for home shopping. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Beijing is likely to become more committed to supporting domestic demand,” Serena Zhou, senior China economist at Mizuho Securities Asia, wrote in recent note. “Policy initiatives may include central government-led destocking in the property market.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Calls for further policy support for the residential market have grown as home-price declines accelerated, suggesting developers still rely on price cuts to encourage sales. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The country’s new home sales by area may decline another 15 per cent from their current level before the sector stabilises, Lulu Shi, a director at Fitch, projected earlier this week. Transactions by value may drop another 7 to 10 per cent next year, she added. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A group of academics led by an adviser to the country’s central bank last month urged Beijing to stabilise important traditional sectors including real estate, including using fiscal support, echoing calls of other prominent economists. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, the prospect of a strong easing package is growing dim after Asia’s largest economy expanded faster than expected in the third quarter, laying a foundation for achieving policymakers’ full-year expansion goal. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Real estate policies could “focus on risk prevention through market forces, execution of local easing and urban renewals,” Citigroup analysts led by Griffin Chan wrote in an October report. But central government stimulus is unlikely, the report said. BLOOMBERG </p></div>",
