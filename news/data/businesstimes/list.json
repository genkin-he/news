But in the volatile, fiery crucible that is the markets in 2026, it’s the Year of Geopolitics.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Eight weeks into the year, we’ve had to experience – and anticipate – risks around Ukraine, Israel, Venezuela, Greenland, plus the worrying and current concentration of <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/edge-precipice-us-iran-crisis-2026\" target=\"_blank\">US military assets off Iran</a>. Simultaneously, we’ve been grappling with concerns around the independence of the US Federal Reserve, and the <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/despite-legal-woes-trumps-tariffs-remain-challenge-south-east-asia\" target=\"_blank\">additional trade tariffs</a> announced by US President Donald Trump following the recent Supreme Court ruling.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It begs the question: In an environment where economic growth remains resilient, how should we price geopolitical risk? Should we sell now and ask questions later? Or should we discount, look through, or simply ignore? Should Asian markets – from Tokyo to Mumbai – treat geopolitical risks as transient noise to be filtered out, or as a material threat requiring active and urgent defensive repositioning? </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Inevitably (and unfortunately) there is no easy answer. Our region exhibits specific economic vulnerabilities and thus a unique set of transmission channels through which geopolitical risk flows across asset prices. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">These complexities require a more nuanced response than either pure complacency or panic selling. So in this Year of Geopolitics, I share the Lombard Odier framework which analyses and assesses geopolitical risk, and how to position (our Asia-tilted) portfolios accordingly. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Loud headlines, quiet markets</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">First, to look beyond emotion. Geopolitical events, while heavily covered in media, generate limited and short-lived stress in financial markets. Volatility tends to be episodic, with asset prices recovering within hours (as in the case of “Liberation Day” in 2025), days or weeks – unless fundamental economic channels are disrupted. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">At Lombard Odier, we believe markets are primarily macro-driven, responding to negative forces such as financial crises, recessions and pandemics rather than geopolitical shocks. This shifts investor focus from predicting the unpredictable – such as wars, elections and diplomatic breakdowns – towards assessing when such events threaten corporate profitability and economic stability.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Second, identify whether key economic transmission channels are disrupted. Markets respond meaningfully when critical technologies such as semiconductors are restricted, and/or when energy and commodity markets face sustained supply constraints; for example, if conflicts in the Strait of Hormuz or Suez Canal closed oil markets or interrupted supply chains. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Finally, assess whether a geopolitical event impairs companies’ ability to generate profits. Outside of recessions, corporate earnings tend to keep growing, and markets look through transient volatility if demand stays intact and cost structures remain undamaged. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Investors should ask a simple, disciplined question: Does this event alter revenue growth or margins in a sustained way? If the answer is no, then geopolitical risk belongs to short-term noise rather than longer-term strategic asset allocation.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Following these three principles offers resilience when applied to portfolio construction. It recognises that markets price economic implications, rather than ethical or moral judgments. By focusing on whether profitability is genuinely threatened rather than forecasting specific shocks, Lombard Odier believes we can navigate our adapting, fragmented world order.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Asia tilt</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Treating geopolitical risk as a globally “uniform” phenomenon obscures crucial regional distinctions. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Different risks will affect different regions differently. For example, Asian markets face asymmetric exposure to Middle Eastern conflict through (extreme) energy import dependence, concentrated shipping chokepoint vulnerability and complex supply chain integration that compounds during disruption to global trade flows.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Crucially, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and India import 80 to 100 per cent of their petroleum requirements, with substantial volumes transiting the Strait of Hormuz. China’s onshore crude inventories – including its strategic petroleum reserve – cover over 90 days of imports, a buffer that does not entirely eliminate vulnerability to (sustained) supply disruption. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The per-barrel price of Brent crude is higher by 18 per cent year to date, suggesting potentially compressed margins for energy-hungry Asian airlines, chemical producers and power utilities. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Yet historical examples suggest that unless physical supply is interrupted, price spikes prove temporary. The 2019 attacks on Saudi Aramco facilities and the 2021 Suez Canal blockage produced initial volatility followed by rapid normalisation as alternative sourcing, inventory draws and demand elasticity restored market balance. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Asian investors must distinguish between the substantial risk premium currently embedded in energy markets and the probability of actual supply curtailment that would transform premium into sustained economic damage. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Seek, discover, decide</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The challenge for Asian investors in this Year of Geopolitics is constructing portfolios that endure geopolitical volatility without – as ever – sacrificing performance. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The solution lies neither in blanket defensive positioning nor in naive “all-in” risk appetite, but in differentiation – identifying specific vulnerabilities and opportunities that regional complexities create. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For example, (enduring) US-China geopolitical tensions are giving rise to a new wave of sectoral opportunities. Asian equity markets have commenced significant reallocation towards “strategic autonomy” such as semiconductor manufacturing equipment, rare earth processing, renewables and space-related technologies, creating competitive advantages less susceptible to volatilities in global trade. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This rotation provides a mechanism for reducing portfolio “geopolitical beta” without retreating to cash.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Lombard Odier believes resilience emerges from understanding that markets are discounting machines, rather than moral arbiters. Markets price economic implications; they do not make ethical judgments.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The intelligent allocator builds diversified portfolios that endure shocks through robust strategic and tactical asset allocation, allowing them to navigate an adapting, fragmented order without panic or complacency.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>The writer is chief investment officer for Asia at Lombard Odier</strong></p></div>",

            "title": "Zeekr 7X review: A taxing situation",
            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[SINGAPORE] The first time I drove a Zeekr 7X, it had a fold-down tray table in the back seat, the kind you’d find in a Rolls-Royce Phantom. The electrically reclining passenger-side rear seat felt like something for a prince. There was even a self-driving mode that let the Zeekr navigate traffic lights and junctions on its own, behaving more politely than most BMW drivers.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That was in China in 2025. The Performance AWD version I tried in Singapore doesn’t have the tray table, the fancy reclining seat or the autonomous driving wizardry. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Instead, it comes with a road tax bill that makes you wonder if you’ve accidentally bought a Rolls-Royce anyway: S$6,918 a year, enough to make the Land Transport Authority (LTA) staff send you a Christmas card every year. Electric cars are taxed on motor output here, and the range-topping 7X has a lot of it.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even without the bells and whistles that come with Chinese versions of the car, the 7X Performance certainly has the numbers to back up Zeekr’s ambition to build cars plusher than Tesla’s and more high-tech than Mercedes-Benz’s.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its two motors pack 646 horsepower (not long ago, the stuff of Ferraris). It hits 100 kmh in 3.9 seconds, which is the kind of thrill that used to require a 5.0-litre V8, except now it’s delivered silently and smoothly by a 100 kilowatt-hour battery good for 540 km.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As fast as the Zeekr is, the general driving experience is more serene than stimulating, even when the world passes by the windows in a blur. There’s little steering feel, and the air suspension prioritises plushness over engagement, which makes things supple and refined – but more like a day at the spa, rather than Spa-Francorchamps.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The inevitable comparison: the Tesla Model Y has sharper handling and more feedback. The Zeekr is what you buy if you value cushiness over cornering.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That said, the serene undertone running through the 7X experience feels like a complement to its aesthetics’ Scandinavian overtones. Its design was overseen by Stefan Sielaff, the ex-Bentley styling chief who now runs Zeekr’s Gothenburg studio. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Inside and out, there’s a clean, minimalist elegance that feels far more Nordic spa than Chinese nouveau riche. The cabin is lined in soft Nappa leather and quality materials that make it look like the Germans have been pinching their pfennigs.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, the list of creature comforts is as long as Zeekr’s history is short. The Performance comes with self-operating doors (again, very Rolls-Royce), a heads-up display, massage seats, and passenger seat controls on the towkay side in the back that let you create more legroom for yourself. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Window shades foil the paparazzi, and an actual fridge or food warmer lets you transport treats at the proper temperature, whether champagne or laksa.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Then, there are the basics that somehow still elude Tesla: Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a proper instrument cluster, a sunshade for the glass roof, and something my wife wishes I had on my forehead – a volume knob for the sound system.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">My only real gripe is that the air-conditioning feels a bit feeble for our climate. Actually, I do have another: Even if you opt for one of the single-motor RWD versions, you still have to pay S$361 a month for road tax, for which you can thank its brawny 422-horsepower motor. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Model Y – or, for that matter, electric alternatives such as the BMW iX2, BYD Sealion 7, MG MGS6 EV and XPeng G6 – doesn’t oblige you to fill the LTA’s coffers so generously.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The people at Zeekr must be tearing their hair out over how making their cars more powerful has ended up making them less compelling here, rather than more.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But the rest of the 7X does feel a cut above the others named on this page, in terms of what you can see and touch. It feels, in short, like what you might consider when it’s time to upgrade from that Tesla. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It’s not as opulent as a Phantom, of course, but if it’s more powerful and expensive than similar-sized rivals, that is entirely intentional, and just how Zeekr rolls.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\"><strong>Zeekr 7X Performance AWD</strong>\n<strong>Motor power/Torque</strong> 646 hp/710 Nm\n<strong>Battery type/Net capacity </strong>Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt/100 kWh\n<strong>Charging time/Type</strong> 16 minutes 10 to 80 per cent (420 kW DC), 5.5 hours (22 kW AC)\n<strong>Range</strong> 543 km\n<strong>0-100 kmh </strong>3.9 seconds\n<strong>Top speed</strong> 210 kmh\n<strong>Efficiency</strong> 20 kWh/100 km\n<strong>Agent</strong> Premium Automobiles BEV\n<strong>Price</strong> S$288,999 with COE\n<strong>Available </strong>Now</p></div>",

LBC rates were increased for residential, commercial, industrial and place of worship/civic and community institution uses. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Developers pay an LBC for the right to enhance the use of some sites or to build bigger projects on them. The rates are stated according to use groups across 118 geographical sectors in Singapore.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">LBC rates for non-landed residential use have been raised by 4.1 per cent on average. LBC rates in 114 sectors have been raised by around 3 to 23 per cent. There are no changes in the other four sectors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For landed residential use, LBC rates have risen by 4 per cent on average.

All 118 sectors saw increases ranging from around 2 to 9 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">LBC rates for commercial use have gone up by 0.5 per cent on average. Twenty of the 118 geographical sectors will see increases of around 3 to 4 per cent, with no change for the remaining 98 sectors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the place of worship/civic and community institution use group, LBC rates have increased by 3 per cent on average across all 118 sectors.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Commenting on the broad-based increases in LBC rates, JLL’s head of research and consultancy for South-east Asia Chua Yang Liang said: “Persistent strong results at government land sales (GLS) tenders would have motivated the chief valuer (CV) to adjust the LBC rates accordingly.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Some of the adjustments were also motivated by the residual gap between recent market transactions and the implied land value based on Sep 1, 2025, LBC  rates for that use group and location.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">LBC rates are announced twice a year, on Mar 1 and Sep 1, following a review by the Singapore Land Authority in consultation with the taxman’s CV.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For non-landed residential use, the biggest LBC rate hike of 22.7 per cent was in Sector 97 which includes the Bedok South area. JLL’s analysis showed that the S$1,330 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr) top bid for the Bedok Rise GLS site in November 2025 was about 36 per cent above the implied land value based on the Sep 1, 2025, LBC rate for non-landed residential use in the sector.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Also in November, a GLS tender for a site next to Newton MRT interchange station fetched a top bid of nearly S$1,820 psf ppr. This was 16 per cent above the implied land value based on the Sep 1, 2025, LBC rate for non-landed residential use in that location, which is in Sector 37, where the LBC rate is being raised by 10.2 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Huttons Asia chief executive officer Mark Yip noted that the 4.1 per cent rise on average for non-landed residential use LBC rates is the biggest increase since September 2022. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He added: “The strong take-up at private residential project launches in 2025 renewed the need among developers to replenish their land banks. As well, reduced borrowing costs for developers boosted their ability to pay more for GLS sites amid the increased competition.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">On industrial LBC rates being raised across all 118 sectors by about 2 to 9 per cent, Wong Shanting, research head for Singapore at Newmark, noted: “This broad-based uplift reflects an active industrial market, underpinned by several high-value transactions that have driven land costs higher.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">An example would be 680 Upper Thomson Road, which was sold in October 2025 for about S$665 psf ppr. Based on JLL’s analysis, this was a 190 per cent premium to the land value implied by the Sep 1, 2025, industrial LBC rate for the area, which is in Sector 107; the LBC rate for the sector has been raised by 9.3 per cent.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Summing up, Dr Chua of JLL said: “The refreshed LBC rates should not have any significant drag on the market trend or dampen developers’ and investors’ longer-term confidence in the underlying property market.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, CBRE’s research head for Singapore and South-east Asia Tricia Song pointed out: “The increase in residential LBC rates could further increase acquisition costs for developers, and dampen an already-weak collective sale market.”</p></div>",
