This brought its FY2025 earnings to 8.6 billion yuan, 30.2 per cent higher than the previous year’s 6.6 billion yuan. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its revenue rose 15.8 per cent on the year to 15.6 billion yuan for the half-year, and climbed 7.4 per cent to 28.5 billion yuan for the full-year. The topline growth was fuelled by the progressive construction of vessels secured at higher newbuild prices. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CGSI in a Friday report maintained its “add” call for Yangzijiang Shipbuilding, citing the group’s earnings growth – backed by a US$22.4 billion orderbook – and an attractive nine times forward price-to-earnings ratio.<strong> </strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The brokerage raised its target price for the counter from S$4.51 to S$4.95, a premium of 14.1 per cent above the stock’s Friday closing price.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CGSI analyst Lim Siew Khee noted that the shipbuilder’s final dividend of S$0.20 per share for FY2025, an increase from S$0.12 per share in FY2024, implies a 50 per cent payout ratio which is a “positive surprise”. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Similarly, DBS said on Thursday that it would likely maintain its “buy” call on the counter, with its S$3.80 target price under review. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">DBS analyst Ho Pei Hwa noted that the stock’s FY2025 net profit beat consensus by 3 to 4 per cent, and that the roughly US$290 million worth of new orders secured by the group in December brings its full-year order wins to around US$2.5 billion. </p></div>",

This was primarily due to weaker healthcare sales, as consumer confidence softened amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Conversely, the company recorded lower expenses during the period. The cost of sales fell 18.9 per cent to S$46.3 million, in line with the lower revenue. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Distribution and marketing expenses shrank by 40.3 per cent to S$15.4 million, mainly driven by reduced activities for the healthcare segment. Finance expenses also dropped by 29.1 per cent, largely due to lower borrowing rates.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As a result of these factors, Haw Par’s gross margin remained stable at 55.3 per cent in the second half of 2025, sitting slightly above the 55 per cent margin in the corresponding period of the preceding year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the full year, Haw Par’s profit rose 16.3 per cent to S$265.5 million. This bottom-line growth occurred despite a 6.1 per cent decrease in full-year revenue to S$230 million, which was dragged down by the drop in demand for healthcare in the second half of the year.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its healthcare segment revenue contracted 6.9 per cent to S$210.4 million. Haw Par attributed this drop primarily to lower sales in Asia, noting that consumers have become increasingly cautious in their spending amid weaker sentiment in certain markets. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, tighter cost management on operating expenses helped improve the operating margin. Consequently, the healthcare segment’s operating profit grew by 7.2 per cent to S$67.1 million in 2025.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Revenue from its other segments, which comprise Leisure and Property, improved by 4 per cent to S$19.6 million. This growth was supported by better performance at Underwater World Pattaya, which welcomed more visitors during the year; the group’s Singapore investment properties enjoyed improved average occupancy. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The higher revenue translated into a 3.7 per cent increase in operating profit for these segments, rising to S$10.6 million.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Haw Par expects global economic growth to remain uneven, and to slow down even further if geopolitical tensions escalate. The company stated that this uncertainty “may dampen consumer confidence and discretionary spending, potentially affecting demand for the group’s products and services”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Shares of Haw Par Group rose 1.9 per cent to close S$0.31 higher at S$16.70, before the results were announced.</p></div>",

Petronas reported a 2.2 per cent increase in carbon emissions in 2025 to 56.95 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, attributed mainly to the transfer of operations for two production sharing contracts.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The firm also reported a 72 per cent reduction in methane emissions, exceeding its target of 50 per cent.

Local institutions and retail investors, meanwhile, were net buyers. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Korean stocks have been on a tear, trouncing other markets as the benchmark soared 170 per cent since an April low. Home to Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, the country has been a direct beneficiary of the memory boom, sidestepping turbulence even as the so-called “AI scare trade” rattled investors elsewhere. Yet the relentless rally driven by a handful of stocks has started to look precarious to some.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“A large sell number tells you sentiment is being reset and positioning is being cleaned up,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets. “Memory upcycle has been a clear narrative, so when volatility rises, the quickest move is to reduce exposure in crowded trades. That can create big flow prints even if fundamentals are intact.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The gauge soared past the 6,000 threshold this week, just a month after surpassing President Lee Jae-myung’s political goal of 5,000. The country’s market valuation even exceeded that of European heavyweights Germany and France. The frenzy to gain exposure to Korean names caused abnormal moves and volumes in exchange-traded funds listed overseas.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Despite the massive selling by foreigners, few see this as a bearish turning point. Kospi still trades at 10.4 times forward earnings estimates, compared to S&amp;P 500’s 21.3 and MSCI Asia-Pacific at 15.3. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The corporate governance reform is also making headway. The parliament this week approved a long-debated legal revision requiring companies to cancel treasury shares. A day later, the president urged a revamp in inheritance tax rules to keep boosting capital markets. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A month-end rebalancing of benchmarks and profit-taking after the breakneck rally triggered the pullback, said Kim Namho, a fund manager at Timefolio Investment Management in Seoul. “Even so, consensus holds that Korean equities remain undervalued, with ample upside after this pause.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Yuanta Securities said MSCI’s rebalancing scheduled for Friday would trigger weight adjustments in funds such as the US-listed iShares MSCI South Korea ETF after Samsung Electronics’ weight exceeded the 25 per cent cap set by regulators. Samsung shares have surged 80 per cent so far this year.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Retail participation is also accelerating, suggesting further upside potential. Investor deposits at the nation’s brokerages – cash available for stock purchases – rose to a new all-time high of 119.5 trillion won, according to Korea Financial Investment Association data. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“There will be opportunities in South Korea amidst any extended sell-off, and we’ll be there as long-term investors,” said Vikas Pershad, an Asian equities portfolio manager at M&amp;G Investments.

The team hammered Inter in the first leg of the matchup in Norway and kept it at arm’s length in the second. Despite producing less possession (71 per cent to 29 per cent) and fewer shots (30 to seven) in Milan, Bodo never looked in real danger.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This is Bodo’s first season in the Champions League, having come through the qualifiers to reach the league phase, but it also looked likely to go out rather quietly at that stage: After six of its eight games, it stood at 32nd in the standings, having not recorded a win. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It had to beat Manchester City and then Atletico Madrid to stand a chance of even reaching these playoffs, which it somehow managed, but surely the Norwegian team would not be able to pull off another upset? As it turns out, it very much could.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Can you believe it?” Knutsen said after the game, his eyes wide with wonder at what his team had achieved. “I can’t actually believe it. The players were amazing. I’m so proud.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It is also worth pointing out that Bodo is playing in its offseason: The Norwegian league finished in November, and while the end of the domestic season coincided with the team’s revival in Europe, and it has not lost since, it goes against conventional wisdom that a team can succeed without the rhythm of regular football  matches.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“It sounds not true,” said Jens Petter Hauge, the winger who started at Bodo but then left for Inter’s rivals AC Milan in 2020. He returned to Bodo in 2024. “What we have done, I’m so proud of the group. We’re all in this together, and we believe so much in this project.”</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Effective strategy</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Bodo’s success has not come because of some wealthy benefactor. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This is more organic, broadly explained by Knutsen’s adherence to high-intensity, high-energy football and a recruitment strategy that not only finds players who fit that approach, but also identifies those with raw talent and an X-factor – one single outstanding quality that everyone else might have overlooked because the player might be raw and unpolished.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This strategy has worked in recent years, when the team was merely bloodying the noses of the big boys in European football’s two lesser competitions, the Europa League and the Conference League, and it is still working at the highest level, and with some gusto.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Is this win over Inter the biggest upset in the history of the Champions League knockout stages? </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It could well be. Other nominations might include Dynamo Kyiv beating Real Madrid in 1999; Deportivo La Coruna producing an astonishing comeback to beat Milan in 2003-04; or maybe Monaco beating Manchester City in 2016-17. Bodo’s achievement is different from all of those.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It is certainly one of the more extraordinary runs of form the Champions League has ever seen. It is also, as the data firm Opta pointed out, the first time since 1972 that a team from outside the top five European leagues – England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France – has won four consecutive games against teams from those nations in the Champions League or its predecessor, the European Cup. That team in 1972 was Ajax Amsterdam, which went on to win the whole thing.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This is not the first time Bodo/Glimt has made an Italian giant look small: In 2021, it hammered Jose Mourinho’s Roma 6-1 in the Europa Conference League. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Up next for the Norwegian club is either Sporting Lisbon or Manchester City. You would not bet on it being their last miracle, either. NYTIMES</p></div>",

In particular, revenue from its public transport business was 8.2 per cent higher at S$1.7 billion. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This was attributed to the commencement of UK Metroline Manchester contracts, UK London bus contracts renewed at improved margins and increased Singapore rail fare revenues, though these were partially offset by the transfer of the Jurong West bus package.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Meanwhile, operating profit from the public transport segment rose 35.3 per cent to S$101.5 million. The group stated this was mainly due to a gain on the disposal of Victoria bus depots as part of newly awarded contracts, contributions from the UK Metroline Manchester contracts and improved margins on UK Metroline London bus contracts.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Its taxi and private-hire vehicle business revenue surged 21.7 per cent to S$512.6 million, mainly from the incremental revenue from the 2024 acquisition of Addison Lee, which was offset by a decrease in the taxi fleet size in Singapore. However, operating profit for this segment fell 25.2 per cent to S$53.9 million. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">This decline was mainly attributed to lower revenue contributions in Singapore, alongside higher amortisation expenses of intangible assets arising from the A2B and Addison Lee acquisitions.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the second half, revenue from its other private transport segment grew 7.5 per cent to S$250.2 million, contributed by CMAC in the UK, but offset by lower contributions from Australia non-emergency patient transport. Operating profit for the segment came in at S$11.3 million, representing a 21.5 per cent drop from S$14.4 million in the second half of 2024.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For FY2025, the group posted a 9.4 per cent improvement in earnings to S$230.3 million, from S$210.5 million. Its top line increased 13 per cent to S$5.1 billion, from S$4.5 billion.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A final dividend of S$0.0459 per share has been proposed, which takes the total dividend for the year to S$0.0850 per share, inclusive of the interim dividend of S$0.0391 per share. This represents a payout ratio of 80 per cent of profit after tax and minority interests. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">It will be paid on May 13, subject to shareholder approval.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Outlook</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">ComfortDelGro’s managing director and group CEO, Cheng Siak Kian, described crossing the S$5 billion revenue mark as a “defining milestone”, reflecting strong operational discipline and the focused execution of its international growth strategy. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Revenue from outside the home market of Singapore expanded to 55.3 per cent of total revenue, up from 49.1 per cent the year before.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Rail fare increases granted by the Public Transport Council took effect from December 2025. The Tampines public bus package is scheduled for handover to a new operator from July 2026.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">London public bus contract renewals are expected to continue at improved margins. The group is participating in ongoing Liverpool and West Yorkshire public bus franchise tenders, as well as the Copenhagen metro tender with RATP Dev. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In Australia, the new Metropolitan Zero Emission Bus franchises in Victoria that commenced in July 2025 will contribute in full in 2026, with industrywide shortage of bus drivers easing.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The business-to-consumer segment is expected to remain under pressure due to intense competition from ride-hailing companies. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The group is also aggressively developing autonomous vehicle (AV) capabilities, aiming to transition 10 per cent of its point-to-point fleet to AVs by 2030. This involves scaling existing operations in China and Singapore, such as the Zig Driverless AV shuttle familiarisation programme and exploring pilot projects in London. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">ComfortDelGro’s shares closed at S$1.55, up 1.3 per cent or S$0.020, before its financial results were posted.</p></div>",
