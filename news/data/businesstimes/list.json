Yong has not been charged and his passport has not impounded. He has been informed by CPIB that he is free to travel.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Based on information provided by Yong, “it appears that” the allegations are the same as what was previously raised in a whistle-blowing report received by the Audit Committee (AC) in FY2024 ended Sep 30, Nam Lee said. The AC had referred it to the internal auditors who concluded that nothing has surfaced or indicated a need for further investigation. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">However, in the course of the internal auditors’ investigations, procedural lapses and control gaps in operational matters were uncovered and reported to the AC, said the company. The AC then highlighted the issues to management, and the required remedial actions have been undertaken, it added.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">These actions were done in the course of reviewing the whistle-blowing report back in 2024, and two different independent professional services firms were appointed to review the work and findings. RSM SG Risk Advisory was the internal auditor and EY was the external auditor for Nam Lee.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Guided by these, the independent directors were unanimously of the view that the 2024 review had adequately addressed the allegations raised in the 2024 whistle-blowing report, and that no further action on the 2024 review was warranted,” said Nam Lee.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In light of the CPIB interview, Yong has recused himself from deliberations and decisions of the nominating committee (NC), of which he, as an executive director, is a member. Yong is also the cousin of executive director Adrian Yong and chairman Joanna Yong. Adrian Yong has also recused himself from the NC relating to this announcement.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The NC has concluded that Eric Yong can continue in his role as the managing director, with “no new factual information” that would cast doubt on his character or integrity, said Nam Lee. The company does not expect the present allegations to lead to a material financial impact.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The NC thus considers that there is no immediate necessity to implement any particular precautionary steps in respect of managing director at this juncture,” said Nam Lee.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Shares of Nam Lee closed unchanged at S$0.565 on Friday, before the announcement.</p></div>",

In brief remarks at the start of their meeting, both leaders said they would seek to advance ties.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While relations between the historic rivals have been on a sounder footing in recent years, Takaichi’s surprise elevation to become Japan’s first female leader may strain ties due to her nationalistic views and hawkish security policies.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One of her first acts since taking office last week, was to accelerate a military build-up aimed at deterring the territorial ambitions of an increasingly assertive China in East Asia. Japan also hosts the biggest concentration of US military abroad.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The detention of Japanese nationals in China and Beijing’s import restrictions on Japanese beef, seafood and agricultural products were also likely to be among sensitive issues on the agenda.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney also held talks with Xi, aiming to restart broad engagement with China after years of poor relations.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Embroiled in a bitter trade dispute with the United States, Canada’s biggest trading partner, Carney told a gathering of executives running parallel to the main summit on Friday that Ottawa aimed to double its non-US exports over the next decade.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China is Canada’s second-biggest trading partner.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Under the leadership of Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau, Canadians were detained and executed by the Chinese government and Canada’s security authorities concluded that China interfered in at least two federal elections. Xi also publicly scolded Trudeau, alleging he leaked their discussions to the press.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China announced preliminary anti-dumping duties on Canadian canola imports in August, a year after Canada said it would levy a 100 per cent tariff on imports of Chinese electric vehicles. Senior officials from both sides met to discuss those issues earlier this month but gave no indication of any looming breakthrough.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Xi also met Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, while South Korean President Lee Jae Myung will tackle Korean denuclearisation with the Chinese leader at a summit on Saturday.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As he held his summits, Xi’s commerce minister delivered a speech on his behalf to the gathering of executives, in which he said China was the “ideal” destination for global business and investment.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In other business, Taiwan said it was making progress on a tariff deal with the United States, and South Korea said final details of its deal with Washington were almost ready after a breakthrough agreed on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said on Thursday that he was hopeful Apec leaders would issue a joint declaration when the summit concludes on Saturday.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Two Apec member-nation diplomats privately expressed scepticism that any statement would be particularly substantive given fractures in global politics.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Apec, which stretches from Russia to Chile and accounts for 50 per cent of global trade, failed to adopt a joint declaration in 2018 and 2019, during Trump’s first presidency.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">There was also some business deals on the sidelines with US chipmaker Nvidia agreeing on a US$3 billion AI joint venture with South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Group.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang has had a whirlwind week, with Nvidia becoming the first company to surpass a US$5 trillion valuation, but the issue of the US chipmaker’s sale of advanced AI chips in China was seemingly left out of Thursday’s Xi-Trump summit.

            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[SEOUL] China’s President Xi Jinping and Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi had their first formal meeting on the sidelines of the Apec conference on Friday (Oct 31), as tensions spanning from trade to security continue to simmer between the two countries.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Xi said he was ready to maintain communication with the Japanese leader and to advance ties between China and Japan, according to Xinhua News Agency. Takaichi responded by saying “China is an important partner for Japan. We both have an important responsibility to promote peace and prosperity in the region and globally.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">China is Japan’s largest trading partner while the US provides Tokyo with crucial security guarantees, which forces Japan into an awkward balancing act when China and the US are increasingly at loggerheads. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A number of bilateral issues also continue to simmer, including China’s increasing military activity around a disputed cluster of islands called the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, trade restrictions including on the export of rare earths, as well as concerns over maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Takaichi’s ties with politicians in Taiwan and her previous visits to a shrine in Tokyo that is associated with Japan’s past militarism add a further element of tension to the talks.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Still, Xi and Takaichi stuck to the diplomatic groundwork laid out in previous meetings between leaders of the two nations. At the top of the meeting, they reaffirmed the stance of pursuing “strategic and mutually beneficial ties” as well as a “constructive and stable relationship”.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I have made principle and action my political creed. I would like to continue straightforward discussions with chairman Xi and deepen our relationship as leaders,” Takaichi said in the meeting, which lasted slightly less than half an hour, according to the Japanese government.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Although known for her hawkish stance on diplomacy, Takaichi appears to be taking a more pragmatic approach after becoming prime minister. In a sign of her shifting stance, she skipped her usual visit to the Yasukuni shrine.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Despite that decision, China still appears to be weighing up the new leader. In a break from recent practice, Xi has not yet publicly congratulated Takaichi on her election to the premiership, despite sending words of congratulations to her predecessors soon after they became prime minister.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The talks come in a year when China has continued to demonstrate its growing presence in the region. In June Beijing sent two aircraft carriers into the Pacific simultaneously for the first time, underscoring China’s growing military reach and increasing worries in Tokyo after they were spotted inside Japan’s exclusive economic zone.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While it’s unknown yet if Takaichi mentioned that or other territorial disputes, it is likely she touched on the issue of recent curbs on the export of critical minerals. While those were put in place as leverage in the trade war between China and the US, the slump in shipments also affected other economies including Japan, South Korea and the European Union. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The supply of rare earths, 17 elements that are crucial to the manufacturing of cars and chips, is likely to be a topic of particular interest for Takaichi, whose previous experience includes a stint as economic security minister.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even as a meeting between Xi and US President Donald Trump on Thursday resulted in the promise of a temporary reprieve in the restrictions by China, key members of Takaichi’s Cabinet spelt out Tokyo’s continued concern about the curbs.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In a call to China’s top diplomat Wang Yi, Japan’s new Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi expressed strong concern, as did Japan’s Trade Minister Ryosei Akazawa in a meeting with China’s Commerce Minister Wang Wentao on Thursday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economy Cooperation meeting in South Korea.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“I expressed strong concern over the severe impact on the global supply chain, including Japan, caused by China’s export controls on rare earths. We strongly urged China to take appropriate measures,” Akazawa told reporters after the meeting.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For China, Takaichi’s visits to Taiwan, including a trip with a parliamentary delegation in April, are a likely source of concern. Beijing will also want to try to limit Tokyo’s willingness to cooperate with Washington on efforts to build supply chains not involving China and to restrict access to high-tech chip technology and supplies.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Following the call between Motegi and Wang, China’s government spokesperson said that Beijing valued statements from Takaichi that Japan did not intend to decouple from China. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">We hope Japan will “work with China to uphold the political foundation for bilateral ties and continue to improve and develop China-Japan relations in the right direction.,” spokesman Guo Jiakun added.

The liquidator, AAG Corporate Advisory, said it is unable to provide details on operations, finances or the reasons for the liquidation before obtaining the relevant information, in response to queries on Thursday by BT. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">One of Twelve Cupcakes’ outlet managers told BT outside the MOM Services Centre on Friday that the decision to shutter Twelve Cupcakes came to its staff with zero warning. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We did not know anything (about this) in advance. There was no notice period at all,” he said. “With so many bills to pay, starting with our rent – what are we going to do now?” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">He added that the main concern among employees now is the salaries they are owed for the month of October, on top of compensation for the sudden termination of employment, especially since a 30-day notice period was not abided by. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Others BT spoke to on Friday said this is particularly pressing as many of those affected have rent due at the end of the month. Most said they are expected to foot their rent by Friday or Saturday – or risk facing eviction or incurring late charges. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Certain landlords are very strict (with payment deadlines). This means that if we don’t have the money immediately, we have to leave,” said one worker. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Those who are foreign workers also said they have debts to repay back home; others have to pay tuition fees for their children.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Some workers noted that Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions were not credited to their accounts for October. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Specific representatives of the counter staff group were addressed by MOM staff in closed-door meetings. These workers told BT after these meetings that they were told local unions will handle all compensation-related matters. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">They added that a separate meeting with union members has been set up for next week, though a fixed date and time has yet to be confirmed. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">As for S-Pass holders, no extension will be given, which means such affected workers will have 30 days to find a new job in Singapore, or they will have to return to their home country. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Affected workers who gathered at the MOM Service Centre on Friday comprised those on S-Passes, Work Permits and Long-term Visit Passes, as well as Singapore citizens. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We understand that the liquidation will take some time, but we do (at the very least) have to receive our salaries for the month of October today so we can continue covering our basic expenses in Singapore, and to feed our families,” one told BT. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">For the time being, the group of counter staff are putting together a page to raise donations.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“We are truly hoping for the best by next week – and we hope the government can help us in our current situation,” the outlet manager said. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">A representative from home-grown eatery The Soup Spoon reached out to BT on Friday, offering to assist affected Twelve Cupcakes workers with available job opportunities. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The business has store openings lined up starting from next week, with several full-time and part-time positions to fill.  </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The Food, Drinks and Allied Workers Union (FDAWU) on Thursday <a class=\"text-verticals-btblue underline\" data-testid=\"article-annotation-link-component\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/unacceptable-and-unfair-union-raps-twelve-cupcakes-abrupt-closure-axing-80-workers\" target=\"_blank\">criticised the cupcake’s business’ abrupt closure as “unacceptable and unfair”</a>, strongly objecting to the business owner’s lack of prior consultation and advance notice. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">FDAWU said it will be assisting members and workers with salary-related claims and job-assistance support, as well as connecting them to the labour movement’s network, such as NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">BT<em> </em>has reached out to MOM and the CPF Board for comment. </p></div>",

Sister brand Porsche scaling back its EV ambitions added to the strains, Audi said on Friday (Oct 31).</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“The situation remains very demanding,” chief financial officer Jürgen Rittersberger said on a call with reporters, noting that the brand is expecting a US$1.5 billion hit from tariffs this year. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The luxury-car maker also needs to find a solution for models it had planned to build on a joint EV platform with Porsche that has now been delayed, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Delivering on the financial goals will also depend on sourcing enough semiconductors as part of the disruption to the supply of chips made by Nexperia, Audi said, echoing VW’s warning on Thursday. Manufacturers are at risk of production shutdowns after the little-known chipmaker in the Netherlands emerged in the crossfire of a dispute with China. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Aside from renewed supply chain risk, the VW unit is seeking to streamline its business to cut costs, while working on a record model offensive. Audi, historically a major profit driver for its parent, has been hit hard by tariffs in the US and sliding market share in China. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">During the third quarter, the Audi brand posted an operating margin of 2 per cent for a profit of 280 million euros (S$421.4 million). That compares with a slightly negative result last year when the brand booked costs related to the closure of its Brussels factory.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">CFO Rittersberger said Audi is still considering a range of options to start making cars in the US. A decision will be made before the end of the year, he told reporters on a call. BLOOMBERG</p></div>",

            "title": "Why a six-wheel Lexus, Japan’s Rolls-Royce and an incomplete car matter so much to Toyota",
            "description": "<div class=\"mx-auto my-4 font-lucida text-xl leading-8 -tracking-5% text-gray-850 md:mb-6 md:px-8\" data-testid=\"article-body-container\"><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">[TOKYO] Toyota brought the biggest cars to the Japan Mobility Show 2025, and was arguably also at the heart of the biggest story there. Its chairman, Akio Toyoda, grew visibly emotional as he unveiled the Century Coupe concept, a sleek yet hulking fastback from a new brand created to tempt buyers away from Rolls-Royce and Bentley.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Japan as a nation seems to have lost some of its energy and dynamism, along with our presence in the world,” he said to the press on Wednesday (Oct 29). “I believe now more than ever, we need the Century.” The new luxury label would “bring the pride of Japan out into the world”, he said.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Toyoda’s press conference provided a dramatic opening to the event, which runs until Nov 9 and is expected to draw more than a million visitors to the sprawling halls of the Tokyo Big Sight exhibition space. Here was the chairman of the world’s largest carmaker acknowledging that Japan – and perhaps by extension its car industry – needs to reclaim some lost mojo.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With its lurid orange bodywork (courtesy of 60 layers of paint), handcrafted parts and sumptuous interior, the Century Coupe already carries a nameplate loaded with meaning. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The original Century, launched in 1967 to honour the 100th anniversary of Toyota founder Sakichi Toyoda’s birth, wore an emblem with Japan’s phoenix, a mythical bird that serves as an imperial symbol of peace, prosperity and renewal. “I believe this car was born carrying Japan on its shoulders,” Toyoda said of that first model.</p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Wholesale reset</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Century’s launch is part of a wholesale reset that will see Toyota reorganise its sprawling product line-up into five standalone brands, which also include Toyota itself, Lexus, Daihatsu and Gazoo Racing (its performance and motorsport division).</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">The group announced on Oct 13 that Century will sit at the pinnacle, giving Lexus room to evolve and “to be adventurous and innovative”, according to chief branding officer Simon Humphries.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">That adventurousness showed up on six wheels, in the form of the LS Concept, a rectilinear people mover that looks like a rolling lounge. Ironically, the concept car takes the form of a huge box precisely to exemplify some out-of-the-box thinking from a brand that Toyota launched to disrupt British and German luxury carmakers.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Inside, bamboo slats provide privacy, fine woodworking lines the cabin and the space feels genuinely palatial. The six-wheel layout wasn’t a provocation for its own sake, according to Koichiro Suga, general manager, Lexus Design Division. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Instead, it came about because four small rear wheels reduce intrusion into the passenger compartment. “Interior space comes first,” he told <em>The Business Times</em>. “The first idea is to provide a sanctuary for the owner.” </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Lexus also showed an LS Coupe Concept, a tall-riding four-door, to suggest that one nameplate can stretch across wildly different forms. It’s a necessary evolution because, as Humphries put it, executive sedans are “fighting a losing battle” against sport utility vehicles, and luxury brands can no longer pin their identities to a single body style.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">In fact, nothing seems sacred at Lexus. The division recently announced it would discontinue the LS, the ultra-refined “Luxury Sedan” that served as its seminal car. The move seemed like heresy, akin to Mercedes-Benz no longer making the S-Class. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But with the letters now standing for “Luxury Space”, the message in Tokyo was that the next Lexus flagship could come in any shape or form – the brand also showed off a single-person autonomous machine designed like a jewel box called the LS Micro. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Something for everyone</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While Lexus toyed with wild ideas, Toyota’s core brand displayed a back-to-basics sensibility. A concept version of the Corolla, still the single best-selling car of all time, showed that the next iteration will offer electric, hybrid, plug-in hybrid and internal combustion options to ensure that there is something for everyone.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Toyota’s IMV Origin, a commercial vehicle designed for villagers in rural Africa, takes that idea to a bizarre place. Toyota’s idea is to ship the car out only 70 per cent finished. The customer completes the remaining 30 per cent with simple tools, configuring it to suit his needs. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Will it carry people or cargo? Will the cargo be boxes or something else?” Toyota chief executive Koji Sato said. “We just build the base. From there, each customer completes the vehicle to fit their needs.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Toyota often looms large over the Japan Mobility Show, and this year was no different. Of the 15 brands present, five were foreign, meaning Toyota alone accounted for four of the 10 domestic names there. (Gazoo Racing was conspicuous by its absence, but Toyoda has promised a major announcement for the brand in December.)</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">But the domestic players didn’t have the entire field to themselves. Chinese giant BYD unveiled the Racco, a boxy electric vehicle (EV) developed specifically for Japan’s keijidosha class – small cars that don’t require owners in some parts of Tokyo to prove they have a parking space.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">With sliding rear doors (a first for any kei EV) and two battery options for daily use or longer trips, the Racco is less car than declaration of war. Until now, foreign car brands have kept out of the kei-car market, which makes up nearly 40 per cent of Japanese car sales, and BYD clearly sees an opening. </p><h2 class=\"-tracking-5% mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"heading-component\">Shaken into action</h2><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">While the EV race has finally come to Japan’s backyard, the outside world’s ongoing shift to electrification has shaken some domestic players into action. Honda, for example, displayed no fewer than six prototype electric cars at Tokyo. Subaru launched one in concept form and displayed a near-production crossover. Suzuki rolled out the Vision e-Sky, a kei EV that will go into production in 2026.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Even as Japan’s car industry picks up its electrification pace, Toyota chief Sato believes that one thing should stay constant. “Wanting to drive a car that looks cool. I think that many of us share such a desire,” he said while presenting the Corolla concept. </p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">“Whether it’s a battery EV, plug-in hybrid, hybrid, or internal combustion engine vehicle, whatever the power source, let’s make good-looking cars that everyone will want to drive.”</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words mb-4 md:mb-6\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-component\">Presumably, that goal applies whether a vehicle has four wheels or six.</p></div>",
