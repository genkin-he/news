McConnell</strong> in Rhode Island and<strong> Indira Talwani</strong> in Massachusetts came after the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said it <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/politics/25/10/48426203/usda-says-the-well-has-run-dry-for-snap-benefits-in-november-we-are-approaching-an-inflection-point\" target=\"_blank\">would halt SNAP payments</a> starting Nov. 1, claiming it lacked authority to continue funding. The program, which serves roughly one in eight Americans, costs about $8 billion monthly and is a cornerstone of the country's social safety net, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/10/31/snap-benefits-emergency-reserves-federal-government-shutdown-usda/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> Fortune.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Courts SNAP Ruling</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">McConnell ruled that the USDA must use at least the $5 billion contingency fund to sustain benefits and continue honoring existing work requirement waivers. Talwani, in a separate opinion, called the funding suspension \"unlawful\" and ordered the agency to inform the court by Monday whether it would use emergency funds to cover November payments in full.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-heMQHl Hlnip\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The decisions <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/legal/25/10/48485809/trump-administration-sued-over-suspending-food-benefits-amid-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">follow lawsuits by Democratic-led states,</a> cities, and nonprofits that argued that federal law requires the administration to maintain SNAP, even during a funding lapse. They cited an additional $23 billion available in related reserves. Sen. <strong>Amy Klobuchar</strong> (D-Minn.), ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said the rulings confirm that \"the administration is choosing not to feed Americans in need, despite knowing it is legally required to do so.\"</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Expected Delays</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Despite the court orders, many beneficiaries are expected to face delays because reloading benefit cards can take over a week. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/25/05/45522362/we-have-no-details-says-food-program-director-as-trumps-maha-boxes-threaten-730000-seniors-grocery-lifeline\" target=\"_blank\">Food banks nationwide</a> are extending hours to meet demand, fearing temporary relief. \"Unless the administration is magical, nothing is going to happen tomorrow,\" said <strong>Cynthia Kirkhart</strong>, CEO of Facing Hunger Food Bank, according to the report.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Last year, SNAP served 41 million people — two-thirds from families with children.
