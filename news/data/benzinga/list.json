This suggests that the stock may have the potential for further upward movement.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Key support is at $23.00, while resistance is at $25.50. If the stock tests the support level and holds, it could indicate a continuation of the current trend, but a breach below could signal further downside.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Caesars’ stock has seen a 12-month performance decline of 24.41%, highlighting a challenging longer-term trend.
