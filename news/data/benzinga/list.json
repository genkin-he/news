            "title": "Sprott Uranium Miners ETF Opens Clearest Path To Highly In-Demand Asset",
            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-fxwyg khStwV\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Although the rise of artificial intelligence and the subsequent demand surge have created robust market demand for affiliated infrastructures, global nuclear energy leaders<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/commodities/25/09/47516877/nuclear-expansion-faces-uranium-crunch-by-2030\" target=\"_blank\"> expressed serious concerns about future supply chains</a> and resource management. During the 50th Symposium hosted by the <strong>World Nuclear Association</strong> (WNA), experts in the field warned that electricity consumption by data centers next year will be roughly equivalent to that used by the nation of Japan.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Subsequently, the underlying arithmetic points to a tripling of capacity by 2050 as a bare-minimum requirement. However, a looming uranium shortage threatens to derail the nuclear energy ascension. It really comes down to a simple math equation: as demand for nuclear fuel rises sharply, the inventory of the critical resource from existing mines will likely incur a net deficit.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Indeed, output from today's deposits is expected to halve between 2030 and 2040 amid broader resource depletion. This dynamic imposes a \"significant gap\" in the global supply chain because demand for commodities tied to power generation is only accelerating. As such, the WNA has urged miners to boost exploration and investment initiatives. Otherwise, the nuclear industry may have tremendous difficulty supplying worldwide energy needs.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">What's adding to the dilemma is the structural constraint of the uranium sector. Unfortunately, uranium mining is uniquely challenging to scale, with projects taking 10 to 20 years to transition from discovery to production. Furthermore, costs can be high and potentially onerous.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If that wasn't challenging enough, there's also the matter that multiple countries and regions are<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/eurozone/25/09/47521003/sweden-lifts-uranium-mining-ban-as-europe-struggles-with-energy-security\" target=\"_blank\"> competing for the relatively rare commodity</a>. In September, for example, Sweden announced a draft law to lift its ban on uranium mining, a reversal of a 2018 decision. Fundamentally, the lesson here is that Europe is trying to decrease its reliance on imports for its energy and critical minerals.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Still, the news points to the uncomfortable reality that the region is broadly struggling with energy security. With competition poised to accelerate in the future, many are turning to uranium as an investment opportunity.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>The Sprott ETF:</strong> While the calculus for key energy resources arguably points to a bullish conclusion, investing in uranium presents many difficulties for retail market participants. Some sector funds are only advertised as uranium vehicles but may contain indirect exposure, such as utility companies. Others might not hold the asset directly, leading to synthetic exposure that may not cleanly align with the uranium market. Finally, some of the top-tier uranium players fall well outside the North American purview.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For investors who are interested in uranium but desire as few ancillary elements as possible, the <strong>Sprott Uranium Miners ETF</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/URNM\" target=\"_blank\">URNM</a>) presents a viable alternative. Known worldwide for its expertise in the precious metals and resource markets, <strong>Sprott Inc.</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/SII\" target=\"_blank\">SII</a>) delivers pure-play exposure to nuclear energy.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Fundamentally, what distinguishes the URNM ETF is its direct exposure to uranium miners; that means no utilities nor diversified energy giants. Instead, the focus is on miners, explorers and developers. A second key factor to consider is that URNM holds the actual asset through a closed-end trust, which is unusual for an equity ETF. Third, the fund covers a global base, with exposure tied to resource-rich nations like Australia, Canada and Kazakhstan.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Although the URNM ETF may be attractive to certain investors, several risks exist that must be considered. Primarily, the direct exposure to uranium means that the magnitude of volatility for this fund will likely be more robust than standard funds tracking benchmark indices like the S&amp;P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite. In addition, as a non-diversified fund, URNM should be considered a high-torque vehicle. That means the upside can be intense, but downturns may also be severe.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Lastly, because uranium features technical challenges such as relatively low liquidity and commodity price instability, the URNM ETF should almost be treated like a leveraged fund. While investors may be able to enjoy high reward potential, the risks are likewise enormous.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>The URNM ETF:</strong> Since the start of the year, the URNM ETF has gained 63%. In the trailing half-year period, the fund shot up almost 90%.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>After succumbing to brief volatility, URNM's price action shot firmly above its 20-day exponential moving average.</li>\n<li>Volume levels in September and October have been noticeably elevated compared to levels seen in the summer this year.</li>\n<li>While the price action stands comfortably above the 50 and 200 DMAs, peak accumulative volume has declined. Ideally, this metric should rise in conjunction with the price.</li>\n</ul><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em>Featured i</em><em>mage by </em><a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/distelapparath-2726923/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=4535761\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Markus Distelrath</em></a><em> on </em><a href=\"https://pixabay.com/photos/nuclear-power-plant-cooling-tower-4535761/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pixabay</em></a><em>.</em></p><!--/$--></div></div>",

            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-fxwyg khStwV\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>The Clorox Company</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/CLX\" target=\"_blank\">CLX</a>) will release earnings results for the first quarter after the closing <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/CLX/earnings\" target=\"_blank\">bell on Monday, Nov. 3</a>.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Analysts expect the company to report quarterly earnings at 78 cents per share, down from $1.86 per share in the year-ago period. The consensus estimate for Clorox's quarterly revenue is $1.4 billion, compared to $1.76 billion a year earlier, according to data from <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">On Oct. 10, JP Morgan analyst Andrea Teixeira maintained a Neutral rating on Clorox and lowered the price target from $135 to $127.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">With the recent buzz around Clorox, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Clorox offers an annual dividend yield of 4.41%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of $1.24 per share ($4.96 a year).  </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-SfCGz ciVbir\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $136,077 or around 1,210 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $27,215 or around 242 shares.</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>To calculate: </strong>Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($3.64 in this case). So, $6,000 / $4.96 = 1,210 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $4.96 = 242 shares ($100 per month).</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>How that works:</strong> The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>CLX Price Action:</strong> Shares of Clorox rose 1.6% to close at $112.46 on Thursday.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><div><div><div class=\"bz-campaign bz-campaign-bottom-48555721\" data-nosnippet=\"true\"><div class=\"sc-c014f608-0 kUPEDz skeleton min-h-[inherit] animate-pulse variant\" role=\"status\"><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div></div><div class=\"flex sm:hidden flex-col\"><div class=\"sc-c014f608-0 kUPEDz skeleton min-h-[inherit] animate-pulse variant\" role=\"status\"><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div></div></div></div></div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/analyst-color/25/10/48524289/jim-cramer-likes-toast-but-isnt-buying-shares-yet\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Cramer Likes Toast, But Isn’t Buying Shares—Yet</a></strong></li>\n</ul><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p><!--/$--></div></div>",
