            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-fxwyg khStwV\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Which wireless carrier is winning the AI-5G race?</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">As next-gen technology like 5G wireless and AI are brought to market, they are both exciting separately and together. Together, they create something new. They improve quality and reliability, as well we are watching the creation of new growth opportunities. Raising the bar. As Artificial Intelligence begins to entwine, and work with wireless, let us consider what tomorrow will look like and who will win.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>First mover advantage vs. fast followers in wireless and AI</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Companies who are first to market are known to have the first mover advantage. Next, are companies who are the fast followers. Both can do well in the marketplace, but in different ways.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">It is the companies who are not moving at all who could find themselves left behind during this next change wave.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-fzzUx jSgJNL\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Example, AT&amp;T is a first to market company. They often take non-conventional paths. Sometimes it works, like when they were first to the Apple iPhone. Other times it fails, like when they acquired DirecTV, WarnerMedia assets including CNN, Warner Bros. Studio and more.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Verizon is a fast follower. They don't typically lead the way. They follow first movers. While this typically means they are not first, it does protect them from the slings and arrows of first-movers.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Even when Verizon is quick, like during the past decade along with AT&amp;T, they acquired AOL and Yahoo! So, they can miss as well.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">T-Mobile struggled in the marketplace along with Sprint until the past decade. They have finally put themselves on the growth track. Their momentum still looks positive.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Next waves of growth: FWA, wireless broadband, private wireless</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Today, we are watching new waves of technology give wireless and telecom new growth opportunities.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Starting with private wireless and FWA or wireless broadband, we have seen new growth and movement as the industry transforms.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Private wireless is when private companies build their own, private network. Wireless broadband is when wireless carriers offer broadband using FWA.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>HPE, Juniper Networks, Cisco, Huawei, Extreme Networks and others</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Along with the three wireless networks, are an assortment of other providers in a sector. Think HPE Juniper Networks, Cisco, Huawei, Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks, Arista Network, Extreme Networks and many others.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Now, we are seeing AI kick into a higher gear with different versions, new companies and new gear, shooting for the sky.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In the past few years, we are seeing Nvidia continue to rocket forward with growth. We also see past leaders like Intel and Qualcomm make significant changes in direction to keep up with the changes all around us.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD, Apple, Broadcom, Google, Microsoft and others</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">All companies are chasing the dream of becoming a leader in the new space of 5G wireless and AI, and both together.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">While we do not yet know exactly what the blending of these two different technologies will look like five or ten years from today, we are starting to see real improvements already.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Improvements like using AI to continually scan wireless and wire line networks and find the weak links. To get them fixed before they are noticed. In the past, this would have caused a cascading affect, taking days or weeks to completely resolve after manually re-routing traffic.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>AI helps keep wireless networks up and running faster</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">One key area of improvement is AI in wireless communications. It continually monitors the environment and datasets looking for weaknesses. Then it acts before what would have become a network outage.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Wireless networks use AI to make sure their systems are humming along, rather than always putting out fires as they occur. This new way is faster and more efficient compared to the human element.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In fact, when a problem is discovered, it can often be corrected before it becomes noticeable impacting performance.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Traffic can be quickly rerouted automatically and repaired before the network crashes.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Because of AI, I believe the stability and reliability of networks will dramatically improve going forward. In fact, many may users may never experience a network outage again.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">This kind of improvement with one competitor will force all players to follow the similar path. The reason is other carriers cannot let a competitor have an edge.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>AI will also create new income opportunities and services</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Plus, AI can and will create new services which can increase revenue opportunities and profitability.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Wireline, wireless and mobile networking welcomes AI to make the network operate better and create new earnings potential with new services and fewer issues.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Wireless has gone through various stages of growth and maturity over 50-years.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">During the next several years, AI and wireless collaboration and growth will astonish us. Both separately and together. And, as the technology continues to advance, it will also very likely create its own new services.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">I expect to see a flurry of new services appear the way Uber did, out of the blue.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">So, as AI and wireless continue to advance, expect transformation of industries, sectors and companies.  Finding the leaders will be the true challenge. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong><em>Benzinga Disclaimer: This article is from an unpaid external contributor.
