            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-gfrmXj kPLDLR\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Senate Democrats on Thursday introduced legislation that would strip private equity firms and other large corporate landlords of key real estate tax advantages, in a move that could materially reshape the economics of institutional housing portfolios.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The <strong>American Homeownership Act</strong> would eliminate depreciation and mortgage interest deductions for private equity firms, hedge funds, private real estate investment trusts and large investment managers that buy up housing, according to a <a href=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FACT%20SHEET_%20The%20American%20Homeownership%20Act%20.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a> from the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The proposal also blocks those firms from accessing federally backed mortgages and from purchasing foreclosed homes sold by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and federal agencies — striking at multiple pillars of the institutional single-family rental model.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Antitrust Action</h3><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The bill directly targets Wall Street firms that collectively own nearly 450,000 single-family homes and more than 2.2 million apartments nationwide. Corporate landlords purchased nearly one in six homes sold in 2025, according to the statement, while the share of first-time homebuyers has fallen to record lows.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Beyond tax treatment, the legislation would impose new antitrust constraints on housing consolidation. It would close a reporting loophole that allows large property acquisitions to avoid federal review and make corporate ownership of more than 30% of a local housing market presumptively illegal — a provision that could chill roll-up strategies in high-growth metro areas.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-jHrKIi gTZsSs\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The bill also expands the scope of firms affected. Any corporate entity that buys more than 50 single-family homes for rental would lose access to the targeted tax breaks, potentially complicating scaling strategies for large operators.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">‘Wall Street Landlords Are Exacerbating The Housing Crisis’</h3><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Democrats argue that \"private equity and Wall Street landlords are exacerbating the housing crisis by snapping up large numbers of houses\" and subjecting renters to \"massive rent hikes, unfair fees, and needless evictions.\"</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The legislation includes carve-outs designed to avoid slowing new supply. Firms that build and own new multifamily housing would retain tax benefits for that construction, and developers of new single-family homes would be allowed to keep benefits for five years. Entities rehabilitating uninhabitable properties would also remain eligible, as would owners participating in federally funded affordable housing programs such as the Low Income Housing Tax Credit.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The federal government would save \"billions of dollars\" by ending the housing-related tax breaks for Wall Street firms, according to the release, with those savings redirected into housing construction and homeownership programs.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For institutional investors, the proposal signals a more aggressive federal posture toward private capital in housing — combining tax policy, mortgage access and antitrust enforcement in a single legislative push.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Whether the bill advances remains uncertain. But if enacted, it would represent one of the most significant federal interventions yet into the private equity-backed housing sector, with potential implications for underwriting models, portfolio concentration strategies and long-term return assumptions across the residential real estate asset class.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"bz-optimizely-campaign bz-optimizely-campaign-bottom-50906696\" data-nosnippet=\"true\"></div><!--/$--></div></div>",
