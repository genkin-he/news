They've never done it before. They weren't sure how it works. Would they have to, as he said, “turn everything over?” Would someone else control their money?</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Ramsey addressed that fear directly.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“What you don't want from an adviser is arrogance,” he said. “Dropping their glasses on the end of their nose and shaming or telling you what you need to do. These are all warning signs that you run from.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">He said that a good advisor should act like a teacher, not someone who shames you or talks down to you. If you say you don't understand something, the advisor's job is to explain it another way.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Then he gave an analogy that made the whole idea feel less intimidating.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“Sometimes I go into a nice restaurant and we ask the waiter, you know, what's the best thing in here?” Ramsey said. “And I don't always get what they suggest.

I just listen to them and then I make my choice.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Trending: Own the Characters, Not Just the Content: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/elf-labs-ip\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Inside a Fast-Growing Pre-IPO IP Company</strong></a></strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In other words, you're still ordering the meal.

You tell me what the situation is and then I will decide based on the information you teach me about this particular situation.” The advisor works for you, not the other way around.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Catching Up And Seeking Clarity</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Neil also shared frustration that his 401(k) wasn't matching the S&amp;P returns he hears about. Ramsey said an advisor can review fund choices and point out options that may perform better, but again, the final decision stays with the client.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The deeper issue wasn't performance. It was fear.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“We don't want to retire poor,” Neil said.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Ramsey's response was confident. “You're not going to retire poor,” he said. “You're going to retire rich. I can tell just by talking to you because you're freaking paying attention. People that retire poor don't bother to look at it.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Warshaw added that many people wake up financially later in life. Once you start paying attention, there is still time to make adjustments.</p><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:2\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In the end, Ramsey's message was to get a plan and stick to it. Constantly checking balances and worrying every day only increases stress.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“You need to get you a plan, ride the plan, and have a little peace in your finances,” he said.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For anxious savers in their 50s, that peace may start with understanding that asking for advice doesn't mean giving up control.

Research cited in Horvath's testimony shows comprehension and retention are stronger on paper than on screens for complex texts.

While many people would dream of winning $5 million, MrBeast has the internet divided on a question about a big lump sum upfront or steady monthly income for life.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">MrBeast Divides the Internet</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">With 469 million subscribers on YouTube, MrBeast often entertains people around the world and provides life lessons, entertainment and shows how far some people will go to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/25/05/45394482/mrbeast-teases-two-more-seasons-of-beast-games-after-losing-millions-ideally-dont-lose-8-figures\" target=\"_blank\">win money and challenges.</a></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">On the same day that the 10<sup>th</sup> and final episode of a second season of \"Beast Games\" aired on streaming platform Prime Video from <strong>Amazon.com Inc</strong> <a class=\"ticker-link\" data-exchange=\"NASDAQ\" data-ticker=\"AMZN\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/AMZN\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(NASDAQ:</a><a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/AMZN\" target=\"_blank\">AMZN</a>)<!-- -->, MrBeast took to social media to ask an intriguing question.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">\"If you won Beast Games, would you rather take $5,000,000 upfront or $50,000 a month for life?\" MrBeast, who is also known as <strong>Jimmy Donaldson</strong>, <a href=\"https://x.com/MrBeast/status/2026690019935551908\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a>.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The question divided the internet and went viral with 10.9 million views on the tweet.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-BjUjF epByxC\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Unlike a straight up question of would you rather take something now or split the amount evenly over a time period, the question becomes more of a dilemma of wanting immediate cash now and securing financial freedom or betting on living more years and being smart with steady monthly income over time.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Here's the math.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Taking $50,000 a month equals $600,000 annually. It would take 8.33 years to equal the $5 million payout, which means as long as you live 8.33 more years from now, you would make more money by taking the monthly payments.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Factors to consider include how long you may live and also the rate of return you could get if you took the $5 million now. Some people on social media believed they could invest the $5 million or put it to work to earn a higher monthly rate of return.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">This author polled followers on social media to see which answer ranked ahead:</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">\"MrBeast Question on Beast Games as a poll: Would you rather take $5 million upfront or $50,000 a month for life if you won Beast Games 2?\" I <a href=\"https://x.com/chriskatje/status/2026712686717800566\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a>.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The results from 43 votes were:</p><!--/$--><!--$--><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>$5 million upfront: 34.9%</li>\n<li>$50,000 a month for life: 65.1%</li>\n</ul><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The winner was the monthly income, but based on the fact that you could outearn the $5 million in 8.33 years, the close results of the poll may come as a surprise.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Ultimately, it comes down to life expectancy, rate of return and financial goals. The average life expectancies are 78.4 to 79 in the United States and around 73 years globally. This means that if you are 70 or under in the U.S. and 64 years and 8 months old or younger globally, you are more than likely to make more than the $5 million by taking monthly payments.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Another factor to consider could be if the person asked the questions has kids as $5 million upfront now could secure their financial future with college money or money put aside, while the monthly payments could stop if the parent died tomorrow.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Financial hardships or needing money immediately for medical bills, debt, or to care for a loved one could also factor into being more likely to take the $5 million now.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Social Media Responds</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The question divided social media and generated plenty of thoughtful responses.

Lottery Jackpots</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">MrBeast's question could look similar to the decision many people will never have to decide, which is if you win a lottery jackpot, do you take the lump sum or the monthly payouts over time.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/education/25/09/47532921/powerball-hits-1-8-billion-10-things-to-buy-with-winnings-including-cryptocurrency-stocks-gold-and-tesla-vehicles\" target=\"_blank\">recent Powerball jackpot</a> that was at $1.8 billion, the lump sum cash payout total was only $826.4 million. While this is a life changing amount, it is also significantly less than the $1.8 billion.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Those taking the lump sum for lottery jackpots lose a significant part of future earnings with a lower upfront payout.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Taking the annual payments grants 30 payments over 29 years with one payment up front and the additional payments made each year that are 5% higher to fight off inflation.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The lottery example is different than MrBeast's question as his payout doesn't cap the monthly payments and instead makes them for life, allowing them to pass the lump sum upfront payout.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em>Image created using artificial intelligence via Gemini.</em></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"bz-optimizely-campaign bz-optimizely-campaign-bottom-50951927\" data-nosnippet=\"true\"></div><!--/$--></div></div>",
