Its revenue fell 22% year-on-year to 133 million euros ($156.9 million), similar to a 23% decline it reported in 2024. The company has never reported a profit, and its latest loss totaled 87 million euros in the first half of 2025, widening from a 69 million euro loss a year earlier.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The sale of Caruso and Sergio Rossi's manufacturing assets, and possibly a future sale of the Sergio Rossi brand, represent a dramatic turn for the company, and not a moment too soon.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The global market for personal luxury goods shrank by 2% last year to 358 billion euros, according to consultancy Bain. That weakness was evident in the fourth-quarter 2025 earnings reports from LVMH and Kering, which both showed revenue declines. Saks Fifth Avenue, the largest U.S. luxury retail chain, declared bankruptcy last month.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>CFO departure</strong></h4><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Lanvin hinted at its restructuring last October, when it announced the departure of longtime executive president and CFO David Chan, and quickly appointed Han Jiyang, a veteran financier from one of Fosun's other units, to take his place. The company also named St. John head Andy Lew as its new CEO in early 2025, replacing Eric Chan, who lasted just one year in the position. Lanvin also changed its general counsel last December.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Caruso is one of Lanvin's five brands that were purchased separately and then merged into a standalone company by Shanghai-based Fosun, one of China's leading private conglomerates. Founded in 1958, the brand was one of Fosun's first luxury purchases in 2013, while Sergio Rossi was one of the last in 2021.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">With about 450 employees and a factory in Soragna, near Parma, Caruso's products are made entirely in Italy. Sergio Rossi produces footwear at a factory in San Mauro Pascoli, and also outsources some production. Sergio Rossi had 43 directly operated stores as of 2024 as well as an e-commerce website and points of sale in department stores.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">With Caruso gone and Sergio Rossi possibly on the block, the big question is what Lanvin will look like when dust from the ongoing overhaul finally settles. A Sergio Rossi sale would leave it with St. John, based in North America; Wolford, based in Austria; and its flagship Lanvin brand, one of the oldest French maisons, founded in 1889.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">St. John, with its main market in North America, has been the best performer of that trio. In the first six months last year, the brand reported revenue of 39.7 million euros, roughly the same as a year earlier. The Lanvin brand, whose major market is Europe, saw sales plunge 42.1% in first half of last year to 27.9 million euros, while Wolford's revenue declined by 22.6% to 33 million euros over that time.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">When Fosun began cobbling together its fashion arm in 2013, it expected to bring the international brands it was acquiring to its home in China, which was one of the world's fastest growing personal luxury goods markets at that time. But China's economic slowdown has led to growing consumer caution, and luxury goods are one of the easiest things to forgo in such an environment.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In a recent report, however, Bain forecast a rebound in the China market for personal luxury goods. After shrinking by about 4% in 2025, following a roughly 18% drop in 2024, Bain predicted \"modest expansion\" for the market in 2026.</p><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:6\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:7\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em>To subscribe to Bamboo Works weekly free newsletter, click</em> <a href=\"https://thebambooworks.com/register/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>here</em></a></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong><em>Benzinga Disclaimer: This article is from an unpaid external contributor.
