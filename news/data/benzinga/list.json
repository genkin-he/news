It tends to work best if you:</p><!--/$--><!--$--><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Have at least $45,000 in tappable equity and a credit score of 680 or higher.</li>\n<li>Need a specific, sizable amount for one‑time goals rather than ongoing, flexible borrowing.</li>\n<li>Prefer the certainty of a fixed rate and fixed term over a variable‑rate line of credit.</li>\n</ul><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">From there, run the numbers and compare the total cost of a cash‑out refi versus layering on a second mortgage for just the amount you need.
