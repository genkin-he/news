Over the same period, the S&amp;P 500 rose from roughly 3,840 to nearly 6,700—a 74% gain. According to Thompson, the real driver behind this split isn't AI but monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/10/31/chatgpt-job-openings-stock-market-sp500-scariest-chart-world-derek-thompson-monetary-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> Fortune.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fed Rate Cuts</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/economic-data/25/10/48113185/trump-tariffs-fed-inflation-interest-rate-cut-minutes\" target=\"_blank\">Fed began hiking interest rates</a> in March 2022 to curb inflation, pushing borrowing costs higher and cooling business investment.

            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-fxwyg khStwV\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">When you're earning a paycheck, it's easy to gauge how you stack up. Salary charts tell you exactly where you <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/24/07/40021172/what-income-makes-you-upper-class-heres-what-you-need-to-rank-among-the-top-20\" target=\"_blank\">fall on the income ladder</a>. But retirement rewrites the math. Without annual earnings, the question shifts from how much you make to how much you've built. And that's where things get tricky — especially for retirees trying to figure out whether they're \"upper-middle class\" or actually \"wealthy.\"</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">To find that line, the most reliable place to start is with data, not vibes. The <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/cps-hinc/hinc-05.html\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Census Bureau</a> divides American households into quintiles — five equal groups, each representing 20% of households ranked by income. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Don't Miss:</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — <a href=\"https://benzingapartners.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=531&amp;aff_id=1\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.</strong></a></strong></li>\n<li><strong>Missed Nvidia and Tesla?

Using this structure, the middle 20%, roughly the 40th to 60th percentiles, is the \"middle class.\" The next 20%, between the 60th and 80th percentiles, is the \"upper-middle class.\" Above that — the 80th percentile and higher — you've entered <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/25/05/45234639/are-you-upper-class-heres-the-net-worth-you-need-in-your-50s\" target=\"_blank\">upper-class territory</a>.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-gQfuga iaHpuj\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For retirees, income only tells half the story. The more revealing measure is net worth, and for that, the go-to sources are the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances</a> and the <a href=\"https://dqydj.com/net-worth-by-age-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">DQYDJ Net Worth Calculator</a>, which translates that survey data into percentile rankings by age. It's the most current snapshot we have until the Fed releases new data in 2026.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Among households aged 65 to 69, entering the upper-middle class means having a net worth around $550,000, while those aged 70 to 74 hit that mark closer to $700,000. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Trending: Accredited Investors Can Now Tap Into the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/homeshares-y2\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>$36 Trillion Home Equity Market — Without Buying a Single Property</strong></a></strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Crossing into the upper class starts near $1.5 million at ages 65–69 and about $1.65 million for 70–74. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">And if you're wondering where \"wealthy\" truly begins, the top 5% of retirees — roughly the 95th percentile — starts around $7 million in net worth for both age groups. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">These numbers include more than just investments. They factor in primary home equity, which can be a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/24/08/40610715/do-you-know-how-much-wealthier-homeowners-are-than-renters-spoiler-its-about-40x-more\" target=\"_blank\">major driver of wealth for older Americans</a>. Many retirees own their homes outright, and with decades of appreciation baked in, real estate often explains the leap between upper-middle and upper-class net worth. A paid-off home in a high-demand area can push an otherwise modest portfolio into seven-figure territory.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The difference between owning and renting is huge. <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf23.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">According to the SCF</a>, the typical U.S. homeowner has a median net worth of $396,200, compared with just $10,400 for the average renter. In other words, homeowners held nearly 38 times more wealth, showing how much long-term homeownership can shape financial stability in retirement.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Still, wealth on paper doesn't always equal comfort in practice. Lifestyle, debt levels, and spending habits play a huge role in how \"rich\" retirement feels. A retiree with a paid-off home, low expenses, and steady income from Social Security and investments can live just as well — or better — than someone with double the net worth but higher costs and obligations. Comparison may be the thief of joy, but context is its antidote.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">So before chasing an arbitrary number, focus on what actually matters. Keep debt low, protect your savings, budget realistically, and give your money room to grow. A solid financial plan can stretch far beyond the percentile charts. And if you're unsure where you stand, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/smartasset\" target=\"_blank\">consult a financial advisor who can tailor strategies to your goals</a> — not just your percentile. Because in retirement, wealth isn't just about how much you have. It's about how well it works for you.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em><strong>Image: Shutterstock</strong></em></p><!--/$--></div></div>",

No Loan</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Some also pointed out that lenders may get suspicious when someone applies for a personal loan but has zero visible debt.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“They are questioning why you need a ‘personal loan’ when you have no debt,” said one former loan officer. “Without any debt, most banks will flag a generic loan,” another person said. “If OP allowed their credit card balances to report organically, the lender would have seen ‘debt’ and wouldn’t have denied them.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The thread also warned against opening more accounts or taking loans just to build credit. “You don’t need another card now,” wrote one commenter. “Allow your accounts to age. You also shouldn’t take on loans just for the sake of taking on loans. You’re currently throwing away money on interest on a loan that you didn’t need.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The original poster now plans to change their approach: “That's why I am going to carry some debt now and pay it off. I think they also don't see my debt management. It's always 0. But if I have debt every month and pay it off, that should work.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></strong></p><!--/$--></div></div>",
