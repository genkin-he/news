In the hour leading up to the Power Inflow signal, META's stock price had some slight pullback following the initial price rise that occurred earlier in the day. Following the Power Inflow signal, the price of META steadily spiked higher, reaching a price of $680.96 at one point prior to 2:45 PM EST. Over that same period, there was a noticeable shift towards buying activity on both the retail and institutional side of the market shortly following the signal. This Power Inflow signal is aimed to be a bullish indication of institutional and retail interest, spotlighting where traders may be entering the market for the stock.<br/></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Understanding the Power Inflow Signal</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The <strong>Power Inflow</strong> alert is a proprietary signal developed and provided by <strong>TradePulse.</strong> The alert is issued within the first two hours of the trading day, highlighting when there is a significant shift in order flow, specifically indicating that there's been a strong trend towards buying activity. This suggests a high probability of bullish price movement for the rest of the day, making it a potentially strategic and opportune entry point for active traders.<br/><br/>Order flow analytics analyze real-time buying and selling trends by examining the volume, timing, and order size across both retail and institutional traders. These insights offer a more detailed understanding of price behavior and market sentiment for a stock, allowing the trader or institution to make the most informed decision possible.<br/></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>META Intraday Performance</strong><br/>At the time of the Power Inflow, META was priced at $663.67. Following the signal:<br/><strong>• Intraday High As Of 2:45 PM EST: $680.96 (+2.61%)</strong><br/><br/>Today's Power Inflow alert on META is a great example of how real-time order flow analytics can reveal bullish momentum, especially during a period where the stock price appears to be stagnant or weakening. Despite the stock trading lower on the day, a trader who bought into META shortly following the Power Inflow signal would have been able to realize a potential intraday gain.  These short-term gains following the Power Inflow signal on META emphasize the power of order flow analytics, and TradePulse's Power Inflow signal in particular, in spotting bullish intraday momentum, offering traders a potentially advantageous buying opportunity.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-bNqYHQ hvXQzJ\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em>This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice, investment recommendations, or a solicitation to buy or sell securities.
