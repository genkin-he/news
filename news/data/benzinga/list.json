Saylor was asked about the specific “headwinds” to the industry and steps required to overcome those.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“The fact that Bitcoin is not viewed as capital by the traditional credit ratings industry,” Saylor replied. He argued that failing to consider <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/crypto/cryptocurrency/25/06/46139888/michael-saylor-says-bitcoin-treasury-companies-can-unlock-even-more-growth-heres-how\" target=\"_blank\">BTC’s collateral value</a> under traditional banking, insurance and credit rating rules is a “structural” problem.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Bitcoin’s perception as capital by the traditional credit ratings industry is the first major hurdle. He argued that classifying Bitcoin as collateral and assigning it a collateral value under conventional banking, insurance, and credit rating rules is a significant structural problem.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-SfCGz ciVbir\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Saylor alluded to this point earlier in the year, stating that while equity offerings have helped fund BTC accumulation, the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/crypto/cryptocurrency/25/06/46139888/michael-saylor-says-bitcoin-treasury-companies-can-unlock-even-more-growth-heres-how\" target=\"_blank\">real breakthrough</a> lies in creating scalable, BTC-backed credit instruments.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Educate And Lobby, Says Saylor</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The second issue, according to him, is banking acceptance, custody, and credit. He said that major U.S. banks purchasing, selling, and custodying Bitcoin, as well as issuing credit and margin lines against the asset, might be “great” for all parties involved.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“We don’t need a law to fix it. What we do need to do is lobby the banks, lobby the insurance companies,” Saylor emphasized.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The Bitcoin bull concluded by stressing the need to “educate” traditional fixed-income investors, retirees, and corporate treasurers about Bitcoin as a viable investment alternative.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Strategy Beats Revenue Estimates, Misses On Earnings</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The remarks come in the wake of Strategy’s <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/earnings/25/10/48545856/strategy-stock-rallies-after-mixed-q3-26-bitcoin-yield-ytd\" target=\"_blank\">mixed third-quarter financials</a>.
