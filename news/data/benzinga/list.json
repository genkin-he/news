Family agreements often rely on best-case assumptions. A job offer. Stable income. Shared responsibility. When one piece falls away, the co-signer remains fully liable.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Refinance The House Or Refinance The Risk?</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The couple owned their home outright. It was paid off.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Orman suggested refinancing it and taking out a $169,000 mortgage to pay off the private student loans. \"I think it's a far better way for you to do this,\" she said, explaining that a mortgage could lower the monthly payment dramatically and be a tax write off. \"If I were in your situation, I would literally be refinancing my home, paying off the student loans, do a 30-year mortgage. Believe it or not, the payments will not be that much.\"</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Her reasoning was structural. Private student loans are not tax deductible and are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. A fixed-rate mortgage offers predictable payments and potential tax advantages. In her view, consolidating the debt under one stable loan could give the grandparents more control, while allowing the grandson to make payments directly to them.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">It is a significant decision. It ties the debt to the home. But it also replaces multiple private obligations with one fixed schedule.</p><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:2\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Because $169,000 is not just a student loan balance.
