            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-gfrmXj kPLDLR\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The latest study from the <strong>World Gold Council </strong>(WGC) shows that the underlying force behind gold's recent strength is still in place.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In a <a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/why-gold-2026-cross-asset-perspective\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>, \"Why gold in 2026?\" WGC explains how risk assets have delivered surprisingly strong returns, yet the foundations beneath that performance appear increasingly fragile.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Equities trade at elevated forward multiples, credit spreads remain compressed, and consensus GDP forecasts imply a resilience that contrasts sharply with historically high readings in economic policy uncertainty. High conviction in growth occurring alongside extreme uncertainty is precisely a thriving environment for gold.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">WGC argues that the market is overlooking unresolved structural risks, as strong investor optimism and supportive policy conditions continue to lift equities, credit, and commodities. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Yet geopolitical tensions persist, output gaps in major economies remain narrow, and inflation still lingers. Such conditions limit policymakers' room to respond to future shocks. Thus, gold's recent strength is not exuberance – but hedging demand against risks that investors appear to be underestimating.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-jHrKIi gTZsSs\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Underallocation Diagnosis</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Furthermore, gold remains strategically under-owned. Despite strong price appreciation in recent years, private gold investment as a share of global equities and bonds remains low. It's currently barely above 2% (the lower bound of the optimal allocation), while the upper bound is 8%.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Institutional portfolios remain geared to the traditional 60/40 ratio. That approach leaves gold a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/25/09/47890930/gold-market-outlook-technical-analysis-september-bank-of-america-goldman-sachs\" target=\"_blank\">modest allocation</a> – relative to its historical role as a drawdown mitigator.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Yet, at the same time, bonds are less effective than before. Falling yields and a negative stock-bond correlation allowed Treasuries to cushion equity sell-offs. But that relationship has weakened.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Inflation shocks, most notably in 2022, led to declines in bonds alongside equities. With core inflation still above central bank targets and fiscal deficits expanding, yields may face upward pressure. In such an environment, the opportunity cost of holding gold may rise tactically, but structurally, gold benefits from inflation-hedging demand and from a higher stock-bond correlation that reduces bonds' diversification value.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Margin Debt Alarm</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">WGC also notes debt as a silent factor. US margin debt (funds borrowed to purchase equities) has surged, outpacing the growth rate of the S&amp;P 500.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">History shows that excessive yearly increases in margin debt relative to equity returns have preceded major bear markets. Such dynamics occurred during the dot-com bubble and the Great Recession.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Since leverage amplifies both upside momentum and downside risk, forced deleveraging becomes a catalyst for safe-haven demand. A lack of downside protection, as signaled by the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/26/01/50081927/stock-market-outlook-bofa-investor-survey-hyper-bull-sentiment\" target=\"_blank\">recent Bank of America survey</a>, only worsens this risk.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Thus, for investors, the message is clear. Despite an outstanding performance in 2025, gold remains more of a structural hedge than a momentum trade going forward. And it might be one that markets are still underpricing.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Price Watch: SPDR Gold Shares</strong> <a class=\"ticker-link\" data-exchange=\"ARCA\" data-ticker=\"GLD\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/GLD\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(NYSE:</a><a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/GLD\" target=\"_blank\">GLD</a>)<!-- --> is up 20.48% year-to-date.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em>Photo by r.classen via Shutterstock</em></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"bz-optimizely-campaign bz-optimizely-campaign-bottom-50921785\" data-nosnippet=\"true\"></div><!--/$--></div></div>",

The history of Hollywood studio mergers and acquisitions is littered with creative roadkill.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Netflix Blinks And Paramount Wins</h2><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:2\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">‘They Bought It To Sell It’</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Fennessey’s central argument is that Warner Bros. never needed to be sold at all. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-jHrKIi gTZsSs\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“It’s a great business with enough viable properties to sustain another century of film, TV, and any other forms of media,” he said. “But the people who bought the company in 2022 bought it to sell it” — a damning framing of the deal as a corporate flip of a crown jewel rather than a strategic vision for its future.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">That’s a reference to the 2022 merger that created Warner Bros. Discovery, when AT&amp;T spun off its WarnerMedia assets and combined them with Discovery Inc. under CEO <strong>David Zaslav</strong>.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">He invoked the Disney-Fox merger of 2019 as a cautionary tale. “Look at the Fox Disney deal from 7 years ago and ask yourself if that helps movies in any way. This one could be significantly worse.” These deals, he argued, “tend to favor corporate synergies over creative risk taking” and “shrink the number of people who get to work in the movie business.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">One Watchful Eye Over HBO, CNN, And CBS</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The political dimension of the deal is where Fennessey’s alarm is loudest. Ellison will now oversee not just the studios behind “Game of Thrones,” “Barbie” and “Dune,” but CNN, HBO, and CBS — a network already under scrutiny for what the podcast described as a “pivot rightward and in the direction of President Trump.” </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“He’ll now have CNN and HBO under that same watchful eye,” Fennessey warned.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">That concern extends well beyond podcast commentary. Ellison attended Trump’s State of the Union this week as a guest of Senator <strong>Lindsey Graham</strong>, while Sarandos was <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/26/02/50877517/netflix-ceo-ted-sarandos-braces-for-white-house-meeting-days-after-saying-warner-bros-bid-is-not-a-political-deal-report\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly at the White House</a> on the very day Netflix dropped out.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Skydance: Genius Or Bottom Of The Barrel?</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">On whether Ellison’s Skydance is equipped to steward a legacy stretching from “Casablanca” to “Harry Potter,” Fennessey was candid: “Skydance’s track record as a tastemaker is iffy at best.” The company produced “Top Gun: Maverick” and “True Grit” — but also a string of forgettable streaming action films. “Sometimes you’re a genius,” he said, “sometimes your taste leads you to the bottom of the barrel.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">At this price, he added, over-leverage is a real danger: “it’s not hard to see a world in which Paramount is overleveraged by debt… with any number of unfortunate and ugly outcomes.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Netflix Lost The Battle, Won The War</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Fennessey argued Netflix may have made the shrewdest move of all. “Netflix may have just played the most successful game of chicken in the history of modern media. It lost the battle for Warner Brothers, but almost certainly won the long term fight for primacy.” </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Netflix shares surged more than 13% in after-hours trading on Thursday and were up over 7% at $90.64 before the bell on Friday. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The deal still faces regulatory review, with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing scheduled for March 4.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em>Image via Shutterstock</em></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"bz-optimizely-campaign bz-optimizely-campaign-bottom-50921573\" data-nosnippet=\"true\"></div><!--/$--></div></div>",
