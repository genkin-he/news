Yet Nvidia is trading at its lowest multiples since mid-2020, potentially adding fuel to a market that has stalled early this year.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Still, expectations were high. Nvidia options implied a relatively muted +/- 5.1% move post-earnings. According to Behan, that suggests optimism is already priced in amid massive capex forecasts, but traders are still demanding proof that spending is translating into monetization. \"The AI trade has transitioned from hype to scrutiny,\" he said, adding that Nvidia now serves as the key metric for that shift.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Ryan Lee</strong>, the Senior Vice President of Product and Strategy at <strong>Direxion</strong>, said that the exact thing the market needed to hear was CEO <strong>Jensen Huang's</strong> statement that computing demand is \"rising exponentially.\"</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The adoption of AI agents in the enterprise and the spending of hyperscalers are tailwinds for semiconductors, said Lee. However, the same factors also suggest high capex and disruption in traditional software, which are headwinds for the rest of the market.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:4\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Client Concentration</h3><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">But Nvidia's earnings also point to hyperscaler concentration, as more than 50% of data center sales came from this group. Lee pointed out the revenue concentration but said these clients have fortress balance sheets. Meanwhile, enterprise agentic AI adoption may slowly begin to diversify demand.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“Hyperscalers were over 50% of 4Q data center revenue, showing both the extreme level of capex from the hyperscalers and just how concentrated Nvidia's revenue can be in the core business. That said, there are worse things than client concentration coming from companies with fortress balance sheets. The narrative around enterprise adoption of agentic AI shows this is beginning to diversify,” he explained.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For a broader play, investors may consider QQQ or equal-weight strategies like <strong>Direxion NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Shares</strong> <a class=\"ticker-link\" data-exchange=\"NASDAQ\" data-ticker=\"QQQE\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/QQQE\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(NASDAQ:</a><a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/QQQE\" target=\"_blank\">QQQE</a>)<!-- --> to mitigate megacap concentration risk.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Currently, Nvidia seems to be firmly in control of the economics of the AI trade. The larger question for ETF investors: Is this just another beat, or is this the spark that sends the market into its next leg higher?</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"bz-optimizely-campaign bz-optimizely-campaign-bottom-50897461\" data-nosnippet=\"true\"></div><!--/$--></div></div>",
