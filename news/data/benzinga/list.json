            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-fxwyg khStwV\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Nebius Group NV</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/NBIS\" target=\"_blank\">NBIS</a>) has become one of 2025’s most jaw-dropping AI success story, and perhaps its biggest puzzle. The mid-cap AI cloud infrastructure firm has soared around 513% over the past 12 months, and 330% this year, vaulting from relative obscurity into Wall Street’s favorite speculative obsession. Yet as the stock’s valuation rockets past 29 times projected 2026 sales,<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/etfs\" target=\"_blank\"> ETF managers</a> are asking the billion-dollar question: how much AI is too much AI?</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The Amsterdam-based firm has ridden the AI euphoria harder than almost any peer, fueled by a blockbuster $17.4 billion AI infrastructure deal with <strong>Microsoft Corp </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/MSFT\" target=\"_blank\">MSFT</a>) and a 625% year-over-year revenue jump last quarter. Its new enterprise platform, <strong>AI Cloud 3.0 – Aether</strong>, promises supercomputer-grade performance for regulated industries.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">That very frenzy is creating headaches for ETF allocators. Nebius sits squarely at the intersection of AI, cloud computing, and data infrastructure, making it a potential candidate for several thematic funds. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On The Radar: AIQ, WTAI, And THNQ</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The <strong>Global X Artificial Intelligence &amp; Technology ETF </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/AIQ\" target=\"_blank\">AIQ</a>) is among the likeliest candidates that would consider Nebius when the latter meets liquidity and listing criteria. The $2.1 billion fund already holds AI-driven infrastructure names like<strong> Palantir Technologies Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/PLTR\" target=\"_blank\">PLTR</a>) and <strong>C3.ai Inc</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/AI\" target=\"_blank\">AI</a>), giving investors exposure to both the software and hardware sides of artificial intelligence. Nebius’s cloud-heavy model would fit neatly within that ecosystem, though its sky-high valuation could skew portfolio risk.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-heMQHl Hlnip\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Similarly, the <strong>WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Fund</strong> (BATS:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/WTAI\" target=\"_blank\">WTAI</a>), has favored smaller, fast-growing AI players with its more concentrated 75-stock portfolio. WTAI’s holdings in companies like <strong>SoundHound AI Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/SOUN\" target=\"_blank\">SOUN</a>) and <strong>Veritone Inc </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/VERI\" target=\"_blank\">VERI</a>) signal its appetite for emerging names in the AI value chain. Adding Nebius could enhance that growth tilt but also increase volatility, given the stock’s wild price swings.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Meanwhile, <strong>ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/THNQ\" target=\"_blank\">THNQ</a>), which strictly focuses on AI infrastructure and automation technologies, could also be looking in Nebius’ direction. The cloud computing names like<strong> Snowflake Inc</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/SNOW\" target=\"_blank\">SNOW</a>) and data center operators held by the fund make the latter a natural home for a firm building the “AI supercloud,” but THNQ tends to wait for consistent profitability before initiating new positions, a box Nebius hasn’t ticked yet.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div><div><div class=\"bz-campaign bz-campaign-bottom-48578137\" data-nosnippet=\"true\"><div class=\"sc-c014f608-0 kUPEDz skeleton min-h-[inherit] animate-pulse variant\" role=\"status\"><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div></div><div class=\"flex sm:hidden flex-col\"><div class=\"sc-c014f608-0 kUPEDz skeleton min-h-[inherit] animate-pulse variant\" role=\"status\"><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div></div></div></div></div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/etfs/new-etfs/25/09/47928129/the-world-is-spending-on-defense-heres-a-new-etf-that-lets-you-profit\" target=\"_blank\">Best ETF For The Critical Minerals Boom?

From \"ghost jobs\" and marathon interview rounds to exhaustive background checks, even the most powerful roles demand patience—and persistence. Former Vice President <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> recently revealed that her own path to the White House came after a nine-hour vetting interview with a lawyer.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">\"When I was being vetted for vice president, I had a nine-hour interview with a lawyer going through everything—my taxes, my professional record, everything,\" Harris said on <em>The Diary of a CEO</em> podcast. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The process, she added, goes far beyond qualifications. \"By the time that interview is happening, it's usually narrowed down to about three people. So all the vetting has been done. Then it's about chemistry—can you trust someone, can you work with them, are you doing it for the same reasons?\", <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/10/31/former-vice-president-kamala-harris-nine-hour-interview-land-top-job-still-got-gold-medal-depression-win-or-lose/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> The Fortune.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Past Experience</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Harris, who served as the district attorney of San Francisco, California's attorney general, and a U.S. senator, had decades of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40476748/kamala-harris-reportedly-raises-500m-in-one-month-campaign-highlights-record-breaking-1b-milestone\" target=\"_blank\">experience</a> before becoming the nation's 49th vice president.

It's fight or flight, and it's adrenaline surging, surging, surging,\" Harris said.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">That feeling resurfaced after her <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/politics/25/10/48223150/kamala-harris-says-shes-not-done-yet-hints-at-a-political-comeback-you-might-bleed-and-it-is-worth-it\" target=\"_blank\">2024 presidential loss</a> to <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, she said, describing the days afterward as emotionally draining. \"It lasted for days,\" Harris said, calling it like a \"phantom limb.\"</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Political Comeback</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Harris’s candid revelations come in the wake of her defeat in the 2024 presidential election.
