Anthropic had baked the same two restrictions — no autonomous weapons, no mass surveillance of U.S. citizens — into that agreement. The Pentagon, which says it has never sought to use AI for those purposes, demanded the clauses be removed so it could deploy Claude for “all lawful purposes.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-BjUjF epByxC\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">When Anthropic refused, Defense Secretary <strong>Pete Hegseth </strong>designated the company a “supply chain risk” — a label typically reserved for firms with ties to foreign adversaries — and President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> ordered all federal agencies and military contractors to cut ties with the company. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In a statement on Friday, Anthropic said it was “deeply saddened” by this and would challenge any supply chain risk designation against it in court.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“We believe this designation would both be legally unsound and set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government,” the company said. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Divergence That Matters</strong></h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The core question now is what, exactly, OpenAI agreed to that Anthropic didn’t — because on paper, both companies had similar red lines. Altman said the Pentagon acknowledged the principles already reflected in U.S. law and policy. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">\"We are asking the DoW to offer these same terms to all AI companies, which in our opinion we think everyone should be willing to accept,\" Altman wrote.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Anthropic argued the same thing and still got blacklisted.
