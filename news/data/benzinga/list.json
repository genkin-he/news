You also shouldn’t take on loans just for the sake of taking on loans. You’re currently throwing away money on interest on a loan that you didn’t need.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The original poster now plans to change their approach: “That's why I am going to carry some debt now and pay it off. I think they also don't see my debt management. It's always 0.
