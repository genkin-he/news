Over the past month, <strong>Halliburton Inc. (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/HAL\" target=\"_blank\">HAL</a>)</strong> stock increased by <strong>7.35%</strong>, and in the past year, by <strong>35.93%</strong>. With performance like this, long-term shareholders are optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:2\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h3 class=\"block core-block\">How Does Halliburton P/E Compare to Other Companies?</h3><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&amp;P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Halliburton has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of <strong>32.14</strong> of the Energy Equipment &amp; Services industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:3\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:4\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-jHrKIi gTZsSs\"></div><!--/$--></div></div>",
