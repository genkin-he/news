That's up from 20 cents per share in the year-ago period. The consensus estimate for ADT's quarterly revenue is $1.3 billion (it reported $1.26 billion last year), according to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">On Feb. 24, ADT, Origin AI and Verisure  announced a five-year renewable commercial agreement.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">With the recent buzz around ADT, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, ADT has an annual dividend yield of 2.71%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 5.5 cents per share (22 cents a year).</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from ADT, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Next, we take this amount and divide it by ADT's $0.22 dividend: $6,000 / $0.22 = 27,273 shares.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-jHrKIi gTZsSs\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>So, an investor would need to own approximately $221,184 worth of ADT, or 27,273 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.22 = 5,455 shares, or $44,240 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same.
