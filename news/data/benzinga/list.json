One suggested, “Let 5-10% report then pay it off after the statement. Should fix the problem pretty quick.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">OP acknowledged the oversight: “I don't like to see a big number, but it's my fault.

No Loan</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Some also pointed out that lenders may get suspicious when someone applies for a personal loan but has zero visible debt.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“They are questioning why you need a ‘personal loan’ when you have no debt,” said one former loan officer. “Without any debt, most banks will flag a generic loan,” another person said. “If OP allowed their credit card balances to report organically, the lender would have seen ‘debt’ and wouldn’t have denied them.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The thread also warned against opening more accounts or taking loans just to build credit. “You don’t need another card now,” wrote one commenter. “Allow your accounts to age. You also shouldn’t take on loans just for the sake of taking on loans. You’re currently throwing away money on interest on a loan that you didn’t need.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The original poster now plans to change their approach: “That's why I am going to carry some debt now and pay it off. I think they also don't see my debt management. It's always 0. But if I have debt every month and pay it off, that should work.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></strong></p><!--/$--></div></div>",

The sooner a new visitor can recognize that your product or service can solve a problem, the better. Then, it comes down to a good user experience. People must like a product for it to spread, and the Dropbox team focused on creating a high-caliber platform before using the marketing hacks Houston discussed later in the clip.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Trending: Accredited Investors Can Now Tap Into the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/homeshares-y2\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>$36 Trillion Home Equity Market — Without Buying a Single Property</strong></a></strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Set Up An Incentive Referral Program</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The Dropbox team recognized early on that users drove most of their new sign-ups.

The company created a referral system where people got additional storage by referring their friends.
