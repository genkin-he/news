Anthropic had baked the same two restrictions — no autonomous weapons, no mass surveillance of U.S. citizens — into that agreement.

Altman said the Pentagon acknowledged the principles already reflected in U.S. law and policy. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">\"We are asking the DoW to offer these same terms to all AI companies, which in our opinion we think everyone should be willing to accept,\" Altman wrote.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Anthropic argued the same thing and still got blacklisted.
