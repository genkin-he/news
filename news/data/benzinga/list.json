They also said a longer fight that constrains supply could support the dollar against most peers, while the yen and Swiss franc could hold up better, reports the outlet. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Khamenei's tenure was marked by repeated crackdowns on dissent, including mass unrest in 2009 and in 2022 after <strong>Mahsa Amini</strong> died in custody, according to Fox News.

            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-iViryI frOthR\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In early January 1888, just after <strong>Thomas Edison</strong> opened his West Orange, New Jersey laboratory, he drafted a five-page punch list titled \"Things doing and to be done\" that mixed the urgent with the wildly ambitious.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A To-Do List Built For Big Bets</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Unlike typical daily checklists, Edison’s lists included key achievements and potential inventions listed as bullet points alongside technical improvements. His 1888 list featured over 80 items, ranging from a “cotton picker” and “electrical piano” to “ink for the blind” and “artificial silk.” That scattershot range was a system that helped him get ideas out of his head and onto paper so they would stop renting space in the brain.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pocket Notebooks Turned Ideas Into Archives</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">According to Rutgers University, his lists were part of a broader habit of carrying pocket notebooks to record every observation, diagram, and thought. Over 3,500 of these notebooks, totaling 5 million pages, have been archived under the Edison Papers Project at the Edison National Historic Site in West Orange, New Jersey.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-BjUjF epByxC\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Edison essentially employed a highly structured, prolific approach to invention, using “idea books” and detailed notebooks to track thousands of projects at his Menlo Park, New Jersey, laboratory. His method was characterized by a specific, ambitious, and, for the time, revolutionary “idea quota” aimed at maintaining high-volume output of one minor invention every 10 days and a major invention every six months or so.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">He ultimately earned 1,093 US patents, according to Reuters.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Science Says Writing It Down Works</h2><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:2\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Modern psychology backs up Edison's old-school habit, too. A peer-reviewed study published in 2011 found that unfinished goals can trigger intrusive thoughts, but making a plan can reduce that mental interference, freeing attention for the task in front of you.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em>Photo Courtesy: Roman Samborskyi on Shutterstock.com</em></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"bz-optimizely-campaign bz-optimizely-campaign-bottom-50953206\" data-nosnippet=\"true\"></div><!--/$--></div></div>",
