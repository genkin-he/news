The analyst noted that Roku's 17% platform revenue growth fell short of elevated investor expectations of around 19–20%, which drove shares down 5% after hours.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">However, he attributed the modest top-line surprise to Roku's more conservative guidance philosophy rather than to any execution weakness.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-bNqYHQ hvXQzJ\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Carpenter said Roku has executed effectively on its monetization initiatives in recent quarters and that management's bullish tone for the fourth quarter signals steady momentum. Roku now expects platform revenue growth of 15%, exceeding investor forecasts and implying a slight acceleration in growth when excluding one-time political and Frndly TV impacts.
