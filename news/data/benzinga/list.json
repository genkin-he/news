            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-iViryI frOthR\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">When a parent passes away, the money they leave behind can bring out tension that's been simmering for years. That was the case for one family who recently sought advice on “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/8zzQiKjNXmY?si=Km_WepGd4g3jhIW5&amp;t=3371\" target=\"_blank\">The Ramsey Show</a>.” What started as a concern about financial responsibility quickly turned into a legal and ethical debate.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Mike, a caller from Virginia Beach, Virginia, explained that his wife and her siblings <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/management/26/02/50824468/wife-43-wants-to-use-her-150k-inheritance-to-pay-off-debt-but-husband-wants-to-invest-it-suze-orman-says-consider-bankruptcy-instead\" target=\"_blank\">inherited money</a> from their father several years ago. One sibling was named executor of the will. But instead of distributing the money equally, the executor decided not to tell one of the siblings about their share, claiming that person wasn't financially responsible enough to handle it.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Don't Miss:</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/paladin-power-storage\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the Fire-Safe Energy Storage Company With $185M in Contracted Revenue</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong>Own the Characters, Not Just the Content: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/elf-labs-ip\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Inside a Fast-Growing Pre-IPO IP Company</strong></a></strong></li>\n</ul><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Executor's Role Is To Follow The Will</h2><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:2\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-BjUjF epByxC\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Even if the executor disagrees with how the money will be used, Ramsey said that doesn't matter. “Even if you don't like it, even if you don't agree with it, you have one option when you're the executor, and that's to execute what the will says,” he said.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">He warned that ignoring those instructions could result in serious consequences. “The people on the other side of it are going to sue your butt, and they're going to win because you violated your fiduciary responsibility,” Ramsey said. “I would tell the executive that they’re being stupid and they’re going to get sued.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Trending: This Under-$1 Pre-IPO AI Company Is Still Open to Retail Investors —<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/immersed\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> Learn More</strong></a></strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The amount in question wasn't massive, about $8,000 to $10,000 per sibling. Ramsey said it's “not enough to mess with,” but said the dollar figure doesn't change the principle. If the excluded sibling discovers they were intentionally left out, the executor could be “in deep kimchi legally,” he said.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Mike said he had already told the executor that withholding the money was a bad idea. Ramsey's advice? You've said your piece. “Then you've done your job and leave it alone,” he said.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choosing The Right Person Matters</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Co-host <strong>Jade Warshaw</strong> highlighted a broader lesson. Picking an executor isn't just about trust. It's about integrity and neutrality.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“They need to be Switzerland,” she said, meaning the executor should stay neutral and carry out the will exactly as written.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Ramsey agreed and reminded listeners that the will reflects the wishes of the person who passed away, not the opinions of surviving family members.

They've never done it before. They weren't sure how it works.

You tell me what the situation is and then I will decide based on the information you teach me about this particular situation.” The advisor works for you, not the other way around.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Catching Up And Seeking Clarity</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Neil also shared frustration that his 401(k) wasn't matching the S&amp;P returns he hears about. Ramsey said an advisor can review fund choices and point out options that may perform better, but again, the final decision stays with the client.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The deeper issue wasn't performance. It was fear.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“We don't want to retire poor,” Neil said.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Ramsey's response was confident. “You're not going to retire poor,” he said. “You're going to retire rich. I can tell just by talking to you because you're freaking paying attention. People that retire poor don't bother to look at it.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Warshaw added that many people wake up financially later in life.

The market's attention has been on whether Abel outlines a different playbook for Berkshire's cash-heavy balance sheet, including the possibility of new deals, fresh equity buys, or even a dividend policy shift.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-BjUjF epByxC\"></div><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:4\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:5\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Investment Fluctuations Impact Earnings</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">As per the earning report, the company's 2025 net income included $30,737 million of investment gains, down from $41,558 million in 2024, and it also booked other-than-temporary impairment charges tied to Kraft Heinz and Occidental totaling $8,255 million for the year. In the fourth quarter alone, those impairment losses were $4,495 million, a key driver separating operating performance from reported net results.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Berkshire also broke out how accounting treatment moved the investment line: unrealized gains contributed $9.6 billion in the quarter and $12.9 billion for the year, while 2024 included a full-year unrealized loss of $38.1 billion. Realized gains after tax were $3.9 billion in the quarter and $17.8 billion for 2025, compared with $79.6 billion for 2024.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">As Berkshirehathaway noted, the company cautioned that quarter-to-quarter changes in investment gains can distort per-share figures for investors who don't track the accounting mechanics. Net earnings per average equivalent Class A share were $46,563 for 2025 versus $61,900 in 2024, and Class B was $31.04 versus $41.27.</p><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:6\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Insurance Sector Drives Record Q3 Performance</h2><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:7\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:8\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Insurance Sector: A Key Performance Indicator</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Operating results showed insurance remained a major contributor, though underwriting profitability cooled from the prior year. Insurance-underwriting earnings were $1,561 million in the fourth quarter versus $3,409 million in 2024, and $7,258 million for the year versus $9,020 million, as shared in the report. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Insurance-investment income also stepped down, with $3,072 million in the quarter compared with $4,088 million a year earlier, and $12,513 million for 2025 versus $13,670 million. The preview had pointed to the insurance segment as a key item to watch after Berkshire previously highlighted a 34% year-over-year jump in third-quarter operating earnings driven by stronger insurance profits.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Elsewhere in the operating lineup, BNSF delivered $1,347 million of fourth-quarter earnings and $5,476 million for the year, while Berkshire Hathaway Energy posted $691 million for the quarter and $3,979 million for 2025. Manufacturing, service and retailing contributed $3,370 million in the quarter and $13,647 million for the year.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The company also disclosed that insurance float was about $176 billion at Dec. 31, 2025, up roughly $5 billion from year-end 2024. Shares outstanding at year-end were 1,438,223 Class A equivalent shares, with Class B per-share amounts defined as 1/1,500th of the Class A figures.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"bz-optimizely-campaign bz-optimizely-campaign-bottom-50951965\" data-nosnippet=\"true\"></div><!--/$--></div></div>",
