            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-gfrmXj kPLDLR\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Good Morning Traders!</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Today's economic calendar is moderate but meaningful as markets digest NVDA's earnings reaction and broader macro data. After reporting Q3 revenue growth of 62 percent year over year and strong forward margin guidance, NVDA initially surged above 200 in after hours trading before fading back toward flat, highlighting crowded positioning and elevated expectations. This dynamic will likely shape early tech sentiment. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Initially, Jobless Claims provide a fresh read on labor market conditions. At 10:00AM ET, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman testifies before the Senate Banking Committee, which may generate regulatory or policy headlines. At 10:30AM ET, Natural Gas Inventories are released, followed by Kansas City Fed Manufacturing at 11:00AM ET. Treasury supply continues with Bill Announcements at 11:00AM ET, a 4 and 8 Week Bill Auction at 11:30AM ET, and a 7 Year Note Auction at 1:00PM ET. With earnings volatility intersecting with labor data and Treasury supply, expect sharp rotations and disciplined risk management throughout the session. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"> Now, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-jHrKIi gTZsSs\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">SPY is currently trading around 692.75 as markets digest NVDA's volatile post earnings reaction and prepare for Jobless Claims at 8:30AM ET. If buyers defend this area, a push toward 695.00 may develop, followed by 697.25 if momentum builds into the mid morning session. Sustained strength above 699.50 would indicate expanding upside participation and could open the door toward 702.00 if yields remain stable. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If SPY loses 692.75 with conviction, sellers may press into 690.50. A breakdown there could expose 688.25, and continued downside pressure may test 685.75. Watch how markets interpret NVDA's fade from above 200 back toward flat, as that tone could influence broader risk appetite.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">QQQ is currently trading around 616.00 and remains highly sensitive to NVDA's earnings reaction. Holding above this pivot may allow a move into 619.00, followed by 622.25 if growth names regain momentum. A break above 625.00 would signal strong upside continuation and potential re acceleration in tech leadership. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If 616.00 fails to hold, sellers may guide price into 612.75. A sustained breakdown could bring 609.50 into focus, and deeper weakness may target 605.75. Tech volatility may expand as traders reassess semiconductor momentum following the after hours fade.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Apple Inc. (AAPL)</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">AAPL is currently trading around 274.25 and attempting to build structure above recent consolidation. If buyers defend this zone, a move toward 276.75 may develop, followed by 279.00 if broader tech firms. Sustained strength above 281.50 would reflect renewed institutional demand. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If 274.25 breaks lower, sellers may test 272.00. A breakdown there could expose 269.75, and continued weakness may bring 267.25 into view. Apple's relative strength will help determine whether mega caps absorb NVDA-related volatility.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">MSFT is currently trading around 399.25 and sitting just below the key 400 psychological level. If buyers reclaim 401.00 with strength, price may rotate toward 404.00, followed by 407.25 if upside momentum builds. A sustained push above 410.00 would signal structural repair in large cap tech. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If 399.25 fails to hold, sellers may press into 396.50. Continued weakness could extend into 393.75, and deeper downside may test 390.50. Microsoft's reaction to broader growth flows will likely influence QQQ direction.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">NVDA is currently trading around 197.25 after an explosive initial reaction above 200 following earnings that saw revenue up 62 percent year over year and strong margin guidance. If buyers defend this pivot, a move back toward 200.00 may develop, followed by 204.50 if upside momentum resumes. Sustained strength above 207.00 would reflect renewed confidence in the Blackwell cycle narrative. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If 197.25 breaks lower, sellers may test 193.75 quickly. A breakdown there could expose 190.50, and continued weakness may target 186.75. The fade from after hours highs suggests positioning is crowded, so expect elevated volatility throughout the session.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Alphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">GOOGL is currently trading around 311.75 and attempting to stabilize after recent swings. If buyers defend this zone, a move toward 314.25 may unfold, followed by 317.00 if communication services strengthen. A break above 319.75 would signal renewed upside momentum. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If 311.75 fails, sellers may press into 308.75. A sustained breakdown could expose 305.50, and deeper weakness may target 302.75. Watch whether large cap tech rotates into relative strength away from semiconductors.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Meta Platforms Inc (META)</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">META is currently trading around 649.75 and maintaining relative stability despite semiconductor volatility. If buyers step in, price may rotate toward 653.50, followed by 657.25 if upside momentum expands. Sustained strength above 660.00 would indicate continued leadership. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If 649.75 breaks down, sellers may guide price into 645.50. A deeper pullback could test 641.25, and continued weakness may bring 637.50 into focus. Relative strength here would signal resilience within growth.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Tesla Inc. (TSLA)</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">TSLA is currently trading around 415.00 and remains reactive to broader risk tone. If buyers defend this pivot, a push toward 419.25 may develop, followed by 423.50 if speculative participation builds. A breakout above 427.00 would signal expanding upside momentum. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If 415.00 fails to hold, sellers may test 410.75. Continued downside pressure could extend into 406.50, and deeper weakness may bring 401.75 into view.

Over the past month, <strong>Canadian Imperial Bank Inc.

A lower P/E could indicate that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future or it could mean that the company is undervalued. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of <strong>15.66</strong> in the Banks industry, Canadian Imperial Bank Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of <strong>16.1</strong>.

A low P/E ratio can be an indication of undervaluation, but it can also suggest weak growth prospects or financial instability. Moreover, the P/E ratio is just one of many metrics that investors should consider when making investment decisions, and it should be evaluated alongside other financial ratios, industry trends, and qualitative factors. By taking a comprehensive approach to analyzing a company's financial health, investors can make well-informed decisions that are more likely to lead to successful outcomes. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-jHrKIi gTZsSs\"></div><!--/$--></div></div>",
