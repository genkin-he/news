Several states experienced prolonged freezes this winter. Heat pump owners were hit especially hard when auxiliary electric heat kicked in during subfreezing temperatures. But many insist that weather alone doesn't explain everything.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“I used less kWh last year compared to the previous year but my bill is still higher,” one homeowner wrote, blaming rising base rates and new fees.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Trending: Own the Characters, Not Just the Content: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/elf-labs-ip\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Inside a Fast-Growing Pre-IPO IP Company</strong></a></strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The AI Data Center Debate</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Some commenters argue the increases are tied to infrastructure upgrades needed to power massive AI data centers.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“Look at <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/tech/25/12/49157578/ai-data-centers-are-driving-us-power-crunch-and-even-record-grid-spending-isnt-enough-new-research-finds\" target=\"_blank\">AI data centers</a> gobbling up energy and we're all paying for it,” one person wrote. “It’s disgusting.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The original poster claimed utilities are passing along the cost of billions in grid upgrades, adding that customers are effectively subsidizing new infrastructure while utilities receive state-approved profit margins.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Others pushed back, saying the electric grid has needed upgrades for decades. Rising interest rates, wildfire prevention projects and long-delayed maintenance are also driving capital spending.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Still, frustration runs deep. “We should not be paying for city-size data center infrastructure none of us asked for,” one commenter wrote. “Data centers need to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/tech/26/02/50567229/anthropic-vows-to-pay-full-power-bill-for-its-ai-data-centers-says-americans-wont-foot-the-bill\" target=\"_blank\">pay for their own</a> construction and utilities.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Some homeowners are looking for ways to offset the pain. Solar installations, insulation upgrades and switching suppliers were frequently mentioned.

There is only ONE utility provider. A for-profit, privately owned company.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For households already stretched by mortgages, insurance and food costs, even a $100 jump can hurt.
