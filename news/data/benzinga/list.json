It would take 8.33 years to equal the $5 million payout, which means as long as you live 8.33 more years from now, you would make more money by taking the monthly payments.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Factors to consider include how long you may live and also the rate of return you could get if you took the $5 million now. Some people on social media believed they could invest the $5 million or put it to work to earn a higher monthly rate of return.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">This author polled followers on social media to see which answer ranked ahead:</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">\"MrBeast Question on Beast Games as a poll: Would you rather take $5 million upfront or $50,000 a month for life if you won Beast Games 2?\" I <a href=\"https://x.com/chriskatje/status/2026712686717800566\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a>.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The results from 43 votes were:</p><!--/$--><!--$--><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>$5 million upfront: 34.9%</li>\n<li>$50,000 a month for life: 65.1%</li>\n</ul><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The winner was the monthly income, but based on the fact that you could outearn the $5 million in 8.33 years, the close results of the poll may come as a surprise.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Ultimately, it comes down to life expectancy, rate of return and financial goals. The average life expectancies are 78.4 to 79 in the United States and around 73 years globally. This means that if you are 70 or under in the U.S. and 64 years and 8 months old or younger globally, you are more than likely to make more than the $5 million by taking monthly payments.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Another factor to consider could be if the person asked the questions has kids as $5 million upfront now could secure their financial future with college money or money put aside, while the monthly payments could stop if the parent died tomorrow.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Financial hardships or needing money immediately for medical bills, debt, or to care for a loved one could also factor into being more likely to take the $5 million now.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Social Media Responds</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The question divided social media and generated plenty of thoughtful responses.

The chipmaker easily beat revenue and profit expectations and issued strong guidance, but shares slid sharply in response, reflecting concern over whether sky-high expectations can be sustained. Despite the stellar results, Nvidia's pullback weighed on the semiconductor sector and contributed to sluggish performance among major tech benchmarks late in the week.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Wall Street's cautious reaction underscored a shift in focus from headline earnings beats to deeper questions about long-term growth, capital returns and competitive dynamics as rival AI hardware efforts gain traction. Even as Nvidia signaled continued demand for its AI-compute platforms, investors homed in on issues such as future spending patterns, competition from alternative AI chip designs, and the sustainability of massive hyperscaler capex commitments. This sentiment pressured broader technology stocks and highlighted the fragility of the market's AI-led rally despite fundamentally strong results.</p><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:2\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Benzinga provides daily reports on the stocks most popular with investors.
