It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&amp;P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Merck &amp; Co has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of <strong>131.09</strong> of the Pharmaceuticals industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:3\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:4\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-jHrKIi gTZsSs\"></div><!--/$--></div></div>",
