The ministry spokesman didn't provide additional details on the accusations.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">\"China's leadership shakeup is no longer a contained political issue and is increasingly shaping how risk is priced across geopolitics and trade,\" Arlan Suderman, Chief Commodities Economist at StoneX, <a href=\"https://www.stonex.com/en/market-intelligence/china-military-purges-are-making-policy-outcomes-less-predictable/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">wrote </a>on January 29.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">‘Nobody Is Safe'</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">General Zhang Youxia hails from a prominent military family.

This release will be closely monitored for signs of upstream inflation pressures that could influence future Fed policy expectations and bond yields. At 9:45AM ET, the MNI Chicago PMI provides insight into regional manufacturing conditions. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">At 10:00AM ET, Construction Spending data is released, followed by the Kansas City Fed Services Activity report at 11:00AM ET. Later in the afternoon at 3:00PM ET, Agricultural Prices Paid and Received round out the data slate. With inflation data driving early positioning and lighter releases into the afternoon, expect volatility around 8:30AM ET and potential consolidation into the weekend. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Now we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)</strong><br/>SPY is currently trading around 685.75 as markets prepare for the 8:30AM ET PPI release, which will be closely watched following recent inflation volatility. If buyers defend this level on a favorable inflation read, a move toward 688.00 may develop, followed by 690.25 if upside momentum builds into the mid morning session. Sustained strength above 692.00 would indicate expanding participation and could open the door toward 695.00 into the close. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-jHrKIi gTZsSs\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If SPY loses 685.75 with conviction, sellers may press into 683.50. A breakdown there could expose 681.25, and continued downside pressure may test 678.75. Inflation data tends to trigger sharp bond market reactions, so expect volatility around the 8:30AM window.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">QQQ is currently trading around 606.25 and remains sensitive to rate driven moves following PPI. Holding above this pivot may allow a rotation into 608.75, followed by 611.50 if growth names regain traction. A break above 613.75 would reflect stronger upside momentum and potential continuation into the upper range. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If 606.25 fails to hold, sellers may guide price into 603.50. A sustained breakdown could bring 600.75 into focus, and deeper weakness may target 597.25. Tech may exaggerate any yield reaction to inflation data.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Apple Inc. (AAPL)</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">AAPL is currently trading around 272.25 and attempting to build higher structure after recent consolidation. If buyers defend this zone, a move toward 274.75 may develop, followed by 277.00 if broader tech firms. Sustained strength above 279.50 would signal improving institutional demand. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If 272.25 breaks lower, sellers may test 269.90. A breakdown there could expose 267.50, and continued weakness may bring 264.75 into view. Watch Apple's relative strength for signs of mega cap resilience.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">MSFT is currently trading around 397.50 and remains just below the key 400 level. If buyers reclaim 400.00 with strength, price may rotate toward 402.75, followed by 405.50 if momentum builds. A sustained push above 408.00 would indicate structural improvement in large cap tech. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If 397.50 fails to hold, sellers may press into 394.75. Continued weakness could extend into 392.00, and deeper downside may test 389.25. Microsoft's reaction to bond yields will likely influence QQQ sentiment.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">NVDA is currently trading around 184.25 and remains volatile following earnings. If buyers defend this pivot, a move toward 187.75 may develop, followed by 190.50 if upside momentum returns. Sustained trade above 193.25 would reflect renewed confidence in the semiconductor space. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If 184.25 breaks lower, sellers may test 181.75 quickly. A breakdown there could expose 178.50, and continued weakness may target 175.75. NVDA's direction will likely set the tone for broader tech.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Alphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">GOOGL is currently trading around 306.25 and attempting to stabilize above recent consolidation. If buyers defend this zone, a move toward 308.75 may unfold, followed by 311.50 if communication services strengthen. A break above 314.00 would signal renewed upside momentum. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If 306.25 fails, sellers may press into 303.75. A sustained breakdown could expose 301.25, and deeper weakness may target 298.50. Losing the 300 region would dampen enthusiasm in large cap growth.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Meta Platforms Inc (META)</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">META is currently trading around 651.75 and maintaining relative stability. If buyers step in, price may rotate toward 655.50, followed by 659.25 if upside momentum expands. Sustained strength above 662.00 would indicate continued leadership within growth names. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If 651.75 breaks down, sellers may guide price into 647.50. A deeper pullback could test 643.75, and continued weakness may bring 639.50 into focus. Relative performance here will provide clues about broader risk appetite.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Tesla Inc. (TSLA)</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">TSLA is currently trading around 406.50 and remains reactive to macro tone. If buyers defend this pivot, a push toward 410.25 may develop, followed by 414.00 if momentum builds. A breakout above 418.50 would signal stronger speculative participation. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If 406.50 fails to hold, sellers may test 402.75. Continued downside pressure could extend into 399.25, and deeper weakness may bring 395.50 into view. Tesla often amplifies broader market swings.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Final Word: </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Trade with discipline, manage risk carefully, happy Friday, and have a great weekend.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong><em>Benzinga Disclaimer: This article is from an unpaid external contributor.
