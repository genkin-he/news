Amazon stated that its AI partner, Anthropic, will gain over five times the compute power it had before, with its Claude model expected to run on more than one million Trainium2 chips by the end of 2025. The analyst noted that while the launch arrived about a month later than expected, it confirms that Amazon's large-scale capacity ramp for AI workloads has begun.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">He added that the new Rainier capacity could significantly strengthen AWS through 2026.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Analysts expect AWS revenue to rise 19% year over year in 2026, slightly faster than 2025's 18%. Post believes that Anthropic's growing AI demand could materially boost AWS results, estimating up to $6 billion in incremental revenue in 2026, potentially adding 4 percentage points to overall growth.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The analyst described Amazon's investment in proprietary technology — including Trainium chips and Nova models as a critical strategic move to differentiate AWS in the competitive AI market.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">AWS CEO <strong>Matt Garman</strong> has said these chips can outperform general-purpose alternatives, and Post noted that Amazon's in-house approach could reduce training and inference costs while lifting AWS margins. Still, he acknowledged that investor skepticism remains over whether demand for Trainium-based systems will expand beyond Anthropic.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Post expects Amazon's upcoming earnings call and its re:Invent conference to highlight the benefits of the Rainier rollout and possibly announce Trainium3, further closing the performance gap with other AI chipmakers.
