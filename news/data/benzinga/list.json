Skilled trades may command higher pay while labor remains scarce. Meanwhile, AI developers are building the systems that could eventually change how those trades operate.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The robots may not be installing sinks tomorrow.

            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-iViryI frOthR\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In early January 1888, just after <strong>Thomas Edison</strong> opened his West Orange, New Jersey laboratory, he drafted a five-page punch list titled \"Things doing and to be done\" that mixed the urgent with the wildly ambitious.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A To-Do List Built For Big Bets</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Unlike typical daily checklists, Edison’s lists included key achievements and potential inventions listed as bullet points alongside technical improvements. His 1888 list featured over 80 items, ranging from a “cotton picker” and “electrical piano” to “ink for the blind” and “artificial silk.” That scattershot range was a system that helped him get ideas out of his head and onto paper so they would stop renting space in the brain.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pocket Notebooks Turned Ideas Into Archives</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">According to Rutgers University, his lists were part of a broader habit of carrying pocket notebooks to record every observation, diagram, and thought. Over 3,500 of these notebooks, totaling 5 million pages, have been archived under the Edison Papers Project at the Edison National Historic Site in West Orange, New Jersey.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-BjUjF epByxC\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Edison essentially employed a highly structured, prolific approach to invention, using “idea books” and detailed notebooks to track thousands of projects at his Menlo Park, New Jersey, laboratory. His method was characterized by a specific, ambitious, and, for the time, revolutionary “idea quota” aimed at maintaining high-volume output of one minor invention every 10 days and a major invention every six months or so.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">He ultimately earned 1,093 US patents, according to Reuters.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Science Says Writing It Down Works</h2><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:2\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Modern psychology backs up Edison's old-school habit, too.

Scaramucci wrote that Trump replied, \"That's impossible. There's nobody smarter than me,\" and said he witnessed the exchange.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scaramuccis Stark Warning About Leadership</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Scaramucci argued that the comment points to a management style built around certainty rather than debate. He framed effective leadership as building teams that test assumptions, warning that a leader who insists on being the top mind in every meeting eventually narrows the talent around him.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-BjUjF epByxC\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In the same post, Scaramucci said journalist <strong>Maggie Haberman</strong> later corroborated the line in \"The Confidence Man.\" He added that the remark, in his view, explains how decision-making can become more about ego than outcomes.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">That critique has also shown up in Scaramucci's response to Trump's trade actions, where he has argued the president's inner circle isn't built to push back. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">After Trump moved to slap new tariffs on most major U.S. trading partners, Scaramucci posted on X, \"There is stupid and then there is Donald Trump Stupid: DTS. A new global low.\"</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Scaramucci also took aim at Trump's advisers, saying the administration was operating inside an \"echo chamber of stupidity\" on trade. The comments followed China's decision to answer U.S. tariffs with its own measures on Thursday.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Consequences of Aggressive Foreign Policy</h2><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:2\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">This perspective on leadership and decision-making aligns with Scaramucci’s critique of Trump’s tariff strategy, highlighting the broader implications of policies shaped by a lack of dissent within advisory circles. The potential fallout from aggressive actions, whether in trade or foreign policy, underscores the delicate balance leaders must maintain, particularly as geopolitical tensions rise.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Market Reactions Reflect Growing Tariff Concerns</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Critics of the tariff campaign have argued that higher import costs and retaliation can boomerang onto U.S. growth. The size of the Dow's one-day slide after the \"Liberation Day\" announcement signaled how quickly investors repriced the economic risk.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Scaramucci's leadership critique and his tariff attacks both hinge on the same claim: that Trump resists dissent and surrounds himself with reinforcement instead of challenge. In the leadership post, as X noted, Scaramucci warned that when a leader believes he's always the smartest in the room, the room gets smaller over time.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"bz-optimizely-campaign bz-optimizely-campaign-bottom-50953153\" data-nosnippet=\"true\"></div><!--/$--></div></div>",
