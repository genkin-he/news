A cash‑out refinance would replace that low‑rate mortgage with a larger loan at current market rates.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">That can mean:</p><!--/$--><!--$--><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Higher interest costs over time, because your entire balance (not just the cash out portion) gets repriced.</li>\n<li>A reset of your amortization schedule, potentially pushing your payoff date further into the future.</li>\n<li>Bigger payment shock, especially if you extend back to a fresh 30‑year term.</li>\n</ul><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If you like your current rate and payoff trajectory but need cash, a second solution like a home equity loan can be a smarter fit.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When a Rocket Home Equity Loan Makes Sense</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Rocket's home equity loan is built for <a href=\"https://launchpad.rocketmortgage.com/?nvm=false&amp;qls=BZG_affrktxx.homeequity&amp;aff_sub=ajdedicated\" target=\"_blank\">homeowners who know how much they need</a> and want structure rather than a revolving line of credit.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">It can be a strong option if:</p><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:3\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For example, say your home is worth $500,000 and you owe $250,000 on a 3% first mortgage. Refinancing to pull $75,000 in cash could mean giving up that rate on the entire $325,000 balance. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">A <a href=\"https://launchpad.rocketmortgage.com/?nvm=false&amp;qls=BZG_affrktxx.homeequity&amp;aff_sub=ajdedicated\" target=\"_blank\">Rocket home equity loan</a>, by contrast, leaves the 3% loan alone and adds a separate, fixed‑rate payment on just the $75,000.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Decide if Rocket's Home Equity Loan Is Right for You</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">A Rocket home equity loan can be a smart way to turn equity into cash while preserving the low‑rate mortgage you worked hard to secure. It tends to work best if you:</p><!--/$--><!--$--><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Have at least $45,000 in tappable equity and a credit score of 680 or higher.</li>\n<li>Need a specific, sizable amount for one‑time goals rather than ongoing, flexible borrowing.</li>\n<li>Prefer the certainty of a fixed rate and fixed term over a variable‑rate line of credit.</li>\n</ul><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">From there, run the numbers and compare the total cost of a cash‑out refi versus layering on a second mortgage for just the amount you need.
