The analyst noted that Roku's 17% platform revenue growth fell short of elevated investor expectations of around 19–20%, which drove shares down 5% after hours.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">However, he attributed the modest top-line surprise to Roku's more conservative guidance philosophy rather than to any execution weakness.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-bNqYHQ hvXQzJ\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Carpenter said Roku has executed effectively on its monetization initiatives in recent quarters and that management's bullish tone for the fourth quarter signals steady momentum. Roku now expects platform revenue growth of 15%, exceeding investor forecasts and implying a slight acceleration in growth when excluding one-time political and Frndly TV impacts. The analyst believes Roku's platform growth could reaccelerate next year, supported by several potential tailwinds — including the Amazon DSP rollout, Roku Ads Manager, the U.S. midterm elections, a refreshed home screen interface, and the World Cup.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Roku's third-quarter revenue of $1.21 billion rose 14%, topping guidance of $1.205 billion. Platform revenue climbed 17%, driven by ad performance. Platform margins of 51.5% backed gross margin of 43%. Roku posted positive GAAP operating income for the first time since 2021. It generated $125 million in free cash flow, topping Carpenter's $75 million estimate.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Looking ahead, Roku raised its fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance from $131 million to $145 million and lifted its platform growth outlook from 12.5% to 15%. The company also improved its device revenue forecast to roughly flat year over year, up from prior expectations of a 10% decline.
