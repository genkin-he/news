            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-fxwyg khStwV\"><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Snapshot:</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Kalshi is edging further into blockchain territory: hiring crypto talent, partnering with oracle networks, and flowing its event contract data on-chain.</li>\n<li>It isn’t about decentralized betting. Kalshi aims to become the probability layer of Web3, a regulated data backbone for DeFi protocols, trading bots, and blockchain projects that need credible, low-latency event feeds.</li>\n</ul><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Prediction markets promised to make finance more foresight-driven, but their early incarnations were too niche to matter or too unregulated to scale. Kalshi, federally licensed and VC-backed, set out to change that by dragging the sector into the institutional mainstream. It worked, but in earning Wall Street's trust, it alienated some of crypto's decentralization purists.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Now Kalshi is pivoting again. The firm has quietly opened channels to the blockchain world, hiring a head of crypto, signing data partnerships with oracle networks, and enabling USDC settlement. It hasn't gone fully on-chain, but the direction of travel is unmistakable.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Regulated Core, a Permissionless Edge</strong></h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For most of its life, Kalshi stayed firmly conventional: dollar-settled, centrally operated, and regulator-approved. That conservatism paid off. Brokers like Robinhood integrated its products, and institutional players began treating event contracts as serious instruments.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-fzzUx jSgJNL\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In crypto circles, that sort of orthodoxy can signal surrender. Polymarket, Kalshi's crypto-native rival (built on Polygon), sprinted ahead, offering unfiltered event trading before being forced offshore by regulators. It became the chaotic default for crypto bettors, while Kalshi stayed respectable – but walled off.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Kalshi's new strategy aims to bridge the two worlds. Rather than competing with Polymarket's decentralization, it wants to make its market probabilities a trusted reference feed for Web3. Its <a href=\"https://nexteventhorizon.substack.com/p/kalshi-pyth-deal\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">recent partnership</a> with oracle provider Pyth captures the intent: </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">\"For the first time, regulated event data will be streamed on-chain at scale.\" </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">That may be marketing copy but it reflects a real shift. Kalshi isn't decentralizing trading; it's composing its data. Regulated data is a rarity in DeFi and Kalshi's status as a Designated Contract Market gives its price feeds a legitimacy that informal oracles lack. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Pyth framed the deal as making \"regulated prediction market prices available to everyone with an internet connection,\" a not-so-subtle critique of DeFi's <em>laissez-faire</em> data culture, where <a href=\"https://defirate.com/news/sushiswap-rug-pull/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">liquidity can outpace credibility</a>.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>From Platform to Protocol</strong></h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Kalshi's recalibration became apparent last summer with the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-25/prediction-marketplace-kalshi-taps-influencer-john-wang-to-head-crypto-push\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">hire of John Wang</a>, a prominent figure from the Solana ecosystem. He described prediction markets as a \"Trojan horse\" for mainstream crypto adoption. Kalshi's plan is not ideological purity, but <a href=\"https://x.com/j0hnwang/status/1959967199101407438\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">strategic infiltration</a>: keep a regulated core, let its data leak into permissionless territory.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">To that end, Kalshi has struck partnerships with Pyth, Switchboard, and <a href=\"https://x.com/StorkOracle/status/1978197374272254233\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Stork</a> to extend its reach. Each oracle targets a different chain and developer base, making them distribution channels, not just integrations. If developers start treating Kalshi's probabilities as canonical, its influence could extend far beyond its own traders.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Regulation as Strategy</strong></h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Rather than chase liquidity head-on, Kalshi could become the probability layer underpinning hedging vaults, structured products, and automated DeFi strategies. Competitors might even build atop its data.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">But crypto purists won't be impressed that Kalshi still controls custody, settlement, and matching. They may be missing something important. Kalshi's evolving architecture mirrors Web3's most resilient designs: a tightly governed core surrounded by a permissionless edge. The only difference is accountability: Kalshi answers to Washington, not token holders.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The launch of KalshiEco, a developer ecosystem supported by Solana and Base, pushes the strategy further. It's a classic SaaS play: platformize your data, provide APIs and tooling, and let others build. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Take Away</strong></h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Kalshi isn't just trying to be the biggest prediction market. It wants to be crypto’s <a href=\"https://x.com/KalshiEco/status/1980353570190102541\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">reference layer for probabilities</a> – a sort of blockchain Bloomberg for event risk. Recent evidence suggests the approach is working.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">After Robinhood added Kalshi's contracts in August, trading volumes surged, surpassing Polymarket's by September –roughly <a href=\"https://phemex.com/news/article/prediction-market-volumes-surge-amid-kalshi-and-polymarket-rivalry-24643\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$3 billion versus $1.4 billion</a>. Volume doesn't equal legitimacy, but it gets attention.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Across the sector, others still sit at finance's fringes: Zeitgeist leans into full decentralization; Manifold turns predictions into social games. They have traction, but not regulatory standing. Meanwhile, Polymarket is set to leave the regulatory grey zone and formalize its US presence. Kalshi is betting that in the long run, legitimacy, not just liquidity, determines who becomes DeFi's data backbone.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If DeFi is to handle the impact of real-world events like elections, interest-rate moves, and weather patterns, it needs reliable feeds. Kalshi's odds could become indispensable infrastructure.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Can a centralized exchange become essential to decentralized finance without decentralizing itself? That's Kalshi's quiet gamble. So far, the market seems willing to play along.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong><em>Benzinga Disclaimer: This article is from an unpaid external contributor.

            "title": "London Stock Exchange Transitions: New Market Dynamics",
            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-fxwyg khStwV\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In the third quarter, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) dropped out of the top 20 global IPO markets for the first time in many years, ranking 23rd in the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-30/london-drops-out-of-top-20-ipo-markets-after-69-plunge-in-fundraising\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg rating</a>. This is an unexpected turn for an exchange that has long ranked among the world's leading venues for public offerings and attracted capital from across the globe for decades. In the current ranking, it was surpassed by the exchanges in Singapore, Mexico, and even Oman.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>London may be losing volume, but not control</strong></h2><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">At first glance, it may indeed seem that London is losing its influence. But if you look deeper, the root cause is that IPOs themselves have lost popularity in recent years: due to high interest rates, many companies preferred to postpone going public. According to EY <a href=\"https://www.ey.com/en_gl/newsroom/2024/12/2024-ipo-wrapped-americas-and-emeia-recover-asia-pacific-lags#:~:text=The%20global%20IPO%20market%20recorded,EY%20Global%20IPO%20Trends%202024.\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> by the end of 2024, the total number of global IPOs was 1215, compared to 1351 in <a href=\"https://www.ey.com/en_tr/insights/ipo/trends#:~:text=Global%20IPO%20activity%20by%20number%20of%20IPOs&amp;text=See%20image%20description%20below.&amp;text=Column%20chart%20showing%20global%20IPO,1%2C351;%20H1%202024%2C%20551.\" target=\"_blank\">2023</a>.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Investors have also been cautious. In the current environment, it is pretty difficult to predict which companies going public will be successful and which will not. So, capital has been directed to other instruments. However, the situation is gradually changing: interest rates around the world are falling, opening a window of opportunity, especially for technology companies.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Britain's Post-Brexit Regulatory</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Against this backdrop, each economy reacted in its own way. The UK decided not to wait for external conditions to improve, but to seize the moment to make systemic changes. After Brexit, the UK began to build its own regulatory system, independent of Brussels and Washington. The country effectively acknowledged that it would not be able to meet both European and American standards at the same time and decided to develop its own British model of regulation.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">You might settle for a slice of a sprawling feast that doesn't suit your appetite. Or, you could prepare your own pudding-perhaps less grand, but crafted to your liking. London has embraced the pudding approach. This means that the United Kingdom understands that it is losing volume, but wants to build a system in which it sets the rules of the game and doesn’t have to contend with foreign bureaucracy. In the rankings this looks like a decline and a decrease in attractiveness, but what we are seeing here is a change of model. London remains an important center of capital, but its role now – to demonstrate autonomy.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>So, why are some companies leaving the British market?</strong></h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In fact, each company makes its own decision about where to go public, and it is not always because of bias against London. Unilever (LSE:ULVR), for example, is not leaving Britain at all. Post-Brexit, however, regulatory divergence made it impractical to maintain equal footing across both EU and UK frameworks. As a company with deep European roots, Unilever has designated Amsterdam as the primary listing for its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/13/unilever-chooses-amsterdam-for-primary-listing-of-split-off-ice-cream-business\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ice cream</a> division while retaining a secondary listing in London. This isn't a complete departure, its more like a strategic rebalancing that keeps London as part of its dual-listing structure, ensuring access to the U.S. and U.K. markets without full relocation.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-gQfuga iaHpuj\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In addition, the self-identification of companies also plays a role. Take, for example, the ESG agenda. Formally, it exists in both Europe and the UK, but even within this acronym (environmental, social, governance), the emphasis is different in different regions. For Europe, ESG is a mandatory part of any regulations with a strong focus on environmental friendliness. In the UK, the approach is more flexible, with greater attention paid to social issues in some areas.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">That is why companies choose the market that is closer to their philosophy. Ultimately, this is not a question of London losing its appeal.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Asian markets are growing, but not forever</strong></h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">At the same time, there is no point in denying that the role of Asian markets is constantly growing. Over the past year, the total volume of IPOs in Asia has skyrocketed by 80%. Nevertheless, it seems that the prospects for these markets are now exaggerated a little bit.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Yet, this momentum follows a familiar historical pattern seen in several economies. Japan in the 1980s, South Korea in the 1990s, and China in the 2000s each experienced explosive export-led growth, only to face structural slowdowns as demographic pressures, rising debt, and shifting global trade dynamics took hold. The transitions weren't uniform or inevitable, but they do highlight recurring challenges in sustaining high growth over decades. Of course, we can single out Singapore with its adaptive management system and resilience, but it remains the exception rather than the rule. For this reason, we should continue to treat Asia with caution as a reliable engine of long-term stable growth.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In the short term, I would rather bet on Europe. For example, more and more companies are going public in Poland, while others are choosing Amsterdam and Stockholm. And this is just one of many examples of how European markets are quite capable of growing steadily. The main thing is not to give in to alarmist sentiments, but to look at any market calmly and without undue panic. London has certainly lost some of its volume, but in my opinion, it should not be written off.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong><em>Benzinga Disclaimer: This article is from an unpaid external contributor.
