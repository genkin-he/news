In a world where the Fed's rate outlook remains unclear, a growing cohort of investors doesn't want to lock in duration risk.

Operating profits are also set to jump this year, from $67 billion to $72.8 billion. Operating margins are expected at 6.9%, up from 6.6% last year, and revenues and passenger count are set to soar too.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Below the surface, however, airlines face several upside challenges. At the top of that list is net profit margins, which are expected to hold steady at just 3.9%<strong>. </strong>Net profit per passenger is forecast at $7.90, below the 2023 high of $8.50.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">That means while airline companies are stacking more cash, they’re still operating on razor-thin margins. Simultaneously, higher operating costs are matching and, in some cases, outpacing airliner revenue growth. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">That’s why, even with the spring and summer travel season fast approaching, investors need to choose airline stocks carefully.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-jHrKIi gTZsSs\"></div><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:2\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“For example, 97% of airlines say they plan to integrate or are already integrating AI into their global business, especially on the maintenance and operations side,” BCG noted. “Many have already begun to move forward with individual AI initiatives to improve efficiency.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Stock market investors should take this scenario as good news. History shows airline stocks tend to outperform when profitability stabilizes and fuel costs cooperate, especially when demand remains strong, as we’re seeing in early 2026. The market already concurs with that assessment, with the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Airlines Industry Index up 18.4% over the past 90 days, well ahead of the 1.4% posted by the S&amp;P 500 Index over the same time period.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In an upbeat airline environment, which sector stocks look ready to soar in 2026?
