It would take 8.33 years to equal the $5 million payout, which means as long as you live 8.33 more years from now, you would make more money by taking the monthly payments.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Factors to consider include how long you may live and also the rate of return you could get if you took the $5 million now.

The average life expectancies are 78.4 to 79 in the United States and around 73 years globally. This means that if you are 70 or under in the U.S. and 64 years and 8 months old or younger globally, you are more than likely to make more than the $5 million by taking monthly payments.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Another factor to consider could be if the person asked the questions has kids as $5 million upfront now could secure their financial future with college money or money put aside, while the monthly payments could stop if the parent died tomorrow.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Financial hardships or needing money immediately for medical bills, debt, or to care for a loved one could also factor into being more likely to take the $5 million now.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Social Media Responds</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The question divided social media and generated plenty of thoughtful responses.
