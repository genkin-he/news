The mid-cap AI cloud infrastructure firm has soared around 513% over the past 12 months, and 330% this year, vaulting from relative obscurity into Wall Street’s favorite speculative obsession. Yet as the stock’s valuation rockets past 29 times projected 2026 sales,<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/etfs\" target=\"_blank\"> ETF managers</a> are asking the billion-dollar question: how much AI is too much AI?</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The Amsterdam-based firm has ridden the AI euphoria harder than almost any peer, fueled by a blockbuster $17.4 billion AI infrastructure deal with <strong>Microsoft Corp </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/MSFT\" target=\"_blank\">MSFT</a>) and a 625% year-over-year revenue jump last quarter.
