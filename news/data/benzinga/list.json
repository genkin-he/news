state.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Energy Markets Brace For Supply Disruption</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Oil traders were already focused on the chokepoint risk because Iran sits opposite key Gulf producers at Hormuz, and any widening conflict could interrupt tanker traffic.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-BjUjF

Skilled trades may command higher pay while labor remains scarce. Meanwhile, AI developers are building the systems that could eventually change how those trades operate.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The robots may not be installing sinks tomorrow. But if his timeline proves accurate, they might be mowing lawns while the plumber invoices at $350,000 a year — and capital will already be positioned ahead of the shift.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em><strong>Image: Shutterstock</strong></em></p><!--/$--></div></div>",

His 1888 list featured over 80 items, ranging from a “cotton picker” and “electrical piano” to “ink for the blind” and “artificial silk.” That scattershot range was a system that helped him get ideas out of his head and onto paper so they would stop renting space in the brain.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pocket Notebooks Turned Ideas Into Archives</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">According to Rutgers University, his lists were part of a broader habit of carrying pocket notebooks to record every observation, diagram, and thought.
