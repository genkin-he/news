CEO <strong>Scott Bowright</strong> admitted during Chipotle’s <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/CMG/earnings\" target=\"_blank\">third quarter earnings</a> call that younger and lower-income consumers are pulling back — but he's drawing a firm line: no discounts. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Track CMG stock <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/cmg\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</strong></li>\n</ul><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">\"We're losing lower-income and younger consumers to grocery,\" Bowright said, underscoring that even the most beloved burrito brand isn't immune to tightening wallets. \"We're not going to chase short-term traffic with deals.
