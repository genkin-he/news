            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-iViryI frOthR\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">On Saturday, <strong>Anthony Scaramucci</strong> shared an anecdote he says captures what he views as President <strong>Donald Trump</strong>'s core leadership weakness, describing a moment after the 2016 election when Trump rejected the idea of hiring people more capable than he is.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The criticism lands as Scaramucci has also attacked Trump's tariff push and the market shock that followed <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/25/04/44658808/scaramucci-on-tariffs-there-is-stupid-and-then-there-is-donald-trump-stupid\" target=\"_blank\">tariff strategy backlash</a>, including a steep global selloff after Trump's \"Liberation Day\" rollout.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In a post on X, Scaramucci recalled how Bloomberg calling Trump after the election with advice to staff up with people who would challenge him. Scaramucci wrote that Trump replied, \"That's impossible. There's nobody smarter than me,\" and said he witnessed the exchange.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scaramuccis Stark Warning About Leadership</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Scaramucci argued that the comment points to a management style built around certainty rather than debate. He framed effective leadership as building teams that test assumptions, warning that a leader who insists on being the top mind in every meeting eventually narrows the talent around him.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-BjUjF epByxC\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In the same post, Scaramucci said journalist <strong>Maggie Haberman</strong> later corroborated the line in \"The Confidence Man.\" He added that the remark, in his view, explains how decision-making can become more about ego than outcomes.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">That critique has also shown up in Scaramucci's response to Trump's trade actions, where he has argued the president's inner circle isn't built to push back. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">After Trump moved to slap new tariffs on most major U.S. trading partners, Scaramucci posted on X, \"There is stupid and then there is Donald Trump Stupid: DTS. A new global low.\"</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Scaramucci also took aim at Trump's advisers, saying the administration was operating inside an \"echo chamber of stupidity\" on trade. The comments followed China's decision to answer U.S. tariffs with its own measures on Thursday.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Consequences of Aggressive Foreign Policy</h2><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:2\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">This perspective on leadership and decision-making aligns with Scaramucci’s critique of Trump’s tariff strategy, highlighting the broader implications of policies shaped by a lack of dissent within advisory circles. The potential fallout from aggressive actions, whether in trade or foreign policy, underscores the delicate balance leaders must maintain, particularly as geopolitical tensions rise.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Market Reactions Reflect Growing Tariff Concerns</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Critics of the tariff campaign have argued that higher import costs and retaliation can boomerang onto U.S. growth. The size of the Dow's one-day slide after the \"Liberation Day\" announcement signaled how quickly investors repriced the economic risk.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Scaramucci's leadership critique and his tariff attacks both hinge on the same claim: that Trump resists dissent and surrounds himself with reinforcement instead of challenge. In the leadership post, as X noted, Scaramucci warned that when a leader believes he's always the smartest in the room, the room gets smaller over time.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"bz-optimizely-campaign bz-optimizely-campaign-bottom-50953153\" data-nosnippet=\"true\"></div><!--/$--></div></div>",

They create technical documents, then use AI tools to break projects into smaller tasks and generate the code. Some days stretch to 12 hours near deadlines, but they said most days stay under 10.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In their view, experienced engineers who know how to guide AI can replace much of the work typically done by junior and mid-level developers. They believe teams could eventually shrink to “around 2-3 devs per business-unit” supported by AI.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Not everyone agrees with their approach. Some commenters warned that pushing the limits could result in stricter remote policies or more aggressive background checks. Others raised burnout concerns.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Still, many supported the mindset. Several shared stories of being laid off despite strong performance.

            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-iViryI frOthR\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">On Saturday, the United States and Israel struck targets in Iran, rattling energy traders and raising fears that any escalation could choke flows through the Strait of Hormuz, a key route for global crude. President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> framed the campaign as <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/politics/26/02/50951236/trump-says-us-began-major-combat-operations-in-iran-as-israel-launches-preventive-missile-attacks\" target=\"_blank\">major combat operations</a> aimed at crushing Iran's military capacity and ending what he called an imminent threat tied to Tehran's nuclear ambitions.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">As per the report <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/how-us-iran-tensions-could-shape-world-markets-2026-02-28/\" target=\"_blank\">by </a>Reuters, the strikes targeted Iran's leadership and were followed by Iranian missiles launched toward Israel, putting nearby Gulf oil producers on alert. Some major oil companies and leading trading houses paused crude and fuel movements through the Hormuz corridor after the attacks.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Trump tied the operation to what he described as a refusal by Tehran to accept a negotiated outcome in nuclear talks, saying he had not reached a \"final decision\" as recently as Friday. He also pointed to last June's Operation Midnight Hammer, saying it \"obliterated\" three nuclear sites and that Washington had warned Iran against rebuilding its program.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Escalating Conflict Could Spike Oil Prices</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Trump said the U.S. military had begun \"major combat operations\" and argued Iran \"can never have a nuclear weapon,\" casting the strikes as a preemptive move rather than a limited response. He also said the U.S. objective included dismantling Tehran's missile capabilities and its network of armed proxies.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-BjUjF epByxC\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">That political messaging lands directly on the oil market's pressure point: Iran sits across from the Arabian Peninsula at the Strait of Hormuz, where roughly 20% of world oil supply transits, according to the report. Meanwhile, on Friday the Brent settled near $73 a barrel and was already up about 20% for the year.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">As per the outlet, Capital Economics' <strong>William Jackson</strong> wrote that even if hostilities remain contained, Brent could move toward $80, a level seen during last June's 12-day conflict. He also warned that a longer disruption that bites into supply could lift prices toward $100 and add about 0.6 to 0.7 percentage points to global inflation.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Will Markets Respond To Geopolitical Tensions?</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Beyond crude, the Reuters report said investors should brace for bigger swings across markets that have already been jumpy in 2026, citing tariff-driven turbulence and a steep tech selloff. The VIX volatility gauge has climbed about a third this year, while the MOVE index tied to U.S. rate volatility is up 15%, the report said.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Currency moves could hinge on whether oil supply is hit, with Commonwealth Bank of Australia analysts noting the dollar dipped about 1% during last June's war but recovered within days, according to Reuters. The same analysts said a longer conflict that squeezes supply could support the dollar versus most currencies, while the yen and Swiss franc could hold up better.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Israel's shekel is another market to watch as reported by the outlet, which noted it has reacted sharply to prior flare-ups before rebounding quickly. JPMorgan cautioned the pattern could break if risk premiums stay elevated, especially if fighting expands to include heavier action against Iran-aligned groups, Reuters said.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Trump also warned civilians that \"bombs will be dropping everywhere\" as operations continued, while urging Iranians to \"take over your government\" after the fighting. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said it launched a first large-scale wave of missile and drone retaliation toward Israel.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Geopolitical Risk: Historical Market Reactions</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The current escalation in U.S.-Iran tensions has historically injected volatility into financial markets, as seen when major indexes dropped amid fears of military escalation. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For instance, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq often experience short-term losses under such circumstances, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding military actions and their potential impact on oil supply, given that Iran is a significant player in the global oil market. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/Opinion/26/02/50746543/us-iran-tensions-and-market-impact\" target=\"_blank\">Whenever geopolitical risk rises</a>, it can lead to mixed outcomes across various sectors, with energy often benefiting from rising prices, while technology and travel sectors may suffer due to inflation concerns and increased operational costs.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Safe-Haven Assets Set For Renewed Demand</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In Singapore, OCBC strategist <strong>Christopher Wong</strong> told Reuters, \"The strike raises geopolitical risk premia as markets head into Monday's open,\" adding that gold could gap higher and oil could firm on supply fears. Wong also warned of volatility for risk assets and higher-beta currencies if headlines point to wider spillovers.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Reuters said the Swiss franc, up about 3% against the dollar this year, could face more upward pressure, complicating matters for the Swiss National Bank. The report also pointed to gold's 22% gain so far in 2026, strength in silver, and potential demand for U.S. Treasuries as yields have drifted lower in recent weeks.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Bitcoin has not behaved like a shelter asset in the latest shock, falling 2% on Saturday and dropping more than 25% over the past two months, Reuters said. Vantage Point Asset Management CIO <strong>Nick Ferres</strong> said, \"Energy is still inexpensive. That's the obvious sector that rallies on Monday. And gold.\"</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Middle East trading when exchanges reopen will offer an early read on risk appetite, with Saudi Arabia and Qatar among the first markets to react.
