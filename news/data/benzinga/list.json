            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-gfrmXj kPLDLR\"><!--$?--><template id=\"B:2\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Not surprisingly, several Wall Street analysts downgraded DUOL stock. Even experts who maintained optimism lowered their price forecasts. Still, the one group that apparently doesn't share in the pessimism is the smart money.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:3\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Essentially, the volatility skew is a visual representation of the surface-area distortion of volatility space, enabling retail traders to better understand how the smart money is positioned for risk. The skew is a lot like a soccer team's starting formation.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">In the case of DUOL stock, the formation is an aggressive 3-4-3, with an extra forward up front. This setup makes sense for two reasons. First, DUOL obviously suffered a sharp pullback so a reflexive move could more easily send shares in the opposite direction (as in up). Second, the stock features <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/DUOL/short-interest\" target=\"_blank\">extremely elevated short interest</a> at 24.4% of its float.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">With so much pressure on the bearish side, any optimistic development could send DUOL stock rocketing higher.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-jHrKIi gTZsSs\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Establishing The Trading Parameters Of DUOL Stock</h2><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:4\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">This set of trading parameters comes from the Black-Scholes model's assumption that stock market returns are lognormally distributed. By plugging in IV and days to expiration, the model spits out a perfectly symmetrical pricing envelope. Half of the outcomes will be between the spot price and 21.21% up, while the other half will be between the spot and 21.21% down.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">So, the million-dollar question: where is Duolingo stock likely to land?</p><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:5\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">It's here that many traders rely on fundamental or technical analysis. However, these methodologies are interpretive and rely on individual skill (if not outright luck). A more disciplined approach is to use higher-order Markov chains — basically the language of probabilistic transitions — to narrow the probability space.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Whittling Down The Dispersion Of Duolingo Stock</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Under Markov, the future state of a system depends solely on the current state. To extend the soccer analogy from earlier, the chance of scoring depends on key influencing factors, such as ball location and defensive readiness (or lack thereof).</p><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:6\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:7\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Basically, the proposition is that we can study past analogs of the 1-4-D sequence and through a combination of enumerative induction and Bayesian-inspired inference calculate forward what the next five weeks may look like. To be transparent, such a methodology presupposes that the future will resemble past observations, which is not necessarily true.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">However, because the future is unknowable until it happens, Markovian induction is arguably the best tool we have.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">If you accept the premise, we can calculate a forward five-week distribution landing between $96 and $114, with probability density peaking near $107. Given this data, I'm tempted by the 100/110 bull call spread expiring April 17. If DUOL stock rises through the $110 strike at expiration, the maximum payout would be 100%. Breakeven lands at $105.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Ultimately, you have three elements at play here. Besides the compelling quant signal, options traders are prioritizing upside convexity. Finally, heightened short interest makes an upside blow-off move a non-trivial possibility.</p><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:8\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"bz-optimizely-campaign bz-optimizely-campaign-bottom-50946908\" data-nosnippet=\"true\"></div><!--/$--></div></div>",
