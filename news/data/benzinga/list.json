            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-fxwyg khStwV\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>The Clorox Company</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/CLX\" target=\"_blank\">CLX</a>) will release earnings results for the first quarter after the closing <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/CLX/earnings\" target=\"_blank\">bell on Monday, Nov. 3</a>.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Analysts expect the company to report quarterly earnings at 78 cents per share, down from $1.86 per share in the year-ago period. The consensus estimate for Clorox's quarterly revenue is $1.4 billion, compared to $1.76 billion a year earlier, according to data from <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">On Oct. 10, JP Morgan analyst Andrea Teixeira maintained a Neutral rating on Clorox and lowered the price target from $135 to $127.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">With the recent buzz around Clorox, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Clorox offers an annual dividend yield of 4.41%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of $1.24 per share ($4.96 a year).  </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-SfCGz ciVbir\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $136,077 or around 1,210 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $27,215 or around 242 shares.</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>To calculate: </strong>Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($3.64 in this case). So, $6,000 / $4.96 = 1,210 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $4.96 = 242 shares ($100 per month).</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>How that works:</strong> The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>CLX Price Action:</strong> Shares of Clorox rose 1.6% to close at $112.46 on Thursday.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><div><div><div class=\"bz-campaign bz-campaign-bottom-48555721\" data-nosnippet=\"true\"><div class=\"sc-c014f608-0 kUPEDz skeleton min-h-[inherit] animate-pulse variant\" role=\"status\"><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div></div><div class=\"flex sm:hidden flex-col\"><div class=\"sc-c014f608-0 kUPEDz skeleton min-h-[inherit] animate-pulse variant\" role=\"status\"><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div></div></div></div></div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/analyst-color/25/10/48524289/jim-cramer-likes-toast-but-isnt-buying-shares-yet\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Cramer Likes Toast, But Isn’t Buying Shares—Yet</a></strong></li>\n</ul><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p><!--/$--></div></div>",
