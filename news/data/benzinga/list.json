If it jumps in value, they could wipe out the mortgage faster.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Security First, Speculation Later</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The hosts warned about what can happen when risk tolerance shifts.

Eliminate existential risks first–the house, the cars, the basics.

After that, if he wants to buy crypto with a set amount, go for it.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“Nobody calls in saying, ‘Oh my gosh, worst decision of our life. We are deeply in debt,'” Kamel said of people who paid off their homes. “They’re debt-free.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For couples who want growth without extreme swings, there are other options. <a href=\"https://benzingapartners.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=705&amp;aff_id=1\" target=\"_blank\">Motley Fool Asset Management's</a> newest factor ETF offerings are the focus for investors looking for balance. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Each passive ETF offers a growth-oriented alternative to broad index funds, allowing investors to diversify their portfolio based on their investment goals. The funds are composed of U.S. companies vetted and rated by analysts.
