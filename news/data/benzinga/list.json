            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-gfrmXj kPLDLR\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">A now-38-year-old professional says they still “genuinely cringe” when thinking about a decision they made at 28. After landing their first job with benefits, they were excited to start contributing to their company's 401(k), which offered a 5% employer match.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">But after mentioning it at a family dinner, their father warned that the market was “overvalued” and a crash was coming. Their mother agreed. Trusting their parents' confidence, they enrolled in the plan but set their contribution to just 1%, planning to increase it after the crash.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Don't Miss:</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/rad-intel-nasdaq\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share</strong></a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/paladin-power-storage\" target=\"_blank\">This Energy Storage Company Already Has $185M in Contracts—Shares Are Still Available</a></strong></li>\n</ul><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Waiting For The Perfect Moment</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">That crash didn’t come for another three years. And when the market finally dipped, fear took over.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-jHrKIi gTZsSs\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“The crash my dad predicted did not come for another three years,” they wrote on Reddit’s <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1r8wh11/i_let_my_parents_convince_me_to_skip_my_companys/\" target=\"_blank\">r/personalfinance</a> recently. “And when it did come, I panicked and dropped to 0% contribution for about six months because dad said to wait for the bottom.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">By the time they began contributing properly at 31, they had missed three full years of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/Opinion/26/02/50520404/your-retirement-savings-roadmap-the-right-order-for-every-dollar\" target=\"_blank\">employer matching</a> and years of potential compound growth. After running the numbers recently, they estimate the lost opportunity cost between $40,000 and $55,000. “I will never forgive myself for this,” they said.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“Financial advice from people who love you and sound confident is still just a guess,” they wrote. “And the cost of a bad guess at 28 is something you're paying at 38.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Many commenters pointed out that skipping the employer match was the biggest mistake. A 5% match is essentially free money. Even if someone fears a downturn, they can often contribute to a 401(k) and choose more conservative options inside the account, such as cash or bond funds.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Trending: Before the IPO: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/elf-labs-ip\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>How One Company Quietly Locked Up 500+ Iconic Character Rights</strong></a></strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Others repeated a phrase that often comes up in investing discussions: “Time in the market <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/topics/25/12/49263177/a-beginner-investor-asks-if-its-safe-to-invest-right-now-when-peter-schiff-and-michael-burry-think-well-have-a-stock-market-crash-in-2026\" target=\"_blank\">beats timing the market</a>.” Trying to wait for the perfect entry point often results in sitting on the sidelines while the market continues to move.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lessons About Fear And Influence</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The thread also turned into a broader conversation about how strongly parents can influence financial decisions.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">One commenter remarked that at 28, many people still place a lot of trust in their parents' opinions. They added that confidence is not the same as expertise.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Several people shared their own costly lessons, from <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/25/03/44079509/preparing-for-worse-doesnt-mean-dumping-stocks-investing-wisdom-from-market-guru-sam-ro\" target=\"_blank\">pulling money out</a> during the 2008 financial crisis to leaving retirement contributions uninvested for years. The consensus was that most long-term investors have a painful money mistake somewhere in their past.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The original poster said they have now set their contributions to automatically capture the full match and are focused on “boring consistency.” They added they are “refusing to play prophet ever again.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For people who feel unsure about investing, especially if they didn’t grow up with strong financial guidance, experts suggest getting advice from someone qualified. <a href=\"https://benzingapartners.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=731&amp;aff_id=1\" target=\"_blank\">Money Pickle</a> helps connect you with vetted fiduciary financial advisors, meaning the advisor is legally required to put the client's interests first. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Through a quick online quiz, you can schedule a free, no-obligation strategy session to talk about retirement planning, investing, taxes or simply getting organized.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">At 38, the OP still regrets the missed years.
