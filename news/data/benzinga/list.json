Its formula isn’t very complicated, as Nvidia’s graphics chips power everything from OpenAI’s ChatGPT to Tesla’s full self-driving algorithms.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Yet change is stirring as Wall Street begins to question whether Nvidia’s best days are already priced into the mix. In fact, there’s a strong case to be made that investors are quietly rotating toward the next wave of AI beneficiaries, especially companies that are turning AI into recurring revenue rather than capital-intensive hardware sales.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>How to Trade November's Post-Cut Volatility</em></h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em>Markets are moving fast after the Fed's latest rate cut.

Join Matt Maley live on <strong>Wednesday, November 5 at 6 PM ET</strong> to see how he's positioning now, the signals he's watching, and the strategy he's using to capture the next major move in this volatile market. <a href=\"https://events2.benzinga.com/registration-matt-maley-webinar-wed-nov5-2025/?utm_campaign=110525-webinar&amp;utm_adType=sponsorad&amp;utm_ad=RD110325\" target=\"_blank\">Join the Free Session</a></em></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“The ‘AI trade’ has moved from narrative to fundamentals,” said Dylan Dewdney, co-founder at Kuvi AI, a Toronto-based fintech firm. “Nvidia’s margins and scale are priced for perfection, yet global demand for compute remains exponential. The smarter play is in companies building agentic frameworks, which help you utilize agents for optimized, niche functions, like portfolio management.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-fzzUx jSgJNL\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“The next AI winners won’t be chipmakers, they’ll be integration architects. Nvidia’s CUDA moat, Microsoft’s OpenAI lock-in, and Google’s Gemini stack are all versions of the same truth,” Dewdney noted. “Whoever controls the orchestration layer between compute, models, and users, wins.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Dewdney said the first AI wave was compute and the second wave will be coordination. “As gross margins plateau, investors will rotate toward AI infrastructure that compounds productivity, capital allocators, not capital burners.” </p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">These Companies Stand Out As Future AI Winners</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Who best fits the shifting AI landscape? Wall Street experts give these stocks a nod.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>AMD </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/AMD\" target=\"_blank\">AMD</a>)</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Even as an AI underdog, AMD is quietly positioning itself for the “AI efficiency” phase. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“The MI300’s 2x performance-per-watt edge matters as inference workloads become the bottleneck, not training. 2026 could be AMD’s inflection point if they keep winning cloud share,” Dewdney said. “It’s the classic efficiency versus dominance dynamic.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">At Boston-based VistaShares, CEO Adam Patti said he’s “very bullish” on AMD’s outlook, as it’s the fourth-largest holding in the firm’s <strong>AI Infrastructure ETF </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/AIS\" target=\"_blank\">AIS</a>).<em> </em></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“They have a talented management team, significant industry support, and innovative new products on the horizon that will make them a significant player across the spectrum of AI development, but particularly within the inference segment of the market, which is expanding exponentially,” he noted.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Microsoft </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/MSFT\" target=\"_blank\">MSFT</a>)</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Microsoft’s AI integrations across Azure, Copilot, and Office 365 are now monetizing faster than expected, contributing an estimated $10 billion in incremental revenue in FY2025. Meanwhile, investors are re-rating AI providers that can turn inference into recurring profits.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“MSFT is a powerful company with a massive installed base of customers,” Patti said. “However, I wouldn’t view them as a ‘picks and shovels’ play. As a hyperscaler, MSFT is focused now on making the massive infrastructure investments required to build far larger compute capabilities so that one day they can create applications powerful enough to provide significant value to their consumers and generate meaningful profits from these new tools.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Patti said he views MSFT’s recent integrations as “baby steps” towards a far larger AI-centered future, but they have “certainly had success in these early days.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Taiwan Semiconductor </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/TSM\" target=\"_blank\">TSM</a>)</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Patti is also a fan of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“TSM manufactures chips for NVDA, AMD, AAPL, among others,” he said. “Without their capabilities and technology, the AI buildout would be difficult to execute. Fortunately, they have moved some manufacturing to the United States, which alleviates a bit of the geopolitical risk embedded in their business model.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Next Phase</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The stock market’s next AI winners may not be the fastest chip sector giant, but the most efficient, and of the three picks listed above, Microsoft and AMD may be the best positioned.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“MSFT is one of the largest investors in AI Infrastructure, so certainly they will be one of the largest beneficiaries of the eventual success of AI-driven software and services,” Patti said. “However, we have a way to go to realize that business model as highly profitable.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For now, Microsoft is more of a CAPEX provider with the promise of profits down the road. “AMD, however, is a potential winner in the next phase of AI development,” he added. “As inference takes center stage, AMD should be one of the primary beneficiaries.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em>Editorial content from our expert contributors is intended to be information for the general public and not individualized investment advice.
