The firm also announced the establishment of a new subsidiary, <strong>Avenir Minerals</strong>, to consolidate its investments in critical minerals.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Third-quarter net income rose to $1.06 billion, or $2.10 per share. Meanwhile, the miner generated $1.82 billion in operating cash flow and $1.19 billion in free cash flow, benefiting from strong production and higher gold prices.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">\"We delivered another quarter of strong and consistent operational performance, which translated into record financial results as higher gold prices continue to drive expanded margins,\" <a href=\"https://www.agnicoeagle.com/English/news-and-media/news-releases/news-details/2025/AGNICO-EAGLE-REPORTS-THIRD-QUARTER-2025-RESULTS---RECORD-ADJUSTED-NET-INCOME-WITH-ANOTHER-QUARTER-OF-STRONG-PRODUCTION-FINANCIAL-POSITION-FURTHER-STRENGTHENED-BY-REPAYMENT-OF-LONG-TERM-DEBT-AND-CASH-ACCUMULATION/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> <strong>Ammar Al-Joundi</strong>, President and CEO.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">\"We are well on track to meet our full-year production and cost guidance, supported by disciplined cost management and a focus on productivity,\" he added.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Low Costs, High Prices, Strong Balance Sheet</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Meadowbank</strong> and <strong>LaRonde</strong> mines led the quarterly production, which totaled 866,936 ounces (oz). Cash costs were $994/oz, and all-in sustaining costs were $1,373/oz. The average realized gold price of $3,476/oz far exceeded the $2,500 guidance.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-SfCGz ciVbir\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Agnico reaffirmed its 2025 production target of 3.3–3.5 million ounces, with costs expected toward the upper end of the range due to higher royalty-linked expenses. The management expects capital spending for the year to be between $1.75 billion and $1.95 billion, excluding around $290–$310 million in capitalized exploration costs.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The miner strengthened its balance sheet, raising its cash position to $2.36 billion while reducing long-term debt to $196 million, resulting in a net cash position of $ 2.16 billion. Furthermore, the board declared a quarterly dividend of 40 cents and repurchased over one million shares for $150 million, highlighting management's commitment to shareholder returns.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pipeline Advances And New Subsidiary</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Operationally, Agnico continued advancing its growth pipeline. Development progressed at <strong>Canadian Malartic</strong>, <strong>Detour Lake</strong>, <strong>Upper Beaver</strong>, and <strong>Hope Bay</strong>. The exploration work continues on schedule, with promising results – particularly at Hope Bay, with intercepts as high as 16.9g/t gold over 4.6 meters and 12.7g/t gold over 9.3 meters. Furthermore, engineering work at <strong>San Nicolas</strong> in Mexico reached nearly 30% completion.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The standout announcement, however, was the creation of Avenir Minerals. This wholly owned subsidiary will house Agnico's non-core investments in critical minerals.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Avenir will consolidate a portfolio currently valued at approximately $80 million, which includes the company's stakes in <strong>Canada Nickel Company</strong> (OTC:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/CNIKF\" target=\"_blank\">CNIKF</a>) <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/movers/25/10/48434470/americas-only-antimony-mine-just-got-a-255-million-boost-from-big-investors\" target=\"_blank\">and</a> <strong>Perpetua Resources Corp. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/PPTA\" target=\"_blank\">PPTA</a>)<strong>. </strong>It will also receive a seed $50 million in cash.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">\"For the last three years, we've had a small team looking at opportunities on the critical metals side,\" Al-Joundi said during the earnings call. \"With everything that we have going on and our continued focus on gold, we felt now was the time to let that group have more independence and look at opportunities on their own,\" he noted.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">He clarified that while Agnico will maintain a right of first refusal on new projects, Avenir will be self-sustaining.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">\"We want to remain a gold company, but our approach—consistent with our philosophy of disciplined capital allocation—is that it should be based on knowledge,\" he concluded.<br/></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div><div><div class=\"bz-campaign bz-campaign-bottom-48554560\" data-nosnippet=\"true\"><div class=\"sc-c014f608-0 kUPEDz skeleton min-h-[inherit] animate-pulse variant\" role=\"status\"><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div></div><div class=\"flex sm:hidden flex-col\"><div class=\"sc-c014f608-0 kUPEDz skeleton min-h-[inherit] animate-pulse variant\" role=\"status\"><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div><div class=\"skeleton-child\"></div></div></div></div></div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/commodities/25/10/48521387/copper-hits-new-highs-trade-deal-hopes-shift-concerns-to-supply-issues\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Copper Hits New Highs, Trade Deal Hopes Shift Concerns To Supply Issues</em></strong></a></li>\n</ul><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em>Photo via Shutterstock</em></p><!--/$--></div></div>",
