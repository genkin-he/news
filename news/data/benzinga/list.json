The company posted a quarterly loss of 33 cents per share, wider than the 17-cent loss analysts expected.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Operationally, Caesars reported same-store adjusted EBITDA of $901 million, up from $882 million in the comparable period. That improvement matters in buyout math because it points to cash generation even before any deal-related changes.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Record Digital Profits Fuel Acquisition Talks</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">One of the biggest talking points from the quarter was Caesars Digital, which delivered record adjusted EBITDA of $85 million, compared with $20 million in the prior-year quarter. CEO <strong>Tom Reeg</strong> tied the year-over-year same-store adjusted EBITDA gain to that digital performance, while also citing stable regional results and better trends in Las Vegas.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Those same results help explain why Caesars could draw interest from strategic operators as well as financial sponsors.
