            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-fxwyg khStwV\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">When you're earning a paycheck, it's easy to gauge how you stack up. Salary charts tell you exactly where you <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/24/07/40021172/what-income-makes-you-upper-class-heres-what-you-need-to-rank-among-the-top-20\" target=\"_blank\">fall on the income ladder</a>. But retirement rewrites the math. Without annual earnings, the question shifts from how much you make to how much you've built. And that's where things get tricky — especially for retirees trying to figure out whether they're \"upper-middle class\" or actually \"wealthy.\"</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">To find that line, the most reliable place to start is with data, not vibes. The <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/cps-hinc/hinc-05.html\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Census Bureau</a> divides American households into quintiles — five equal groups, each representing 20% of households ranked by income. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Don't Miss:</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — <a href=\"https://benzingapartners.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=531&amp;aff_id=1\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.</strong></a></strong></li>\n<li><strong>Missed Nvidia and Tesla?

Using this structure, the middle 20%, roughly the 40th to 60th percentiles, is the \"middle class.\" The next 20%, between the 60th and 80th percentiles, is the \"upper-middle class.\" Above that — the 80th percentile and higher — you've entered <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/25/05/45234639/are-you-upper-class-heres-the-net-worth-you-need-in-your-50s\" target=\"_blank\">upper-class territory</a>.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-gQfuga iaHpuj\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For retirees, income only tells half the story. The more revealing measure is net worth, and for that, the go-to sources are the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances</a> and the <a href=\"https://dqydj.com/net-worth-by-age-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">DQYDJ Net Worth Calculator</a>, which translates that survey data into percentile rankings by age. It's the most current snapshot we have until the Fed releases new data in 2026.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Among households aged 65 to 69, entering the upper-middle class means having a net worth around $550,000, while those aged 70 to 74 hit that mark closer to $700,000. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Trending: Accredited Investors Can Now Tap Into the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/homeshares-y2\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>$36 Trillion Home Equity Market — Without Buying a Single Property</strong></a></strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Crossing into the upper class starts near $1.5 million at ages 65–69 and about $1.65 million for 70–74. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">And if you're wondering where \"wealthy\" truly begins, the top 5% of retirees — roughly the 95th percentile — starts around $7 million in net worth for both age groups. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">These numbers include more than just investments. They factor in primary home equity, which can be a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/24/08/40610715/do-you-know-how-much-wealthier-homeowners-are-than-renters-spoiler-its-about-40x-more\" target=\"_blank\">major driver of wealth for older Americans</a>. Many retirees own their homes outright, and with decades of appreciation baked in, real estate often explains the leap between upper-middle and upper-class net worth. A paid-off home in a high-demand area can push an otherwise modest portfolio into seven-figure territory.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The difference between owning and renting is huge. <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf23.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">According to the SCF</a>, the typical U.S. homeowner has a median net worth of $396,200, compared with just $10,400 for the average renter. In other words, homeowners held nearly 38 times more wealth, showing how much long-term homeownership can shape financial stability in retirement.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Still, wealth on paper doesn't always equal comfort in practice. Lifestyle, debt levels, and spending habits play a huge role in how \"rich\" retirement feels. A retiree with a paid-off home, low expenses, and steady income from Social Security and investments can live just as well — or better — than someone with double the net worth but higher costs and obligations. Comparison may be the thief of joy, but context is its antidote.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">So before chasing an arbitrary number, focus on what actually matters. Keep debt low, protect your savings, budget realistically, and give your money room to grow. A solid financial plan can stretch far beyond the percentile charts. And if you're unsure where you stand, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/smartasset\" target=\"_blank\">consult a financial advisor who can tailor strategies to your goals</a> — not just your percentile. Because in retirement, wealth isn't just about how much you have. It's about how well it works for you.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em><strong>Image: Shutterstock</strong></em></p><!--/$--></div></div>",
