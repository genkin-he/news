            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-gfrmXj kPLDLR\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>George Noble</strong>, a hedge fund manager and former assistant to legendary <strong>Fidelity</strong> investor <strong>Peter Lynch</strong>, is sounding the alarm on<strong> OpenAI</strong>‘s blockbuster $110 billion fundraise — calling the deal structure “borderline criminal” and warning it “can’t end well.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Noble posted his analysis on X on Friday, shortly after OpenAI CEO <strong>Sam Altma</strong>n announced the raise from <strong>Amazon.com Inc.</strong> <a class=\"ticker-link\" data-exchange=\"NASDAQ\" data-ticker=\"AMZN\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/AMZN\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(NASDAQ:</a><a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/AMZN\" target=\"_blank\">AMZN</a>)<!-- -->, <strong>Nvidia Corp.</strong> <a class=\"ticker-link\" data-exchange=\"NASDAQ\" data-ticker=\"NVDA\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/NVDA\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(NASDAQ:</a><a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/NVDA\" target=\"_blank\">NVDA</a>)<!-- --> and <strong>SoftBank Group Corp.</strong> <a class=\"ticker-link\" data-exchange=\"OTC\" data-ticker=\"SFTBY\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/SFTBY\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(OTC:</a><a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/SFTBY\" target=\"_blank\">SFTBY</a>)<!-- -->.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Numbers Behind the Warning</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Noble didn’t mince words on the financials. “OpenAI burned $8 billion in 2025. They project burning $17 billion in 2026. $35 billion in 2027. $47 billion in 2028,” he wrote, adding that cumulative losses before any projected path to profitability exceed $115 billion. </p><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:2\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-jHrKIi gTZsSs\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Circular Financing, Not Arm’s-Length Investment</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Noble’s sharpest critique targets what he calls vendor financing disguised as venture capital. “Amazon invests $50 billion in OpenAI. OpenAI commits to spending $100 billion on Amazon Web Services. Nvidia invests $30 billion. OpenAI commits to buying 3 gigawatts of Nvidia compute,” he wrote. “Amazon and Nvidia are essentially paying OpenAI to buy their own products.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Amazon’s $50 billion commitment includes an initial $15 billion outlay, with the remaining $35 billion in the coming months when certain <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/26/02/50927167/amazon-bets-50-billion-on-openai-in-landmark-ai-partnership\" target=\"_blank\">conditions are met</a>. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lynch Protégé Draws Historical Parallels</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Noble, drawing on four and a half decades of market experience, placed the OpenAI raise alongside the dot-com bubble and the 2008 mortgage machine. “When the biggest players start financing each other’s growth through circular investment structures, you’re not witnessing a revolution… You’re watching the LAST PHASE of a credit cycle,” he wrote. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">He also cited<strong> J.P. Morgan</strong>‘s estimate that the AI industry needs $650 billion in annual revenue just to generate a 10% return on total infrastructure buildout — against an industry currently generating a fraction of that.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Noble closed with a pointed question: “At what price does this actually make sense?
