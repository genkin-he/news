They also said a longer fight that constrains supply could support the dollar against most peers, while the yen and Swiss franc could hold up better, reports the outlet. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Khamenei's tenure was marked by repeated crackdowns on dissent, including mass unrest in 2009 and in 2022 after <strong>Mahsa Amini</strong> died in custody, according to Fox News.
