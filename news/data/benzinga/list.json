A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily.

While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-gQfuga iaHpuj\"></div><!--/$--></div></div>",
