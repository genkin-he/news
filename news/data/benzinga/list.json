            "description": "<div><div class=\"sc-gfrmXj kPLDLR\"><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/etfs\" target=\"_blank\">Options-based ETFs</a>, especially those that offer a covered call strategy, are gaining traction in 2026, especially for investors looking to generate income in a volatile market environment.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The biggest player in this space is the <strong>JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF</strong> <a class=\"ticker-link\" data-exchange=\"ARCA\" data-ticker=\"JEPI\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/JEPI\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(NYSE:</a><a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/JEPI\" target=\"_blank\">JEPI</a>)<!-- -->, which has an AUM of about $44.5 billion and offers a 30-day SEC yield of 8.13%. This ETF offers a hybrid model of investing in defensive stocks and investing 15% of the assets in equity-linked notes that mimic out-of-the-money covered call writing on the<strong> S&amp;P 500 Index</strong>. This provides upside and income generation through steady income flows. This year so far, $1.43 billion has flowed into the fund, according to <em>Etf Db</em>.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$?--><template id=\"B:2\"></template><div></div><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Income Vs. Upside</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">These funds generate cash flow by selling call options on equity holdings, collecting premiums that are distributed among shareholders. The trade-off is obvious: upside participation is capped during market rallies. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-jHrKIi gTZsSs\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">These funds offer high income, downside risk reduction, and the potential to outperform in a sideways market where option premiums remain high and capital gains are harder to capture. But they underperform in a strong bull market if not capped. Investors should also be mindful of the type of strategy used, holdings, expense ratios, and taxes before investing. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For investors prioritizing monthly income, the steady distribution stream can outweigh the opportunity cost of limited upside. So the fact that 2026 is turning out to be good for the funds so far might suggest the investor mood is conservative.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">With billions invested in covered call ETFs, these funds are moving from being tactical yield vehicles to being core portfolio income solutions, especially attractive to retirees who want to receive regular income without sacrificing equities entirely.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">However, its success is also tied to volatility conditions and investor expectations. As a result, should a bull market persist for an extended period, <strong>traditional index-based ETFs</strong> may prove to be more effective. But in an atmosphere of rate uncertainty and episodic volatility, investor demand for yield-enhanced equity investments shows few signs of fading.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><em>Photo: bigjom jom via Shutterstock</em></p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><br/></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"bz-optimizely-campaign bz-optimizely-campaign-bottom-50945316\" data-nosnippet=\"true\"></div><!--/$--></div></div>",
