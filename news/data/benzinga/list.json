The <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/cps-hinc/hinc-05.html\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Census Bureau</a> divides American households into quintiles — five equal groups, each representing 20% of households ranked by income. </p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Don't Miss:</strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — <a href=\"https://benzingapartners.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=531&amp;aff_id=1\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.</strong></a></strong></li>\n<li><strong>Missed Nvidia and Tesla?

Using this structure, the middle 20%, roughly the 40th to 60th percentiles, is the \"middle class.\" The next 20%, between the 60th and 80th percentiles, is the \"upper-middle class.\" Above that — the 80th percentile and higher — you've entered <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/25/05/45234639/are-you-upper-class-heres-the-net-worth-you-need-in-your-50s\" target=\"_blank\">upper-class territory</a>.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"sc-gQfuga iaHpuj\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">For retirees, income only tells half the story. The more revealing measure is net worth, and for that, the go-to sources are the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances</a> and the <a href=\"https://dqydj.com/net-worth-by-age-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\">DQYDJ Net Worth Calculator</a>, which translates that survey data into percentile rankings by age.

They factor in primary home equity, which can be a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/24/08/40610715/do-you-know-how-much-wealthier-homeowners-are-than-renters-spoiler-its-about-40x-more\" target=\"_blank\">major driver of wealth for older Americans</a>.

A paid-off home in a high-demand area can push an otherwise modest portfolio into seven-figure territory.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The difference between owning and renting is huge. <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf23.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">According to the SCF</a>, the typical U.S. homeowner has a median net worth of $396,200, compared with just $10,400 for the average renter. In other words, homeowners held nearly 38 times more wealth, showing how much long-term homeownership can shape financial stability in retirement.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Still, wealth on paper doesn't always equal comfort in practice. Lifestyle, debt levels, and spending habits play a huge role in how \"rich\" retirement feels. A retiree with a paid-off home, low expenses, and steady income from Social Security and investments can live just as well — or better — than someone with double the net worth but higher costs and obligations. Comparison may be the thief of joy, but context is its antidote.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">So before chasing an arbitrary number, focus on what actually matters. Keep debt low, protect your savings, budget realistically, and give your money room to grow. A solid financial plan can stretch far beyond the percentile charts. And if you're unsure where you stand, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/smartasset\" target=\"_blank\">consult a financial advisor who can tailor strategies to your goals</a> — not just your percentile. Because in retirement, wealth isn't just about how much you have.

As a result, their balances were always reported as zero.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Credit card issuers report balances to the credit bureaus on the statement closing date, not the due date. By paying off everything early, the person unintentionally erased any evidence of credit usage, making them look inactive in the eyes of lenders.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">One top commenter summarized it clearly: “You don’t need to ‘carry’ a balance to show usage. All you need to do is pay your statement balances in full monthly as opposed to paying your card to $0 before statement generation. That’s where OP went wrong.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"nativo-placement-in-content-ap\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong>Trending: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/lightstone-y2\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen</strong></a></strong></p><!--/$--><!--$--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Paying Early Can Backfire</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Another contributor added, “You should not be paying off your balance before your statement closing dates. That’s not how credit cards are designed to be paid. Treat them just like a utility bill. Once you receive your statement, THEN pay the statement balance off by the due date.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><div class=\"min-w-[300px] w-[300px] min-h-[250px] raptive-ad-placement mx-auto overflow-hidden min-w-[300px]\"></div><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Many in the thread agreed that letting a small balance post each month before paying it off is a better way to show responsible usage without accruing interest. One suggested, “Let 5-10% report then pay it off after the statement. Should fix the problem pretty quick.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">OP acknowledged the oversight: “I don't like to see a big number, but it's my fault.

No Loan</h2><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">Some also pointed out that lenders may get suspicious when someone applies for a personal loan but has zero visible debt.</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">“They are questioning why you need a ‘personal loan’ when you have no debt,” said one former loan officer. “Without any debt, most banks will flag a generic loan,” another person said. “If OP allowed their credit card balances to report organically, the lender would have seen ‘debt’ and wouldn’t have denied them.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The thread also warned against opening more accounts or taking loans just to build credit. “You don’t need another card now,” wrote one commenter. “Allow your accounts to age. You also shouldn’t take on loans just for the sake of taking on loans. You’re currently throwing away money on interest on a loan that you didn’t need.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\">The original poster now plans to change their approach: “That's why I am going to carry some debt now and pay it off. I think they also don't see my debt management. It's always 0. But if I have debt every month and pay it off, that should work.”</p><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$--><p class=\"block core-block\"><strong><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></strong></p><!--/$--></div></div>",
