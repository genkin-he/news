<p>Shanghai-based tech firm KEENON Robotics, established in 2010, has evolved over the past 15 years from an experimental research company into a professional enterprise focused on the development and application of service robots. During this period, KEENON Robotics has overcome several key challenges in robotics technology and applied its products across various industries, including dining, hospitality, healthcare, and manufacturing, gradually establishing itself as a major player in the service robotics sector.</p>



<p><strong>Technological progress through human-centered design</strong></p>



<p>KEENON Robotics&#8217; progress in robotics technology stems from its long-standing commitment to the concept of &#8220;robots serving humans.&#8221; Since 2010, when most companies were still uncertain about the commercialization of robotics, KEENON began focusing on key challenges such as positioning accuracy, environmental perception, and motion control. By introducing SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) technology, KEENON&#8217;s robots attained centimeter-level positioning accuracy in complex environments, improving their performance in real-world applications.</p>

<p><strong>KEENON’s XMAN-F1 adapts to diverse service environments</strong></p>



<p>In July, KEENON launched its latest bipedal humanoid robot, XMAN-F1, marking a shift from specialized robots to general-purpose service robots. Using its advanced VLA (Visual-Language-Action) large model, KOM2.0, the XMAN-F1 can autonomously adapt to various complex scenarios, for which it provides intelligent services to users.</p>



<p>The XMAN-F1 humanoid robot is equipped with 3D vision and voice recognition, allowing it to interpret complex instructions. In hotel scenarios, the robot can prepare a cup of tea at a specified temperature, select the tea type, adjust the water settings, and complete the brewing process without human assistance.</p>



<p>Its dual robotic arms, featuring 7-degree-of-freedom joints and force-feedback sensors, enable precise operations such as opening bottles or folding clothes. Factory tests show that a single arm can handle loads of up to 300 kilograms with a precision margin of less than 0.1 millimeters.</p>



<p>The robot is equipped with a reinforcement learning-based dynamic balance system, which allows it to navigate complex terrains and respond to unexpected collisions. In simulated home environments, it can step over obstacles up to five centimeters high while avoiding items such as pet toys. KEENON has begun pilot deployments of the XMAN-F1 with partners including Shangri-La Hotels and Walmart, targeting applications in hotel services and warehouse logistics.</p>

<p><strong>Specialized robots for diverse environments</strong></p>



<p>In addition to humanoid robots, KEENON offers specialized service robots, including the T Series Dining Robot 4.0, M Series Medical Robot Pro, and H Series Home Service Robot. Designed for dining, healthcare, and home environments, these robots provide tailored solutions. The T Series navigates narrow restaurant aisles, while the M Series integrates UV disinfection, medication delivery, and waste collection.</p>



<p><strong>Hardware, algorithms, and data: a closed-loop ecosystem</strong></p>



<p>KEENON Robotics’ technological innovations extend beyond hardware to include advancements in algorithms and data. Its self-developed KEENON chip boosts computing power while reducing energy consumption, enabling robots to operate efficiently for extended periods. The KOM2.0 large model, trained on massive amounts of scenario data, incorporates few-shot learning capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to new work environments. In addition, KEENON has established a closed-loop ecosystem of hardware, algorithms, and data, ensuring continuous iteration and improvement of its robots.</p>

<p>Taobao Instant Commerce, Alibaba’s quick commerce unit, is set to launch a new retail brand called “Taobao Convenience Store” (our translation), LatePost reported. The stores will operate 24 hours a day and offer around 10,000 SKUs across categories such as groceries, snacks, alcohol, electronics, baby products, and beauty items — roughly triple the selection of a typical convenience store.</p>



<p>Despite the name, Taobao Instant Commerce will not open or control stores directly. Instead, it will authorize qualified merchants to operate under the brand and provide them with traffic, supply chain, and delivery support, while requiring compliance with platform standards such as 24-hour operations and order handling performance. [<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ExzXDlX1CwVEF0cW5H7D_A">LatePost</a>, in Chinese]</p>



<p><em>Update: Taobao Instant Commerce has officially announced the launch of the “Taobao Convenience Store” brand, scheduled to go live on November 1. The first phase will include 34 authorized stores across China, offering 24-hour service and 30-minute delivery through warehouse-style operations.</em></p>

<p>Tencent Games will launch the China server of THE FINALS, a team-based shooter developed by Embark Studios, on November 18. The game centers around two core features: fully destructible environments and a cash-out mode, where players compete to capture vaults and escort cash boxes to cash-out stations while defending against rival teams. THE FINALS offers three distinct character classes — light, medium, and heavy — each with unique abilities and weapon options. The Chinese version will feature exclusive skins and localized content tailored for domestic players. The title first launched globally on December 7, 2023, quickly attracting over 10 million players within its first two weeks.

<p>NVIDIA has reportedly become the sole customer for TSMC’s next-generation A16 process node, with both companies currently conducting joint testing. The A16 process integrates nanosheet transistors and Super Power Rail (SPR) technology, promising a major leap in performance and efficiency. NVIDIA is expected to adopt the A16 process for its upcoming Feynman GPU architecture, scheduled for release in 2028. Apple, TSMC’s long-time key client, has yet to engage in talks regarding the use of the A16 process for its future mobile SoCs. Apple’s absence is surprising for the industry, and it remains unclear whether the company will follow up. [<a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/893/119.htm">IThome</a>, in Chinese]</p>
