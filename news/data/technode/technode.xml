<p>Taobao Instant Commerce, Alibaba’s quick commerce unit, is set to launch a new retail brand called “Taobao Convenience Store” (our translation), LatePost reported. The stores will operate 24 hours a day and offer around 10,000 SKUs across categories such as groceries, snacks, alcohol, electronics, baby products, and beauty items — roughly triple the selection of a typical convenience store.</p>



<p>Despite the name, Taobao Instant Commerce will not open or control stores directly. Instead, it will authorize qualified merchants to operate under the brand and provide them with traffic, supply chain, and delivery support, while requiring compliance with platform standards such as 24-hour operations and order handling performance.

<p>Tencent Games will launch the China server of THE FINALS, a team-based shooter developed by Embark Studios, on November 18. The game centers around two core features: fully destructible environments and a cash-out mode, where players compete to capture vaults and escort cash boxes to cash-out stations while defending against rival teams. THE FINALS offers three distinct character classes — light, medium, and heavy — each with unique abilities and weapon options. The Chinese version will feature exclusive skins and localized content tailored for domestic players. The title first launched globally on December 7, 2023, quickly attracting over 10 million players within its first two weeks.

<p>NVIDIA has reportedly become the sole customer for TSMC’s next-generation A16 process node, with both companies currently conducting joint testing. The A16 process integrates nanosheet transistors and Super Power Rail (SPR) technology, promising a major leap in performance and efficiency. NVIDIA is expected to adopt the A16 process for its upcoming Feynman GPU architecture, scheduled for release in 2028. Apple, TSMC’s long-time key client, has yet to engage in talks regarding the use of the A16 process for its future mobile SoCs. Apple’s absence is surprising for the industry, and it remains unclear whether the company will follow up. [<a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/893/119.htm">IThome</a>, in Chinese]</p>

<p>Today, Sony put the PlayStation 5 Pro (PS5 Pro) on sale in the Chinese mainland market, with a price of RMB 5,599 ($770). First released overseas in November 2024, the PS5 Pro arrived in China nearly 11 months later.</p>



<p>Positioned as a next-gen high-performance console, the new model features major upgrades including enhanced GPU performance, doubled ray tracing capabilities, and a 2TB storage configuration, making it one of the most talked-about gaming products of the year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the high price tag and mixed feedback on real-world performance have sparked heated debate among Chinese gamers—some calling it a “must-buy,” while others dismiss it as an “overpriced upgrade.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="780" height="426" src="https://i0.wp.com/technode.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ps5-pro.png?resize=780%2C426&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-194121" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/technode.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ps5-pro.png?w=1079&amp;ssl=1 1079w, https://i0.wp.com/technode.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ps5-pro.png?resize=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/technode.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ps5-pro.png?resize=768%2C419&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/technode.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ps5-pro.png?resize=1024%2C559&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/technode.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ps5-pro.png?resize=780%2C426&amp;ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/technode.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ps5-pro.png?resize=400%2C218&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/technode.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ps5-pro.png?resize=706%2C385&amp;ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/technode.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ps5-pro.png?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></figure>



<p><strong>4K/60fps becomes standard, AI upscaling raises expectation</strong></p>



<p>The core upgrades of the PS5 Pro focus on graphics performance. According to Sony, the PS5 Pro’s GPU compute units are 67% bigger than the standard PS5, boosting rendering speeds by 45%. Coupled with the new PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) AI upscaling technology, the console can enhance dynamic resolution on 4K TVs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth uses PSSR to boost native 1080p visuals to near-4K clarity while maintaining a stable 60fps. Ray tracing performance has improved by 2–3 times compared with the original PS5, making glass reflections and city lighting in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 look more realistic.</p>



<p>The PS5 Pro comes standard with a 2TB SSD and 18GB of memory (16GB + 2GB system reserved). It also supports Wi-Fi 7, which provides download speeds roughly 30% faster than the standard PS5. The PS5 Pro’s DualSense controller features improved haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, providing more nuanced tactile responses in games such as Astro’s Playroom.</p>

<p><strong>PS5 Pro in China – high price sparks player debate over value</strong></p>



<p>The PS5 Pro Chinese mainland edition is priced at RMB 5,599 ($770), but only comes in a digital version, with the disc drive sold separately for around RMB 569 ($78). Compared with the standard PS5, which can be found on the second-hand market for around RMB 2,400 ($330), the Pro edition’s cost-performance ratio is not high. The price above RMB 5,000 ($688) has deterred many players, who feel it offers less value than buying a second-hand PS5 or waiting for the PS6.</p>



<p>The PS5 Pro does not launch with any exclusive games or special effects; all titles remain compatible with the standard PS5. Many players say the Pro only offers improvements in graphics and frame rates, lacking must-have exclusives, which reduces its appeal for the average user.</p>



<p>Some consider the Pro suitable for players seeking the ultimate visual experience, but others point out that the standard PS5 already meets 4K gaming needs. The benefits of the Pro edition are limited unless used with a high-refresh-rate 4K TV.</p>

<p><strong>Potential early performance and graphics issues</strong></p>



<p>New models may exhibit occasional visual flaws and performance regressions. For instance, according to <a href="https://news.sohu.com/a/829793085_114822">Sohu News</a>, games such as Silent Hill 2 Remake have shown stuttering or screen flickering on the overseas PS5 Pro, while the standard PS5 runs more consistently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) technology is not yet fully optimized, which may lead to noisy visuals or glitches when interacting with global illumination in certain titles. In <a href="https://it.sohu.com/a/824456310_114822">Alan Wake 2</a>, enabling ray tracing on the overseas PS5 Pro causes noticeable frame rate fluctuations, and some scenes may not appear any better than on the original PS5.</p>

<p><strong>Region restrictions and content limitations on the Chinese PS5 Pro</strong></p>



<p>The Chinese mainland version of the PS5 Pro is region-locked. Games can only be purchased and downloaded from the China PS Store, and some international titles may be unavailable. Switching to an overseas account is possible via a system backup method, but the process is complex and requires access to a foreign console.</p>



<p>Games on the Chinese PS5 Pro are subject to content review. Some titles may be altered or censored, particularly those containing violence, blood, or other sensitive material. Additionally, certain popular games may not be released in China.</p>



<p><strong>Balancing technological upgrades with player expectations</strong></p>



<p>The debate around the PS5 Pro highlights new challenges in the console market. As hardware performance approaches its limits, players have become increasingly sensitive to cost-performance ratios.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the growing adoption of high-refresh-rate 4K TVs and the integration of AI technologies, the performance race in the console market is set to continue. Ultimately, success may hinge on which companies can most accurately respond to core player demands.</p>
