<p>Insta360 said the US International Trade Commission has issued a final ruling in a Section 337 patent investigation initiated by GoPro, finding that its products do not infringe the asserted patents. The company said the decision concludes the ITC case and will not affect its imports or sales in the United States.</p>



<p>The ITC reviewed six GoPro patents and found several utility patent claims invalid or not infringed. Although certain previous-generation products were found to fall within the scope of one design patent, the ITC confirmed that Insta360’s revised design does not infringe.</p>



<p>A parallel patent lawsuit filed by GoPro in a California federal court, which was stayed pending the ITC probe, is expected to resume. [TechNode reporting]</p>

<p>Next week, Qwen will unveil its first namesake AI smart glasses at the 2026 Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, Spain. Capabilities currently available in the Qwen app — such as ordering food delivery and hailing rides — will also be integrated into terminal devices including the Qwen AI glasses. According to an Alibaba insider, in addition to the AI glasses, Qwen plans to roll out AI-powered smart rings and AI earbuds later this year, with the products set to be launched in global markets. </p>



<p>An Alibaba staff member said that both the Quark AI glasses and the Qwen AI glasses are supported by the same underlying algorithms as well as the same software and hardware teams. However, future smart glasses models and the global branding strategy will be unified under the Qwen name.

<p><strong>Core </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>echnology: </strong><strong>e</strong><strong>motion </strong><strong>r</strong><strong>ecognition </strong><strong>b</strong><strong>ased on </strong><strong>a</strong><strong>utonomic </strong><strong>n</strong><strong>ervous </strong><strong>s</strong><strong>ignals</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>The core technology of Bi’an Mind lies in its self-developed AI emotion recognition algorithm. The approach is based on the principles of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity. </p>



<p>By collecting physiological signals such as heart rate variability (RRI) and breathing rate, and combining them with the Valence-Arousal model, the algorithm can classify and assess basic emotional states such as anger, sadness, anxiety, and happiness.</p>



<p>Compared with emotion recognition methods that rely on facial expressions or voice features, this approach emphasizes physiological data, which in theory can reduce interference caused by cultural differences or deliberate control of expressions. </p>



<p>It allows for more discreet and continuous monitoring. However, its accuracy, generalizability, and adaptability across different populations still need to be validated in large-scale real-world scenarios.</p>



<p><strong>Product </strong><strong>f</strong><strong>orms — </strong><strong>c</strong><strong>ombining </strong><strong>a</strong><strong>lgorithms and </strong><strong>h</strong><strong>ardware</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>Building on its algorithm capabilities, the company has launched several hardware and system products.&nbsp;The smart emotion watch features an RRI monitoring module that tracks emotional states, stress, and energy levels around the clock to generate visual reports.</p>



<p>It also integrates tools such as mindfulness exercises and psychological assessments, creating a closed loop of monitoring, intervention, and feedback. Key challenges for these products include the long-term stability of emotion data, users’ willingness to consistently engage with their psychological data, and the ability to quantify the effectiveness of interventions.</p>



<p>The emotion screening and early warning system, which targets healthcare institutions, educational organizations, and high-risk industries, offers tools for group-level emotion analysis.&nbsp;It generates metrics such as stress indices and autonomic nervous system balance reports and provides real-time alerts when abnormal fluctuations occur.</p>



<p>In practice, these systems function more as decision-support tools, with their value depending on compliant data collection, privacy safeguards, and the ability of administrators to interpret and act on the insights.</p>

<p><strong>Industry </strong><strong>a</strong><strong>pplications and </strong><strong>i</strong><strong>mplementation </strong><strong>s</strong><strong>cenarios</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>Bi’an Mind has taken its emotion recognition technology into several specialized fields. In early childhood education and general teaching, wearable devices monitor teachers’ emotional fluctuations, which can inform training programs and help optimize job assignments. </p>



<p>For high-risk industries such as nuclear power and mining, the technology tracks workers’ fatigue and stress levels, providing additional data to support safety management decisions.</p>



<p>In healthcare and mental health, the company partners with psychological service platforms to offer long-term data tracking for patients with depression and anxiety, helping clinicians assess treatment outcomes.</p>



<p>Because emotion data is highly sensitive in both healthcare and safety settings, these applications relies on carefully balancing algorithm performance, regulatory compliance, and ethical considerations.</p>



<p><strong>From supportive feature to core human-computer interaction</strong></p>



<p>Looking at broader technology trends, emotion recognition is shifting from a purely supportive function to a central element of human-computer interaction. Bi’an Mind’s approach, which leverages physiological data modeling, highlights this evolution. </p>



<p>The ultimate impact of such systems will depend not only on algorithm accuracy but also on how industries collectively understand the value of emotional data and the limits of its use.</p>

<p>Soaring memory and storage chip prices are likely to push major Chinese smartphone brands to raise handset prices in early March, according to supply chain sources. After bottoming out in the second half of 2024, prices for mobile memory and storage chips have risen for several consecutive quarters, with gains accelerating at the start of 2026, the sources said. Procurement costs for smartphone memory chips are now more than 80% higher than a year earlier and show no signs of easing. </p>



<p>Channel partners and original design manufacturers (ODMs) said leading brands including Oppo, OnePlus, Vivo, Xiaomi, iQOO and Honor are preparing a new round of price adjustments. If implemented, it would mark the industry’s broadest and most significant collective price increase in nearly five years. Frequent fluctuations in memory costs could result in multiple handset price hikes in China within a single year for the first time.

<p>Volkswagen will be the launch customer for XPeng’s second-generation Vision-Language-Action model, CEO He Xiaopeng said Wednesday. He said the model’s upcoming debut could mark a “DeepSeek moment” for intelligent driving. XPeng first introduced the model in November 2025 and defines it as its first mass-produced physical world large model designed to understand and predict real-world scenarios. The company said the system can perform internal reasoning and simulate responses to different driving situations, adding that it increases average driver takeover distance on complex roads by 13 times.

<p>Transsion Holdings on Wednesday reported a sharp decline in its 2025 financial performance, with core profit indicators plummeting. The company&#8217;s annual revenue totaled 65.62 billion yuan ($9.47 billion), a 4.5% year-on-year decrease, while net profit attributable to the parent company fell by 53.43% to 2.58 billion yuan ($374 million). The downturn was primarily driven by increased market competition, rising supply chain costs, and higher expenses related to research and development and market expansion. The company’s stock has also taken a hit, with its market value dropping by more than 60% from its peak, as of Feb. 25. Additionally, Transsion is grappling with ongoing patent infringement lawsuits, adding further uncertainty to its future prospects.

<p>US real-time 3D technology company Unity Software is exploring a potential sale of its China business, targeting a valuation above $1 billion, sources familiar with the matter told <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/capital-markets/unity-software-is-said-to-consider-selling-china-business" type="link" id="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/capital-markets/unity-software-is-said-to-consider-selling-china-business">Bloomberg</a>. The company has hired advisers to approach potential buyers, but discussions are at an early stage and no deal has been reached.</p>



<p>Unity, a major player in game engines, has held a dominant position in China’s game development sector since entering the market in 2012. Popular titles such as Tencent’s Honor of Kings have been developed using Unity’s engine. Its China operations generate annual revenue in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Rising pressures in recent years may have prompted the firm to reconsider its global strategy.</p>

<p>Unity Software shares have dropped more than 60% since the start of 2026, despite Q4 2025 revenue rising sequentially to $503.1 million, according to <a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2026-02-25/doc-inhnyyvu2385486.shtml?utm_source=chatgpt.com" type="link" id="https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2026-02-25/doc-inhnyyvu2385486.shtml?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Sina Finance</a>. The company’s management remains cautious on growth and market conditions.</p>



<p>Its Chinese joint venture, Unity China, has secured investment from Alibaba Group, China Mobile, and ByteDance, among others. Some investors hold share redemption rights if certain conditions are not met, highlighting lingering uncertainty over the venture’s prospects. Analysts say a potential divestment could help Unity mitigate capital pressures and remove a looming liquidity risk.</p>

<p>Last year, Google’s DeepMind released its AI world model, Genie 3, sending ripples through the market. The technology can instantly generate interactive 3D virtual worlds from a single image or text description, and is seen as a disruptive challenge to traditional game engine models.</p>
