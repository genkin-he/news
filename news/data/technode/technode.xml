<p>Tencent’s AI tool Yuanbao issued an apology after a user reported that the system generated offensive language instead of a New Year greeting. A man in Xi’an said he asked Yuanbao to create a festive image on Chinese New Year’s Eve. After multiple attempts to modify the prompt, the AI replaced the intended blessing with the phrase “Your mom [expletive],” leaving the user frustrated.</p>



<p>Tencent confirmed the incident was caused by abnormal outputs during multi-turn interactions and said it had taken immediate steps to correct the problem and improve the user experience. The company apologized to affected users. The incident follows earlier reports in January of Yuanbao producing insulting language when users attempted to modify code using the platform.

<p>Soaring memory and storage chip prices are likely to push major Chinese smartphone brands to raise handset prices in early March, according to supply chain sources. After bottoming out in the second half of 2024, prices for mobile memory and storage chips have risen for several consecutive quarters, with gains accelerating at the start of 2026, the sources said. Procurement costs for smartphone memory chips are now more than 80% higher than a year earlier and show no signs of easing. </p>



<p>Channel partners and original design manufacturers (ODMs) said leading brands including Oppo, OnePlus, Vivo, Xiaomi, iQOO and Honor are preparing a new round of price adjustments. If implemented, it would mark the industry’s broadest and most significant collective price increase in nearly five years. Frequent fluctuations in memory costs could result in multiple handset price hikes in China within a single year for the first time.

<p>Volkswagen will be the launch customer for XPeng’s second-generation Vision-Language-Action model, CEO He Xiaopeng said Wednesday. He said the model’s upcoming debut could mark a “DeepSeek moment” for intelligent driving. XPeng first introduced the model in November 2025 and defines it as its first mass-produced physical world large model designed to understand and predict real-world scenarios. The company said the system can perform internal reasoning and simulate responses to different driving situations, adding that it increases average driver takeover distance on complex roads by 13 times.

<p>Transsion Holdings on Wednesday reported a sharp decline in its 2025 financial performance, with core profit indicators plummeting. The company&#8217;s annual revenue totaled 65.62 billion yuan ($9.47 billion), a 4.5% year-on-year decrease, while net profit attributable to the parent company fell by 53.43% to 2.58 billion yuan ($374 million). The downturn was primarily driven by increased market competition, rising supply chain costs, and higher expenses related to research and development and market expansion. The company’s stock has also taken a hit, with its market value dropping by more than 60% from its peak, as of Feb. 25. Additionally, Transsion is grappling with ongoing patent infringement lawsuits, adding further uncertainty to its future prospects.

<p>US real-time 3D technology company Unity Software is exploring a potential sale of its China business, targeting a valuation above $1 billion, sources familiar with the matter told <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/capital-markets/unity-software-is-said-to-consider-selling-china-business" type="link" id="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/capital-markets/unity-software-is-said-to-consider-selling-china-business">Bloomberg</a>. The company has hired advisers to approach potential buyers, but discussions are at an early stage and no deal has been reached.</p>



<p>Unity, a major player in game engines, has held a dominant position in China’s game development sector since entering the market in 2012. Popular titles such as Tencent’s Honor of Kings have been developed using Unity’s engine. Its China operations generate annual revenue in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Rising pressures in recent years may have prompted the firm to reconsider its global strategy.</p>

<p>Unity Software shares have dropped more than 60% since the start of 2026, despite Q4 2025 revenue rising sequentially to $503.1 million, according to <a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2026-02-25/doc-inhnyyvu2385486.shtml?utm_source=chatgpt.com" type="link" id="https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2026-02-25/doc-inhnyyvu2385486.shtml?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Sina Finance</a>. The company’s management remains cautious on growth and market conditions.</p>



<p>Its Chinese joint venture, Unity China, has secured investment from Alibaba Group, China Mobile, and ByteDance, among others. Some investors hold share redemption rights if certain conditions are not met, highlighting lingering uncertainty over the venture’s prospects. Analysts say a potential divestment could help Unity mitigate capital pressures and remove a looming liquidity risk.</p>

<p>Last year, Google’s DeepMind released its AI world model, Genie 3, sending ripples through the market. The technology can instantly generate interactive 3D virtual worlds from a single image or text description, and is seen as a disruptive challenge to traditional game engine models.</p>



<p>Market participants are concerned that these AI tools may significantly reduce the barriers to game development, which could weaken Unity’s core competitive edge. In response, shares of Unity, along with competitors including Roblox and Ubisoft, declined, dragging down the broader video game sector.</p>



<p>Unity had planned as early as 2022 to spin off its China business, with the goal of giving local teams more autonomy and expanding into non-gaming markets such as smart cities and industrial design. In the same year, it established a joint venture in China with strategic partners.</p>



<p>Now, if the potential sale goes ahead, it could mark Unity’s complete exit from direct operations in China. Unity has not yet commented on the sale.</p>

<p>According to the Global Times, on Feb. 20, DJI filed an appeal with the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, challenging the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) December 23, 2025, decision to place the company and its products on the restricted list. In its petition, DJI stated that the FCC’s action lacked substantial evidence and contained serious procedural and substantive flaws, not only violating the principle of due process but also potentially breaching the US Constitution and relevant federal laws. On Feb. 24, DJI told reporters that the move aims to protect DJI’s legal rights and safeguard the interests of US consumers and the broader agricultural sector who rely on DJI products but are affected by the ban.

<p>Tencent has closed its TiMi Montreal studio, marking another retrenchment in North America as development costs remain high, according to IGN. Founded in 2021 and led by former Assassin’s Creed creative director Ashraf Ismail, the studio was positioned as a AAA open-world, multi-platform game development center. Over its five years of operation, however, it did not release any standalone titles, contributing instead to projects such as Pokémon Unite and Call of Duty: Mobile. </p>



<p>Several former employees confirmed the closure online. Currently, Tencent did not respond to a request for comment. The shutdown may be linked to elevated development costs in North America. Tencent previously closed its Los Angeles-based studio in 2023, according to media reports, as part of broader adjustments to its overseas operations.

<p>The Chinese technology giant’s sales revenue exceeded 880 billion yuan ($122 billion) in 2025, Chairman Liang Hua said on Tuesday, underscoring the company’s focus on strengthening core competitiveness and pursuing high-quality growth. Liang said the company maintained strategic focus during the year and adhered to a quality-first development approach, striving to provide competitive products and services to customers worldwide. He added that overall operations remained stable. In August last year, the company reported first-half 2025 revenue of 427 billion yuan ($59.3 billion), up 3.94% from a year earlier, while net profit fell 32% year-on-year to 37.1 billion yuan ($5.2 billion).
