<p>With transaction volume equivalent to twice the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP), Maybank said in a statement that it is accelerating the pace of financial inclusion and digital connectivity in Malaysia and across ASEAN.</p>
<p>The bank claimed it continues to lead in digital banking, ranking number one in Malaysia in number and amount of transactions across key PayNet services, including DuitNow transfers and QR payments, FPX and JomPAY.</p>
<p>Taufik Albar, Group Chief Executive Officer of Community Financial Services, Maybank, said that digital innovation has always been a cornerstone of Maybank Group’s strategy.</p>
<p>“Over the years, we have continued to transform the MAE App into an integrated financial lifestyle app that addresses our customers evolving needs, and helps them perform everyday transactions in a more seamless, secure and personalized way,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>According to him, since the launch of MAE App, the bank has seen an encouraging growth in digital banking acceptance, highlighting MAE App’s relevance amongst customers. </p>
<p>&#8220;Today, we are proud to serve 10.7 million MAE users, with a 48 percent market share of mobile banking transaction volume in Malaysia, </p>
<p>&#8220;As we continue to enhance the MAE App, our focus remains on shaping the digital banking experience of the future, built around the lives of our customers,” he added.</p>
<p>As the first bank in the country to introduce QR payments in 2017, Maybank said it continues to lead in cashless transformation, empowering individuals and businesses to send and receive payments instantly via Maybank Scan &amp; Pay at zero transaction fee. </p>
<p>The total number of Scan &amp; Pay transactions performed via the MAE App grew 51 times as of August 2025, compared with 2020. </p>
<p>In 2024 alone, Maybank recorded a 26 percent increase in new merchant sign-ups, broadening acceptance to more eateries and retail outlets nationwide.</p>
<p>Giorgio Migliarina, Group Chief Technology and Digital Officer, Maybank said that the MAE App represents Maybank’s vision of creating a smarter, more inclusive digital ecosystem that empowers customers to manage their finances with confidence, convenience and control. </p>
<p>“The MAE App has redefined everyday banking, blending lifestyle and financial features in one app, </p>
<p>&#8220;Empowering Malaysians to take charge of their financial goals, the MAE App has enabled customers to create close to eight million Tabung, strengthening their savings habits and long-term financial planning,&#8221; he noted. </p>
<p>With its ease of use, he highlighted that nine out of 10 MAE Wallet customers actively use it for their day-to-day transactions, with many highlighting its safety and robust security as the reason. </p>
<p>&#8220;This trust motivates us to continuously enhance the MAE App to deliver even more value and protection for our customers,” he added.</p>

<p>Biesse said in a statement on Thursday that the partnership enables the firm to leverage sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), aiming for a 30 percent reduction in carbon emissions associated with their inbound and outbound air freight between Europe and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This translates to projected annual savings of approximately 15 tons in Well-to-Wheel (WTW) CO2e, considering estimated 50 tons emitted in 2024 for Biesse Malaysia.</p>
<p>“Biesse is addressing the climate reality head on and utilising solutions where they can make the most impact,” said Alessio Cadeddu, Chief Financial Officer of Biesse Asia. </p>
<p>“The cross-border nature of supply chains today means there is a pressing need for the decarbonization of air transport. </p>
<p>&#8220;SAF represents an effective and available step in this energy transition. Together with DHL Express, we can<br />
help expand its commercial adoption and improve carbon outcomes across sectors,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Julian Neo, Managing Director of DHL Express Malaysia and Brunei, added SAF is currently one of the most promising means of reducing emissions in air transport, and requires a collaborative effort from the entire ecosystem of partners in the industry to drive progress. </p>
<p>&#8220;We are delighted to welcome Biesse on board our GoGreen Plus offering, as their support contributes to boosting demand, production, and uptake of SAF, </p>
<p>&#8220;This reflects our continued commitment to decarbonize the logistics industry by promoting SAF accessibility and affordability to more businesses,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Launched in 2023, GoGreen Plus products are based on true value chain decarbonization. </p>
<p>SAF is produced from s sustainable feedstocks, such as used cooking oil and other residues. </p>
<p>In neat form and over the lifecycle, it significantly cuts greenhouse gas emissions by around 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel.</p>
<p>GoGreen Plus is part of the DHL Group&#8217;s measures to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. </p>
<p>With around 70 percent of the company&#8217;s carbon footprint coming from its air network, sustainable air transportation solutions are crucial for emission-reduced logistics.</p>

<p>Following the integration, Truth Social will be the first social media platform to offer its users technology to access embedded prediction markets capabilities through CDNA, Crypto.com said in a statement. </p>
<p>According to the statement, Truth Social users will be able to trade prediction contracts related to major events and milestones, such as political elections, interest and inflation rate changes, commodity prices on gold and crude oil, events across all major sports leagues, and more using the new product technology called “Truth Predict”. </p>
<p>Prices will update in real-time, allowing users to react instantly to developments in major current events.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to become the world’s first publicly traded social media platform to offer our users access to prediction markets, </p>
<p>“Truth Predict will allow our loyal users to engage in prediction markets with a trusted network while harnessing our social media platform to provide totally unique ways for users to discuss and compare their predictions,&#8221; said Devin Nunes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Trump Media.</p>
<p>With more than $3 billion in financial assets as of the end of the second quarter, and having posted its first quarter of positive operating cash flow after going public just last year, he said Trump Media is well-positioned to leverage its strong balance sheet and existing social media capabilities to create a new standard for access to prediction market platforms. </p>
<p>&#8220;For too long, global elites have closely controlled these markets &#8211; with Truth Predict, we’re democratizing information and empowering everyday Americans to harness the wisdom of the crowd, turning free speech into actionable foresight,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>It is noted that the event contracts will be offered via CDNA, with the integration providing a federally compliant way to access CDNA event contracts and make predictions on the outcomes of events, including politics, economics, financials, and sports &#8211; all seamlessly woven with technology from Truth Social.</p>
<p>“Prediction markets are poised to be a multi-deca-billion dollar industry, </p>
<p>“Crypto.com has quickly become one of the most trusted providers of prediction market services, and we’re thrilled to combine with Truth Social to support the world’s first prediction markets available from a social media platform. This aligns perfectly with what users look for in social media &#8211; a community to engage with and seek truth,&#8221; said Kris Marszalek, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Crypto.com. </p>
<p>He noted Truth Predict will provide customers with a powerful tool related to market sentiment on an unlimited number of events. </p>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to integrate Truth Social’s truly pioneering social media platform and technology with our industry-leading technology and regulated prediction market trading,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>According to the statement, the integration will begin Beta testing live on Truth Social in the near future, followed by a full launch in the United States. </p>
<p>Subsequently, Trump Media plans to launch the service globally once all the requisite requirements are met.</p>
<p>Truth Social and Truth+ users who have Truth gems, which are earned for interacting on the platforms, will be able to convert their gems into the Cronos (CRO) digital currency and apply them to purchases of Truth Predict contracts.</p>
<p>This initiative between Trump Media and Crypto.com follows the recent establishment of a strategic partnership between the firms to introduce a CRO rewards system on the Truth Social and Truth+ platforms, as well as the announcement to establish Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, Inc., following a definitive agreement for a proposed business combination with Yorkville Acquisition Corp, a special-purpose acquisition company sponsored by Yorkville Acquisition Sponsor LLC, to form a digital asset treasury company focused on the acquisition of CRO.</p>

<p>BNP Paribas’ Securities Services business will serve as the transfer agent, underscoring how tokenization can seamlessly integrate into existing capital markets infrastructure， Marketnode said in a statement on Thursday. </p>
<p>Marketnode’s modular platform, Gateway, will provide the core tokenization architecture, to enable greater efficiency, transparency, and connectivity across the investment value chain. </p>

<p>“This partnership reflects our commitment to innovation and our desire to leverage on technology as we venture into a tokenized future – one that the Singapore financial industry is rapidly embracing,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Luc Renard, Head of Southeast Asia, Securities Services, BNP Paribas, commented as tokenization of money market funds gains attention for their potential growth and reach, financial services have an increasingly important role to drive the next stage of development. </p>
<p>&#8220;To support this, we are proud to put our on-the-ground specialist teams, global operating model, and technology-driven approach in collaboration with Maybank Asset Management Singapore,</p>
<p>&#8220;This mandate emphasizes the importance of staying at the forefront of technology to accompany our clients,&#8221; he added.  </p>
<p>Looking ahead, the partnership will expand tokenization capabilities across additional fund portfolios and explore new collateral use cases to meet the efficiency and flexibility requirements for a capital future that is on-chain, said the statement. </p>

<p>QAI Ventures said in a statement that the programs harness its expertise as a global investor and leading QuantumAI ecosystem builder. </p>
<p>The accelerator launch follows from QAI Ventures’ successful programs rolled out in Europe and North America, which have seen over 20 companies incubated over the last three years, with an overall portfolio of 27 companies.</p>
<p>“Through our VC-funded Accelerator, Venture Building programs, and deep industry collaborations, QAI Ventures is building the Future of QuantumAI in Asia backed by Enterprise Singapore,</p>
<p>&#8220;Our model fosters entrepreneurial dynamism, drives economic growth, and empowers innovators to translate QuantumAI breakthroughs into real-world impact,&#8221; said Alexandra Beckstein, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of QAI Ventures.</p>
<p>It is noted that artificial intelligence (AI) is moving to Quantum, defining the future of computing at the intersection of both technologies, known as QuantumAI. </p>
<p>QAI Venture’s Singapore accelerator targets this emerging opportunity with a dedicated QuantumAI accelerator in Asia. </p>
<p>It is also noted that quantum could unlock $250 billion of market value across industries like pharmaceuticals, finance, logistics, and materials science, according to Bain &amp; Company.; Quantum computers are 13,000 times faster than supercomputers, per Google.</p>
<p>The QAI Ventures Accelerator is an intensive five-month program designed to empower early-stage founders, helping them translate scientific breakthroughs into scalable, investment-ready businesses. </p>
<p>Participants benefit from direct mentorship by a global network of leading quantum technologists, VCs, and industry executives, while engaging in masterclasses on everything from IP strategy and product-market fit to fundraising and corporate governance.</p>
<p>The program culminates in a high-profile Demo Day, where startups present to an international audience of investors and partners to secure their next stage of growth.</p>
<p>Applications for the inaugural cohort are open from October 29, 2025, to March 2, 2026. </p>
<p>The program, which kicks off mid-2026, is open to incorporated startups with teams of at least two founders who have passed a due diligence process.</p>
<p>Complementing the Accelerator, QAI Ventures will also start a dedicated Venture Building Program in 2026, focusing on translating Singapore’s world-class research and IP into market-ready ventures. </p>
<p>The company will also leverage its proprietary database of over 2,000 relevant patents to create and spin off new companies in Singapore, further driving job creation and innovation. </p>
<p>The Venture Building approach targets scientists with strong intellectual property and the ambition to found a company, as well as serial entrepreneurs eager to enter the Deep Tech and Quantum space. </p>
<p>QAI Ventures aims to register seven new ventures in Singapore by 2027 – three in the first year and four in the second.</p>
<p>“Beyond breakthrough research, there is a need to build the bridge from laboratory to market for the quantum revolution to take off,</p>
<p>&#8220;Our partnership with QAI Ventures to venture-build and accelerate growth of quantum startups provides that critical pathway, strengthening Singapore’s position as both a launchpad for homegrown quantum ventures and a regional gateway for global startups scaling across Asia,&#8221; said Sophia Ng, Executive Director, Startup Ecosystem, EnterpriseSG.  </p>
<p>According to her, this is a pivotal step in strengthening the quantum readiness among corporates in Singapore, as these startups can help address real industry challenges while benefiting from accelerated go-to-market development.</p>

<p>VinFast said in a statement on Tuesday that under the dealer finance tie-up, Yes Bank will extend financing to VinFast dealers on favorable terms. </p>
<p>The retail finance agreement will also offer a wide range of customer benefits, including attractive interest rates, flexible repayment options, 100 percent on-road funding, exclusive offers, and priority services—applicable across VinFast’s entire product portfolio. </p>
<p>The collaboration enables VinFast to leverage Yes Bank’s extensive pan-India branch network and digital platforms to reach customers across both urban and emerging markets. </p>

<p>“The shift to electric mobility succeeds when customers and dealers have the right tools and support. Our partnership with Yes Bank is a step towards building that ecosystem, providing hassle free financing solutions that make it easier for dealers to manage inventory and for customers to access our EVs, </p>
<p>&#8220;By working together, we are ensuring a smoother ownership experience and making EV adoption more reassuring for our customers, while advancing India’s path toward greener transportation,&#8221; said Pham Sanh Chau, Chief Executive Officer of VinFast Asia.</p>
<p>Sumit Bali, Country Head Retail Assets and Debt Management, Yes Bank, said as EV adoption accelerates, access to financing will play a vital role in driving this transition. </p>

<p>&#8220;Such partnerships also help us empower our customers to achieve their green mobility aspirations with ease,&#8221; he added. </p>

<p>This is part of the holistic set of recommendations announced by the Equities Market Review Group to adopt a regulatory approach that is pro-enterprise, alongside measures to strengthen investor confidence, MAS said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The consolidation of listing review functions under SGX RegCo will provide prospective issuers with greater certainty on the listing process and timeline. </p>
<p>Going forward, they will only have to engage with SGX RegCo. </p>
<p>Currently, issuers engage with MAS to review their prospectus, and with SGX RegCo on their suitability to list.</p>
<p>SGX RegCo will continue to focus on admitting quality issuers and ensuring that issuers disclose relevant and material information to support informed decision-making.</p>
<p>MAS will continue to work with SGX RegCo to ensure timely and robust market surveillance and enforcement, as well as investigate and take action against breaches of prospectus disclosure requirements under the Securities and Futures Act.</p>
<p>The consolidation complements other efforts to streamline the listing process that had been consulted on earlier. </p>
<p>It also comes alongside measures that aim to strengthen investor confidence, such as proposals to enhance investor recourse avenues and to support companies in unlocking shareholder value.</p>
<p>In tandem with MAS’ public consultation, SGX RegCo is concurrently proposing changes to SGX’s listing rules to operationalize the consolidation. </p>
