<p>Following the integration, Truth Social will be the first social media platform to offer its users technology to access embedded prediction markets capabilities through CDNA, Crypto.com said in a statement. </p>
<p>According to the statement, Truth Social users will be able to trade prediction contracts related to major events and milestones, such as political elections, interest and inflation rate changes, commodity prices on gold and crude oil, events across all major sports leagues, and more using the new product technology called “Truth Predict”. </p>
<p>Prices will update in real-time, allowing users to react instantly to developments in major current events.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to become the world’s first publicly traded social media platform to offer our users access to prediction markets, </p>
<p>“Truth Predict will allow our loyal users to engage in prediction markets with a trusted network while harnessing our social media platform to provide totally unique ways for users to discuss and compare their predictions,&#8221; said Devin Nunes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Trump Media.</p>
<p>With more than $3 billion in financial assets as of the end of the second quarter, and having posted its first quarter of positive operating cash flow after going public just last year, he said Trump Media is well-positioned to leverage its strong balance sheet and existing social media capabilities to create a new standard for access to prediction market platforms. </p>
<p>&#8220;For too long, global elites have closely controlled these markets &#8211; with Truth Predict, we’re democratizing information and empowering everyday Americans to harness the wisdom of the crowd, turning free speech into actionable foresight,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>It is noted that the event contracts will be offered via CDNA, with the integration providing a federally compliant way to access CDNA event contracts and make predictions on the outcomes of events, including politics, economics, financials, and sports &#8211; all seamlessly woven with technology from Truth Social.</p>
<p>“Prediction markets are poised to be a multi-deca-billion dollar industry, </p>
<p>“Crypto.com has quickly become one of the most trusted providers of prediction market services, and we’re thrilled to combine with Truth Social to support the world’s first prediction markets available from a social media platform. This aligns perfectly with what users look for in social media &#8211; a community to engage with and seek truth,&#8221; said Kris Marszalek, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Crypto.com. </p>
<p>He noted Truth Predict will provide customers with a powerful tool related to market sentiment on an unlimited number of events. </p>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to integrate Truth Social’s truly pioneering social media platform and technology with our industry-leading technology and regulated prediction market trading,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>According to the statement, the integration will begin Beta testing live on Truth Social in the near future, followed by a full launch in the United States. </p>
<p>Subsequently, Trump Media plans to launch the service globally once all the requisite requirements are met.</p>
<p>Truth Social and Truth+ users who have Truth gems, which are earned for interacting on the platforms, will be able to convert their gems into the Cronos (CRO) digital currency and apply them to purchases of Truth Predict contracts.</p>
<p>This initiative between Trump Media and Crypto.com follows the recent establishment of a strategic partnership between the firms to introduce a CRO rewards system on the Truth Social and Truth+ platforms, as well as the announcement to establish Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, Inc., following a definitive agreement for a proposed business combination with Yorkville Acquisition Corp, a special-purpose acquisition company sponsored by Yorkville Acquisition Sponsor LLC, to form a digital asset treasury company focused on the acquisition of CRO.</p>

<p>BNP Paribas’ Securities Services business will serve as the transfer agent, underscoring how tokenization can seamlessly integrate into existing capital markets infrastructure， Marketnode said in a statement on Thursday. </p>
<p>Marketnode’s modular platform, Gateway, will provide the core tokenization architecture, to enable greater efficiency, transparency, and connectivity across the investment value chain. </p>
<p>The platform supports both EVM and non-EVM networks with recent integrations including Solana, Stellar and XRP Ledger. </p>
<p>“This partnership underscores the power of collaboration across the financial ecosystem,” said Andrew Scott, Head of Digital Assets at Marketnode. </p>
<p>“As tokenization accelerates from concept to reality, the industry’s infrastructure must evolve just as boldly, </p>
<p>&#8220;By bridging infrastructural gaps and uniting expertise across our partners, we are defining what the next generation of trusted, interoperable markets can look like in Asia,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Ivan Won, Head of Product &amp; Marketing at Maybank Asset Management Singapore, said this partnership enhances modern day investors’ access to the firm&#8217;s products. </p>
<p>“This partnership reflects our commitment to innovation and our desire to leverage on technology as we venture into a tokenized future – one that the Singapore financial industry is rapidly embracing,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Luc Renard, Head of Southeast Asia, Securities Services, BNP Paribas, commented as tokenization of money market funds gains attention for their potential growth and reach, financial services have an increasingly important role to drive the next stage of development. </p>
<p>&#8220;To support this, we are proud to put our on-the-ground specialist teams, global operating model, and technology-driven approach in collaboration with Maybank Asset Management Singapore,</p>
<p>&#8220;This mandate emphasizes the importance of staying at the forefront of technology to accompany our clients,&#8221; he added.  </p>
<p>Looking ahead, the partnership will expand tokenization capabilities across additional fund portfolios and explore new collateral use cases to meet the efficiency and flexibility requirements for a capital future that is on-chain, said the statement. </p>

<p>QAI Ventures said in a statement that the programs harness its expertise as a global investor and leading QuantumAI ecosystem builder. </p>
<p>The accelerator launch follows from QAI Ventures’ successful programs rolled out in Europe and North America, which have seen over 20 companies incubated over the last three years, with an overall portfolio of 27 companies.</p>
<p>“Through our VC-funded Accelerator, Venture Building programs, and deep industry collaborations, QAI Ventures is building the Future of QuantumAI in Asia backed by Enterprise Singapore,</p>
<p>&#8220;Our model fosters entrepreneurial dynamism, drives economic growth, and empowers innovators to translate QuantumAI breakthroughs into real-world impact,&#8221; said Alexandra Beckstein, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of QAI Ventures.</p>
<p>It is noted that artificial intelligence (AI) is moving to Quantum, defining the future of computing at the intersection of both technologies, known as QuantumAI. </p>
<p>QAI Venture’s Singapore accelerator targets this emerging opportunity with a dedicated QuantumAI accelerator in Asia. </p>
<p>It is also noted that quantum could unlock $250 billion of market value across industries like pharmaceuticals, finance, logistics, and materials science, according to Bain &amp; Company.; Quantum computers are 13,000 times faster than supercomputers, per Google.</p>
<p>The QAI Ventures Accelerator is an intensive five-month program designed to empower early-stage founders, helping them translate scientific breakthroughs into scalable, investment-ready businesses. </p>
<p>Participants benefit from direct mentorship by a global network of leading quantum technologists, VCs, and industry executives, while engaging in masterclasses on everything from IP strategy and product-market fit to fundraising and corporate governance.</p>
<p>The program culminates in a high-profile Demo Day, where startups present to an international audience of investors and partners to secure their next stage of growth.</p>
<p>Applications for the inaugural cohort are open from October 29, 2025, to March 2, 2026. </p>
<p>The program, which kicks off mid-2026, is open to incorporated startups with teams of at least two founders who have passed a due diligence process.</p>
<p>Complementing the Accelerator, QAI Ventures will also start a dedicated Venture Building Program in 2026, focusing on translating Singapore’s world-class research and IP into market-ready ventures. </p>
<p>The company will also leverage its proprietary database of over 2,000 relevant patents to create and spin off new companies in Singapore, further driving job creation and innovation. </p>
<p>The Venture Building approach targets scientists with strong intellectual property and the ambition to found a company, as well as serial entrepreneurs eager to enter the Deep Tech and Quantum space. </p>
<p>QAI Ventures aims to register seven new ventures in Singapore by 2027 – three in the first year and four in the second.</p>
<p>“Beyond breakthrough research, there is a need to build the bridge from laboratory to market for the quantum revolution to take off,</p>
<p>&#8220;Our partnership with QAI Ventures to venture-build and accelerate growth of quantum startups provides that critical pathway, strengthening Singapore’s position as both a launchpad for homegrown quantum ventures and a regional gateway for global startups scaling across Asia,&#8221; said Sophia Ng, Executive Director, Startup Ecosystem, EnterpriseSG.  </p>
<p>According to her, this is a pivotal step in strengthening the quantum readiness among corporates in Singapore, as these startups can help address real industry challenges while benefiting from accelerated go-to-market development.</p>

<p>The collaboration enables VinFast to leverage Yes Bank’s extensive pan-India branch network and digital platforms to reach customers across both urban and emerging markets. </p>

<p>“The shift to electric mobility succeeds when customers and dealers have the right tools and support. Our partnership with Yes Bank is a step towards building that ecosystem, providing hassle free financing solutions that make it easier for dealers to manage inventory and for customers to access our EVs, </p>
<p>&#8220;By working together, we are ensuring a smoother ownership experience and making EV adoption more reassuring for our customers, while advancing India’s path toward greener transportation,&#8221; said Pham Sanh Chau, Chief Executive Officer of VinFast Asia.</p>

<p>This is part of the holistic set of recommendations announced by the Equities Market Review Group to adopt a regulatory approach that is pro-enterprise, alongside measures to strengthen investor confidence, MAS said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The consolidation of listing review functions under SGX RegCo will provide prospective issuers with greater certainty on the listing process and timeline. </p>
<p>Going forward, they will only have to engage with SGX RegCo. </p>
<p>Currently, issuers engage with MAS to review their prospectus, and with SGX RegCo on their suitability to list.</p>
<p>SGX RegCo will continue to focus on admitting quality issuers and ensuring that issuers disclose relevant and material information to support informed decision-making.</p>
<p>MAS will continue to work with SGX RegCo to ensure timely and robust market surveillance and enforcement, as well as investigate and take action against breaches of prospectus disclosure requirements under the Securities and Futures Act.</p>
<p>The consolidation complements other efforts to streamline the listing process that had been consulted on earlier. </p>
<p>It also comes alongside measures that aim to strengthen investor confidence, such as proposals to enhance investor recourse avenues and to support companies in unlocking shareholder value.</p>
<p>In tandem with MAS’ public consultation, SGX RegCo is concurrently proposing changes to SGX’s listing rules to operationalize the consolidation. </p>

<p>As part of the launch, HSBC said in a statement that it will allocate $1.5 billion as a dedicated pool to provide high-growth innovation companies unique financing solutions to scale their business.</p>
<p>Launched at the Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology (SWITCH), HSBC Innovation Banking will offer Singapore-based venture-backed businesses and the investors that support<br />
them, access to enhanced sector expertise, specialized products, tailored financial solutions, and new opportunities through HSBC’s global network.</p>

<p>&#8220;It’s a global innovation hub with a support system of sandboxes and accelerators and a natural home for next generation entrepreneurs powering growth across Asia and beyond,&#8221; said David Sabow, Global Head of Innovation Banking.</p>

<p>“Home to more than 4,000 start-ups and supported by a vibrant network of investors, accelerators, and incubators, Singapore is a top destination for the start-up ecosystem in AsiaPacific, </p>
<p>&#8220;We have a market leading proposition in Singapore that offers the full suite of banking and funding solutions for new economy businesses,&#8221; said Gilbert Ng, Head of Banking &#8211; Singapore, Corporate and Institutional Banking, HSBC.</p>
<p>&#8220;The launch of HSBC Innovation Banking and the allocation of $1.5 billion in capital demonstrates our continued commitment to supporting the growth of Singapore’s innovation economy,&#8221; he added. </p>

<p>The competition, one of the projects under the Korea &#8211; ASEAN Digital Innovation Flagship Project (KADIF), funded by the ASEAN-Korea Cooperation Fund through the Government of Korea, seeks to advance the growth of the regional AI startup ecosystem and contribute to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p>Implemented by the National IT Industry Promotion Agency of Korea (NIPA) in collaboration with the ASEAN Secretariat and <a href="https://cradle.com.my/">Cradle Fund Sdn. Bhd. (Cradle)</a> under Malaysia’s Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI), the initiative reaffirms the shared commitment of ASEAN and Korea to accelerate digital cooperation and inclusive technological advancement.</p>
<p>In line with Malaysia’s ASEAN Chairmanship in 2025, the program exemplifies the country’s continued leadership in driving regional collaboration, entrepreneurship and innovation under the ASEAN Startup Initiative (ASI). It also supports Malaysia’s broader vision to strengthen ASEAN’s digital economy through partnerships that unite technology, sustainability and human capital development.</p>
<p>Following a rigorous two-stage evaluation process comprising document review and pitching assessment, two startups from each ASEAN Member State and the Republic of Korea were selected, representing a diverse range of emerging innovators across sectors such as education technology, digital health, fintech, and artificial intelligence for sustainability.</p>
<p>The selected teams embarked on an intensive eight-week acceleration program from September to October 2025, led by the Korean accelerator Y&#038;ARCHER, featuring tailored mentoring, investor readiness training, and global market access support. </p>
<p>The program will culminate in the AI Youth Festa 2025 Demo Day and Winners Announcement, held in conjunction with the Startup ASEAN Summit from Nov 3 to 5, 2025 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p>
<p>Norman Matthieu Vanhaecke, Group Chief Executive Officer of Cradle, stated, “As Malaysia assumes the ASEAN Chairmanship in 2025, we are committed to driving regional innovation and entrepreneurship through technology leadership. Across ASEAN, more than 750 AI-driven startups are shaping emerging industries, with Malaysia contributing nearly 200 of these ventures, including rising players such as Aonic, UrbanMetry, and Mesolitica, who are leading advancements in industrial automation, geospatial intelligence, and language technology.</p>
<p>“With AI-related startup investments growing since 2019 and more than MYR4.2 billion committed by Microsoft and Google to strengthen Malaysia’s AI and data-centre infrastructure, the nation is emerging as a regional hub for ethical and sustainable technological growth.</p>
<p>Cradle’s role under MOSTI continues to focus on nurturing AI-led startups, strengthening cross- border collaboration, and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals through responsible and inclusive innovation,” he added.</p>
<p>“The AI Youth Festa serves as an important platform to deepen collaboration between Korea and ASEAN in advancing digital innovation. By connecting young entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds, we are cultivating an ecosystem of cooperation, knowledge exchange and shared growth that reflects our collective aspiration for a sustainable digital future,” said Sungwoo Shin, Project Lead of NIPA.</p>
<p>The Korea–ASEAN AI Development &#038; Startup Competition 2025 forms part of the Plan of Action to Implement the ASEAN-Republic of Korea Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (2026-2030) and aligns with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP), reflecting a shared<br />
vision of connectivity, inclusivity and innovation. Through this initiative, participating agencies reaffirm their commitment to fostering a digitally empowered ASEAN–Korea community built on partnership and sustainable development.</p>
<p>The AI Youth Festa 2025 Demo Day will be held on 4 November 2025 at AICB. Participation is open to startups, investors and regional ecosystem partners. </p>

<p>The unicorn startup said in a statement on Thursday that it also reported an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of S$43 million ($32 million) and total assets of S$1.3 billion ($1 billion), according to audited FY2025 numbers.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s FY2025’s gross profit margin continued its expansion to over 12 percent, as it deepens its strategy of a strong marketplace margin expansion, ecosystem-led ancillary income growth, and productivity optimisation. </p>
<p>In the last 12 months, Carro also scaled up operations in Hong Kong and Japan, cementing its footprint outside of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Carro&#8217;s fintech business, Genie Financial Services, recorded a strong consumer loan book growth of 35 percent to S$670 million ($500 million) across the region,<br />
and kept non-performing loans (NPL) at below 0.5 percent, a number much better than industry benchmarks in the region.</p>
<p>“As we grow our differentiated ecosystem-led business operating model, we continue to focus on driving marketplace margin expansion by cross-selling ancillaries to drive recurring income streams and improve customer lifetime value, </p>
<p>&#8220;Additionally, we will continue to expand into new markets and segments, particularly in new energy vehicles (NEVs),&#8221; said Aaron Tan, Co-founder and Group Chief Executive Officer of Carro. </p>
<p>According to him, this year, the firm launched its brand new segment in Singapore and Malaysia to capture a broader customer base in the automotive value chain, and is looking to bring this to other markets. </p>
<p>At the same time, he said the firm is doubling down on its use of technology and artificial intelligence (AI), coupled with process improvements to drive productivity optimization and enable its businesses to scale better without growing costs linearly, </p>
<p>&#8220;We’re excited to share that we’ve launched our most advanced AI-enabled inspection app combining on-board diagnostics, visual, sound and vibration to improve our inspection capabilities, </p>
<p>&#8220;Our use of AI also stretches to sales conversion and customer service, which helps handle up to 85 percent of conversations and has cut down average response time by up to 80 percent to below 3 minutes in our largest markets,&#8221; he said.  </p>
<p>At the same time, he said the firm has redesigned its wholesale platforms to drive platform-led growth and improve the digital experience for both its dealers and end customers. </p>
<p>&#8220;All these are part of our bigger plan to scale at pace while exploring new initiatives,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Ernest Chew, Chief Financial Officer of Carro, said despite a challenging and unpredictable macro-environment, the firm continued focus on execution, unit economics and optimization has resulted in record volumes (+15 percent year-on-year growth), revenues and gross profit, as well as improved margins across most profitability metrics. </p>
<p>&#8220;A continuation of these efforts has seen our first half of FY2026 EBITDA growing over 50 percent year-on-year, </p>
<p>&#8220;Our overall liquidity by end FY2025 also improved year-on-year, as we continue to be extremely focused on financial discipline, vigilant on cash flows and working capital, and balance sheet strength,&#8221; he said.  </p>
<p>He also said that following the firm&#8217;s latest fundraising led by Cool Japan Fund, the firm has the strongest balance sheet position in three years. </p>
<p>&#8220;We are actively diversifying and securitizing our receivables to improve financial flexibility and strengthen our capital structure, </p>
<p>&#8220;Very pleased that our investment into Hong Kong has been strategically value-accretive, growing quickly to become a leading player domestically and profitable in the first year,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>The unicorn startup has also officially closed a $60 million round of funding led by Cool Japan Fund, a Japan&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund. </p>
<p>This investment will go towards bolstering the demand of Japanese cars across Asia Pacific where Carro has a presence in.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="150" height="150" src="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Steven-Gao-Co-Founder-and-CEO-of-IndustrialMind-1-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" srcset="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Steven-Gao-Co-Founder-and-CEO-of-IndustrialMind-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Steven-Gao-Co-Founder-and-CEO-of-IndustrialMind-1-348x348.jpg 348w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><p><a href="https://www.industrialmind.ai/">IndustrialMind.ai</a>, an artificial intelligence (AI) company founded by former Tesla manufacturing AI team, announced Thursday a $1.2 million pre-seed round. </p>
<p>The firm said in a statement that investors in the round include Antler, Gang Song (angel; Ex-Tesla Vice President of Manufacturing), TSVC, and Plug and Play. </p>
<p>The funding will accelerate development and customer deployment of IndustrialMind.ai’s “AI Engineer,” with capabilities ranging from drawing-to-process automation<br />
to real-time monitoring and root-cause analysis, improving yield, increasing throughput, and shortening new-product-introduction timelines.</p>
<p>Despite broad adoption of robotics and digital tools on the shop floor, converting data into timely operational decisions remains difficult — especially during rapid ramps and complex new-product launches. </p>
<p>Having built an AI manufacturing platform that solved critical bottlenecks at Tesla’s Giga factories, the founding team is now bringing that decision-making brain to the broader industry: an AI system that understands drawings and process data, recommends concrete adjustments, and helps validate impact on real equipment. </p>
<p>The effort focuses on rebuilding the decision-making center of modern manufacturing and redefining the factory of the future.</p>
<p>“Engineers already have enough tools. They need a real trustworthy teammate, an AI Engineer,</p>
<p>&#8220;The ultimate engineer on the factory floor combines manufacturing judgment with AI capabilities and delivers verified, actionable changes,” said Steven Gao, Co-founder， Chief Executive Officer of IndustrialMind.ai.</p>
<p>Gang Song, former Tesla VP of Manufacturing and the round’s angel investor, also said this is a rare team that understands both high-volume manufacturing and state-of-the-art AI.</p>
<p>“IndustrialMind.ai has solved real bottlenecks on real lines. IndustrialMind.ai is bringing that playbook to the broader industry,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>IndustrialMind.ai’s AI Engineer spans the path from print to performance. </p>
<p>It understands drawings to extract features and automatically draft BOMs, routings, and should-cost quotes, turning “drawing to process” into a minutes-long step. </p>
<p>On the line, it monitors production in real time, detects and predicts anomalies, and offers engineer-ready adjustments that keep processes stable and quality in control. </p>
<p>When issues arise, a multi-agent root-cause engine blends knowledge and data to surface fixes and auto-generate reports, closing the loop far faster than manual methods.</p>
<p>IndustrialMind.ai is already deploying the AI Engineer with industry leaders including Siemens, tesa, and Andritz, and operates a forward-deployed model that embeds the product directly into each customer’s workflows and systems to deliver measurable value within weeks.</p>
