      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="150" height="150" src="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TBWAxEDB-Innovation-Lab-Press-Image-1-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" srcset="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TBWAxEDB-Innovation-Lab-Press-Image-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TBWAxEDB-Innovation-Lab-Press-Image-1-348x348.jpg 348w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><p><a href="https://www.tbwa.com.sg/">TBWA\Singapore </a>announced Wednesday the launch of its Innovation Lab, the first Center of Excellence in TBWA’s Asia-Pacific network established with support from the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB). </p>
<p>The firm said in a statement that the lab establishes Singapore as a regional proving ground for AI-led brand innovation, helping companies translate ambition into scalable experiences, intelligent systems, and new growth models enabled by emerging technologies.</p>
<p>According to the statement, the lab has been established in response to a fundamental shift facing brands. </p>
<p>It is noted that as customer expectations evolve faster than traditional marketing and innovation cycles, ambition alone is no longer enough. Brands need to be able to build, test, and learn at speed, while ensuring ideas are credible, scalable, and commercially sound.</p>
<p>“Technology has finally caught up with creative ambition. AI and immersive platforms allow us to build, test, and learn at a pace the industry simply couldn’t achieve before, </p>
<p>&#8220;This lab exists to ensure that speed is used responsibly, creating brand experiences that are richer, more engaging, and grounded in real value, not hype,&#8221; said Mandy Wong, Chief Executive Officer, TBWA\Group Singapore. </p>
<p>Unlike traditional innovation labs that often rely on large-scale, long-horizon, and high-cost initiatives that take months to prove and are difficult to unwind once committed, TBWA\Singapore said its lab is built to deliver outcomes through rapid prototyping, early proof, and disciplined scale. </p>
<p>Its role is to help brands identify new growth spaces, rapidly test ideas, and scale only what earns the right to grow.</p>
<p>The firm highlighted that artificial intelligence sits at the core of the lab’s model, collapsing timelines across insight, ideation, experience design, and production. </p>
<p>This allows teams to prototype immersive brand experiences in weeks rather than months, pressure-test ideas early, and compound learning rather than resetting with each new project.</p>
<p>The lab also focuses on how emerging technologies unlock opportunities that were previously impractical or out of reach. Robotics and intelligent systems are applied to solve complex human and business challenges across education, training, service<br />
design, and social impact. </p>
<p>Virtual and augmented reality are used to extend brands into new realms, creating environments audiences can step into, interact with, and return to, rather than passively consume.</p>
<p>“We’re interested in the spaces where creativity and systems collide. AI, robotics, and spatial computing let us prototype experiences and operating models that used to be too slow, too complex, or too risky to attempt, </p>
<p>&#8220;Our job is to make those ideas real, usable, and scalable,&#8221; said Mel Daniels, Head of Innovation, TBWA\Asia and TBWA\Singapore.</p>
<p>According to the statement, the launch of the lab formalizes capabilities TBWA\Singapore has already proven in market, including immersive experience platforms developed for Singapore’s arts and culture industry to deepen audience engagement through interactive digital environments. </p>
<p>The lab also extends existing work in designing bespoke AI agents and AI-enabled operating systems integrated into real creative, production, and strategic workflows.</p>
<p>Supported by the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), the Innovation Lab will develop, test and refine ideas and experiences, before scaling them across clients, categories and global markets. </p>
<p>At the same time, partnerships with educational institutions and other industry players will uplift the local tech and innovation ecosystem.</p>
<p>“TBWA\Singapore&#039;s Innovation Lab will harness AI in marketing and advertising to support businesses, while partnering our Institutes of Higher Learning to develop the next generation of AI-savvy talent, </p>
<p>&#8220;Firms like TBWA\Singapore play an important role in Singapore&#8217;s marketing ecosystem, strengthening our position as a trusted hub for professional services. We look forward to working with TBWA\Singapore to advance AI transformation in the marketing sector,&#8221; said Junie Fo, Vice President and Head of Professional Services, EDB.</p>
<p>Beyond client delivery, the lab also plays a central role in shaping the agency’s future talent strategy. </p>
<p>Under the leadership of Mandy Goh, Head of Talent and Human Resources of TBWA\Singapore, the lab will operate as a training and incubation platform for the hybrid skillsets the industry will require over the next 12 to 18 months, blending creativity, technology, systems thinking, and cultural intelligence.</p>
<p>“The future of our industry depends on new hybrid skillsets. The Innovation Lab gives us a live environment to train, experiment, and incubate talent for the roles the agency and our clients will need next, not just the ones that exist today,&#8221; said Goh. </p>
<p>This includes upskilling existing talent, developing new career pathways, and incubating roles that do not yet formally exist, ensuring both the agency and its clients are prepared for what’s next rather than reacting to it.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="150" height="150" src="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-27-162241-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" /><p><a href="https://www.workday.com/">Workday, Inc.</a>, the global enterprise artificial intelligence (AI) platform has released new research on Thursday that found the need to rework AI outputs is eroding productivity gains for employees. </p>
<p>This signals a productivity gap that Singapore organizations will need to address, especially as AI use is becoming more widespread, the firm said in a statement. </p>
<p>The study, which surveyed 3,200 respondents globally, including in Singapore, found that approximately half of Singapore respondents spend at least an hour each week clarifying, correcting or even rewriting AI-generated outputs, with 12 percent spending between two to four hours weekly on rework alone.</p>
<p>Despite this, net productivity gains remain positive, with seven in ten respondents noting they are more productive today compared to pre-AI adoption levels. </p>
<p>All respondents indicated that AI tools are already deployed in their organizations, and 86 percent reported implementing three or more AI use cases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, organizations in the region are broadly aligned that AI-driven efficiency gains should benefit employees. </p>
<p>Some 68 percent of respondents agree that companies that reinvest in their people will be more competitive and resilient over the long term.</p>
<p>Among respondents whose organizations reported time savings from AI adoption, 78 percent said those gains were reinvested in employee development, upskilling or training, while 68 percent redirected time towards higher-value, strategic or innovative work.</p>
<p>Notably, 80 percent said AI cost savings were reinvested in the workforce – matching the proportion reinvested in technology or infrastructure, and significantly exceeding the share returned to shareholders (23 percent).</p>
<p>“Reinvesting AI-driven gains into people is critical to improving outcomes and sustaining long-term value creation,” said Jess O’Reilly, general manager, ASEAN, Workday. </p>
<p>“AI can improve efficiency, but speed alone does not unlock real value. What makes the biggest difference is reinvesting those<br />
gains into people, </p>
<p>&#8220;Organizations will need to prioritize talent development in the core areas of AI literacy and critical thinking. Building confidence for employees in their use of AI will be pivotal to<br />
reducing rework, enhancing business outcomes and delivering lasting value,&#8221; she added. </p>
<p>As AI becomes embedded in daily workflows, employees reported growing performance expectations, said the study. </p>
<p>Six in ten respondents say they are now expected to deliver a significantly higher volume of output compared to before AI adoption.</p>
<p>Findings from the report show that the burden of rework largely sits at mid-managerial levels.</p>
<p>Managers and directors are most likely to shoulder the responsibility of validating, refining, and approving work, including AI-assisted output – reflecting their role as quality gatekeepers.</p>
<p>Despite heightened expectations, overall sentiment remains largely positive. </p>
<p>Most respondents (75 percent) say they trust their leadership teams to make fair decisions about AI’s impact on job security and<br />
rewards, while only 7 percent express concern about potential redundancy due to AI.</p>
<p>Six in 10 respondents also noted that their stress levels and risk of burnout have decreased since the deployment and adoption of AI tools.</p>
<p>The organizations realizing the greatest value from AI treat saved time as a strategic resource. </p>
<p>They reinvest in upskilling their teams, improving collaboration, and strengthening judgment-driven work.</p>
<p>The biggest opportunity is helping employees learn how to use AI effectively – especially in areas that require judgement, creativity, and decision-making. The research makes one thing clear: reinvesting in people is the fastest way to reduce rework, improve outcomes, and turn AI speed into lasting business value, said the statement. </p>

<p>The firm said in a statement that upon completing the pre-issuance conditions and being permitted to launch, it plans to introduce digital payment services in Malaysia designed to support businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) engaged in international trade. </p>
<p>These services are intended to include streamlined onboarding, convenient funding options, efficient foreign exchange, and secure remittance and settlement experiences, with a focus on compliance, security, and operational reliability, helping Malaysian SMEs reduce friction in legitimate trade as they scale into regional and emerging-market corridors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Receiving conditional approval from Bank Negara Malaysia is an important milestone for XTransfer in the ASEAN region,</p>
<p>&#8220;We appreciate BNM&#8217;s guidance and oversight. We look forward to bringing Malaysian businesses compliant and efficient payment solutions that help trade move faster and more predictably, especially as intra-Asia and broader South–South trade routes continue to expand,&#8221; said Bill Deng, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of XTransfer. </p>
<p>It is noted that Malaysia is also central to XTransfer&#8217;s regional strategy, with a plan to establish Malaysia as its regional operational hub, serving as a strategic control center within Southeast Asia, coordinating compliance, risk management, customer support, and global operations to ensure alignment with both local and group-wide standards. </p>
<p>&#8220;Malaysia gives us the talent, governance environment, and regional proximity to scale across the region,&#8221; Bill added.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017, XTransfer is dedicated to using technology to bridge large financial institutions and SMEs worldwide, providing secure, compliant, fast, convenient and low-cost cross-border trade payment and fund collection solutions. </p>
<p>The firm currently has more than 800,000 enterprise clients.</p>

<p>The firm said in statement on Thursday that the company moved its highest volume of 102,688 tons (+19 percent year on year) and 63 million parcels (+165 percent year on year) with a new daily peak record of 974,000 parcels during the year. </p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s profitability momentum also continued in the fourth quarter of 2025, with Teleport recording a net operating profit (NOP) of MYR 5.2 million ($1.34 million), up MYR 7.5 million ($1.93 million) year on year. </p>
<p>For FY2025, Teleport achieved its highest-ever total volume of 347,885 tons (+18 percent year on year) and 167 million total parcels moved (+99 percent year on year), driving total revenue to MYR 1.2 billion (+11 percent year on year). </p>
<p>This growth validates Teleport’s unique asset-light model of combining passenger and freighter capacity of third-party airlines, AirAsia belly space and Teleport freighters to meet growing market demands for eCommerce. </p>
<p>Furthermore, this strong finish contributed to a full-year NOP of MYR 18.6 million ($4.79 million), a MYR 40 million ($10.29 million) turnaround from a MYR 21 million ($5.4 million) net loss in FY2024. </p>
<p>Teleport’s return to profitability at all levels was driven by strict cost and margin discipline, as well as a reduction in finance costs following the successful refinancing of the Deutsche Bank loan in the third quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>“Returning to profitability in 2025 is a testament to our team’s discipline, the trust our partners place in us and proves that Teleport’s asset-light model can scale profitably, </p>
<p>&#8220;Moving 167 million parcels and delivering MYR 1.2 billion ($310 million) in revenue proves that our model works at scale. This operating improvement, supported by the refinancing of our debt and a clear focus on both cost and margin discipline, gives us a solid foundation to scale further,&#8221; said Teleport Chief Executive Officer Pete Chareonwongsak.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we enter 2026, the $50 million in pre-IPO growth capital from HPS Investment Partners allows us to accelerate this momentum. While we remain mindful of shifting market yields and currency volatility, we are optimistic and clear about our goal of moving more global eCommerce with the same discipline that delivered positive earnings this year, </p>
<p>&#8220;By further integrating partner airline capacity with our own network, we are building a sustainable, global logistics infrastructure that has long-term earnings potential,&#8221; he added. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="150" height="150" src="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-27-155211-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" srcset="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-27-155211-150x150.png 150w, https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-27-155211-348x348.png 348w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><p><a href="https://www.gotocompany.com/en">GoTo Group</a>, Indonesia’s largest digital ecosystem, has released a comprehensive statement detailing its evolution from a 2010 call center to a public tech powerhouse. </p>
<p>The firm said in a statement on Thursday that the move comes as the company seeks to provide clarity regarding its corporate governance, historical investments, and its relationship with founder Nadiem Makarim following recent legal proceedings.</p>
<p>A central point of the clarification involves GoTo’s relationship with Google. </p>
<p>While Google became a stakeholder in 2017, GoTo emphasized that the tech giant was never a majority or controlling shareholder.</p>
<p>According to the statement, all funding rounds were managed via standard Share Subscription Agreements (SSAs) with no &#8220;special treatment&#8221; for any specific investor.</p>
<p>GoTo also clarified that it never bought back its own shares from Google. </p>
<p>However, it did purchase Tokopedia shares from Google during the 2021 merger and restructured fintech entity shares (PT Dompet Karya Anak Bangsa) later that year.</p>
<p>In both instances, investors chose to reinvest the proceeds back into new GoTo shares.</p>
<p>Addressing the transition of founder Nadiem Makarim to public office in 2019, GoTo reiterated that Makarim resigned from all positions within the Group before becoming Indonesia’s Minister of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology.</p>
<p>To ensure a &#8220;clear separation of interests,&#8221; Makarim granted Power of Attorney (PoA) over his shareholder voting rights to his co-founders. </p>
<p>This effectively removed him from any decision-making role within the company for the duration of his public service.</p>
<p>GoTo also provided a deep dive into its internal financial shifts, specifically the relationship between PT Aplikasi Karya Anak Bangsa (PT AKAB) and PT Gojek Indonesia (PT GI).</p>
<p>As the company scaled, PT AKAB (a Foreign Investment Company) was established in 2015 to house the app’s technology. </p>
<p>To streamline for the 2021 initial public offering (IPO), PT AKAB took full control of PT GI.</p>
<p>According to GoTo, PT AKAB subscribed to newly issued shares in PT GI; PT GI used the proceeds (IDR 809 billion) to repay outstanding debts owed to PT AKAB. </p>
<p>The company also stated firmly that no individual shareholders, including Nadiem Makarim, received proceeds from these internal transfers.</p>
<p>In response to questions regarding share pricing, GoTo also explained the distinction between Nominal Value (required by Indonesian law) and the Subscription Price (determined by market demand).</p>
<p>GoTo also confirmed that these figures are clearly articulated in their financial statements, which are audited by independent firms and available for public review.</p>
<p>By detailing these milestones, GoTo aims to reinforce its foundation of trust and prudence. </p>
<p>The company said it remains focused on its mission to serve millions of consumers, drivers, and merchants across Indonesia, asserting that its &#8220;innovation is matched by transparency.&#8221;</p>

<p>The firm said in a statement on Wednesday that the results were driven by continued global adoption of Indocyanine Green (ICG) use in fluorescence-guided surgeries, across a growing range of procedures and specialties, alongside disciplined commercial execution as well as geographical expansion.</p>
<p>Its revenue growth was underpinned by both volume growth and improved pricing internationally. </p>
<p>Its sales volumes increased 13% year-on-year, while average selling prices rose across key markets, particularly in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s gross margin maintained at 85 percent even as volumes continued to scale. </p>
<p>Its operating profit increased to $84.2 million, despite higher operating expenses associated with planned investments in commercial scale-up particularly in Asia, regulatory<br />
capabilities and initial public offering (IPO)-related costs.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s reported net profit after tax (NPAT) included net exceptional items of approximately $11.8 million. </p>
<p>Thiswas primarily related to a gain on the sale of discontinued non-core UltraLinQ business operations of approximately $23.7 million in August 2025, partially offset by a tax provision on dividend income of approximately $8.5 million and impairment and other charges totaling approximately US$3.4 million, including impairments related to assets held for sale and loss on disposal of intangible assets.</p>
<p>Excluding these exceptional items, the firm&#8217;s underlying NPAT increased 14 percent year-on-year to $63.8 million compared to $56 million.</p>
<p>The group ended FY2025 with no debt and a strong net cash position of $176.1 million, providing financial flexibility to support future growth initiatives.</p>
<p>“FY2025 marked a significant milestone for UltraGreen, culminating in our successful IPO in Singapore in December, with most of the offer being taken up by institutional investors, </p>
<p>&#8220;Even as we executed the listing process, we continued to deliver strong operating and financial performance and focus of our business model,&#8221; said Ravinder Sajwan, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director of UltraGreen.ai.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking ahead, we expect to continue delivering strong operational and financial growth, with FY2026 revenue forecast of between $170 million to $190 million,</p>
<p>&#8220;This outlook is driven by underlying business expansion, the full-year impact of pricing initiatives implemented in FY2025, and further penetration into new markets,&#8221; he added. </p>

<p>The firm said in a statement on Wednesday that its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the year stood at MYR 84 million ($21.62 million) and MYR 65 million ($16.73 million) in net operating profit (NOP), resulting in profit after tax (PAT) of over MYR 54 million ($13.9 million) and reinforcing its return to sustained profitability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, driven by the launch of the business to business (B2B) business — which contributed approximately 55 percent of revenue —as well as continued personalization initiatives, revenue in the fourth quarter of 2025 tripled quarter on quarter and nearly doubled year on year to MYR 300 million ($77.21 million). </p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s margins remained resilient, supported by minimal marketing spend under AirAsia MOVE’s unique social-led acquisition model, delivering an EBITDA of MYR 45 million ($11.58 million) and NOP of MYR 40 million ($10.29 million). </p>
<p>Its NOP margin also saw a significant 6 percentage points quarter on quarter uptick due to lower interest expense. </p>
<p>Excluding B2B, the firm&#8217;s flights transactions climbed 12 percent quarter on quarter, while gross booking value (GBV) rose 28 percent quarter on quarter on higher average spend. </p>
<p>Its performance was underpinned by a market-leading ancillary strategy with attach rates 23 percent higher than peer online travel agents (OTAs).</p>
<p>It is noted that its flights also secured two major partnerships with VietJet and IndiGo to further diversify its portfolio. </p>
<p>Stays continued to gain traction, with conversion improving to 2.3 percent from 1.9 percent a year ago, pushing the firm&#8217;s transactions up 2 percent and growing GBV 18 percent year on year. </p>
<p>Duty Free also outperformed, with GBV increasing 157 percent year on year, following the commencement of operations in the Philippines and Indonesia.</p>
<p>“This year, we will double down on content to drive user acquisition and conversion, </p>
<p>&#8220;By leveraging user-generated content and deeper community engagement, we aim to attract higher-intent users while optimizing marketing spend,&#8221; said AirAsia MOVE Chief Executive Officer Nadia Zahir Omer.</p>
<p>According to him, this will be enabled by continued investment in technology, including the development of the firm&#8217;s virtual concierge, to enhance the booking experience, thereby improving retention and lifting NPS. </p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time, we will pursue greater Stays growth by leveraging our flight-anchored flywheel, deepening hotel partnerships and launching more personalized bundles to increase attach rates and customer lifetime value,&#8221; she added. </p>

Pte Ltd (AIM)</a>, a Singapore-based aerospace and defense electronics manufacturing services (EMS) platform.</p>
<p>StateSquare Capital said in a statement on Thursday that the firm will invest in AIM to drive its organic expansion and international acquisitive acceleration across Europe and North America, further strengthening AIM’s position as a leading independent EMS provider to global aerospace and defense customers.</p>
<p>Under StateSquare’s ownership, AIM will pursue a clearly defined value-creation strategy focused on organic capability and capacity expansion, alongside a targeted international buy-and-build program across Europe and North America. </p>
<p>AIM was founded in 1999 and serves global aerospace and defense customers from its operations in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the United Kingdom. </p>
<p>The Company provides a comprehensive suite of flight-critical, end-to-end electronic and mechanical manufacturing solutions, spanning prototyping, production, assembly, and testing.</p>
<p>The investment in AIM is underscored by its strong technical capabilities and robust quality systems, evidenced by long-standing Nadcap accreditation, as well as AS9100 and ISO9001 certifications – meeting the highest standards required by the global aerospace industry.</p>
<p>StateSquare’s investment DNA is rooted in global buy-and-build mid-market private equity partnerships and the firm has earmarked significant follow-on capital to support AIM’s transformational growth journey.</p>
<p>Closing of the investment is expected to occur by first quarter of 2026.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to partner with AIM’s leadership to further scale the Company into a global aerospace and defense manufacturing solutions provider of choice for leading avionics original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), </p>
<p>&#8220;Our transformational value creation strategy for AIM is centered on a clearly defined global buy-and-build roadmap – an investment strategy deeply embedded in StateSquare’s leadership,&#8221; said Florian Marquis, Managing Partner and Chief Executive Officer of StateSquare Capital.</p>
<p>Joseph Khoo, Partner at StateSquare Capital, said they believe that the global aerospace and defense sector benefits from strong structural growth drivers. </p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, we are excited to onboard experienced EMS and aerospace industry veterans onto the company’s board to further drive the company’s long-term strategy and support the institutionalization of AIM in the years to come,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Dr. Tan Kim Yong, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AIM, said StateSquare Capital’s global investment approach, combined with its strong local expertise, makes them the perfect partner for them. </p>
<p>&#8220;While AIM was founded in Asia, we have been successfully serving global customers across Europe and North America for decades,</p>
<p>&#8220;StateSquare Capital’s early and clear commitment to further invest in the growth of AIM’s platform gave us the confidence to partner with Florian and his team,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Nicholas Tan, Chief Operating Officer of AIM, said as the company reaches an inflection point in its accelerating global growth, and in alignment with their chairman’s intent to ensure long-term continuity and scalability of the business, they have chosen to partner with the StateSquare team as their preferred growth partner to work alongside management to significantly scale AIM and support their growth capital needs in the years to come. </p>
<p>&#8220;AIM is recognized for its strong, customer-centric operating ethos – a philosophy closely shared by the StateSquare team, </p>
<p>&#8220;By leveraging their global experience and ecosystem, we are excited to advance our shared vision and sustainable growth strategy for AIM, creating long-term value for our customers, stakeholders, and our dedicated employees,&#8221; he added. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="150" height="150" src="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-08-182851-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" srcset="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-08-182851-150x150.png 150w, https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-08-182851-348x348.png 348w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><p><a href="https://www.digitalrealty.com/">Digital Realty</a>, the global cloud- and carrier-neutral data center platform, announced Wednesday the expansion of its Digital Realty Innovation Lab (DRIL) into Singapore, Japan and London. </p>
<p>This marks the first expansion of the company’s global DRIL network into Asia Pacific and Europe, following the successful launch of the inaugural DRIL facility in Northern Virginia in September 2025, which has received acclaim from enterprise customers, the firm said in a statement. </p>
<p>The new DRIL locations will offer the firm&#8217;s ecosystem of partners and customers fully supported, real-world testing environments where they can bring their own workloads or use pre-configured infrastructure to validate AI and hybrid cloud deployments before scaling. </p>
<p>This is especially important as AI adoption increases and infrastructure readiness has emerged as a critical barrier to moving from experimentation to production at scale. </p>
<p>All three are expected to be available for use by customers and partners this year.</p>
<p>The launch represents Digital Realty’s commitment to support Singapore, Japan and the United Kingdom’s continued leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) innovation. </p>
<p>In Singapore, AI adoption is driving continued growth in the nation’s digital economy, which now accounts for 18.6 percent of total gross domestic product (GDP). </p>
<p>Japan also plans to invest 10 trillion yen ($64.12 billion) or more in the semiconductor and AI sectors by 2030. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the United Kingdom’s AI sector continues to accelerate, with more than 5,800 AI companies now operating nationwide, sector revenue reaching £23.9 billion ($32.42 billion) and AI generating £11.8 billion ($16 billion) in gross value added (GVA).</p>
<p>According to the statement, the Singapore DRIL is designed to serve as a digital innovation hub, bringing together local customers, partners, and research institutions with global technology providers and industry participants seeking to develop, test and deploy AI and hybrid cloud solutions in Singapore.</p>
<p>In Japan, the DRIL will be located at the company’s NRT12 data center in the Greater Tokyo area. </p>
<p>Designed to support advanced AI and high-performance computing use cases, it will feature 20 racks with direct liquid cooling (DLC) capabilities, enabling support for high-power-density workloads.</p>
<p>The DRIL in the UK will be in London, providing customers and partners with a dedicated environment to test and validate AI and hybrid cloud deployments before full-scale implementation.</p>
<p>“Sustaining rapidly expanding digital economies requires innovation ecosystems built on infrastructure that is not only AI-ready, but also efficient, resilient, and trusted,” said Serene Nah, Managing Director and Head of Asia Pacific, Digital Realty.</p>
<p>According to her, since launching the DRIL in the United States, they have seen strong demand from customers and partners across Asia Pacific seeking dedicated environments to validate AI and hybrid cloud architectures before deploying at scale. </p>
<p>&#8220;Bringing this capability to Singapore and Japan reflects the digital maturity of these markets and their critical role in shaping the region&#8217;s long-term digital competitiveness, </p>
<p>&#8220;By creating spaces where enterprises can test, optimize, and de-risk their AI infrastructure, we&#8217;re accelerating responsible deployment and strengthening Asia Pacific&#8217;s position as a hub for trusted digital innovation,&#8221; she added. </p>
<p>Séamus Dunne, Managing Director, UK &amp; Ireland, Digital Realty, said European AI adoption is expected to grow rapidly, and London sits at the center of that growth.</p>
<p>“Launching the Digital Realty Innovation Lab in London gives enterprises and partners a real-world environment to validate AI and hybrid cloud architectures before rolling them out across live environments, </p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a critical step in helping organizations deploy next-generation infrastructure faster, and with greater confidence,” he added. </p>
<p>The new DRIL locations will enable businesses throughout Asia Pacific and Europe to test performance, optimize configurations, and seamlessly connect to cloud and network providers via ServiceFabric, Digital Realty’s global interconnection and orchestration platform.</p>
<p>By leveraging Digital Realty’s global experience in deploying AI-ready infrastructure and its proven Pervasive Datacenter Architecture (PDx) methodology, the DRIL enables customers to test, optimize, and validate AI deployments in real-world conditions, reducing complexity and significantly accelerating the journey from pilot to production.</p>
