<p>This is part of the holistic set of recommendations announced by the Equities Market Review Group to adopt a regulatory approach that is pro-enterprise, alongside measures to strengthen investor confidence, MAS said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The consolidation of listing review functions under SGX RegCo will provide prospective issuers with greater certainty on the listing process and timeline. </p>
<p>Going forward, they will only have to engage with SGX RegCo. </p>
<p>Currently, issuers engage with MAS to review their prospectus, and with SGX RegCo on their suitability to list.</p>
<p>SGX RegCo will continue to focus on admitting quality issuers and ensuring that issuers disclose relevant and material information to support informed decision-making.</p>
<p>MAS will continue to work with SGX RegCo to ensure timely and robust market surveillance and enforcement, as well as investigate and take action against breaches of prospectus disclosure requirements under the Securities and Futures Act.</p>
<p>The consolidation complements other efforts to streamline the listing process that had been consulted on earlier. </p>
<p>It also comes alongside measures that aim to strengthen investor confidence, such as proposals to enhance investor recourse avenues and to support companies in unlocking shareholder value.</p>
<p>In tandem with MAS’ public consultation, SGX RegCo is concurrently proposing changes to SGX’s listing rules to operationalize the consolidation. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="150" height="150" src="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SWITCH-IVB-Launch_Group-Photo-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" srcset="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SWITCH-IVB-Launch_Group-Photo-150x150.jpg 150w, https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SWITCH-IVB-Launch_Group-Photo-348x348.jpg 348w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><p>Global banking group <a href="https://www.hsbc.com/">HSBC </a>announced Wednesday the launch of Innovation Banking in Singapore, a dedicated proposition to further deepen its support to the innovation and venture ecosystem in Singapore and across the region.</p>
<p>As part of the launch, HSBC said in a statement that it will allocate $1.5 billion as a dedicated pool to provide high-growth innovation companies unique financing solutions to scale their business.</p>
<p>Launched at the Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology (SWITCH), HSBC Innovation Banking will offer Singapore-based venture-backed businesses and the investors that support<br />
them, access to enhanced sector expertise, specialized products, tailored financial solutions, and new opportunities through HSBC’s global network.</p>
<p>“Singapore is a nation of innovators. In just six decades it has built thriving industries and universities, fostered a pro-business environment and strengthened linkages to the world through trade, finance and digital connections, </p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a global innovation hub with a support system of sandboxes and accelerators and a natural home for next generation entrepreneurs powering growth across Asia and beyond,&#8221; said David Sabow, Global Head of Innovation Banking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today marks another milestone as we aim to create the largest dedicated global innovation banking business in the world, </p>
<p>&#8220;Since HSBC Innovation Banking was established in 2023, we have grown our client base by nearly 60 percent and now have more than 900 globally-connected innovation finance experts,” he added. </p>
<p>Backed by HSBC’s hallmark financial strength and global network, HSBC Innovation Banking is a global banking platform for startups, innovators and investors. </p>
<p>The launch in Singapore is the third expansion of HSBC Innovation Banking in Asia-Pacific this year, adding on to its existing presence in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Continental Europe, India, Hong Kong, and China, allowing startups the ability to tap into some of the world’s most vibrant capital markets and innovative hubs. </p>
<p>“Home to more than 4,000 start-ups and supported by a vibrant network of investors, accelerators, and incubators, Singapore is a top destination for the start-up ecosystem in AsiaPacific, </p>
<p>&#8220;We have a market leading proposition in Singapore that offers the full suite of banking and funding solutions for new economy businesses,&#8221; said Gilbert Ng, Head of Banking &#8211; Singapore, Corporate and Institutional Banking, HSBC.</p>
<p>&#8220;The launch of HSBC Innovation Banking and the allocation of $1.5 billion in capital demonstrates our continued commitment to supporting the growth of Singapore’s innovation economy,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>In Singapore, HSBC has been supporting the growth of new economy businesses since 2021. </p>
<p>To date, the bank continues to gain market share and has seen strong double-digit revenue growth for the segment.</p>
<p>HSBC continues to be one of the most active banks in the Singapore start-up ecosystem and has successfully supported many leading local, innovative brands and businesses including Atome Financial, Glife Technologies and Tickled Media to scale to the next level of growth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Neil Falconer has been appointed Head of Innovation Banking in Singapore and will lead a dedicated Innovation coverage team to support existing clients as well as drive new client acquisition in Singapore. </p>
<p>Given the synergy, Falconer will continue to lead coverage of the Consumer, Healthcare and TMT sectors within the International Mid-Market segment.</p>
<p>In addition, HSBC has set up a dedicated Credit Solutions team in Singapore. </p>
<p>Led by Shaun Sakhrani as Head of Credit Solutions, Singapore and Asia Head of Platform Lending, the Credit Solutions team will offer a range of financing structures from venture debt to platform finance to HSBC Innovation Banking clients. </p>

<p>The competition, one of the projects under the Korea &#8211; ASEAN Digital Innovation Flagship Project (KADIF), funded by the ASEAN-Korea Cooperation Fund through the Government of Korea, seeks to advance the growth of the regional AI startup ecosystem and contribute to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p>Implemented by the National IT Industry Promotion Agency of Korea (NIPA) in collaboration with the ASEAN Secretariat and <a href="https://cradle.com.my/">Cradle Fund Sdn. Bhd. (Cradle)</a> under Malaysia’s Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI), the initiative reaffirms the shared commitment of ASEAN and Korea to accelerate digital cooperation and inclusive technological advancement.</p>
<p>In line with Malaysia’s ASEAN Chairmanship in 2025, the program exemplifies the country’s continued leadership in driving regional collaboration, entrepreneurship and innovation under the ASEAN Startup Initiative (ASI). It also supports Malaysia’s broader vision to strengthen ASEAN’s digital economy through partnerships that unite technology, sustainability and human capital development.</p>
<p>Following a rigorous two-stage evaluation process comprising document review and pitching assessment, two startups from each ASEAN Member State and the Republic of Korea were selected, representing a diverse range of emerging innovators across sectors such as education technology, digital health, fintech, and artificial intelligence for sustainability.</p>
<p>The selected teams embarked on an intensive eight-week acceleration program from September to October 2025, led by the Korean accelerator Y&#038;ARCHER, featuring tailored mentoring, investor readiness training, and global market access support. </p>
<p>The program will culminate in the AI Youth Festa 2025 Demo Day and Winners Announcement, held in conjunction with the Startup ASEAN Summit from Nov 3 to 5, 2025 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p>
<p>Norman Matthieu Vanhaecke, Group Chief Executive Officer of Cradle, stated, “As Malaysia assumes the ASEAN Chairmanship in 2025, we are committed to driving regional innovation and entrepreneurship through technology leadership. Across ASEAN, more than 750 AI-driven startups are shaping emerging industries, with Malaysia contributing nearly 200 of these ventures, including rising players such as Aonic, UrbanMetry, and Mesolitica, who are leading advancements in industrial automation, geospatial intelligence, and language technology.</p>
<p>“With AI-related startup investments growing since 2019 and more than MYR4.2 billion committed by Microsoft and Google to strengthen Malaysia’s AI and data-centre infrastructure, the nation is emerging as a regional hub for ethical and sustainable technological growth.</p>
<p>Cradle’s role under MOSTI continues to focus on nurturing AI-led startups, strengthening cross- border collaboration, and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals through responsible and inclusive innovation,” he added.</p>
<p>“The AI Youth Festa serves as an important platform to deepen collaboration between Korea and ASEAN in advancing digital innovation. By connecting young entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds, we are cultivating an ecosystem of cooperation, knowledge exchange and shared growth that reflects our collective aspiration for a sustainable digital future,” said Sungwoo Shin, Project Lead of NIPA.</p>
<p>The Korea–ASEAN AI Development &#038; Startup Competition 2025 forms part of the Plan of Action to Implement the ASEAN-Republic of Korea Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (2026-2030) and aligns with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP), reflecting a shared<br />
vision of connectivity, inclusivity and innovation. Through this initiative, participating agencies reaffirm their commitment to fostering a digitally empowered ASEAN–Korea community built on partnership and sustainable development.</p>
<p>The AI Youth Festa 2025 Demo Day will be held on 4 November 2025 at AICB. Participation is open to startups, investors and regional ecosystem partners. </p>

<p>The unicorn startup said in a statement on Thursday that it also reported an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of S$43 million ($32 million) and total assets of S$1.3 billion ($1 billion), according to audited FY2025 numbers.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s FY2025’s gross profit margin continued its expansion to over 12 percent, as it deepens its strategy of a strong marketplace margin expansion, ecosystem-led ancillary income growth, and productivity optimisation. </p>
<p>In the last 12 months, Carro also scaled up operations in Hong Kong and Japan, cementing its footprint outside of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Carro&#8217;s fintech business, Genie Financial Services, recorded a strong consumer loan book growth of 35 percent to S$670 million ($500 million) across the region,<br />
and kept non-performing loans (NPL) at below 0.5 percent, a number much better than industry benchmarks in the region.</p>
<p>“As we grow our differentiated ecosystem-led business operating model, we continue to focus on driving marketplace margin expansion by cross-selling ancillaries to drive recurring income streams and improve customer lifetime value, </p>
<p>&#8220;Additionally, we will continue to expand into new markets and segments, particularly in new energy vehicles (NEVs),&#8221; said Aaron Tan, Co-founder and Group Chief Executive Officer of Carro. </p>
<p>According to him, this year, the firm launched its brand new segment in Singapore and Malaysia to capture a broader customer base in the automotive value chain, and is looking to bring this to other markets. </p>
<p>At the same time, he said the firm is doubling down on its use of technology and artificial intelligence (AI), coupled with process improvements to drive productivity optimization and enable its businesses to scale better without growing costs linearly, </p>
<p>&#8220;We’re excited to share that we’ve launched our most advanced AI-enabled inspection app combining on-board diagnostics, visual, sound and vibration to improve our inspection capabilities, </p>
<p>&#8220;Our use of AI also stretches to sales conversion and customer service, which helps handle up to 85 percent of conversations and has cut down average response time by up to 80 percent to below 3 minutes in our largest markets,&#8221; he said.  </p>
<p>At the same time, he said the firm has redesigned its wholesale platforms to drive platform-led growth and improve the digital experience for both its dealers and end customers. </p>
<p>&#8220;All these are part of our bigger plan to scale at pace while exploring new initiatives,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Ernest Chew, Chief Financial Officer of Carro, said despite a challenging and unpredictable macro-environment, the firm continued focus on execution, unit economics and optimization has resulted in record volumes (+15 percent year-on-year growth), revenues and gross profit, as well as improved margins across most profitability metrics. </p>
<p>&#8220;A continuation of these efforts has seen our first half of FY2026 EBITDA growing over 50 percent year-on-year, </p>
<p>&#8220;Our overall liquidity by end FY2025 also improved year-on-year, as we continue to be extremely focused on financial discipline, vigilant on cash flows and working capital, and balance sheet strength,&#8221; he said.  </p>
<p>He also said that following the firm&#8217;s latest fundraising led by Cool Japan Fund, the firm has the strongest balance sheet position in three years. </p>
<p>&#8220;We are actively diversifying and securitizing our receivables to improve financial flexibility and strengthen our capital structure, </p>
<p>&#8220;Very pleased that our investment into Hong Kong has been strategically value-accretive, growing quickly to become a leading player domestically and profitable in the first year,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>The unicorn startup has also officially closed a $60 million round of funding led by Cool Japan Fund, a Japan&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund. </p>

<p>The firm said in a statement that investors in the round include Antler, Gang Song (angel; Ex-Tesla Vice President of Manufacturing), TSVC, and Plug and Play. </p>
<p>The funding will accelerate development and customer deployment of IndustrialMind.ai’s “AI Engineer,” with capabilities ranging from drawing-to-process automation<br />
to real-time monitoring and root-cause analysis, improving yield, increasing throughput, and shortening new-product-introduction timelines.</p>
<p>Despite broad adoption of robotics and digital tools on the shop floor, converting data into timely operational decisions remains difficult — especially during rapid ramps and complex new-product launches. </p>
<p>Having built an AI manufacturing platform that solved critical bottlenecks at Tesla’s Giga factories, the founding team is now bringing that decision-making brain to the broader industry: an AI system that understands drawings and process data, recommends concrete adjustments, and helps validate impact on real equipment. </p>
<p>The effort focuses on rebuilding the decision-making center of modern manufacturing and redefining the factory of the future.</p>
<p>“Engineers already have enough tools. They need a real trustworthy teammate, an AI Engineer,</p>
<p>&#8220;The ultimate engineer on the factory floor combines manufacturing judgment with AI capabilities and delivers verified, actionable changes,” said Steven Gao, Co-founder， Chief Executive Officer of IndustrialMind.ai.</p>
<p>Gang Song, former Tesla VP of Manufacturing and the round’s angel investor, also said this is a rare team that understands both high-volume manufacturing and state-of-the-art AI.</p>
<p>“IndustrialMind.ai has solved real bottlenecks on real lines. IndustrialMind.ai is bringing that playbook to the broader industry,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>IndustrialMind.ai’s AI Engineer spans the path from print to performance. </p>
<p>It understands drawings to extract features and automatically draft BOMs, routings, and should-cost quotes, turning “drawing to process” into a minutes-long step. </p>
<p>On the line, it monitors production in real time, detects and predicts anomalies, and offers engineer-ready adjustments that keep processes stable and quality in control. </p>
<p>When issues arise, a multi-agent root-cause engine blends knowledge and data to surface fixes and auto-generate reports, closing the loop far faster than manual methods.</p>
<p>IndustrialMind.ai is already deploying the AI Engineer with industry leaders including Siemens, tesa, and Andritz, and operates a forward-deployed model that embeds the product directly into each customer’s workflows and systems to deliver measurable value within weeks.</p>

<p>Weixin Pay said in a statement on Thursday that this collaboration will provide smoother, more convenient, and secure payment services for Chinese tourists when spending for millions of merchants of selected major banks in Thailand. </p>
<p>It will create new opportunities for Thai businesses to tap into the vast Chinese consumer market. </p>
<p>PromptPay is a national real-time payment infrastructure launched by the Bank of Thailand and NITMX. </p>
<p>Covering major banks and merchants across the country, it has become one of the most popular mobile payment methods in Thailand. </p>
<p>Through the integration with PromptPay, Chinese tourists in Thailand can simply scan a local merchant&#8217;s PromptPay QR code to pay directly in RMB using the familiar Weixin/WeChat app, eliminating the need for currency exchange or obtaining a local account. </p>
<p>Leveraging PromptPay&#8217;s nationwide coverage, Weixin Pay users will enjoy this convenience in more daily scenarios such as dining, retail, attractions, and transportation.</p>
<p>Weixin Pay has long been active in Thailand and is already widely accepted by a vast number of local merchants. </p>
<p>Weixin Pay service is already available at many popular tourist destinations and establishments – including the Bangkok BTS Skytrain, CentralWorld, 7-Eleven, McDonald&#8217;s, and numerous local Thai restaurants and durian markets. </p>
<p>Most merchants across Thailand&#8217;s three major airports – Suvarnabhumi, Don Mueang, and Phuket International Airport – also accept Weixin Pay, making travel and shopping more convenient for Chinese visitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look forward to deepening cooperation with our Thai partners to further promote regional digital payment connectivity,&#8221; said the Weixin Pay team. </p>
<p>&#8220;This partnership marks another significant step forward for Weixin Pay in cross-border payment interconnectivity, strengthening our presence in the Southeast Asian market, and aligns with the vision for building a more interconnected global payment ecosystem, </p>
<p>&#8220;In the future, Weixin Pay will continue to expand its cross-border payment network with more countries and regions, creating greater value for users and merchants worldwide,&#8221; the team added. </p>

<p>TikTok said in a statement on Wednesday that the MOU aims to strengthen Vietnam&#8217;s digital ecosystem by supporting local businesses, enabling cultural exchange, and fostering digital growth. </p>
<p>&#8220;Our partnership with the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, further underscores TikTok&#8217;s long-term commitment to fostering digital innovation and growth across the region,&#8221; said Nikhil Rolla, Head of Strategic Accounts, Southeast Asia, TikTok. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, TikTok said its platform is now home to over 460 million people in Southeast Asia, reaffirming its position as the region&#8217;s fastest-growing platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over 160 million users in Indonesia, 70 million in Vietnam, 50 million in Thailand and and the remaining 180 million spread across Southeast Asia come to TikTok every month to be entertained as they learn and discover something new,</p>
<p>&#8220;This scale represents more than just exponential growth opportunities for developers, app publishers and businesses, it also reflects our vision for Southeast Asia: to be a key driver of the region&#8217;s digital economy,&#8221; Rolla noted.</p>
<p>TikTok said the firm has evolved from an entertainment platform into a hub for app discovery and business growth across industries such as gaming, finance, travel, and retail. </p>
<p>Two in three app discoveries are intentional, and 45 percent of users continue exploring content on-platform, highlighting the platform’s role in decision-making, not just entertainment. </p>
<p>It said the platform also enables developers and businesses to reach the right audience, optimize campaigns in real time, and measure impact. </p>
<p>By combining community participation, creative storytelling, and data-driven insights, it helps apps scale efficiently while building loyalty and sustained user value.</p>
<p>Brands across Southeast Asia are also achieving stronger returns and sustained growth by using its platform, said the statement. </p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re entering a new era of creativity, one where AI accelerates imagination and sparks bold ideas, </p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission is to enable brands of all sizes to move faster, scale smarter, and stay in tune with the speed of culture.&#8221; added Rolla.</p>
<p>At the heart of this innovation is Symphony, TikTok&#8217;s generative artificial intelligence (AI) creative suite. </p>
<p>Designed to assist marketers at every stage of the content creation process, Symphony seamlessly transforms initial ideas into high-quality videos in minutes, providing complete scripts, assets, and multilingual dubbing. </p>
<p>It also enables the creation of diverse AI-powered digital avatars, allowing brands to effectively deliver their message.</p>
<p>TikTok said its platform also empowers brands to tap into the platform’s most authentic asset: its community. </p>
<p>Its Content Suite allows brands to discover high-performing, user-generated content mentioning their products—delivering over 40 times more relevant results than in-app searches—and instantly turn these videos into licensed ads.</p>
<p>It is noted that this AI-powered ecosystem is complemented by Smart+, TikTok’s intelligent performance solution. </p>
<p>Smart+ automates and optimizes campaigns across targeting, bidding, and creative selection, and works with Symphony to enhance existing assets or generate new, high-potential videos, ensuring campaigns remain fresh and effective without manual intervention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is simple. We want every app to reach its audience, connect deeply, and scale meaningful results on TikTok, </p>
<p>&#8220;Through the integration of creativity, technology, and insight, we’re helping brands and developers thrive in Southeast Asia’s rapidly evolving digital landscape,&#8221; said Rolla.</p>

<p>The trio said in a statement on Wednesday that they aim to catalyze tech development and business growth in the local AI ecosystem.</p>
<p>The new collaboration builds on the AI Accelerate program, jointly run by NUS Enterprise’s BLOCK71, a global network of physical accelerators across 11 cities, and Microsoft. </p>
<p>The existing program features a 10-week incubator for startups, where they can build on Microsoft Azure, refine their AI products, and tap on expert guidance for business strategy and fundraising. </p>
<p>Participating startups can also access mentorship and networking opportunities with venture capital investors and AI ecosystem players.</p>
<p>The 2025 cohort saw a total of 26 startups across a wide range of sectors.</p>
<p>Microsoft, Enterprise Singapore and NUS Enterprise have now joined forces to expand the AI Accelerate program beyond helping founders refine their technology and prepare products for market, to now enabling them to launch effectively and grow commercially, both in Singapore and abroad. </p>
<p>Under the new tripartite collaboration, this enhanced edition introduces a Go-To-Market (GTM) program, with Microsoft experts providing startups with practical guidance for achieving product-market fit and commercialization, enabling them to scale more effectively in regional and global markets.</p>
<p>Enterprise Singapore, through the Digital Industry Singapore (DISG) joint office, will also work with Microsoft to fast-track access to the Startup SG Tech grant for qualified startups. </p>
<p>This leverages Microsoft’s expertise in AI to jointly select high-potential startups for grant funding as part of a panel comprising of experts representing industry and venture capital. </p>
<p>Grants can be used to support key activities that contribute towards the development and commercialization of the innovative AI solutions, including for the filing of IP, use of cloud and AI to build their products, talent acquisition, and more.</p>
<p>“This collaboration will make a real difference to startups, actively shaping the future of AI and innovation in Asia,</p>
<p>&#8220;With support from NUS Enterprise and Enterprise Singapore, combined with Microsoft’s platforms, expertise, and unmatched sales and distribution ecosystem, entrepreneurs<br />
will have the tools and resources they need to build their ideas, reach customers, and scale beyond borders,&#8221; Microsoft ASEAN President, Mayank Wadhwa said. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Enterprise Singapore Managing Director, Cindy Khoo said there’s no question that AI is a game-changer for industries and businesses. </p>
<p>&#8220;But we need to be proactive to unlock its transformative potential, and establish the right platforms and partnerships to drive AI innovation,</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to be working with Microsoft and NUS Enterprise to accelerate funding and commercialization opportunities for cutting-edge AI startups, and grow not<br />
just the next generation of companies but also deepen Singapore’s AI ecosystem,&#8221; she added. </p>
<p>NUS Senior Vice President (Innovation and Enterprise), Dr Tan Sian Wee, also said at NUS Enterprise, their mission goes beyond nurturing startups. </p>
<p>&#8220;We are shaping ventures that can create lasting impact and drive meaningful change. This collaboration strengthens that ambition by giving AI startups access to world-class technology, networks, and expertise, helping them grow from strong ideas into globally competitive companies,</p>
<p>&#8220;Together with Microsoft and Enterprise Singapore, we aim to connect research, talent, and industry in new ways that will accelerate innovation and position Singapore as a leader in the AI economy.”&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Applications are now open for the upcoming AI Accelerate program, and with the recent surge in interest, the application deadline has extended to November 14, 2025.</p>
<p>To qualify for AI Accelerate 2026, startups must be Singapore-based and post-MVP, with traction such as users, pilots, or revenue. </p>
<p>They must operate in business to business (B2B) or scalable business to consumer (B2C) markets, have AI at the core of their product, be rooted in Asia with global ambitions, and<br />
be privately held. </p>
<p>The 10-week sprint begins in January 2026, culminating in an Investor Day in May 2026, where graduating startups will pitch to venture capitalists and corporate partners.</p>

<p>The firm said in a statement that the company generated adjusted pre-tax profit of Rp 62 billion ($3.74 million) during the quarter, an increase of Rp 728 billion year on year. </p>
<p>The group&#8217;s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) reached Rp 516 billion, an improvement of 239 percent year on year. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, its EBITDA was positive for the fourth consecutive quarter, reaching Rp 369 billion, an increase of Rp 455 billion year on year. </p>
<p>These improvements resulted from stronger revenue performance and disciplined cost management.</p>
<p>The group&#8217;s core gross transaction value (GTV) reached Rp 102.8 trillion, a 43 percent year on year increase. </p>
<p>The group’s total GTV climbed to Rp 176 trillion, up 28 percent year on year, while net revenue grew 21 percent year on year to Rp 4.7 trillion. </p>
<p>Its annual transacting users (ATU) in Indonesia rose 33 percent to 61.1 million, amounting to around 30 percent of the country’s adult population.</p>
<p>GoTo expects continued growth and profitability as it leverages the scale and synergy of its ecosystem. </p>
<p>The company raises its full-year 2025 Group adjusted EBITDA guidance from Rp 1.4-1.6 trillion to Rp 1.8-1.9 trillion and remains confident in meeting its targets.</p>
<p>This outlook is based on current market conditions and reflects the company&#8217;s preliminary estimates, which are all subject to various uncertainties and risks including increasing market competition, cost inflation, macroeconomic conditions and other variables.</p>
<p>“GoTo Group continues to deliver growth while improving profitability as we advance toward our vision of becoming a world class technology platform used by all Indonesians, </p>
<p>&#8220;In the third quarter, we reached another milestone, generating an adjusted pre-tax profit  for the first time, amounting to Rp 62 billion,&#8221; said Patrick Walujo, GoTo Group Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given this momentum, we are raising our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to between Rp 1.8 trillion and Rp 1.9 trillion, underscoring the confidence we have in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and long-term value for all stakeholders, </p>
<p>&#8220;Our focus remains clear &#8211; to deliver consistent, delightful, and cost-effective products for consumers while maximizing income for driver-partners and merchants,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Simon Ho, GoTo Group Chief Financial Officer, said the firm&#8217;s third-quarter results reflect continued progress in efficiency and financial discipline across the business. </p>
<p>According to him, the firm achieved another record for group adjusted EBITDA and generated positive adjusted free cash flow, supported by revenue growth and disciplined cost management.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks to disciplined execution and focused investment, we’ve been able to grow, serve more users, and do so more efficiently, </p>
<p>&#8220;As our ecosystem scales, we are strengthening profitability and building a resilient financial foundation for the future,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>The company also achieved positive adjusted free cash flow amounting to Rp 247 billion reflecting strengthened operating and financial performance.</p>
<p>GoTo’s e-commerce service fee from PT Tokopedia reached Rp 211 billion in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The company maintains a solid cash position and balance sheet. As of 30 September 2025, it held Rp 18 trillion ($1.1 billion) in cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposits.</p>
<p>The company has also advanced its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. </p>
<p>Its next large language model (LLM) entered training during the quarter, delivering higher efficiency using fewer GPUs while outperforming the previous 70-billion-parameter model. </p>
<p>GoTo also launched a shared internal AI platform providing standardized access to GPUs, models, and reusable components, which will improve development velocity and reduce costs over time.</p>
<p>According to the firm, AI is being progressively integrated across the ecosystem ultimately enabling substantially improved user experience, and reduced time‐to‐market and costs. </p>
<p>AI and automation helped lift customer satisfaction by 6 percent during the quarter as initial response times were reduced and resolutions were reached quickly. </p>
<p>Pilots in the company’s collections operations are also delivering better connection and repayment performance than third‐party tools, at a lower cost to serve.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="150" height="150" src="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-6-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" srcset="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-6-150x150.jpg 150w, https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-6-348x348.jpg 348w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><p>Global Affairs Canada is deepening its commitment to regional cybersecurity capacity-building by expanding its investment in advancing cybersecurity capacity building through the Malaysia Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) and BlackBerry Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (CCoE) in Cyberjaya of Malaysia. </p>
<p>BlackBerry said in a statement on Wednesday that under this initiative, Global Affairs Canada will provide C$226,000 ($162,161) to upskill and train cyber-defenders from across ASEAN delivered at the CCoE by BlackBerry in collaboration with MCMC. </p>
<p>Announced during the 47th ASEAN Leaders Summit in Kuala Lumpur, the two-year investment will cover the training, for 100 government and select civil society professionals at the Malaysia CCoE in Cyberjaya. </p>
<p>The MCMC and BlackBerry CCoE serves as Malaysia’s national hub for cyber-capacity development and ASEAN regional training.</p>
<p>“Our new government is investing in the Canadian ingenuity that powers and secures economies worldwide, while expanding our footprint in the Indo-Pacific,&#8221; said Mark Carney, Prime Minister of Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;This investment supports BlackBerry – a Canadian success story – in strengthening its global leadership, </p>
<p>&#8220;It reflects our vision: Canadian innovation fueling global markets and building secure, resilient digital infrastructure,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>This additional funding builds on Canada’s C$3.9 million ($2.8 million) investment in cybersecurity training and education announced in 2024. </p>
<p>This funding will strengthen cybersecurity partnerships and expertise in the region through enhanced training opportunities for professionals pursuing careers in cyber resilience. </p>
<p>In collaboration with BlackBerry, MCMC and the Toronto Metropolitan University’s Rogers Cybersecure Catalyst (the Catalyst), the first courses are commencing in November 2025 under this first phase of funding.</p>
<p>The additional funding announced by Prime Minister Carney will support specialized programming scheduled for 2026, including a five-day intensive ASEAN Week from February 9–13. </p>
<p>It will feature a non-technical track covering foundational concepts and a technical track delivering advanced training, including the Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst Fundamentals. </p>
<p>Another key component of the program is a dedicated Women&#8217;s Program for ten candidates from ASEAN Member States, to be delivered in partnership with TMU Rogers ‘the Catalyst’. </p>
<p>The initiative is part of a broader vision of the Canada-Malaysia agreement, to train approximately 3,500 participants, with a target of 25 percent women, across<br />
the region.</p>
<p>“The MCMC and BlackBerry CCoE is a vital hub for developing cyber talent both nationally and across the region, and we are proud to join with the government of Canada and Malaysia to enhance the curriculum and increase access to cyber training, </p>
<p>&#8220;As we continue to innovate and enhance the facility, participants from Malaysia and ASEAN will also benefit from hands-on experience to better prepare them for the real-world of cybersecurity,&#8221; said John Giamatteo, Chief Executive Officer of BlackBerry.</p>
<p>Since opening its doors in 2024, the MCMC and BlackBerry CCoE has trained over 5500 people, delivering more than 36,000 hours of training, and offers a range of over 55 courses, together with globally-certified training partners such as SANS, ISC2, CompTIA and EC-Council. </p>
<p>BlackBerry and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) also just signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the sidelines of the 47th ASEAN Summit, announcing a multi-<br />
year education partnership to develop the nation’s next generation of cyber-leaders and embedded software engineers.</p>
<p>In addition to the ASEAN curriculum expansion, the facility is also undergoing a transformative upgrade, featuring high-performance labs, a cyber “war room,” a Security Operations Centre (SOC) simulator, and interactive kiosks. </p>
<p>These enhancements will provide cyber defenders with immersive, real-world training opportunities, in addition to its widerange of in-person and online courses – which cater for flexible, self-paced learning.</p>
