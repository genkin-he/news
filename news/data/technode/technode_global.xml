      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="150" height="150" src="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image001-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" srcset="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image001-348x348.jpg 348w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/en/">TikTok</a>, the subsidiary of the China-based tech firm ByteDance, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Center of Digital Transformation under Vietnam&#8217;s Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism to boost the country&#8217;s digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>TikTok said in a statement on Wednesday that the MOU aims to strengthen Vietnam&#8217;s digital ecosystem by supporting local businesses, enabling cultural exchange, and fostering digital growth. </p>
<p>&#8220;Our partnership with the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, further underscores TikTok&#8217;s long-term commitment to fostering digital innovation and growth across the region,&#8221; said Nikhil Rolla, Head of Strategic Accounts, Southeast Asia, TikTok. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, TikTok said its platform is now home to over 460 million people in Southeast Asia, reaffirming its position as the region&#8217;s fastest-growing platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over 160 million users in Indonesia, 70 million in Vietnam, 50 million in Thailand and and the remaining 180 million spread across Southeast Asia come to TikTok every month to be entertained as they learn and discover something new,</p>
<p>&#8220;This scale represents more than just exponential growth opportunities for developers, app publishers and businesses, it also reflects our vision for Southeast Asia: to be a key driver of the region&#8217;s digital economy,&#8221; Rolla noted.</p>
<p>TikTok said the firm has evolved from an entertainment platform into a hub for app discovery and business growth across industries such as gaming, finance, travel, and retail. </p>
<p>Two in three app discoveries are intentional, and 45 percent of users continue exploring content on-platform, highlighting the platform’s role in decision-making, not just entertainment. </p>
<p>It said the platform also enables developers and businesses to reach the right audience, optimize campaigns in real time, and measure impact. </p>
<p>By combining community participation, creative storytelling, and data-driven insights, it helps apps scale efficiently while building loyalty and sustained user value.</p>
<p>Brands across Southeast Asia are also achieving stronger returns and sustained growth by using its platform, said the statement. </p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re entering a new era of creativity, one where AI accelerates imagination and sparks bold ideas, </p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission is to enable brands of all sizes to move faster, scale smarter, and stay in tune with the speed of culture.&#8221; added Rolla.</p>
<p>At the heart of this innovation is Symphony, TikTok&#8217;s generative artificial intelligence (AI) creative suite. </p>
<p>Designed to assist marketers at every stage of the content creation process, Symphony seamlessly transforms initial ideas into high-quality videos in minutes, providing complete scripts, assets, and multilingual dubbing. </p>
<p>It also enables the creation of diverse AI-powered digital avatars, allowing brands to effectively deliver their message.</p>
<p>TikTok said its platform also empowers brands to tap into the platform’s most authentic asset: its community. </p>
<p>Its Content Suite allows brands to discover high-performing, user-generated content mentioning their products—delivering over 40 times more relevant results than in-app searches—and instantly turn these videos into licensed ads.</p>
<p>It is noted that this AI-powered ecosystem is complemented by Smart+, TikTok’s intelligent performance solution. </p>
<p>Smart+ automates and optimizes campaigns across targeting, bidding, and creative selection, and works with Symphony to enhance existing assets or generate new, high-potential videos, ensuring campaigns remain fresh and effective without manual intervention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is simple. We want every app to reach its audience, connect deeply, and scale meaningful results on TikTok, </p>
<p>&#8220;Through the integration of creativity, technology, and insight, we’re helping brands and developers thrive in Southeast Asia’s rapidly evolving digital landscape,&#8221; said Rolla.</p>

<p>The trio said in a statement on Wednesday that they aim to catalyze tech development and business growth in the local AI ecosystem.</p>
<p>The new collaboration builds on the AI Accelerate program, jointly run by NUS Enterprise’s BLOCK71, a global network of physical accelerators across 11 cities, and Microsoft. </p>
<p>The existing program features a 10-week incubator for startups, where they can build on Microsoft Azure, refine their AI products, and tap on expert guidance for business strategy and fundraising. </p>
<p>Participating startups can also access mentorship and networking opportunities with venture capital investors and AI ecosystem players.</p>
<p>The 2025 cohort saw a total of 26 startups across a wide range of sectors.</p>
<p>Microsoft, Enterprise Singapore and NUS Enterprise have now joined forces to expand the AI Accelerate program beyond helping founders refine their technology and prepare products for market, to now enabling them to launch effectively and grow commercially, both in Singapore and abroad. </p>
<p>Under the new tripartite collaboration, this enhanced edition introduces a Go-To-Market (GTM) program, with Microsoft experts providing startups with practical guidance for achieving product-market fit and commercialization, enabling them to scale more effectively in regional and global markets.</p>
<p>Enterprise Singapore, through the Digital Industry Singapore (DISG) joint office, will also work with Microsoft to fast-track access to the Startup SG Tech grant for qualified startups. </p>
<p>This leverages Microsoft’s expertise in AI to jointly select high-potential startups for grant funding as part of a panel comprising of experts representing industry and venture capital. </p>
<p>Grants can be used to support key activities that contribute towards the development and commercialization of the innovative AI solutions, including for the filing of IP, use of cloud and AI to build their products, talent acquisition, and more.</p>
<p>“This collaboration will make a real difference to startups, actively shaping the future of AI and innovation in Asia,</p>
<p>&#8220;With support from NUS Enterprise and Enterprise Singapore, combined with Microsoft’s platforms, expertise, and unmatched sales and distribution ecosystem, entrepreneurs<br />
will have the tools and resources they need to build their ideas, reach customers, and scale beyond borders,&#8221; Microsoft ASEAN President, Mayank Wadhwa said. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Enterprise Singapore Managing Director, Cindy Khoo said there’s no question that AI is a game-changer for industries and businesses. </p>
<p>&#8220;But we need to be proactive to unlock its transformative potential, and establish the right platforms and partnerships to drive AI innovation,</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to be working with Microsoft and NUS Enterprise to accelerate funding and commercialization opportunities for cutting-edge AI startups, and grow not<br />
just the next generation of companies but also deepen Singapore’s AI ecosystem,&#8221; she added. </p>
<p>NUS Senior Vice President (Innovation and Enterprise), Dr Tan Sian Wee, also said at NUS Enterprise, their mission goes beyond nurturing startups. </p>
<p>&#8220;We are shaping ventures that can create lasting impact and drive meaningful change. This collaboration strengthens that ambition by giving AI startups access to world-class technology, networks, and expertise, helping them grow from strong ideas into globally competitive companies,</p>
<p>&#8220;Together with Microsoft and Enterprise Singapore, we aim to connect research, talent, and industry in new ways that will accelerate innovation and position Singapore as a leader in the AI economy.”&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Applications are now open for the upcoming AI Accelerate program, and with the recent surge in interest, the application deadline has extended to November 14, 2025.</p>
<p>To qualify for AI Accelerate 2026, startups must be Singapore-based and post-MVP, with traction such as users, pilots, or revenue. </p>
<p>They must operate in business to business (B2B) or scalable business to consumer (B2C) markets, have AI at the core of their product, be rooted in Asia with global ambitions, and<br />
be privately held. </p>
<p>The 10-week sprint begins in January 2026, culminating in an Investor Day in May 2026, where graduating startups will pitch to venture capitalists and corporate partners.</p>

<p>The firm said in a statement that the company generated adjusted pre-tax profit of Rp 62 billion ($3.74 million) during the quarter, an increase of Rp 728 billion year on year. </p>
<p>The group&#8217;s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) reached Rp 516 billion, an improvement of 239 percent year on year. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, its EBITDA was positive for the fourth consecutive quarter, reaching Rp 369 billion, an increase of Rp 455 billion year on year. </p>
<p>These improvements resulted from stronger revenue performance and disciplined cost management.</p>
<p>The group&#8217;s core gross transaction value (GTV) reached Rp 102.8 trillion, a 43 percent year on year increase. </p>
<p>The group’s total GTV climbed to Rp 176 trillion, up 28 percent year on year, while net revenue grew 21 percent year on year to Rp 4.7 trillion. </p>
<p>Its annual transacting users (ATU) in Indonesia rose 33 percent to 61.1 million, amounting to around 30 percent of the country’s adult population.</p>
<p>GoTo expects continued growth and profitability as it leverages the scale and synergy of its ecosystem. </p>
<p>The company raises its full-year 2025 Group adjusted EBITDA guidance from Rp 1.4-1.6 trillion to Rp 1.8-1.9 trillion and remains confident in meeting its targets.</p>
<p>This outlook is based on current market conditions and reflects the company&#8217;s preliminary estimates, which are all subject to various uncertainties and risks including increasing market competition, cost inflation, macroeconomic conditions and other variables.</p>
<p>“GoTo Group continues to deliver growth while improving profitability as we advance toward our vision of becoming a world class technology platform used by all Indonesians, </p>
<p>&#8220;In the third quarter, we reached another milestone, generating an adjusted pre-tax profit  for the first time, amounting to Rp 62 billion,&#8221; said Patrick Walujo, GoTo Group Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given this momentum, we are raising our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to between Rp 1.8 trillion and Rp 1.9 trillion, underscoring the confidence we have in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and long-term value for all stakeholders, </p>
<p>&#8220;Our focus remains clear &#8211; to deliver consistent, delightful, and cost-effective products for consumers while maximizing income for driver-partners and merchants,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Simon Ho, GoTo Group Chief Financial Officer, said the firm&#8217;s third-quarter results reflect continued progress in efficiency and financial discipline across the business. </p>
<p>According to him, the firm achieved another record for group adjusted EBITDA and generated positive adjusted free cash flow, supported by revenue growth and disciplined cost management.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks to disciplined execution and focused investment, we’ve been able to grow, serve more users, and do so more efficiently, </p>
<p>&#8220;As our ecosystem scales, we are strengthening profitability and building a resilient financial foundation for the future,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>The company also achieved positive adjusted free cash flow amounting to Rp 247 billion reflecting strengthened operating and financial performance.</p>
<p>GoTo’s e-commerce service fee from PT Tokopedia reached Rp 211 billion in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The company maintains a solid cash position and balance sheet. As of 30 September 2025, it held Rp 18 trillion ($1.1 billion) in cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposits.</p>
<p>The company has also advanced its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. </p>
<p>Its next large language model (LLM) entered training during the quarter, delivering higher efficiency using fewer GPUs while outperforming the previous 70-billion-parameter model. </p>
<p>GoTo also launched a shared internal AI platform providing standardized access to GPUs, models, and reusable components, which will improve development velocity and reduce costs over time.</p>
<p>According to the firm, AI is being progressively integrated across the ecosystem ultimately enabling substantially improved user experience, and reduced time‐to‐market and costs. </p>
<p>AI and automation helped lift customer satisfaction by 6 percent during the quarter as initial response times were reduced and resolutions were reached quickly. </p>
<p>Pilots in the company’s collections operations are also delivering better connection and repayment performance than third‐party tools, at a lower cost to serve.</p>

<p>BlackBerry said in a statement on Wednesday that under this initiative, Global Affairs Canada will provide C$226,000 ($162,161) to upskill and train cyber-defenders from across ASEAN delivered at the CCoE by BlackBerry in collaboration with MCMC. </p>
<p>Announced during the 47th ASEAN Leaders Summit in Kuala Lumpur, the two-year investment will cover the training, for 100 government and select civil society professionals at the Malaysia CCoE in Cyberjaya. </p>
<p>The MCMC and BlackBerry CCoE serves as Malaysia’s national hub for cyber-capacity development and ASEAN regional training.</p>
<p>“Our new government is investing in the Canadian ingenuity that powers and secures economies worldwide, while expanding our footprint in the Indo-Pacific,&#8221; said Mark Carney, Prime Minister of Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;This investment supports BlackBerry – a Canadian success story – in strengthening its global leadership, </p>
<p>&#8220;It reflects our vision: Canadian innovation fueling global markets and building secure, resilient digital infrastructure,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>This additional funding builds on Canada’s C$3.9 million ($2.8 million) investment in cybersecurity training and education announced in 2024. </p>
<p>This funding will strengthen cybersecurity partnerships and expertise in the region through enhanced training opportunities for professionals pursuing careers in cyber resilience. </p>
<p>In collaboration with BlackBerry, MCMC and the Toronto Metropolitan University’s Rogers Cybersecure Catalyst (the Catalyst), the first courses are commencing in November 2025 under this first phase of funding.</p>
<p>The additional funding announced by Prime Minister Carney will support specialized programming scheduled for 2026, including a five-day intensive ASEAN Week from February 9–13. </p>
<p>It will feature a non-technical track covering foundational concepts and a technical track delivering advanced training, including the Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst Fundamentals. </p>
<p>Another key component of the program is a dedicated Women&#8217;s Program for ten candidates from ASEAN Member States, to be delivered in partnership with TMU Rogers ‘the Catalyst’. </p>
<p>The initiative is part of a broader vision of the Canada-Malaysia agreement, to train approximately 3,500 participants, with a target of 25 percent women, across<br />
the region.</p>
<p>“The MCMC and BlackBerry CCoE is a vital hub for developing cyber talent both nationally and across the region, and we are proud to join with the government of Canada and Malaysia to enhance the curriculum and increase access to cyber training, </p>
<p>&#8220;As we continue to innovate and enhance the facility, participants from Malaysia and ASEAN will also benefit from hands-on experience to better prepare them for the real-world of cybersecurity,&#8221; said John Giamatteo, Chief Executive Officer of BlackBerry.</p>
<p>Since opening its doors in 2024, the MCMC and BlackBerry CCoE has trained over 5500 people, delivering more than 36,000 hours of training, and offers a range of over 55 courses, together with globally-certified training partners such as SANS, ISC2, CompTIA and EC-Council. </p>
<p>BlackBerry and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) also just signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the sidelines of the 47th ASEAN Summit, announcing a multi-<br />
year education partnership to develop the nation’s next generation of cyber-leaders and embedded software engineers.</p>
<p>In addition to the ASEAN curriculum expansion, the facility is also undergoing a transformative upgrade, featuring high-performance labs, a cyber “war room,” a Security Operations Centre (SOC) simulator, and interactive kiosks. </p>
<p>These enhancements will provide cyber defenders with immersive, real-world training opportunities, in addition to its widerange of in-person and online courses – which cater for flexible, self-paced learning.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="150" height="150" src="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-29-200402-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" srcset="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-29-200402-150x150.png 150w, https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-29-200402-348x348.png 348w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><p>Singapore-based <a href="https://www.airwallex.com/my">Airwallex</a> has announced the global launch of its refreshed ‘Airwallex for Startups’ program, a comprehensive initiative designed to help founders turn finance into a growth engine for their businesses. </p>
<p>The program positions financial operations as a strategic driver of scalability, resilience, and innovation rather than a back-office function, the firm said in a statement on Wednesday. </p>
<p>It is noted that globally, 90 percent of startups fail, and nearly two in five (38 percent) stall because they run out of cash. </p>
<p>Airwallex noted that when companies cannot effectively manage their financial operations, even strong business models and growing revenue are no guarantee of survival.</p>
<p>It’s precisely this gap that the ‘Airwallex for Startups’ program will address. </p>
<p>The program will begin in Singapore before expanding to other markets in the coming months. </p>
<p>It combines Airwallex’s financial infrastructure with hands-on Chief Financial Officer (CFO) mentorship and an artificial intelligence (AI) innovation sandbox, going far beyond traditional startup programs by helping founders build resilient financial foundations and scalable growth models.</p>
<p>Previously, the program supported startups across multiple regions with access to Airwallex’s financial infrastructure, startup perks, and community-building events – including a pitch competition in Singapore judged by a panel that included the Singapore Fintech Association – as well as learning and networking sessions with the likes of Square Peg, Jungle Ventures, and NextGen Ventures, Australia&#8217;s first student-focused venture capital fund. </p>
<p>Startups in select regions also had the opportunity to win business acceleration grants worth $10,000 in their respective local currencies. </p>
<p>Building on that foundation, this next phase takes the mission further by equipping founders with the tools, guidance, and networks they need to grow beyond borders with confidence.</p>
<p>“The best ideas don’t just need funding; they need the right financial foundations to scale,” said Lucy Liu, Co-founder and President, Airwallex. </p>
<p>“Feedback from our community has sharpened our focus, </p>
<p>&#8220;We’re now aligning our expertise and experience to deliver what founders value most from Airwallex: access to the tools, knowledge, and networks that turn financial operations into a growth advantage,&#8221; she added. </p>
<p>The &#8216;Airwallex for Startups’ program is built on three core pillars designed to maximize founder success.</p>
<p>Firstly, stage-appropriate financial infrastructure. Startups gain access to Airwallex products and financial perks designed to make every dollar count. </p>
<p>Benefits scale with funding stage – from pre-seed through Series A and beyond – ensuring support grows alongside each company’s trajectory.</p>
<p>Secondly, strategic financial mentorship. Founders receive ongoing access to veteran finance leaders through the Startup CFO Expert Panel. </p>
<p>These CFOs have guided some of the region’s most successful tech companies through hypergrowth and downturns alike. </p>
<p>Participants join small-group sessions and operator-led masterclasses covering cash-flow and burn optimization, valuation and cap-table strategy, fundraising preparation, and investor relations.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the AI Sandbox which provides a differentiated innovation track for AI-native startups. </p>
<p>Selected teams receive real challenge statements from Airwallex – such as customer-acquisition or workflow-automation problems – and collaborate directly with internal champions to design and test solutions in live conditions.</p>
<p>The most promising teams may go on to develop design-partner relationships with Airwallex, gaining early customer validation and proof points to accelerate future fundraising. </p>
<p>The inaugural cohort focuses on growth and productivity use cases.</p>
<p>Beyond these pillars, Airwallex has also partnered with OpenAI, Google Cloud, HubSpot, and other leading platforms to provide founders with an integrated stack of exclusive perks across AI, cloud infrastructure, and growth tools. </p>
<p>This ecosystem approach creates a multiplier effect that extends beyond financial services alone, giving startups the complete toolkit they need to build, ship, and scale faster.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="150" height="150" src="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-29-193906-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" srcset="https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-29-193906-150x150.png 150w, https://technode.global/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-29-193906-348x348.png 348w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><p><a href="https://www.hyd-gen.com/">HYDGEN</a>, a Singapore and India-based green hydrogen innovator with proprietary anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer technology, has closed a $5 million Pre-A funding round, including equity and debt. </p>
<p>The firm said in a statement on Tuesday that the round was led by Transition Venture Capital (India), with participation from Cloudberry Pioneer Investments (Europe), Moringa Ventures (Singapore), and strategic family offices from India and Singapore. </p>
<p>The funding will accelerate HYDGEN’s aim to deliver ultra-pure, cost-efficient hydrogen available directly at the point of use.</p>
<p>With the new funding, HYDGEN will upgrade their current manufacturing facility in Mangalore, India to a semi-automated assembly line, providing a cost-efficient manufacturing hub for Asia and global markets.</p>
<p>It will also increase single AEM stack capacity to 250 kW, cementing HYDGEN’s leadership in industrial-scale AEM electrolyzers.</p>
<p>The funding also allows the firm to expand its presence in global markets like Japan, Europe and Middle East, where policy incentives and industrial hydrogen adoption are accelerating.</p>
<p>The firm will also be able to support commercialization efforts for on-site hydrogen generation for industrial users.</p>
<p>“Many discussions about hydrogen focus on its role in a clean energy future, but the urgent opportunity is enabling industries to have hydrogen where and when they need it, with purity they can trust, </p>
<p>“Our AEM electrolyzers allow companies to produce hydrogen on-site at a competitive cost, solving supply chain challenges today while preparing them for the broader transition to green hydrogen in the years ahead,&#8221; said Dr. Manipaddy Krishna Kumar, Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer of HYDGEN.</p>
<p>It is noted that HYDGEN has developed a new class of AEM electrolyzers, combining the affordability of alkaline technology with the energy efficiency and operating flexibility of PEM, while eliminating the need for expensive platina-group metals.</p>
<p>“HYDGEN is the first team we’ve seen that can scale AEM electrolyzers to true industrial levels while maintaining cost leadership, </p>
<p>“This is not a research project anymore, it’s a commercially ready platform for industries already spending billions on hydrogen,&#8221; said Mohamed Shoeb Ali, Managing Partner at Transition VC.</p>
<p>Over the past year, HYDGEN has launched pilots across India, Singapore, and Southeast Asia, with several partners now scaling deployments, validating both market demand and technology readiness.</p>
<p>“What impressed us was HYDGEN’s ability to combine high-purity output with a low-CAPEX modular design,</p>
<p>“That combination is exactly what industrial users need to decarbonize today,&#8221; said Mahir Sahin, Founding Partner at Cloudberry Pioneer Investments.</p>
<p>These deployments demonstrate that HYDGEN’s solutions not only meet the purity and operational requirements of advanced industries, but also offer a practical, cost-efficient path to decarbonization, said the statement. </p>
<p>It is noted that global policy support, from India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission to Canada’s Clean Hydrogen Investment Tax Credit, is accelerating the adoption. </p>
<p>Across Europe and Asia, governments are offering grants and subsidies for industrial decarbonization.</p>
<p>Yet HYDGEN’s value proposition stands on its own: replacing trucked-in cylinders with on-site generation delivers immediate cost and reliability benefits, with incentives<br />
serving as an added accelerator.</p>
<p>“Hydrogen is central to the world’s industrial and energy transition, yet much of today’s supply remains carbon-intensive and costly to transport,&#8221; said Theodora Lai, Partner and Co-founder, Moringa Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe decentralized hydrogen production will reshape the $260 billion global hydrogen market, </p>
<p>&#8220;HYDGEN’s scalable AEM technology puts them ahead of that curve — solving industrial challenges while accelerating the clean transition — an innovation we’re proud to back at Moringa Ventures,” he added.</p>
<p>Dr. Goutam Dalapati, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of HYDGEN, also highlighted that the firm aims to make green hydrogen cheaper, purer, and always available where industries need it most.</p>

<p>The firm said in a statement on Wednesday that 2C2P’s additional investments in technology, infrastructure, and innovation is a reflection of the company’s investment in Southeast Asia. </p>
<p>The company is committed to making payments more accessible across the region and for its diverse demographic, and is also doubling-down on investing in local talent to develop the ‘Silicon Valley of Southeast Asia’.</p>
<p>“Our commitment goes beyond product innovation and serving merchants, </p>
<p>&#8220;We are also investing in the next generation of Southeast Asia’s fintech talent and forging strategic partnerships with local and global businesses that will enable the region to remain at the forefront of financial technology,” said 2C2P’s Chief Executive Officer-elect Worachat Luxkanalode.</p>
<p>The firm has also introduced new business priorities and branding to symbolize its next phase of growth alongside its parent company Antom. </p>
<p>As part of Antom, a leading merchant payment and digitization services provider under Ant International, 2C2P plays a vital role in advancing Antom’s strategy to empower businesses of all sizes across the region with secure, seamless, and innovative financial solutions.</p>

<p>According to the statement, the combination of 2C2P’s Southeast Asia enterprise payment expertise and Antom’s technologies and extensive global network will provide Southeast Asia businesses of all sizes with robust financial solutions to thrive in a rapidly changing environment.</p>
<p>“With this unveiling, we are committed to becoming the trusted and innovative fintech partner of choice in Southeast Asia, </p>
<p>&#8220;We have evolved from serving primarily large enterprises to empowering businesses of all sizes, and from focusing on digital and online payments to delivering true omnichannel<br />
capabilities that connect online, mobile, and offline transactions,&#8221; said Worachat Luxkanalode, Chief Executive Officer-elect of 2C2P.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gary Liu, General Manager of Antom, Ant International, said 2C2P&#8217;s evolution marks a new step in Antom&#8217;s commitment to supporting businesses of all sizes worldwide. </p>
<p>As Antom&#8217;s major brand in Southeast Asia, he said the 2C2P team is well positioned to offer merchants tailored products that best meet their needs. </p>

<p>“After the acquisition of Influential 18 months ago and Captiv8 earlier this year, to build the world’s most powerful connected influencer platform, we’re doubling down on data-driven creator marketing in what is a highly strategic region for Publicis and our clients, </p>
<p>&#8220;Through the combination of HEPMIL’s reach, content expertise and social platforms with the power of Publicis’ identity graph and our unique media ecosystem, we’re building South East Asia’s first end-to-end influencer solution, enabling clients to unite social strategy, influencer management and cross-platform content to deliver creator solutions that drive to real, measurable business outcomes,&#8221; said Arthur Sadoun, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Publicis Groupe.</p>
<p>Amrita Randhawa, Chief Executive Officer of Publicis Groupe Singapore and Southeast Asia, said parts of the solution that is right for clients exist in all parts of industry. </p>
<p>&#8220;But no one has brought everything together meaningfully in Southeast Asia. We will change that,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>According to her, HEPMIL’s origins as the creators of some of Southeast Asia’s most loved consumer content has helped redefine how brands can show up natively, authentically, and with real-time cultural relevance. </p>
<p>&#8220;Now powered by the artificial intelligence (AI), data and platform prowess of Publicis Groupe we will ensure every dollar of clients’ social and influence spend is genuine, accountable and in service of growth in Southeast Asia,” she added. </p>
<p>HEPMIL serves over 450 brands through its relationships with over 3,000 high-value creators, with a total creator reach of over 1 billion in six Southeast Asian markets.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, the company&#8217;s origins trace back to its next-generation media platforms SGAG (established in 2012), MGAG and PGAG which are loved by over 70 million people in Southeast Asia and have become household names. </p>
<p>A focus on creator-led storytelling, culturally relevant formats and deep relationships with creators who have grown with HEPMIL through HEPMIL Creators Network (HCN), has seen the Southeast Asia born agency to accelerate by double digits since inception.</p>
<p>It is noted that influencer marketing is set to grow between 12 percent to 15 percent in Southeast Asia over the next five years with influencer marketing spend likely to exceed $1.4 billion by 2030. </p>
<p>HEPMIL has unparalleled expertise in building digital communities, empowering local creators, and delivering platform-native branded content that engages audiences and drives growth for clients. </p>
<p>“Today marks the beginning of the next chapter of our acceleration, </p>
<p>&#8220;This opportunity to work with the entire team in Publicis Groupe Southeast Asia and globally is going to unlock so much more value for our business, client partners, creator network and our employees.” said Karl Mak, Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder of HEPMIL Media Group.  </p>
<p>According to the statement, HEPMIL will continue to operate as a brand, and work in close collaboration with Publicis Groupe teams across South East Asia.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.</p>

<p>The firm said in a statement on Tuesday that the company has reported stable performance amid a dynamic technology landscape and challenging market conditions, maintaining consistent growth across several business segments.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s contribution margin remained stable, underscoring strong operational efficiency and disciplined cost management despite ongoing market volatility. </p>
<p>Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) remained relatively stable over the past three quarters, recorded at negative IDR 18 billion ($1.08 million) in the third quarter. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, its adjusted EBITDA plus net interest income declined from IDR 201 billion ($12.1 million) in the second quarter to IDR 175 billion ($10.54 million) in the third quarter, primarily reflecting the company’s share buyback program and the lower domestic interest rate environment. </p>
<p>These results demonstrate solid operational fundamentals and prudent financial management, said the firm. </p>
<p>While adjusted EBITDA remained steady, the firm&#8217;s net profit rose sharply to IDR 2.4 trillion ($144.53 million) in the third quarter, compared to IDR 355 billion ($21.38 million) in the previous quarter, mainly driven by gains from investment revaluation. </p>
<p>The company maintained a strong financial position, with total cash, cash equivalents, and liquid investments reaching IDR 17.9 trillion ($1.08 billion) as of September 30, 2025. </p>
<p>This includes investments in liquid instruments such as deposits, government bonds, and mutual funds; providing strong financial flexibility to support long-term growth.</p>
<p>Bukalapak’s four core business segments continued to deliver sustained and positive contributions. </p>
<p>The gaming segment remained the largest contributor, generating IDR 1.4 trillion ($84.31 million) in revenue in the third quarter, growing 2 percent quarter-on-quarter. </p>
<p>The investment segment posted strong performance with IDR 18 billion ($1.08 million) in revenue, up 30 percent quarter-on-quarter, while maintaining a robust contribution margin above 30 percent. </p>
<p>The Mitra Bukalapak segment saw lower revenue as the company continued to focus on more profitable markets, leading to a 44 percent quarter-on-quarter improvement in contribution margin. </p>
<p>The retail segment remained an integral part of Bukalapak’s digital ecosystem, recording a 23.6 percent contribution margin in the third quarter.</p>
<p>“Bukalapak’s third-quarter performance reflects our ability to maintain business stability and resilience amid shifting market dynamics, </p>
<p>“We continue to execute our strategy with discipline, strengthen our ecosystem foundation, and focus on delivering sustainable value for all stakeholders,&#8221; said Victor Putra Lesmana, Director of the company.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Bukalapak said it will continue to enhance all of its business lines and deepen market penetration through product innovation and improved user experience. </p>
<p>Supported by its strong cash position and financial flexibility, the company said it is well-positioned to execute its growth strategy and deliver relevant digital solutions that create lasting value across Indonesia’s business ecosystem.</p>
