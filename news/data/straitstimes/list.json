Netflix also has been granted access to the data room, which contains the financial details needed to make a bid, according to two of the sources familiar with the matter.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Warner Bros Discovery and Moelis declined to comment. Netflix could not be reached for comment.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Owning Warner Bros’ studio business would give Netflix control over some of Hollywood’s most successful stories and characters, including the Harry Potter and DC Comics franchises.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Warner Bros’ prolific television studio also produces many of Netflix’s hits, including original series like “Running Point,” “You” and “Maid.” HBO and its companion streaming service would add more prestige dramas, and subscribers.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Netflix chief executive officer Ted Sarandos told investors last week that while the company is traditionally “more builders than buyers,” it does evaluate acquisitions based on criteria such as the size of the opportunity and whether it would strengthen the company’s entertainment offerings.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Mr Sarandos indicated Netflix would not be interested in acquiring Warner Bros Discovery’s cable television networks, which include CNN, TNT, Food Network and Animal Planet.   </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks,” Mr Sarandos said in the company’s third-quarter investor video. “There is no change there.” </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Warner Bros Discovery announced last week that it would begin evaluating options, after receiving a trio of unsolicited offers from Paramount Skydance to acquire the entire company.   </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The company said its board would consider whether to move forward with its planned split, which would separate the Warner Bros film and television studios, HBO and the companion HBO Max streaming service from its television business, or pursue a sale of all or parts of the company. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Comcast president Mike Cavanagh told investors on Oct 30 the company is evaluating media assets that would be “complementary” to its existing business. He also appeared to dismiss those who are skeptical of Comcast winning regulatory approval, saying “more things are viable than maybe some of the public commentary that’s out there.” REUTERS</p></div>",

Higher rates act to constrain activity and dampen inflation. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Fed officials have in recent months flagged concerns that the jobs market is cooling, causing them to shift their attention to bolstering hiring, even though inflation remains above the Fed’s target.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“There’s definitely some weakening on the employment side of the mandate, and I think they’ll go ahead and take out another insurance cut against that risk,” former Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester, now an adjunct professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, told AFP. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“But it’s important that they not lose sight of the inflation part of the mandate. The inflation risks, I believe, remain to the upside,” she said.</p><h2 class=\"font-header-lg-semibold\" data-testid=\"article-subhead-test-id\">December less clear-cut </h2><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Quarter-point cuts in both October and December are more-or-less baked into the financial markets, according to CME Group data.  </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">But analysts widely expect Fed chair Jerome Powell to tell reporters during the bank’s post-decision press conference on Oct 29 that the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is keeping an open mind about the following meeting.  </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“I don’t think it’s a given that there will be a majority of FOMC voters that will favour easing in December,” EY chief economist Gregory Daco told AFP. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Mr Powell “has not made up his mind yet for one as to whether a December rate cut will be necessary”, added Mr Daco, who nevertheless expects the Fed to make two quarter-point rate cuts in 2025. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The Fed could also use Oct 29’s rate decision to announce an end date for its steps to reduce the size of its balance sheet, which ballooned in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“I think they’re very cautious about stresses in the financial markets,” said Professor Mester. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“They could probably get the balance sheet down a little bit further,” she added. “But I don’t think there’s much appetite for that.” </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Also simmering in the background are Mr Trump’s attempts to exert greater control over the management of the Federal Reserve, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s widely-publicised plans to find a replacement for Mr Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May 2026. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">But that is unlikely to feature in the actual discussions this week, with policymakers most likely remaining squarely focused on interest rate policy, according to Prof Mester, a former voting member of the FOMC. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“They’re really basing it on their best assessment… of where the economy is, where it’s likely go, and how they can set monetary policy to achieve maximum employment and price stability,” she said. <!-- -->AFP<!-- --> </p></div>",

That was far better than a Bloomberg Economics forecast for a 3.9 per cent gain and followed a 20.4 per cent jump in August. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">For the first nine months of 2025, profits were up 3.2 per cent, according to data released on <!-- -->Oct 27<!-- --> by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Faster expansion in output is propping up earnings of Chinese factories and mines, as foreign demand remained robust despite US tariffs. Price declines also slowed in recent months, with the government acting to curb overcapacity and cut-throat competition.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">That said, the actual strength of the recovery appears fragile for now, given a low comparison base in 2024.

            "description": "<div class=\"storyline-wrapper default\"><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">SEATTLE - The largest technology companies are betting on an AI future powered by gigantic complexes of data centres filled with humming servers. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Now that the staggering cost of this push is coming into sharper focus, it’s testing nerves on Wall Street. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Three bellwethers from different corners of the technology world – Google parent Alphabet, Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Microsoft - together racked up some US$78 billion (S$101 billion) in capital expenditures last quarter. That’s up 89 per cent from a year earlier.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Most of that cash was destined for data centre construction and graphics processing units and other gear to fill them. Each increased their forecasts for future outlays. That was enough to rattle investors conditioned to expect enormous spending. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Meta and Microsoft shares fell in after-hours trading on Oct 29 after the companies disclosed the expenditures as part of quarterly reports. Meta also warned that 2026 outlays would be “notably larger” than in 2025.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Though Google investors largely took its spending increase in stride, sending the shares up more than 6 per cent in late trading, the trio of reports renewed questions over whether a bubble is forming. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">On a conference call with Microsoft executives, Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler asked if they were confident that the AI investments would pay off. “Or, frankly, are we in a bubble?”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood reiterated that the company can’t meet current demand for AI and other services, even after spending tens of billions in recent quarters. “I thought we were going to catch up,” she said. “We are not. Demand is increasing. It is not increasing in just one place. It is increasing across many places.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Microsoft helped kick off the AI boom by backing OpenAI with a US$13 billion investment. And the software giant’s data centre build-out is seen as key to maintaining leadership in the AI field.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Still, the company surprised investors by notching a record US$34.9 billion in capital expenditures during the September quarter.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The Azure cloud-computing division – Microsoft’s main vehicle for recouping those investments – saw revenue continue to rise at a rapid clip, but at about the same rate as the prior quarter. A higher growth rate would have provided more assurance that the spending binge is worth it.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Alphabet’s Google, meanwhile, gave a more encouraging outlook. The company said its Gemini AI assistant now has 650 million monthly active users, up 44 per cent from three months ago. And the Google cloud platform has bagged more billion-dollar deals in the first nine months of 2025 than in the prior two years, CFO Anat Ashkenazi said on a call with analysts.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Cloud revenue rose 34 per cent to US$15.2 billion, beating the US$14.8 billion estimate. But Google’s expenses also are climbing. The company expects its capital expenditures to be as much as US$93 billion this year, up from the previous estimate of US85 billion, Ms Ashkenazi said. Next year, she sees a “significant increase” in those numbers.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Of the three companies reporting on Oct 30, Meta offered the most jarring picture. In addition to posting an eye-popping US$16 billion tax charge, the company warned that capital spending would grow at a “significantly faster” clip next year. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Unlike Microsoft and Google, Meta isn’t a major cloud-computing provider to outside customers. That means its spending spree could be riskier.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">If Microsoft and Google overestimate the need for AI services, they already have a way to sell excess computing power to others. And that external demand remains healthy. Both companies reported enormous increases in their backlogs – a tally that represents what customers have committed to spend in the future.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Microsoft’s backlog for commercial customers, which includes some non-cloud expenditures, was US$392 billion. Google’s was US$155 billion, almost double where it stood just 18 months ago.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">With Meta, the AI payoff is less clear. The company, which is infusing AI services into Instagram and Facebook, said the investments will help it better target advertising. That’s the main source of revenue for Meta.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">During Meta’s earnings call on Oct 30, chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said the company has options if it ends up spending too much on infrastructure. In one scenario, it could sell the computing power to other companies.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“We haven’t done that yet,” he said. “But obviously, if you got to a point where you overbuilt, you could have that as an option.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The company also faces concerns about spending in its Reality Labs division, which makes AI smart glasses and other wearable devices. The business reported a loss of US$4.4 billion for the third quarter, with revenue of just US$470 million.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Still, smart glasses are a “huge opportunity,” Mr Zuckerberg said. And the broader danger in AI is spending too little, not too much, he argued.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“I think it’s pretty early, but I think we’re seeing the returns in the core business,” he said. “That’s giving us a lot of confidence that we should be investing a lot more, and we want to make sure that we’re not underinvesting.” BLOOMBERG</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"storyline-wrapper default\"><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">TOKYO - Masayoshi Son’s big wager on artificial intelligence has paid off – propelling the SoftBank Group founder past Uniqlo billionaire Tadashi Yanai to become Japan’s richest person.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Mr Son’s net worth soared 248 per cent in 2025 to US$55.1 billion (S$71 billion) on Oct 29, about US$23 million larger than Mr Yanai’s, the chairman and biggest shareholder of Uniqlo’s parent company Fast Retailing. Mr Yanai has been at the top of the country’s ranking for most of the past decade, and continuously since April 2022, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The recent spike in Mr Son’s fortune mirrors the performance of Tokyo-listed SoftBank, where the Japanese billionaire is the biggest shareholder with a stake of about one third. Mr Son, 68, controls a global portfolio of tech investments from chipmakers to start-up ventures, and has embarked on a spending spree in 2025 to try and position the firm as a linchpin in the global AI boom. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">SoftBank shares climbed on Oct 29 after it was listed among companies interested in launching projects in the United States during President Donald Trump’s visit to Tokyo. Mr Son has become one of Mr Trump’s key foreign backers in global business, making an early pledge this year for US$100 billion in US investments.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">His most ambitious deals now include a planned US$30 billion investment in OpenAI and a US$500 billion initiative to build AI data centres and other infrastructure across the US in partnership with the ChatGPT operator, Oracle and Abu Dhabi fund MGX. Mr Son is also seeking to team up with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for a trillion-dollar industrial complex in Arizona for AI and robots. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The gains linked to OpenAI, Arm Holdings and other AI bets have helped buoy SoftBank, with its shares becoming a proxy for the AI infrastructure spending boom. Mr Son’s new darlings include a surprise US$2 billion investment in Intel, the acquisition of ABB’s robotics arm for US$5.4 billion and fresh exposure to Nvidia and TSMC. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Mr Son, an ethnic Korean born in Japan in 1957, began his entrepreneurial career while studying in the US by developing an electronic dictionary that he famously sold to Sharp Corp. for around US$1 million. After returning to Japan, he founded SoftBank in 1981 as a distributor of computer software. Over the past four decades, the business has evolved into a conglomerate spanning telecommunications, digital payment and technology investment.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">To be sure, some investors caution that AI valuations have run too high, warning that OpenAI and Nvidia are fueling a complex web of business transactions that’s artificially propping up the trillion-dollar AI boom.

The new approach will enable companies to<b> </b>make their own disclosure decisions as long as they fully disclose material information to investors.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">They are also based on recommendations by a review group set up by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in August 2024 to boost liquidity and raise investor interest in the Singapore stock market. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">For companies that want to list, SGX RegCo will retain key criteria to ensure that only issuers “with strong governance and financial health” are listed, it said. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">This means that unmodified audit opinions remain mandatory to ensure companies comply with financial reporting standards. Issuers must still confirm they’ve secured approvals and met legal requirements that could materially impact their operations.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">For other matters, SGX RegCo will also require clear disclosure of material issues to support investors in making informed decisions. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">More firms will find it easier to list, as SGX RegCo will lower the profit test threshold for new listings from $30 million to $10 million, aligning with other major exchanges. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">SGX RegCo said it recognises that pre-revenue companies with strong growth potential in emerging industries<!-- --> <!-- -->may be suitable for SGX mainboard listings, even if they may not meet traditional financial criteria due to the unique circumstances of their industries. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“Their listing will widen the diversity of companies on the mainboard and broaden investor choice,” SGX RegCo said. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Admission requirements have also been refined for certain industries, such as for pre-revenue life science companies. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">For such companies, their minimum operating record will be reduced from three years to two years, and they need to be primarily engaged in laboratory research and development of their identified products for at least one year, among other criteria.  </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Azure Capital chief executive Terence Wong said adjusting the threshold is a positive move as there are many companies on the cusp of their next growth phase. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“Hitting $30 million means they are already there, but there are companies that are under that threshold that are establishing themselves and that’s when they need funding the most,” he said. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“This move makes it easier for them to come up (and list).”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">For companies that are already listed, SGX RegCo also announced measures to minimise market disruption and provide certainty to companies and investors. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">As part of these measures, trading suspensions will only be considered where there is clear evidence of going concern issues. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Companies that are suspended from trading only because their ability to continue as a going concern is in doubt, may apply to resume trading. The Straits Times understands that this will currently affect some 10 to 15 companies. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">SGX RegCo will also stop issuing public trading queries to companies. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">SGX RegCo chief executive Tan Boon Gin said: “Currently, our trading queries are quite general, and they’re not bespoke, so the feedback that we’ve been getting is that as an unintended consequence, they can have a chilling effect on the market.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">For instance, when the share price goes up by a certain amount for a particular stock, investors might hold back from going in on the stock, because they anticipate that a public trading query might be issued, Mr Tan noted. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“This actually impedes price discovery and means that our efforts on the enterprise side might not be maximised because there’s no proper price discovery.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">But SGX RegCo will still issue “trade with caution” alerts if it feels that there is reason to believe the market is not fair, orderly or transparent. These alerts will be valid for two weeks, with new alerts issued as required. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Mr Tan said such alerts will only be issued when SGX RegCo sees that there is evidence of misconduct that the market should be aware of. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">SGX RegCo will still issue disclosure queries to companies where it concerns material issues. Something is considered “material” if it will affect the decisions of investors in whether or not to trade in a company’s shares.  </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Mr Tan said: “If it’s not material, then we will engage privately with the company so that we can tell the company how they can improve, but without having to go out publicly so that this will not create too much noise in the market and not create unnecessary alarm.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">He added that SGX RegCo’s commitment to the market is that if something could affect investors’ decisions to trade, they will still be informed about it. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Issuers must also continue to publicly disclose materially price-sensitive or trade-sensitive information, SGX RegCo said. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Finally, the financial watch list, which flags companies that have accumulated losses and low average daily market capitalisation, will be removed. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Mr Tan said: “The purpose of the financial watch list wasn’t intended to punish companies. The intention was to motivate companies to turn themselves around, so they would not face delisting. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“The unintended consequence was it might actually affect the company’s ability to turn around its business, because once a company gets put on the financial watch list, then people don’t want to deal with the company… so we may actually have made it more difficult for it to turn around the business.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Although there will no longer be a watch list, SGX RegCo still requires companies to announce if they have hit three years’ of losses, so investors are alerted to the company’s condition. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“We also strongly encourage such issuers, where appropriate, to communicate their future plans and specific actions to improve financial performance,” SGX RegCo said.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Mr Tan emphasised that the SGX RegCo remains committed to maintaining regulatory standards, both in the quality of listings and the level of surveillance over the market, to ensure that they continue to be robust. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">He also hopes that measures aimed at boosting market liquidity and vibrancy will have a positive effect on the regulatory landscape.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“By deploying the monies through institutional investors, we are actually going to introduce a lot more discipline into our market, especially in the mid-to-small cap segment,” he said. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“And this will be very good for the market, because this will push companies to do more for their shareholders, and we also think that this will raise standards overall.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Experts welcomed the moves and said the onus will be on companies to be responsible to stakeholders, while investors also need to be responsible for their investment decisions. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Prof Lawrence Loh, Director for the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at NUS Business School, noted that the shift is expected to put greater focus on the depth and rigour of company disclosures.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“Market players, including analysts, must step up their surveillance to encourage quality disclosures beyond checking the boxes.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">He noted that even a full merit-based regime may not be able to catch all possible matters of contention. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“Ultimately, it’s about a delicate balancing act between enterprise and regulation with a fundamental objective that Singapore must stay a competitive and attractive place of equity issuance, but with the necessary guardrails and safeguards for investors,” he said. </p></div>",

You don’t have mass layoffs when the economy is strong.”</p><h2 class=\"font-header-lg-semibold\" data-testid=\"article-subhead-test-id\">Big AI spending </h2><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\"><a aria-label=\"link\" class=\"gap-x-04 items-center inline text-primary-60 select-auto\" data-testid=\"custom-link\" href=\"/business/amazon-to-cut-14000-corporate-jobs-worldwide-spore-may-not-be-spared?ref=inline-article\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular inline\" data-testid=\"paragraph-test-id\">Amazon on Oct 28 said it would cut up to 14,000 jobs</p></a> from its corporate workforce, joining Target, Procter &amp; Gamble and others in axing thousands of office roles. Reuters reported on Oct 28 as many as 30,000 Amazon jobs could eventually be eliminated. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The reasons for the cuts vary. Some, like Target and Nestle, have new CEOs eager to restructure their operations. Baby-apparel company Carter’s is slashing 15 per cent of office jobs as it struggles with hefty import tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">What stands out is the focus by companies like Amazon and Target on white-collar roles seen as vulnerable to AI-driven automation, rather than those on shop or factory floors. Some analysts say Amazon’s move could be an early sign of deeper structural shifts as companies push to justify billions spent on AI tools.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Target’s cuts affect 8 per cent of its corporate staff but Amazon’s cuts affect just 14,000 positions within its 1.5 million-strong workforce.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">KPMG’s latest survey of US-based executives released in September shows projected AI investment has jumped 14 per cent since the first quarter to an average of US$130 million (S$168 million) over the next year. And 78 per cent of executives say they are under intense pressure from boards and investors to prove AI is saving money and boosting profits. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The occupations most likely to be affected would be where entry-level work is replaced with automation, Bank of America economists wrote on Oct 22. So far, however, businesses loaded with white-collar workers such as those in the information, finance, and professional services sector have seen job growth in tandem with increased AI usage, they wrote. “I’m reticent to say it’s AI just yet,” said Allison Shrivastava, economist with Indeed Hiring Lab in New York, who said the tech sector has been retrenching since a 2022 peak. “It has the potential to impact the labour market, but I don’t think we’re seeing that strong an impact right now.”</p><h2 class=\"font-header-lg-semibold\" data-testid=\"article-subhead-test-id\">Low-hiring, low-firing doldrums</h2><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">With the US government shut, data is at a premium. Weekly state jobless figures so far do not show a measurable surge in layoffs, but job growth remains subdued. Payroll provider ADP on Oct 28 estimated an increase of 14,250 US jobs in the four-week period ended Oct 11. Despite the headlines, economists say the labour market is stuck in a “low-hiring, low-firing phase”, with firms quietly trimming headcount by not replacing vacated roles.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">If layoffs accelerate, they could further weaken consumer confidence and the broader U.S. economy, already under strain from tariffs and inflation above Federal Reserve targets. Fed officials concerned about the job market worry the “low-hiring, low-firing” environment could slip towards faster layoffs. “I describe this as a ‘hold-your-breath’ environment,” Mr Shrivastava said. “‘Low-hire, low-fire’ almost makes it feel like we’re in this new equilibrium, where really companies are just holding their breath, trying to figure out what’s going on.” REUTERS</p></div>",
