Excluding this property, occupancy would have remained stable at 91.1 per cent.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Similarly, in the United States, occupancy decreased by two percentage points from the previous quarter to 85.3 per cent, primarily attributed to lower occupancy levels in Raleigh. The logistics portfolio “remained healthy” in the US, with occupancy at 92.3 per cent, said the real estate investment trust’s (Reit) manager.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Occupancy in Australia rose by 1.7 percentage points quarter on quarter to 94.8 per cent, driven by improvements in the logistics portfolio.

Additionally, 4.5 per cent of gross rental income is set to be renewed in FY2025.</p><h2 class=\"font-header-lg-semibold\" data-testid=\"article-subhead-test-id\">Strategic plans</h2><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Clar’s aggregate leverage rose to 39.8 per cent, from 37.4 per cent in Q2.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Its manager noted that the year-to-date weighted average all-in debt cost remained stable at 3.6 per cent. The average debt maturity stood at 3.3 years, compared with 3.2 years in the previous quarter.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">These results follow the manager’s announcement in August regarding the proposed divestment of five Singapore properties.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">These divestments are being proposed at “healthy premiums” of about 6 per cent over the properties’ total market valuation and 20 per cent over the original purchase price, for a total sale consideration of $329 million.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Looking ahead, Clar’s manager expects the Singapore portfolio to grow to more than $12 billion with the addition of properties such as 2 Pioneer Sector 1 and 9 Kallang Sector. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“With a strong balance sheet and healthy liquidity, the Reit remains nimble and disciplined in pursuing accretive investment opportunities to enhance its portfolio and deliver sustainable returns to unitholders,” the manager said.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Units of Clar closed 0.4 per cent or $0.01 down at $2.82 on Oct 31, before the release of the results. <a aria-label=\"link\" class=\"gap-x-04 items-center inline text-primary-60 select-auto\" data-testid=\"custom-link\" href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/capitaland-ascendas-reits-portfolio-occupancy-dips-91-3-q3-rental-reversion-slows?ref=inline-article\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular inline\" data-testid=\"paragraph-test-id\">THE BUSINESS TIMES</p></a></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"storyline-wrapper default\"><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">BEIJING - China’s factory activity slump worsened in October, reaching its longest decline in more than nine years as a deepening economic slowdown sets in during the final quarter.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index was 49, versus 49.8 in September, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Oct 31. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 49.6.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The non-manufacturing measure of activity in construction and services inched up to 50.1, after slipping in September to reach the 50 mark that separates contraction from growth. Seasonal factors were likely at play, since national holidays in October 2025 were longer than in 2024.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The slowdown in factory activities was partially the result of the eight-day public holiday and “increased complexity in global environment,” Huo Lihui, a statistician at the NBS, said in a statement accompanying the release. “Manufacturing firms’ production and market demand both fell,” she said. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Tensions with the US over trade escalated in September, before a deal reached by US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at talks on Oct 30 in South Korea.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Tariff relief and a wider climbdown in the trade war promise a respite for a Chinese economy whose expansion decelerated last quarter to the weakest pace in a year. While growth is on track to reach this year’s target of around 5 per cent, many analysts predict the final three months of 2025 will see the slowest performance since zero-Covid lockdowns roiled production in 2022.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">In a sign of reduced production activity, the output sub-index under the manufacturing PMI fell into the contractionary territory for the first time since April.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Beyond the risks abroad, subdued domestic demand is also hurting the outlook for Chinese factories. Households surveyed by the central bank in the third quarter of the year became less willing to consume and turned more pessimistic about employment.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">And although export growth has been surprisingly robust this year, questions around its sustainability remain after a rush to get ahead of tariffs boosted activity for much of 2025. Now that Mr Xi and Mr Trump agreed to a longer trade truce, it’s possible overseas demand could begin to cool if customers no longer feel the need to stockpile goods in anticipation of higher duties. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Looking over the next five years, Beijing has made clear it plans to keep tech and manufacturing as the top priorities even as it pledged to “significantly” boost the share of consumption in its economy.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Officials plan to take “extraordinary measures” to achieve breakthroughs in core technology and strengthen export controls, according to a readout from a key policy meeting in October that discussed China’s next five-year plan.

            "description": "<div class=\"storyline-wrapper default\"><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\"><span class=\"uppercase\">Melbourne</span> - Shares of the world’s top listed beer, wine and spirits makers have shed a combined US$830 billion (S$1.1 trillion) in a little more than four years as the industry grapples with monumental change.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">That’s the total loss in market value, as a Bloomberg gauge of some 50 companies stands 46 per cent below its June 2021 record high.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Shifting drinking patterns and rising health concerns have hit earnings, compounded by US tariffs, the impact of buoyant interest rates on consumer spending and even elevated commodity prices. In China, weak household confidence and a booze ban for official functions have added fuel to the downtrend.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The result is a wave of pressure facing companies behind some of the world’s most popular drinks that has left them adrift from the record rally in global equities. Instead, these businesses are struggling to adapt to new commercial dynamics that have caught many by surprise.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“There is a structural change going on – people are drinking less,” said Sarah Simon, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">In 2025, shares of European giants Diageo - home to the Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff brands - Pernod Ricard and Remy Cointreau have all hit the lowest levels in at least a decade. Jack Daniel’s owner Brown-Forman and Australia’s Treasury Wine Estates have similarly slumped. Chinese baijiu titan Kweichow Moutai is trading more than 40 per cent below its 2021 high.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Stock price declines may extend further with alcohol producers grappling not just with hits to revenue, but also elevated levels of debt and management churn as they adapt to a sector in flux, according to Simon.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The main challenge facing the industry is a change in behaviour. In August, a Gallup gauge of US alcohol consumption fell to the lowest since records began in 1939. Warnings from the likes of the World Health Organization and US Surgeon General have sapped demand among Gen X. At the same time, alcohol has become less fashionable for millennials and Gen Z.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">A teetotaling trend among celebrities has compounded the decline, with Tom Holland and Katy Perry hawking non-alcoholic drinks. The popularity of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and the emergence of alcohol alternatives like cannabis have also dented booze sales. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“We’ve seen four times the impact of the financial crash on alcohol consumption,” said Laurence Whyatt, an analyst at Barclays. “The market believes there’s been some sort of structural change and that we’re not going back to the growth rates that we had in the past.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The crunch has led to a flurry of deals and product debuts. Carlsberg unveiled a non-alcoholic cider in February and Davide Campari-Milano launched its alcohol-free Crodino in the US in May. In 2024, Diageo acquired Ritual Zero Proof Non-Alcoholic Spirits, while Moet Hennessy, the drinks arm of luxury giant LVMH, purchased a stake in French Bloom, which makes a high-end sparkling beverage.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Some corporate moves have been more dramatic, including restructurings and job cuts. Chief executives have been changed this year at Diageo, Remy Cointreau and Campari in Europe, Treasury Wine in Australia, Molson Coors Beverage in the US and Suntory Holdings in Japan. Moutai has seen two chairmen depart in less than two years.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Not all are negative on the sector, however, with some seeing an opportunity to buy after the massive sell-off. The Bloomberg gauge of global alcohol stocks is trading at around 15 times forward estimated earnings, less than half its 2021 high.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Cook &amp; Bynum, a value hedge fund in the US, has grown positions in Brazilian beer distributor Ambev and Peruvian brewer Backus y Johnston, according to Richard Cook, partner and portfolio manager at the firm. The two stocks have fallen this year, but Cook maintains an upbeat outlook given the dominance in their respective markets and steady earnings, he said.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“We don’t think that humans are going to stop drinking alcohol,”Mr  Cook said. Brewers in growing emerging markets will sell more beer and “the beer they sell is going to be more premium and higher margin over time,” he said.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Uncertainty over the alcohol industry is drawing comparisons to tobacco’s trajectory that “would have been inconceivable five years ago,” said Andrew Gowen, head of research for Bell Asset Management. Negative volume growth will push companies to cut costs and build out cheaper options, he said. His firm is avoiding the sector given lack of clarity over long-term prospects.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“This industry’s been around for 7,000 years, but a lot can change,” Mr Gowen said.

            "description": "<div class=\"storyline-wrapper default\"><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">SAN FRANCISCO - Apple predicted a major sales surge during the holiday season after releasing new iPhones, helping assure investors that its flagship product remains a growth engine.  </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Revenue in the fiscal first quarter, which runs through December, will rise by 10 per cent to 12 per cent, chief financial officer Kevan Parekh said during a conference call with analysts on Oct 30. Analysts had predicted just 6 per cent on average.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“We expect iPhone revenue to grow double-digits year over year, which would be our best iPhone quarter ever,” he said.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The outlook signals that Apple is navigating its way through a range of global challenges, including trade tensions, weakness in China and delays developing artificial intelligence features.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">With the company’s latest iPhone release in September, Apple updated the designs and introduced a new ultrathin model called the Air. The lineup remains the company’s biggest moneymaker, accounting for roughly half of its revenue. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Apple shares gained more than 4 per cent in late trading on Oct 31. They had been up 8.4 per cent in 2025 through the close.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">In the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Sept 27, sales rose 7.9 per cent to US$102.5 billion. That slightly beat the US$102.2 billion average estimate. Earnings rose to US$1.85 a share, topping the average estimate of US$1.77.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Apple benefited from stronger-than-expected services growth in the period, helping offset a slowdown in China. The Mac and wearables division also performed better than anticipated.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Tariffs added US$1.1 billion in expenses during the quarter, in line with Apple’s expectations. The company expects US$1.4 billion in tariff costs in the December period. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Revenue from greater China fell 3.6 per cent to US$14.5 billion last quarter, well short of the US$16.4 billion that analysts projected. The company faces mounting competition from local smartphone providers and has struggled to offer artificial intelligence features in the country. Still, chief executive officer Tim Cook said he believes Apple will return to growth in the region during the current quarter. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Revenue from the iPhone gained 6.1 per cent to US$49 billion in the September period, helped by the new models. Still, that was just short of the US$49.3 billion that analysts projected. Apple said it faced supply constraints, which may have limited growth. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The quarter included roughly two weeks of iPhone 17 availability, and initial demand appeared strong - with sellouts reported across Apple retail stores and third-party channels. Most buyers opted for higher-end iPhone 17 Pro models, helping boost Apple’s average selling price. The US$999 iPhone Air - more expensive than the model it replaced - also helped on this front.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Services remained Apple’s fastest-growing segment last quarter, with revenue rising 15 per cent to US$28.8 billion. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Despite the healthy growth, the services business continues to face challenges from regulators seeking to change App Store policies, which could affect software and subscription revenue. However, Apple secured a recent legal victory when a judge declined to dismantle its US$20 billion-a-year search deal with Alphabet’s Google. BLOOMBERG</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"storyline-wrapper default\"><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">SEATTLE - Amazon.com’s cloud unit posted the strongest growth rate in almost three years, reassuring investors who were concerned that the largest seller of rented computing power was losing ground to rivals. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Amazon Web Services reported third-quarter revenue of US$33 billion (S$42.9 billion), an increase of 20 per cent from the prior year and the biggest year-over-year rise since the end of 2022. Analysts, on average, estimated 18 per cent growth. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Amazon shares jumped about 13 per cent in extended trading after closing at US$222.86 in New York. The stock has lagged behind that of its industry peers in 2025, with investors worrying that the company has yet to benefit enough from its artificial intelligence (AI) products. In its most recent quarter, Microsoft’s Azure cloud business grew at almost twice the rate of AWS, while Alphabet’s Google Cloud posted 33.5 per cent growth.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Mr Jassy opened a conference call with analysts after the results were released by cheering the prospects for AWS and rattling off figures on the impact of AI on the company’s businesses, most of which Amazon hadn’t disclosed previously. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The company estimates that Rufus, the shopping chatbot embedded in its retail apps, will help deliver an additional US$10 billion in annual sales. Connect, the company’s call cenrer product that is widely seen as its most successful software offering for office workers, is on track to pull in US$1 billion in annualised revenue, Mr Jassy said. Bedrock, the AWS marketplace for businesses to tap into AI models, could ultimately be as big a business as EC2, the computing service that is one of the cloud unit’s primary money makers.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“We have momentum,” he said. “You can see it.” </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">During the quarter that ended Sept 30, Amazon’s total revenue rose 13 per cent to US$180.2 billion, the company said in a statement. Analysts, on average, were anticipating US$177.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The strong performance of Amazon’s cloud business and its core retail business likely reassured investors worried that the company was <a aria-label=\"link\" class=\"gap-x-04 items-center inline text-primary-60 select-auto\" data-testid=\"custom-link\" href=\"/business/companies-markets/meta-defies-ai-spending-gloom-with-record-breaking-bond-sale?ref=inline-article\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular inline\" data-testid=\"paragraph-test-id\">spending too much money</p></a> pursuing what some have suggested is an AI bubble, said Melissa Otto, analyst at S&amp;P Global.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“We are seeing good evidence of the AWS business performing very well,” she said. “It doesn’t feel bubbly to me. It just feels like a business firing on all cylinders.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Like its biggest rivals, Amazon has invested heavily in data centres and chips to build and operate AI models capable of generating text or images and automating processes. Capital expenditures rose 61 per cent to a record US$34.2 billion in the quarter, chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The power capacity of the AWS data centre fleet has doubled since 2022, and Mr Jassy said he expected it to double again by 2027. Last week, the unit suffered its biggest outage in years. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Though Amazon has sought to position its cloud business as a marketplace for a broad range of AI tools, for now, it has a lot riding on a single partner: Anthropic PBC, the maker of the Claude chatbot and software coding assistant.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Amazon is backing Anthropic with an investment of US$8 billion, and built the start-up a massive complex of data centre and custom AWS AI chips. That system, called Project Rainier, is up and running, the company said this week. Amazon said its Trainium2 chip was “fully subscribed” and represented a multibillion-dollar business.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Google recently announced a deal to provide Anthropic with some of its own chips. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">In the third quarter, Amazon reported operating income of US$17.4 billion, which included a US$2.5 billion charge related to a legal settlement announced last month with the Federal Trade Commission over Prime subscriptions and US$1.8 billion for estimated severance costs.

            "title": "Meta defies AI spending gloom with record-breaking bond sale",
            "description": "<div class=\"storyline-wrapper default\"><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">NEW YORK - Meta Platforms found record-shattering demand for its bond sale on Oct 30 even as its shares plunged, in a sign that bond investors are looking past any concerns about its artificial-intelligence (AI) spending plans.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The company sold US$30 billion (S$39 billion) of bonds, the largest high-grade US note sale since 2023, drawing the most ever orders at US$125 billion. That came on a day where Meta’s shares plunged as much as 14 per cent, after it had posted quarterly earnings late on Oct 29, and <a aria-label=\"link\" class=\"gap-x-04 items-center inline text-primary-60 select-auto\" data-testid=\"custom-link\" href=\"/business/companies-markets/tech-giants-meta-microsoft-and-alphabet-test-investors-patience-with-huge-ai-spending-spree?ref=inline-article\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular inline\" data-testid=\"paragraph-test-id\">stock investors recoiled at how much the company planned to spend on AI.</p></a> </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta will spend hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade on data centres and other AI infrastructure to try to achieve human-level AI capabilities and integrate them into its products, including Facebook and Instagram. Meta said its capital expenditure this year would be as much as US$72 billion, a figure that will grow even faster in 2026.   </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">At least part of that spending will be fueled by borrowing. And for now, US corporate bond investors are eager to lend to Meta. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Their demand is partly because investors have been pouring money into short- and intermediate-term high-grade bond funds for 25 consecutive weeks, looking to lock in yields before they fall further. It’s the longest inflow streak in four years, according to LSEG Lipper. Meanwhile, most corporate bond sales in 2025 have been refinancing existing debt, rather than new net borrowing.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">That’s left investors clamouring for new bonds, according to Robert Cohen, head of global developed credit at DoubleLine Capital.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The timing for the AI debt binge is “perfect” said Mr Cohen. “The capital markets would be happy to finance these deals as long as they’re structured property.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The stock and bond markets may have reacted differently because they are looking at different parts of the company’s earnings report. Shares of Meta dropped in part because the company said in its earnings report that it took a one-time, non-cash charge of about US$15.9 billion in the third quarter tied to tax cuts in the United States. The hit is not enough to disrupt its creditworthiness, according to Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">But the company’s cash flow from operating activities was US$30 billion for the quarter. For bond investors, who worry more about whether they will get paid back in full and on schedule, Meta’s bond offering is “quite appealing,” he said.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“The company continues to demonstrate that they possess the earnings power to generate the cash flows sufficient to meet the bond investors’ primary objective about getting paid back as expected,” said Mr Sosnick.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">But Meta is facing doubts from equity investors about whether AI can supercharge its advertising business at a level that would justify its plans to spend even more on data centres and chips in 2026. Earnings reports from competitors Alphabet and Microsoft though left no doubt that demand for data centers overall hasn’t yet been met; Microsoft’s backlog for commercial customers, which includes some non-cloud expenditures, was US$392 billion. Google’s was US$155 billion, almost double where it stood just 18 months ago. </p><h2 class=\"font-header-lg-semibold\" data-testid=\"article-subhead-test-id\">Winners and losers</h2><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Tech companies have been borrowing heavily to fund their AI needs – about US$157 billion in US public bond markets as of late September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. And more debt is coming, with big tech companies expected to spend about US$3 trillion on infrastructure like data centres between now and the end of 2028, according to Morgan Stanley. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“The magnitude of the numbers and the way the numbers are kind of going parabolic, you have to take a step back and think about things a little differently,” said Thomas Murphy, a portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investment.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Oracle sold US$18 billion of investment-grade bonds in September, and banks this week kicked off a US$38 billion debt offering that will help fund data centres tied to the company. The company saw its cash flow flip negative in 2025 for the first time since 1992 and analysts anticipate the metric will be in free fall over the coming years before returning to positive in 2029. Debt investors have been buying protection against the company defaulting on its debt, a trend that Morgan Stanley sees continuing in the near term.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“The devil’s in the details,” said Mr Cohen. “There’ll be good projects and bad ones and we are being very careful about that because we know that not every product’s going to work.” BLOOMBERG</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"storyline-wrapper default\"><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">SEOUL – South Korea’s economy grew in the third quarter by the fastest pace in <!-- -->1½ years<!-- -->, helped by strong exports and solid private consumption as government stimulus measures boosted spending.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 1.2 per cent in the three months through September from the previous quarter, according to Bank of Korea (BOK) data released on Oct 28. The result topped the median estimate of 1 per cent growth. The economy grew 1.7 per cent from a year earlier.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The figures come ahead of this week’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, where US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are set to meet on Oct 30. South Korean officials hope the gathering will help generate momentum for progress in their own trade talks, with President Lee Jae Myung scheduled to meet Mr Trump on Oct 29.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Much of South Korea’s economic momentum now hinges on the outcome of trade negotiations with Washington, which have dragged on for about three months after an initial deal was signed in July. The two sides remain apart on how to structure a US$350 billion (S$453.5 billion) investment package underpinning the agreement to cap American tariffs on South Korean goods at 15 per cent.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The BOK estimated that US tariffs will trim growth by 0.45 percentage point <!-- -->in 2025<!-- -->, and 0.6 point in 2026. The bank raised its growth forecast to 0.9 per cent in August, a view in line with projections by the International Monetary Fund, which cited trade frictions and weak domestic demand as key challenges. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Still, South Korea’s exports have generally held up despite external headwinds. Early trade figures for the first 20 days of October showed a rebound driven by semiconductor exports, though autos and total shipments to the US declined sharply.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Demand for artificial intelligence-related memory chips remained a key driver. Exports overall rose 1.5 per cent, led by higher shipments of semiconductors and motor vehicles, while facility investment climbed 2.4 per cent on stronger demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, the BOK said in a statement.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Domestic demand also contributed to the momentum. The Lee administration’s extra budget of more than US$20 billion, which began filtering through the economy in July with two rounds of cash handouts, supported consumer spending and lifted private consumption during the quarter. Private consumption grew 1.3 per cent, with spending on both goods and services increasing, the BOK said.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">In July, when the cash handouts were distributed, retail sales and department store sales advanced, and data earlier on Oct 28 showed that consumer confidence in October remained near historically high levels in October, signalling broad optimism among households. Meantime, the benchmark stock gauge continued its blistering rally on Oct 27 to trade above the symbolic 4,000 level for the first time ever.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">BOK governor Rhee Chang Yong has said two extra budgets in 2025 would boost GDP by around 0.1 percentage point. While stimulus has helped lift activity, underlying risks from financial imbalances remain.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The central bank kept interest rates steady for a third straight meeting last week, citing risks tied to the housing market, household leverage and the currency. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">President Lee highlighted the housing market concerns in an interview with Bloomberg TV late last week, describing real estate investment as “a very dangerous potential crisis, a ticking bomb”.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Apartment prices in Seoul have risen for 38 straight weeks as at Oct 20.

Higher rates act to constrain activity and dampen inflation. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Fed officials have in recent months flagged concerns that the jobs market is cooling, causing them to shift their attention to bolstering hiring, even though inflation remains above the Fed’s target.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“There’s definitely some weakening on the employment side of the mandate, and I think they’ll go ahead and take out another insurance cut against that risk,” former Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester, now an adjunct professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, told AFP. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“But it’s important that they not lose sight of the inflation part of the mandate. The inflation risks, I believe, remain to the upside,” she said.</p><h2 class=\"font-header-lg-semibold\" data-testid=\"article-subhead-test-id\">December less clear-cut </h2><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Quarter-point cuts in both October and December are more-or-less baked into the financial markets, according to CME Group data.  </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">But analysts widely expect Fed chair Jerome Powell to tell reporters during the bank’s post-decision press conference on Oct 29 that the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is keeping an open mind about the following meeting.  </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“I don’t think it’s a given that there will be a majority of FOMC voters that will favour easing in December,” EY chief economist Gregory Daco told AFP. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Mr Powell “has not made up his mind yet for one as to whether a December rate cut will be necessary”, added Mr Daco, who nevertheless expects the Fed to make two quarter-point rate cuts in 2025. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The Fed could also use Oct 29’s rate decision to announce an end date for its steps to reduce the size of its balance sheet, which ballooned in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“I think they’re very cautious about stresses in the financial markets,” said Professor Mester. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“They could probably get the balance sheet down a little bit further,” she added. “But I don’t think there’s much appetite for that.” </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Also simmering in the background are Mr Trump’s attempts to exert greater control over the management of the Federal Reserve, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s widely-publicised plans to find a replacement for Mr Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May 2026. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">But that is unlikely to feature in the actual discussions this week, with policymakers most likely remaining squarely focused on interest rate policy, according to Prof Mester, a former voting member of the FOMC. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“They’re really basing it on their best assessment… of where the economy is, where it’s likely go, and how they can set monetary policy to achieve maximum employment and price stability,” she said. <!-- -->AFP<!-- --> </p></div>",
