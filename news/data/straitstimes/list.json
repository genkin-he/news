            "description": "<div class=\"storyline-wrapper default\"><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">NEW YORK - Meta Platforms found record-shattering demand for its bond sale on Oct 30 even as its shares plunged, in a sign that bond investors are looking past any concerns about its artificial-intelligence (AI) spending plans.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The company sold US$30 billion (S$39 billion) of bonds, the largest high-grade US note sale since 2023, drawing the most ever orders at US$125 billion. That came on a day where Meta’s shares plunged as much as 14 per cent, after it had posted quarterly earnings late on Oct 29, and <a aria-label=\"link\" class=\"gap-x-04 items-center inline text-primary-60 select-auto\" data-testid=\"custom-link\" href=\"/business/companies-markets/tech-giants-meta-microsoft-and-alphabet-test-investors-patience-with-huge-ai-spending-spree?ref=inline-article\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular inline\" data-testid=\"paragraph-test-id\">stock investors recoiled at how much the company planned to spend on AI.</p></a> </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta will spend hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade on data centres and other AI infrastructure to try to achieve human-level AI capabilities and integrate them into its products, including Facebook and Instagram. Meta said its capital expenditure this year would be as much as US$72 billion, a figure that will grow even faster in 2026.   </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">At least part of that spending will be fueled by borrowing. And for now, US corporate bond investors are eager to lend to Meta. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Their demand is partly because investors have been pouring money into short- and intermediate-term high-grade bond funds for 25 consecutive weeks, looking to lock in yields before they fall further. It’s the longest inflow streak in four years, according to LSEG Lipper. Meanwhile, most corporate bond sales in 2025 have been refinancing existing debt, rather than new net borrowing.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">That’s left investors clamouring for new bonds, according to Robert Cohen, head of global developed credit at DoubleLine Capital.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The timing for the AI debt binge is “perfect” said Mr Cohen. “The capital markets would be happy to finance these deals as long as they’re structured property.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The stock and bond markets may have reacted differently because they are looking at different parts of the company’s earnings report. Shares of Meta dropped in part because the company said in its earnings report that it took a one-time, non-cash charge of about US$15.9 billion in the third quarter tied to tax cuts in the United States. The hit is not enough to disrupt its creditworthiness, according to Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">But the company’s cash flow from operating activities was US$30 billion for the quarter. For bond investors, who worry more about whether they will get paid back in full and on schedule, Meta’s bond offering is “quite appealing,” he said.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“The company continues to demonstrate that they possess the earnings power to generate the cash flows sufficient to meet the bond investors’ primary objective about getting paid back as expected,” said Mr Sosnick.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">But Meta is facing doubts from equity investors about whether AI can supercharge its advertising business at a level that would justify its plans to spend even more on data centres and chips in 2026. Earnings reports from competitors Alphabet and Microsoft though left no doubt that demand for data centers overall hasn’t yet been met; Microsoft’s backlog for commercial customers, which includes some non-cloud expenditures, was US$392 billion. Google’s was US$155 billion, almost double where it stood just 18 months ago. </p><h2 class=\"font-header-lg-semibold\" data-testid=\"article-subhead-test-id\">Winners and losers</h2><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Tech companies have been borrowing heavily to fund their AI needs – about US$157 billion in US public bond markets as of late September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. And more debt is coming, with big tech companies expected to spend about US$3 trillion on infrastructure like data centres between now and the end of 2028, according to Morgan Stanley. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“The magnitude of the numbers and the way the numbers are kind of going parabolic, you have to take a step back and think about things a little differently,” said Thomas Murphy, a portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investment.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Oracle sold US$18 billion of investment-grade bonds in September, and banks this week kicked off a US$38 billion debt offering that will help fund data centres tied to the company. The company saw its cash flow flip negative in 2025 for the first time since 1992 and analysts anticipate the metric will be in free fall over the coming years before returning to positive in 2029. Debt investors have been buying protection against the company defaulting on its debt, a trend that Morgan Stanley sees continuing in the near term.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“The devil’s in the details,” said Mr Cohen. “There’ll be good projects and bad ones and we are being very careful about that because we know that not every product’s going to work.” BLOOMBERG</p></div>",

Netflix also has been granted access to the data room, which contains the financial details needed to make a bid, according to two of the sources familiar with the matter.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Warner Bros Discovery and Moelis declined to comment. Netflix could not be reached for comment.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Owning Warner Bros’ studio business would give Netflix control over some of Hollywood’s most successful stories and characters, including the Harry Potter and DC Comics franchises.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Warner Bros’ prolific television studio also produces many of Netflix’s hits, including original series like “Running Point,” “You” and “Maid.” HBO and its companion streaming service would add more prestige dramas, and subscribers.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Netflix chief executive officer Ted Sarandos told investors last week that while the company is traditionally “more builders than buyers,” it does evaluate acquisitions based on criteria such as the size of the opportunity and whether it would strengthen the company’s entertainment offerings.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Mr Sarandos indicated Netflix would not be interested in acquiring Warner Bros Discovery’s cable television networks, which include CNN, TNT, Food Network and Animal Planet.   </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks,” Mr Sarandos said in the company’s third-quarter investor video. “There is no change there.” </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Warner Bros Discovery announced last week that it would begin evaluating options, after receiving a trio of unsolicited offers from Paramount Skydance to acquire the entire company.   </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The company said its board would consider whether to move forward with its planned split, which would separate the Warner Bros film and television studios, HBO and the companion HBO Max streaming service from its television business, or pursue a sale of all or parts of the company. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Comcast president Mike Cavanagh told investors on Oct 30 the company is evaluating media assets that would be “complementary” to its existing business. He also appeared to dismiss those who are skeptical of Comcast winning regulatory approval, saying “more things are viable than maybe some of the public commentary that’s out there.” REUTERS</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"storyline-wrapper default\"><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">SEOUL – South Korea’s economy grew in the third quarter by the fastest pace in <!-- -->1½ years<!-- -->, helped by strong exports and solid private consumption as government stimulus measures boosted spending.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 1.2 per cent in the three months through September from the previous quarter, according to Bank of Korea (BOK) data released on Oct 28. The result topped the median estimate of 1 per cent growth. The economy grew 1.7 per cent from a year earlier.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The figures come ahead of this week’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, where US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are set to meet on Oct 30. South Korean officials hope the gathering will help generate momentum for progress in their own trade talks, with President Lee Jae Myung scheduled to meet Mr Trump on Oct 29.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Much of South Korea’s economic momentum now hinges on the outcome of trade negotiations with Washington, which have dragged on for about three months after an initial deal was signed in July. The two sides remain apart on how to structure a US$350 billion (S$453.5 billion) investment package underpinning the agreement to cap American tariffs on South Korean goods at 15 per cent.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The BOK estimated that US tariffs will trim growth by 0.45 percentage point <!-- -->in 2025<!-- -->, and 0.6 point in 2026. The bank raised its growth forecast to 0.9 per cent in August, a view in line with projections by the International Monetary Fund, which cited trade frictions and weak domestic demand as key challenges. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Still, South Korea’s exports have generally held up despite external headwinds. Early trade figures for the first 20 days of October showed a rebound driven by semiconductor exports, though autos and total shipments to the US declined sharply.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Demand for artificial intelligence-related memory chips remained a key driver. Exports overall rose 1.5 per cent, led by higher shipments of semiconductors and motor vehicles, while facility investment climbed 2.4 per cent on stronger demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, the BOK said in a statement.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Domestic demand also contributed to the momentum. The Lee administration’s extra budget of more than US$20 billion, which began filtering through the economy in July with two rounds of cash handouts, supported consumer spending and lifted private consumption during the quarter. Private consumption grew 1.3 per cent, with spending on both goods and services increasing, the BOK said.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">In July, when the cash handouts were distributed, retail sales and department store sales advanced, and data earlier on Oct 28 showed that consumer confidence in October remained near historically high levels in October, signalling broad optimism among households. Meantime, the benchmark stock gauge continued its blistering rally on Oct 27 to trade above the symbolic 4,000 level for the first time ever.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">BOK governor Rhee Chang Yong has said two extra budgets in 2025 would boost GDP by around 0.1 percentage point. While stimulus has helped lift activity, underlying risks from financial imbalances remain.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The central bank kept interest rates steady for a third straight meeting last week, citing risks tied to the housing market, household leverage and the currency. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">President Lee highlighted the housing market concerns in an interview with Bloomberg TV late last week, describing real estate investment as “a very dangerous potential crisis, a ticking bomb”.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Apartment prices in Seoul have risen for 38 straight weeks as at Oct 20. Gains are concentrated in subway-accessible and redevelopment zones, with some deals closing above market rates despite repeated government interventions.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The Lee administration has announced three rounds of housing measures since June, including tighter loan rules and broader designations of speculative areas. The authorities are aiming to steer credit away from real estate and reduce systemic risks. BLOOMBERG</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"storyline-wrapper default\"><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">SEATTLE - The largest technology companies are betting on an AI future powered by gigantic complexes of data centres filled with humming servers. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Now that the staggering cost of this push is coming into sharper focus, it’s testing nerves on Wall Street. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Three bellwethers from different corners of the technology world – Google parent Alphabet, Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Microsoft - together racked up some US$78 billion (S$101 billion) in capital expenditures last quarter. That’s up 89 per cent from a year earlier.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Most of that cash was destined for data centre construction and graphics processing units and other gear to fill them. Each increased their forecasts for future outlays. That was enough to rattle investors conditioned to expect enormous spending. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Meta and Microsoft shares fell in after-hours trading on Oct 29 after the companies disclosed the expenditures as part of quarterly reports. Meta also warned that 2026 outlays would be “notably larger” than in 2025.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Though Google investors largely took its spending increase in stride, sending the shares up more than 6 per cent in late trading, the trio of reports renewed questions over whether a bubble is forming. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">On a conference call with Microsoft executives, Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler asked if they were confident that the AI investments would pay off. “Or, frankly, are we in a bubble?”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood reiterated that the company can’t meet current demand for AI and other services, even after spending tens of billions in recent quarters. “I thought we were going to catch up,” she said. “We are not. Demand is increasing. It is not increasing in just one place. It is increasing across many places.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Microsoft helped kick off the AI boom by backing OpenAI with a US$13 billion investment. And the software giant’s data centre build-out is seen as key to maintaining leadership in the AI field.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Still, the company surprised investors by notching a record US$34.9 billion in capital expenditures during the September quarter.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The Azure cloud-computing division – Microsoft’s main vehicle for recouping those investments – saw revenue continue to rise at a rapid clip, but at about the same rate as the prior quarter. A higher growth rate would have provided more assurance that the spending binge is worth it.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Alphabet’s Google, meanwhile, gave a more encouraging outlook. The company said its Gemini AI assistant now has 650 million monthly active users, up 44 per cent from three months ago. And the Google cloud platform has bagged more billion-dollar deals in the first nine months of 2025 than in the prior two years, CFO Anat Ashkenazi said on a call with analysts.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Cloud revenue rose 34 per cent to US$15.2 billion, beating the US$14.8 billion estimate. But Google’s expenses also are climbing. The company expects its capital expenditures to be as much as US$93 billion this year, up from the previous estimate of US85 billion, Ms Ashkenazi said. Next year, she sees a “significant increase” in those numbers.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Of the three companies reporting on Oct 30, Meta offered the most jarring picture. In addition to posting an eye-popping US$16 billion tax charge, the company warned that capital spending would grow at a “significantly faster” clip next year. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Unlike Microsoft and Google, Meta isn’t a major cloud-computing provider to outside customers. That means its spending spree could be riskier.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">If Microsoft and Google overestimate the need for AI services, they already have a way to sell excess computing power to others. And that external demand remains healthy. Both companies reported enormous increases in their backlogs – a tally that represents what customers have committed to spend in the future.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Microsoft’s backlog for commercial customers, which includes some non-cloud expenditures, was US$392 billion. Google’s was US$155 billion, almost double where it stood just 18 months ago.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">With Meta, the AI payoff is less clear. The company, which is infusing AI services into Instagram and Facebook, said the investments will help it better target advertising. That’s the main source of revenue for Meta.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">During Meta’s earnings call on Oct 30, chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said the company has options if it ends up spending too much on infrastructure. In one scenario, it could sell the computing power to other companies.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“We haven’t done that yet,” he said. “But obviously, if you got to a point where you overbuilt, you could have that as an option.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The company also faces concerns about spending in its Reality Labs division, which makes AI smart glasses and other wearable devices. The business reported a loss of US$4.4 billion for the third quarter, with revenue of just US$470 million.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Still, smart glasses are a “huge opportunity,” Mr Zuckerberg said. And the broader danger in AI is spending too little, not too much, he argued.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“I think it’s pretty early, but I think we’re seeing the returns in the core business,” he said. “That’s giving us a lot of confidence that we should be investing a lot more, and we want to make sure that we’re not underinvesting.” BLOOMBERG</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"storyline-wrapper default\"><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">SEOUL - Samsung Electronics’ semiconductor arm reported a stronger-than-expected rise in profit, suggesting global AI demand is helping drive a recovery at the South Korean company’s most important business. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The unit, which competes with SK Hynix and US-based Micron Technology, posted an operating profit of 7 trillion won (S$5.5 billion) for the July to September quarter, compared with analysts’ average projection for 4.7 trillion won. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">South Korea’s largest company, which reported upbeat preliminary operating profit and revenue earlier in October, said on Oct 30 that net income totaled 12.01 trillion won, beating analysts’ estimate of 9.29 trillion won. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Samsung has been mobilising its vast resources to better position itself in a fierce global contest where big spenders including OpenAI and Meta Platforms are amassing computing power for their AI services. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The memory chip business is a key pillar of Samsung’s empire, which spans smartphones and home appliances. But the company has ceded leadership in an arena where customers are willing to pay a premium for memory capacity that boosts artificial intelligence capabilities.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The spending spree is spilling over into demand for conventional memory products, where Samsung dominates. Its stock price is up about 90 per cent since the start of 2025, although shares of AI memory leader and home rival SK Hynix have more than tripled in the same period.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Investors are betting on Samsung’s chances of using its scale to gain ground in high-bandwidth memory. It reclaimed its spot as the top memory maker in terms of revenue in the third quarter after AI-related investments bolstered prices and sales volumes of general-purpose Dram and Nand, according to Counterpoint.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The chipmaker recently secured an order from Advanced Micro Devices while awaiting final approval on HBM3E chips and next-generation HBM4 from Nvidia, whose boss Jensen Huang is in South Korea this week. Samsung has also inked a deal to supply chips to OpenAI’s Stargate project. BLOOMBERG</p></div>",

Mr Yanai has been at the top of the country’s ranking for most of the past decade, and continuously since April 2022, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The recent spike in Mr Son’s fortune mirrors the performance of Tokyo-listed SoftBank, where the Japanese billionaire is the biggest shareholder with a stake of about one third. Mr Son, 68, controls a global portfolio of tech investments from chipmakers to start-up ventures, and has embarked on a spending spree in 2025 to try and position the firm as a linchpin in the global AI boom. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">SoftBank shares climbed on Oct 29 after it was listed among companies interested in launching projects in the United States during President Donald Trump’s visit to Tokyo. Mr Son has become one of Mr Trump’s key foreign backers in global business, making an early pledge this year for US$100 billion in US investments.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">His most ambitious deals now include a planned US$30 billion investment in OpenAI and a US$500 billion initiative to build AI data centres and other infrastructure across the US in partnership with the ChatGPT operator, Oracle and Abu Dhabi fund MGX. Mr Son is also seeking to team up with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for a trillion-dollar industrial complex in Arizona for AI and robots. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">The gains linked to OpenAI, Arm Holdings and other AI bets have helped buoy SoftBank, with its shares becoming a proxy for the AI infrastructure spending boom.

After returning to Japan, he founded SoftBank in 1981 as a distributor of computer software. Over the past four decades, the business has evolved into a conglomerate spanning telecommunications, digital payment and technology investment.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">To be sure, some investors caution that AI valuations have run too high, warning that OpenAI and Nvidia are fueling a complex web of business transactions that’s artificially propping up the trillion-dollar AI boom.

The new approach will enable companies to<b> </b>make their own disclosure decisions as long as they fully disclose material information to investors.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">They are also based on recommendations by a review group set up by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in August 2024 to boost liquidity and raise investor interest in the Singapore stock market. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">For companies that want to list, SGX RegCo will retain key criteria to ensure that only issuers “with strong governance and financial health” are listed, it said. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">This means that unmodified audit opinions remain mandatory to ensure companies comply with financial reporting standards. Issuers must still confirm they’ve secured approvals and met legal requirements that could materially impact their operations.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">For other matters, SGX RegCo will also require clear disclosure of material issues to support investors in making informed decisions. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">More firms will find it easier to list, as SGX RegCo will lower the profit test threshold for new listings from $30 million to $10 million, aligning with other major exchanges. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">SGX RegCo said it recognises that pre-revenue companies with strong growth potential in emerging industries<!-- --> <!-- -->may be suitable for SGX mainboard listings, even if they may not meet traditional financial criteria due to the unique circumstances of their industries. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“Their listing will widen the diversity of companies on the mainboard and broaden investor choice,” SGX RegCo said. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Admission requirements have also been refined for certain industries, such as for pre-revenue life science companies. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">For such companies, their minimum operating record will be reduced from three years to two years, and they need to be primarily engaged in laboratory research and development of their identified products for at least one year, among other criteria.  </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Azure Capital chief executive Terence Wong said adjusting the threshold is a positive move as there are many companies on the cusp of their next growth phase. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“Hitting $30 million means they are already there, but there are companies that are under that threshold that are establishing themselves and that’s when they need funding the most,” he said. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“This move makes it easier for them to come up (and list).”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">For companies that are already listed, SGX RegCo also announced measures to minimise market disruption and provide certainty to companies and investors. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">As part of these measures, trading suspensions will only be considered where there is clear evidence of going concern issues. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Companies that are suspended from trading only because their ability to continue as a going concern is in doubt, may apply to resume trading. The Straits Times understands that this will currently affect some 10 to 15 companies. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">SGX RegCo will also stop issuing public trading queries to companies. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">SGX RegCo chief executive Tan Boon Gin said: “Currently, our trading queries are quite general, and they’re not bespoke, so the feedback that we’ve been getting is that as an unintended consequence, they can have a chilling effect on the market.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">For instance, when the share price goes up by a certain amount for a particular stock, investors might hold back from going in on the stock, because they anticipate that a public trading query might be issued, Mr Tan noted. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“This actually impedes price discovery and means that our efforts on the enterprise side might not be maximised because there’s no proper price discovery.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">But SGX RegCo will still issue “trade with caution” alerts if it feels that there is reason to believe the market is not fair, orderly or transparent. These alerts will be valid for two weeks, with new alerts issued as required. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Mr Tan said such alerts will only be issued when SGX RegCo sees that there is evidence of misconduct that the market should be aware of. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">SGX RegCo will still issue disclosure queries to companies where it concerns material issues. Something is considered “material” if it will affect the decisions of investors in whether or not to trade in a company’s shares.  </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Mr Tan said: “If it’s not material, then we will engage privately with the company so that we can tell the company how they can improve, but without having to go out publicly so that this will not create too much noise in the market and not create unnecessary alarm.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">He added that SGX RegCo’s commitment to the market is that if something could affect investors’ decisions to trade, they will still be informed about it. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Issuers must also continue to publicly disclose materially price-sensitive or trade-sensitive information, SGX RegCo said. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Finally, the financial watch list, which flags companies that have accumulated losses and low average daily market capitalisation, will be removed. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Mr Tan said: “The purpose of the financial watch list wasn’t intended to punish companies. The intention was to motivate companies to turn themselves around, so they would not face delisting. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“The unintended consequence was it might actually affect the company’s ability to turn around its business, because once a company gets put on the financial watch list, then people don’t want to deal with the company… so we may actually have made it more difficult for it to turn around the business.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Although there will no longer be a watch list, SGX RegCo still requires companies to announce if they have hit three years’ of losses, so investors are alerted to the company’s condition. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“We also strongly encourage such issuers, where appropriate, to communicate their future plans and specific actions to improve financial performance,” SGX RegCo said.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Mr Tan emphasised that the SGX RegCo remains committed to maintaining regulatory standards, both in the quality of listings and the level of surveillance over the market, to ensure that they continue to be robust. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">He also hopes that measures aimed at boosting market liquidity and vibrancy will have a positive effect on the regulatory landscape.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“By deploying the monies through institutional investors, we are actually going to introduce a lot more discipline into our market, especially in the mid-to-small cap segment,” he said. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“And this will be very good for the market, because this will push companies to do more for their shareholders, and we also think that this will raise standards overall.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Experts welcomed the moves and said the onus will be on companies to be responsible to stakeholders, while investors also need to be responsible for their investment decisions. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">Prof Lawrence Loh, Director for the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at NUS Business School, noted that the shift is expected to put greater focus on the depth and rigour of company disclosures.</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“Market players, including analysts, must step up their surveillance to encourage quality disclosures beyond checking the boxes.”</p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">He noted that even a full merit-based regime may not be able to catch all possible matters of contention. </p><p class=\"font-body-baseline-regular text-primary\" data-testid=\"article-paragraph-annotation-test-id\">“Ultimately, it’s about a delicate balancing act between enterprise and regulation with a fundamental objective that Singapore must stay a competitive and attractive place of equity issuance, but with the necessary guardrails and safeguards for investors,” he said. </p></div>",
