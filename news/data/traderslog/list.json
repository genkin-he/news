The world’s largest digital asset dropped abruptly after a single whale transaction destabilized prices, raising fresh concerns about market fragility and the risks posed by concentrated holdings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Whale Sell-Off Sparks Panic</h2>\n<p>The spike lower was triggered by a massive whale offload of <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-whale-sells-24-000-061435431.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">24,000 BTC</a>, valued at over $2.7 billion. Blockchain data revealed that the sell order, executed across multiple venues, cascaded through the market and accelerated a price plunge in thin weekend trading conditions. Analysts noted that while large transactions are not unusual in crypto, the timing and size of this move overwhelmed liquidity and triggered a chain reaction of selling. The sell-off erased much of the optimism that had built after dovish remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell just days earlier.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">$550 Million in Liquidations</h2>\n<p>As Bitcoin’s price fell, the impact on leveraged traders was swift and severe. Estimates suggest that more than $550 million worth of long positions were liquidated within hours. Forced selling magnified the decline, as traders who had bet on higher prices were automatically closed out of their positions. This wave of liquidations rippled across the broader crypto ecosystem, hitting both retail and institutional accounts, and highlighted the hazards of excessive leverage in a market still prone to sudden, outsized moves.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">$100 Billion Wiped from Market Value</h2>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Broader Implications</h2>\n\n<!-- Kit append_form_to_content(): Form Position: after_content --> </div>",

The white metal broke past key resistance, reaching fresh multi-year highs amid bullish momentum and rising investor interest. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Monetary Policy and Dollar Weakness</h2>\n<p>One of the key drivers of the rally has been shifting expectations for U.S. monetary policy. Markets increasingly anticipate that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates, and boosting the appeal of non-yielding assets like silver. At the same time, weakness in the U.S. dollar has made silver cheaper for buyers in other currencies, spurring additional demand.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Industrial Demand and Supply Tightness</h2>\n<p>The rally is also supported by the metal’s industrial uses. Silver is critical for electronics, solar panels, semiconductors, and electric vehicle infrastructure, and growing adoption in green technologies has deepened structural demand. With several years of reported supply deficits, the industrial side of silver’s market is tightening at the same time investment flows are accelerating.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Safe-Haven Flows and Speculation</h2>\n<p>Safe-haven buying and speculative positioning have also contributed to silver’s advance. Geopolitical uncertainty and economic jitters have kept investors seeking shelter in precious metals, while retail traders increasingly view silver as a high-beta alternative to gold. From a technical standpoint, silver has broken out of major resistance levels, confirming the strength of the uptrend. However, momentum indicators suggest the market is overbought, leaving it vulnerable to short-term corrections or profit-taking.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Risks and Headwinds</h2>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Outlook: Can Silver Reach $50?</h2>\n\n<!-- Kit append_form_to_content(): Form Position: after_content --> </div>",

The stock jumped over 12 % intraday and closed at a new record, fueled by strong momentum in its prediction markets business and growing investor confidence.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Catalysts Behind the Surge</h2>\n<p>Robinhood’s rally has been driven by several factors: CEO Vlad Tenev revealed that the platform has traded more than 4 billion event contracts, over half in Q3 alone, underscoring the rapid growth of its prediction markets. The company’s recent addition to the S&amp;P 500 brought significant institutional inflows, making it the top-performing index component of 2025 with gains above 260 %. Analysts have upgraded price targets in response to this momentum, noting Robinhood’s evolution beyond a retail trading app, while a supportive backdrop of strong equity and crypto markets has bolstered optimism.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Risks &amp; Considerations</h2>\n<p>Despite the record highs, risks remain. Valuations have surged, leaving the stock vulnerable to volatility and potential pullbacks. The prediction markets business, while a standout growth driver, could attract regulatory scrutiny, and Robinhood’s reliance on transaction-based revenue still ties its fortunes to trading activity levels. Insider selling has also emerged, which, although not unusual at these levels, may raise investor caution. Combined, these factors suggest that while Robinhood’s trajectory is impressive, sustaining it will depend on execution and market conditions.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Next</h2>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Investor Sentiment</h2>\n\n<!-- Kit append_form_to_content(): Form Position: after_content --> </div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"entry-content\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>In a move that is turning heads across both finance and sport, Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has become a major shareholder in Juventus Football Club. Rather than a traditional sponsorship, Tether’s involvement marks a deeper step into ownership of one of Europe’s most iconic football institutions.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From Sponsorship to Shareholding</h2>\n<p>Tether first announced its minority investment in Juventus in February 2025, surprising many in both industries. By April, the company had increased its holdings to over 10 percent of the club’s issued share capital, giving it around 6 percent of the voting rights.</p>\n<p>Today, Tether owns roughly 10.7 percent of Juventus, making it the second-largest shareholder after the Agnelli family’s holding company, Exor NV. Exor confirmed it has not sold any of its own shares. Tether has made it clear that it plans to be an active shareholder, even proposing board candidates and governance changes ahead of Juventus’s November 7, 2025, shareholders’ meeting.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Tether Chose Juventus</h2>\n<p>Tether’s move is not only about publicity. It reflects a broader goal of bridging blockchain and sport. Juventus offers global reach and a passionate fan base, giving Tether a unique platform to demonstrate how digital assets can integrate with mainstream entertainment.</p>\n<p>The company says it aims to help Juventus explore blockchain-based fan engagement, digital payments, and loyalty programs. Juventus already has its own fan token (JUV), and with Tether’s expertise, these initiatives could expand into new areas such as crypto ticketing or digital memberships.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tensions and Opportunities</h2>\n<p>The partnership has not been without challenges. Juventus, which reported losses of nearly 200 million euros for the 2023–24 season, is planning a 110 million euro capital increase to strengthen its finances. Tether has expressed interest in taking part, but reports suggest the club may limit its involvement, creating some tension between the parties.</p>\n<p>Despite that, Tether insists it is a long-term investor that hopes to bring both capital and technological know-how to help modernize club operations. With Juventus working to rebuild financially and structurally, the timing could benefit both sides.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mixed Reactions from Fans</h2>\n<p>Reactions among supporters have been mixed. Some welcome the investment as an opportunity for innovation, while others are cautious about a crypto company entering the club’s inner circle. Tether, which has faced scrutiny over the transparency of its reserves, will need to show that its role is to support rather than disrupt Juventus’s heritage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bigger Picture</h2>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Whistle</h2>\n\n<!-- Kit append_form_to_content(): Form Position: after_content --> </div>",

Instead of simply providing charts and indicators, edgeful analyzes up to five years of historical data to show how specific patterns performed in the past. The platform answers questions like “How often does this gap fill?” or “What are the odds this pattern plays out?”, questions that traders spend countless hours backtesting manually.</p>\n<p>At its core, edgeful aggregates years of market behavior and distills it into <strong>statistical reports</strong>, revealing how price typically reacts to common scenarios: gap opens, opening-range breakouts, volatility expansions, mean reversion and news-driven candles. The company helps traders avoid FOMO, emotional tilt, and blown accounts through its probability insights.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Features</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <strong>Report Library (100+ Custom Reports)</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-ORB-Report-1-scaled.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-39095\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"574\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-ORB-Report-1-1024x574.png\" srcset=\"https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-ORB-Report-1-1024x574.png 1024w, https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-ORB-Report-1-300x168.png 300w, https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-ORB-Report-1-768x430.png 768w, https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-ORB-Report-1-1536x861.png 1536w, https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-ORB-Report-1-2048x1147.png 2048w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-contrast-2-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c9c1563bc69468aa37b985681a2779ea\">Edgeful Opening Range Breakout (ORB) Report</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-contrast-3-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ae29f8b5d136e6e1cbe872ce5964d853\">***</p>\n<p>The report library represents edgeful’s central offering. With over 100 custom-built reports covering 3,000+ assets across stocks, futures, crypto, and forex, there’s extensive actionable data available. Reports cover various strategies including:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Gap fills</strong>. The Gap Fill Report breaks down gap behavior with clarity, letting users filter by gap size, weekday, asset class, and trading session (New York, London, etc.), turning a common market concept into a hands-on strategy.</li>\n<li><strong>Opening range breakouts</strong>. The Opening Range Breakout turns the opening of the session into a clear, data-backed trading framework, showing how often price breaks up, down, or both. I like to trade the <a href=\"https://www.traderslog.com/london-opening-range-breakout-strategy\">London Opening Range Breakout</a>, so I was excited to dig into the stats for this strategy.</li>\n<li><strong>Initial balance breakouts. </strong>The Initial Balance Report is a sharp, session-aware tool that turns the first hour’s high/low into a practical roadmap, showing whether price tends to break one side, both sides, or neither, and how that shifts by session. </li>\n<li><strong>Opening candle continuation</strong>. The Opening Candle Continuation Report is a simple but effective bias tool, showing how often the day finishes green or red based on whether the session’s opening candle starts positive or negative.</li>\n<li><strong>Inside Bar. </strong>The Inside Bars Report measures how often price breaks out when it opens within the previous session’s range, revealing a strong historical tendency for price to reach the prior session’s high or low and making those levels reliable, data-backed targets across markets and sessions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Customization capabilities are robust.</strong> Users can adjust date ranges, filter by specific weekdays, modify session times, and set custom parameters. This flexibility is particularly valuable for traders with specific schedules. If you only trade the first hour due to a day job, reports can be tailored accordingly.</p>\n<p>Edgeful also provides strategies combining multiple reports, like the <strong>Ultimate Reversal Setup</strong>.</p>\n<p>This setup combines three data-backed reports to define both daily bias and high-probability reversal targets. The strategy looks for days when price opens above or below all three key levels: yesterday’s range (using the outside day report), a reference opening price (using the ICT opening retracement report), and the prior session’s close (using the gap fill report), creating strong confluence for mean-reversion. </p>\n<p>When all signals align, historical data shows a high likelihood of price reversing back toward these levels, allowing traders to maintain their conviction and manage positions more effectively.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <strong>What’s in Play Screener</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-Whats-In-Play-scaled.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-38984\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"568\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-Whats-In-Play-1024x568.png\" srcset=\"https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-Whats-In-Play-1024x568.png 1024w, https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-Whats-In-Play-300x166.png 300w, https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-Whats-In-Play-768x426.png 768w, https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-Whats-In-Play-1536x852.png 1536w, https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-Whats-In-Play-2048x1135.png 2048w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-contrast-2-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-09d87433608d714d74d25d307d217288\">What’s In Play</p>\n<p>The screener provides a 360° view across market leaders, monitoring main strategies like Gap Fill, Opening Range Breakout, Initial Balance, and Opening Candle Continuation across all selected tickers. This feature helps traders quickly identify where opportunities are forming and gauge overall market sentiment.</p>\n<p>The screener excels at showing directional bias. When all monitored assets show green across strategies, it suggests strong bullish momentum where shorting may be unwise. Conversely, widespread red signals indicate bearish conditions unsuitable for long positions. Mixed signals typically indicate choppy, directionless markets where sitting out may be prudent.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. <strong>Trading Algorithms</strong></h3>\n<p>Edgeful’s Algo Plan is an upgraded subscription that bundles its data-driven trading algos, currently including Gap Fill, Opening Range Breakout (ORB), and Inside Bar (IB), with new strategies like the Engulfing Candles algo added over time. The plan also includes full broker and prop-firm automation, allowing trades to be entered, managed, and exited automatically without needing to be at the screen.</p>\n<p>A core strength of the plan is customization. Each algo can be tailored to your trading personality, risk tolerance, desired win rate, risk-to-reward, position size, and trading days, then optimized through detailed backtests before being fully automated. The plan also includes educational content and access to a private Discord where users share settings and results, helping traders build confidence in data-backed strategies while reducing emotional decision-making.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. <strong>TradingView Integration</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-Market-Sessions-TradingView-Indicator-scaled.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-38980\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"568\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-Market-Sessions-TradingView-Indicator-1024x568.png\" srcset=\"https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-Market-Sessions-TradingView-Indicator-1024x568.png 1024w, https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-Market-Sessions-TradingView-Indicator-300x166.png 300w, https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-Market-Sessions-TradingView-Indicator-768x426.png 768w, https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-Market-Sessions-TradingView-Indicator-1536x852.png 1536w, https://www.traderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Edgeful-Market-Sessions-TradingView-Indicator-2048x1135.png 2048w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-contrast-2-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-fb33c043d5fea7616047415ae00ae92c\">Edgeful Market Sessions TradingView Indicator</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-contrast-3-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ae29f8b5d136e6e1cbe872ce5964d853\">***</p>\n<p>39 free TradingView indicators are included for subscribers, allowing strategies to be visualized directly on charts.

This simplicity eliminates confusion but may deter traders wanting to test before committing. Based on my experience, I rate the cost as modest in relation to the value it delivers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Platform Access &amp; Usability</h2>\n<p>Edgeful is browser-based and accessible from any internet-connected device: computer, tablet, or phone.

If you treat markets as probabilistic systems, not casinos, the platform aligns naturally with your workflow. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ideal for:</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pattern-based traders seeking statistical validation</li>\n<li>Traders who struggle with emotional decision-making</li>\n<li>Those working to pass prop firm challenges</li>\n<li>Retail traders wanting institutional-level data analysis</li>\n<li>Traders with specific schedules needing customized insights</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Less suitable for:</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Discretionary traders who prefer intuition-based approaches</li>\n<li>Complete beginners unfamiliar with basic trading concepts</li>\n<li>Traders unwilling to invest time learning the platform</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Edgeful represents a genuinely innovative approach to retail trading by democratizing statistical analysis previously available only to institutional players. The company’s mission is to level the playing field by transforming complex data into actionable reports, and I believe it largely succeeds in this goal.</p>\n<p>The platform’s greatest strength is turning the question “What do I think will happen?” into “What does the data show typically happens?” This paradigm shift can fundamentally improve trading discipline and consistency. The comprehensive report library, daily updates, and probability-based insights provide genuine edge for traders willing to incorporate data-driven decision-making.</p>\n<p>What I liked the most about the plaform is that it goes far beyond providing statistical reports; offering a range of actionable strategies, a community of active traders and even one-on-one training and mentorship to get you up to speed. Having tested the platform for several weeks, I rate edgeful as an excellent tool for both serious beginners and experienced traders looking to expand their strategy repertoire.</p>\n\n\n<!-- Kit append_form_to_content(): Form Position: after_content --> </div>",
