The energy research firm estimates that between 500,000 and 600,000 barrels a day of Russian oil production could be curtailed in the next two months as a result of the latest U.S. sanctions, but the risk of immediate production shut-ins are extremely marginal at the moment. \"Given that any impact on Russian output will take time to materialize and with Moscow keen to project stability, it is unlikely Russia will oppose another modest OPEC+8 production increase,\" says Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis. \"For the Kremlin, staying composed and signaling control remain central to its strategy.\" In afternoon trade, Brent crude and WTI rise 0.5% to $64.69 and $60.94 a barrel, respectively.

It also removed its Chinese CEO, citing concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia's move came after the Dutch chipmaker's Chinese unit resumed supplying semiconductors to local customers but stipulated that all sales to distributors would need to be settled using the Chinese yuan.

Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or from the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution to the problem. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia said it is financially independent of Wingtech and it does not raise capital from Wingtech, the letter showed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A spokesperson for Nexperia confirmed it sent the letter and the company could not comment further. Nexperia China and Wingtech did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A spokesperson for the Dutch government referred questions about the wafer shut-off to Nexperia, saying the move had been a corporate decision while state intervention \"concerns the preservation of production capacity and is not aimed at the company's day-to-day operations\".</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Netherlands is in discussions with European governments and the European Commission, as well as Chinese authorities, \"to work toward a constructive solution,\" the spokesperson said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>IMPACT ON PRODUCTION </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Court filings showed that the seizure by the Dutch government came as U.S. pressure was rising on Nexperia after Wingtech was placed on a restricted-export list, though Dutch authorities say governance shortcomings were the trigger. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On October 4, China's commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips from China.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Industry bodies have sounded the alarm over the possible impact on production, with Stellantis </span><span> saying on Thursday that it had set up a \"war room\" to monitor the situation. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Japanese automaker Nissan </span><span> said it had enough chips at the moment to last until the first week of November without disruption. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some Nexperia products that used to cost just a few Chinese cents have gone up in price to two or three yuan each over the past two weeks, more than 10 times their original cost, according to a source familiar with the matter.</span></p></span></div></div>",

The company's gross margin improved to 44.1%, up from 43.7% in the previous year, with an adjusted gross margin of 44.9%. Net income attributable to common stockholders rose to $60.0 million, representing 13.2% of net sales, compared to 12.2% last year. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales increased to 31.9% from 31.0% in the prior year.

The acquisition of VACCO on July 18, 2025, contributed $24.7 million to the net sales this quarter. The company's backlog as of September 27, 2025, was $1.6 billion, up from $1.0 billion as of June 28, 2025, and $0.9 billion as of September 28, 2024.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>RBC Bearings has been actively managing its debt, resulting in a decrease in interest expense to $13.4 million from $15.6 million in the same period last year. This reduction was partially offset by a $200.0 million draw on the Revolving Credit Facility to fund the VACCO acquisition. The company also reported an increase in SG&amp;A expenses to $77.4 million, up from $69.5 million last year, primarily due to higher operational costs.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Management's Perspective</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>Dr. Michael J.

We were well prepared to support the generational expansion taking place in these aerospace and defense markets and are pleased to recognize the outstanding performance reached by our factories and offices. Clearly, we have entered a unique period in our business cycle and look forward to delivering a record year to our shareholders.\"</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Future Outlook</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2026, RBC Bearings expects net sales to be in the range of $454.0 million to $462.0 million, representing a growth rate of 15.1% to 17.1% compared to the prior year.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Tandem Global's Latest Blog Post Delves into the Fascinating World of Parasite Manipulation</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>BETHESDA, MD / ACCESS Newswire / October 31, 2025 / What if I told you zombies are real? And no, not the ones you see on movie screens. I'm talking about nature's zombies, real organisms hijacked and controlled by other living things. This phenomenon, often referred to as parasite manipulation, is found in most ecosystems throughout the world. Parasite manipulation can take shape in many forms, from subtle behavioral changes to dramatic transformations that make the host look and act like something out of a horror film.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In these strange relationships, the \"zombie\" isn't dead, at least not yet, but it's no longer in full control of its own body. Tiny fungi, bacteria, and worms can essentially rewrite the host's brain, forcing it to behave in ways that benefit the parasite rather than the animal itself. A caterpillar might climb to the tip of a plant, paralyzed by a fungus, only to be consumed from within as the fungus spreads its spores. Crickets can be compelled to jump to their grave, where they are then eaten alive by microscopic puppeteers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Parasites often produce chemicals that mimic or interfere with their host's natural hormones and neurotransmitters. The result is a perfectly choreographed takeover. The host becomes a tool, unknowingly carrying out the parasite's reproductive or survival agenda. Unlike fictional zombies, these manipulations are highly specific. Each parasite knows exactly how to influence its host to maximize its own chance of survival, whether that means altering movement or feeding behavior.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But what does this look like in practice? How does a fungus convince an ant to march to its death, or a parasitic worm drive a cricket to take its own life? Scientists still don't fully understand how these parasites control their hosts, but their mysteries open the door to the strange world of nature's real-life zombies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For instance, the fungus Ophiocordyceps, often dubbed the \"zombie-ant fungus\", may appear to be just another harmless organism, but its relationship with ants is nothing short of terrifying. The fungus attaches to the body of an ant, secreting enzymes that dissolve the ant's tough exoskeleton, allowing the fungus to penetrate and begin the infection. Once an ant is infected, the fungus slowly takes over its central nervous system, manipulating it to leave the safety of its colony and aimlessly climb vegetation. Once high enough, the ant clamps down on a leaf or twig in what scientists call a \"death grip,\" where it ultimately dies as the fungus eats through its body, releasing spores to infect the next unlucky ant.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another unsettling example comes from Nematomorph hairworm parasites that live inside grasshoppers and crickets. The worm begins its life in water, hatching as a tiny larva that is ingested by small aquatic organisms like aquatic isopods and amphipods. When a cricket or grasshopper ingests one of these small organisms, the worm enters its body and begins a slow-growing invasion. Over the next few months, the long, thin worm grows inside the insect, preparing for reproduction. When the worm reaches maturity, it releases chemicals that literally rewire the cricket's brain. The cricket suddenly feels an irresistible urge to jump into water. Once the cricket drowns, the hairworm emerges from the cricket's body and enters the water to continue its life cycle, leaving the cricket's body as an empty shell.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The green-banded broodsac flatworm uses an interesting strategy to complete its life cycle. It begins by infecting a snail, its first host, where it eventually moves into the snail's eye stalks. There, the parasite causes the stalks to swell and pulse with bright green and yellow bands that resemble small caterpillars, an appetizing target for birds. The infection also changes the snail's behavior. Instead of hiding in the shade, the snail becomes unusually active and crawls into the open during the day, making itself more visible to predators. When a bird eats the infected snail, the flatworm reaches its final host and reproduces inside the bird's digestive system. In this way, the parasitic flatworm uses the snail as both transportation and bait to attract its intended target.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unlike the green-banded broodsac, the Glyptapanteles take on a more direct approach. This parasitic wasp is found on every continent except Antarctica and takes manipulation to an entirely new level. It lays its eggs inside the caterpillar of the geometrid moth, where the larvae feed on the host from within. When they are ready to pupate, the larvae consume the host from within and emerge to spin cocoons on surrounding vegetation. Remarkably, the caterpillar doesn't immediately die. Instead, it undergoes a dramatic behavioral transformation, standing guard over the newly formed pupae. The caterpillar stops moving and feeding, positioning itself close to the pupae, and when threatened, violently swinging its head to deter potential predators. This self-sacrificial behavior significantly reduces predation on the pupae, increasing their survival rates. However, the caterpillar's fate is sealed; it dies shortly after the wasp larvae emerge as adults, having unwittingly served as a bodyguard.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In observing nature's zombies, we understand the reality of a world where autonomy is fragile. They're reminders that in nature, control is an illusion, and every creature, including us, dances to the rhythm of unseen forces.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Tandem Global</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tandem Global (formerly WHC and WEC), provides the know-how and the network to move business and the environment forward, together.
