            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>WASHINGTON (dpa-AFX) - Paramount Skydance Corporation (PSKY) announced it has entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. (WBD). The all-cash transaction, valued at $81 billion in equity and $110 billion in enterprise value, positions Paramount as a premier global media and entertainment powerhouse.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The announcement follows a dramatic turn in the industry, as Netflix declined to raise its offer for WBD, effectively clearing the path for Paramount to step in with its $81 billion bid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the agreement, Paramount will pay $31 per share in cash for WBD's outstanding stock. To protect shareholders, a 'ticking fee' of $0.25 per share per quarter will be added if the transaction has not closed by September 30, 2026. Paramount projects that the deal will generate over $6 billion in synergies, achieved through technology integration, procurement savings, real estate optimization, and streamlined operations across the combined company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The financing package is equally ambitious. Paramount has secured $47 billion in equity, backed by the Ellison Family and RedBird Capital Partners, with new Class B shares priced at $16.02 each. In addition, $54 billion in debt commitments from Bank of America, Citigroup, and Apollo will support the transaction, including funds to backstop WBD's existing bridge facility. Paramount shareholders will also be offered a $3.25 billion rights offering at the same share price, ensuring broad participation in the deal's funding.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approvals and a shareholder vote scheduled for early spring.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Warner Bros. Discovery closed the regular trading session at $28.17, down $0.63 or 2.19%. In after-hours trading, the stock showed a slight recovery, rising to $28.26, an increase of $0.09 or 0.32%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Copyright(c) 2026 RTTNews.com.

In November 2025, we began to see early signs of an improved supply-demand balance, driven by stronger-than-expected demand from energy storage systems (ESS), as well as certain supply disruptions.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Feliz Solomon and Henna Moussavi</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Almost from the moment Iran's universities opened their gates for the start of a new term last week, it was clear the regime had another problem on its hands. Students came back dressed all in black, shouting slogans against the country's leader.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Activists are harnessing anger over last month's brutal crackdown to revive protests aimed at toppling the Islamic Republic. Led by a constellation of disparate groups, the new wave of dissent is ratcheting up domestic pressure on the regime just as it braces for a potential military showdown with the U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The students are bringing a measure of cohesion to what has otherwise been a spontaneous movement fueled by frustration over a crumbling economy. Since last week, crowds have swelled on campuses in major cities as students joined memorials for peers who were killed in the crackdown. The gatherings morphed into heated rallies where students burned the country's flag and called for the death of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Chaotic scuffles and fistfights erupted on several campuses when antiregime protesters were confronted by mobs of regime loyalists.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As the protests gathered pace, Chief Justice Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i warned that \"certain slogans and behaviors, such as burning a flag on campus, are absolutely unacceptable.\" At least half a dozen universities in cities including Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz and Urmia announced that courses would be held remotely for the next few weeks. Some said the move coincided with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, though others cited stability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Student associations responded by calling for a boycott of online classes and urging students to show up on campus anyway.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"These protests are important, because they show Iranian society is still defiant,\" said Arash Azizi, an Iranian-American historian and author of the book \"What Iranians Want .\" \"I don't think this problem of regime versus people will be resolved unless there's fundamental change. They know they can't get out of this so easily.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sustaining the protests hinges on a fragile alliance united by little more than outrage. Student activism in Iran has traditionally been split broadly among three camps representing left-leaning progressives, monarchists and regime loyalists. The last of these are often members of the Basij, a paramilitary group backed by the government that has branches in almost every high school and university. This group was instrumental in the violence that put down street protests in January.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What's emerging now, analysts say, is a coalition of convenience among progressives and monarchists on campus. Mohammad Ali Kadivar, an Iranian associate professor of sociology and international studies at Boston College, says these two camps appear to be tolerating each other as they face a shared opponent. \"For now at least, they're less hostile toward each other,\" Kadivar said. \"They agree implicitly on what they don't want, but much less on what comes next.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The broader opposition movement, much of it in exile, remains bitterly divided. Their rivalry goes back to the betrayals of the 1979 revolution, when democrats and communists helped Iran's religious clerics overthrow the monarchy. Once in power, the clerics turned on their partners, killing and imprisoning them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On campuses at least, both sides are focused on a common enemy: Khamenei. Chants of \"Death to the dictator\" rumble through courtyards. A video shared with The Wall Street Journal by the citizen-journalist network Mamlekate shows demonstrators at Tehran's Shahid Beheshti University raising their hands above their heads and flinging them from side to side — a taboo gesture mocking Khamenei, whose right arm was paralyzed during an assassination attempt in 1981.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Elsewhere, students plastered school walls with photographs of the dead. At Sharif University of Technology, they hung toy rats from trees — a reference to Khamenei hiding from his enemies in underground bunkers — according to video footage verified by Storyful, which is owned by the Journal's parent company News Corp.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What has surprised some analysts is the degree to which students have rallied behind Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's late and final shah. Pahlavi has positioned himself as a potential leader if the regime falls, and in early January he urged Iranians to join the protests that began late last year over the country's free-falling currency. Many protesters said that was why they participated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Jan. 8, the regime shut off the internet and moved to crush the snowballing movement. Human Rights Activists in Iran, a U.S.-based nonprofit, says it has confirmed the deaths of some 7,000 people during the crackdown, and the arrests of more than 50,000 others.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Students on several campuses have embraced symbols of the monarchy, such as the country's former flag, which has a \"Lion and Sun\" emblem on it associated with the dynasty. They frequently chant slogans like, \"Long live the shah!\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The editor of a student media outlet based in Tehran said he supports having Pahlavi lead a transitional unity government until elections can be held, and hopes to get past the factional differences that have divided the opposition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The editor, whose name the Journal withheld out of concern for his safety, said he founded a new coalition called the Union of Lion and Sun Universities to streamline student activism and that more than 30 student groups joined in its first few days.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>United Students Media, a left-leaning collective of student activists across Iran, told the Journal that it doesn't support Pahlavi, whom it views as undemocratic. Its goal, it said, \"is to overthrow the Islamic Republic.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran's universities have long been incubators for political change. Radical students at the University of Tehran played a crucial role in the 1979 revolution. Since then, Iran's Shiite clerical leaders have tried to control schools by purging staff and replacing them with loyalists while harshly punishing dissent on campus.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran's students often have taken risks that other segments of society couldn't. In 2009, they defied threats from the regime to lead opposition rallies. In 2022, authorities violently suppressed the \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" street protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman killed in police custody after being detained for improperly wearing her hijab. Students headed for the relative safety of campuses to keep momentum alive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The question is will they be able to build political alliances, can they organize and mobilize the masses,\" said Azizi, the historian. \"What catches on is completely unpredictable, there's almost a mysterious alchemy to it. What's clear is this: The regime hasn't pacified them.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Feliz Solomon at feliz.solomon@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Berber Jin, Robbie Whelan and Kate Clark</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nvidia plans to unveil a new processor specially tailored to help OpenAI and other customers build faster, more efficient tools, a major shake-up to its business that is poised to reset the AI race.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company is designing a new system for \"inference\" computing, a form of processing that allows AI models to respond to queries, according to people familiar with the plans. The new platform, set to be revealed at Nvidia's GTC developer conference in San Jose next month, will incorporate a chip designed by the startup Groq, the people said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Inference computing has been the subject of intense industry competition. Rivals Google and Amazon have designed chips that compete with Nvidia's flagship systems. And the explosion of autonomous coding in the tech workforce has created demand for new chips that can more efficiently handle complex AI-related tasks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OpenAI has agreed to become one of the largest customers of the new processor, some of the people said, representing a major win for Nvidia. The ChatGPT maker, which is one of Nvidia's largest customers, has spent the past few months shopping for more efficient alternatives to Nvidia's chips, and signed a deal with a chip startup last month that provides it with new options.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earlier Friday, OpenAI alluded to the new processor when it announced it would sign up for a major purchase of \"dedicated inference capacity\" from Nvidia, alongside a $30 billion investment from the chip giant. It also signed a major new deal to use Amazon's Trainium chips.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nvidia has dominated the business of designing and selling GPUs — graphics processing units — a type of processor that can perform billions of simple tasks simultaneously. But for the first time since the start of the AI boom, it is confronting the limits of its flagship product. As the market shifts toward inference, Nvidia is feeling pressure from some customers to produce chips that can more efficiently power AI applications.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The chip giant's powerful Hopper, Blackwell and Rubin series GPUs are considered best-in-class for training gigantic AI models and command top prices. Most analysts estimate that Nvidia controls 90% or more of the GPU market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang has long claimed that Nvidia's GPUs are the market leader for both training and inference, and that such versatility was a key appeal of the product.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But over the past year, demand for advanced computing has shifted from training to inference as companies deploy AI agents and other tools that they hope will upend hundreds of industries and generate enormous profits from subscription fees. Agents are AI systems that act relatively autonomously to carry out tasks on behalf of users.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many companies that build and operate AI agents find that GPUs are too costly, consume too much energy and aren't as well-suited to actually running their models. With the meteoric rise of agentic AI, Nvidia is under pressure to develop inference chips that are less expensive and more energy-efficient.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last month, OpenAI signed a multibillion-dollar computing partnership with Cerebras, which offers an inference-focused chip that its CEO Andrew Feldman says is faster than Nvidia's GPUs. OpenAI entered into negotiations with Cerebras last fall after its engineers asked for a faster inference chip for agentic coding applications, The Journal previously reported.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nvidia agreed to pay $20 billion late last year to license key technologies from Groq and hire its top leadership, including founder Jonathan Ross, in one of Silicon Valley's largest-ever \"acqui-hire\" deals, The Wall Street Journal reported.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Groq designed chips that use a different architecture from Nvidia's, called \"language processing units,\" which are highly efficient for inference functions. So far, however, Nvidia has kept mum about how it intends to use Groq's technology.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI inference computing is divided into two main tasks: pre-fill, or the process by which a model interprets a user prompt, and decode, by which the model generates a response, one word at a time. Pre-fill is usually the faster of the two processes, while decode tends to be especially slow, for larger AI models.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Coding applications have emerged as one of the most important — and profitable — uses of enterprise AI, with Anthropic's Claude Code generally regarded as the market leader. But Anthropic relies primarily on chips designed by Amazon Web Services and Alphabet's Google Cloud unit, rather than by Nvidia, to power its models.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of Claude's closest competitors, however, is OpenAI's fast-growing Codex tool. The ChatGPT-maker plans to use the new Nvidia system to improve Codex, people familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Typically, Nvidia has paired its Vera chips, which are central processing units, or CPUs, with its Rubin GPUs in powerful data center servers, but some large customers have found that certain agentic AI workloads can be run more efficiently on CPUs alone.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This month, Nvidia announced an expanded partnership with Meta Platforms that included the first-ever significant CPU-only deployment to support Meta's ad-targeting AI agents.

We don't need it, we don't want it and will not do business with them again!\" President Trump said in a post on Truth Social.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Defense Department and other agencies using Anthropic's Claude models will have a six-month phaseout period, he said, adding that there would be civil and criminal consequences if the company isn't helpful during the transition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump's announcement came shortly before the Pentagon's Friday afternoon deadline for Anthropic to agree to let the military use its models in all lawful-use cases, a concession the company had refused to make. \"We cannot in good conscience accede to their request,\" Anthropic Chief Executive Dario Amodei said on Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump and administration officials have attacked the company for that stance, while also taking exception to its push for AI regulations and its links to organizations that are big Democratic donors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shortly after the deadline, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on X that he is designating the company a supply-chain risk, impairing its ability to work with other government contractors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hegseth had previously threatened the move. The designation is normally used for companies from foreign adversaries like China that pose security threats.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Depending how aggressively the Defense Department enforces the restriction, it could mean that other companies working with the Pentagon will have to show that they don't use Claude at all, a threat that could hit swaths of Anthropic's business. \"America's warfighters will never be held hostage by the ideological whims of Big Tech,\" Hegseth said in his post.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI and security experts said the administration's actions could have a chilling effect for other businesses considering working with the Pentagon or other agencies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is a dark day in the history of American AI. The message sent to the business community and to countries around the world could not be worse,\" said Dean Ball, a former Trump administration AI adviser who is now a senior fellow at the Foundation for American Innovation, a center-right think tank. He had called for the administration not to use the supply-chain risk designation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ball said that Anthropic partners and investors including Nvidia, Amazon and Google might have to divest from the company or stop working with it if they want to continue working with the Pentagon. Some legal analysts have said it only applies to the work companies do with the military, not all private-sector business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is about Anthropic not being one of the favored companies and they're going to pay the price for not bowing down and not signing on the dotted line,\" said Jack Shanahan, who oversaw AI efforts in the military for during the first Trump administration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It basically says to any startup that's contemplating dipping its toe in the Defense Department water that they're going to grab your ankle and pull you all the way in,\" said Gregory Allen, a senior adviser focused on AI at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Allen, who previously worked on the Defense Department's AI strategy, called the move \"completely absurd.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is going to be a huge deterrent to companies thinking about serving the defense industry,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. The company said Thursday it wouldn't meet the Pentagon's conditions but was \"ready to continue our work to support the national security of the United States.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic's contract with the Pentagon is worth as much as $200 million. The company had sought to have protections written into the deal against the use of its models for autonomous weapons and mass domestic surveillance. The military has said it should have final authority to decide how the technology can be used within the law.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even absent the supply-chain risk designation, broadening the clash to include all federal agencies takes the Anthropic fight to a much larger scale than its spat with the Pentagon. The company's Claude models are being used across the government to do everything from summarize documents to analyze data. Pausing those functions to swap in alternatives could set back the government's AI and modernization efforts, AI experts have said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pentagon officials have criticized Anthropic leaders including Amodei for seeking control over the military's operations. After Claude was used in the Venezuela raid to capture former President Nicolás Maduro in January, an Anthropic employee asked a counterpart at data-mining firm Palantir, its partner, about how the technology was used. Defense Department officials learned about the exchange and viewed it as a challenge to the department's prerogative to have final say in operational matters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic has said the Palantir question was part of routine technical discussion between partners.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The new moves by the administration come as other AI companies grapple with their own red lines. OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman told staff Thursday that the company was working with the Defense Department to see if its models could be used in classified settings while maintaining the same safety guardrails Anthropic has, The Wall Street Journal reported. Employees at Google and OpenAI signed an online petition urging their companies to maintain the same red lines.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Elon Musk's xAI is currently the only AI company besides Anthropic with approval to be used in classified settings, but government agencies have raised concerns about the reliability of its Grok model and how quickly it can be substituted after Claude was embedded in the Pentagon for many months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Trump administration and Anthropic have been feuding since the start of Trump's second term. The company hired several top Biden administration officials, proposed AI regulations and guardrails and criticized the president for exporting AI chips to China, actions that upset administration officials including David Sacks, the White House AI czar.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last summer, the administration put out an executive order on \"woke AI,\" saying the government had an \"obligation not to procure models that sacrifice truthfulness and accuracy to ideological agendas.\" Anthropic was widely seen as a target of the order. The company has said it isn't woke or political and previously called such attacks baseless.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Pentagon has said it didn't want to use Claude for autonomous weapons, mass surveillance or other illegal uses, but that it needs to have full control over the technology it deploys.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

Senior U.S. officials, including at the White House, view Anthropic's outspoken stances on safety and ties to big Democratic donors as potentially making the company too \"woke\" to be a reliable provider, people familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>President Trump said Friday the federal government would stop working with Anthropic and directed every federal agency to immediately cease use of its technology. The Pentagon had earlier given Anthropic a Friday deadline to agree to looser rules on its use by the U.S. military.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic was the only developer approved for classified use before the deal between xAI and the military. The looser controls on Grok, and Musk's absolutist stance on free speech, have made it a more attractive choice to the Pentagon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other officials have questioned whether Grok's looser controls present risks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ed Forst, the top official at the GSA, the procurement arm of the federal government, in recent months sounded an alarm with White House officials about potential safety issues with Grok, people familiar with the matter said. Other GSA officials under him had also raised safety concerns about Grok, which they viewed as sycophantic and too susceptible to manipulation or corruption by faulty or biased data — creating a potential system risk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the time, in late December and early January, Grok was under fire for allowing sexualized editing of photos, including of children. Government officials saw the issue as representative of how Grok could be exploited by bad actors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The matter reached Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, who called a senior xAI executive about the concerns, the people said. The executive told her that xAI was working on addressing the safety issues that made Grok overcompliant. Josh Gruenbaum, a senior GSA acquisitions official recruited through Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, assured government officials that the government platform of Grok was separate from the public one. Wiles was satisfied, the people said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Musk, who has said he is committed to preventing child exploitation, announced in January that the company would limit the image-generation and editing tools to paying customers. He and xAI didn't respond to requests for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In recent weeks, GSA officials were told to put xAI's logo on a tool called USAi, which is essentially a sandbox for federal employees to experiment with different AI models. Grok hadn't been made accessible through USAi largely due to safety concerns, and it remains off the platform, people familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The website shows xAI's logo but only offers models from Anthropic, Google and Meta .</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A team at the GSA studying AI has circulated the report flagging Grok's safety problems to top agency officials, the people said. The larger report noted that Grok's safety failures aren't limited to edge cases but \"reflect a broader tendency toward unsafe compliance in unguarded configurations.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a statement, Gruenbaum said the agency takes AI safety seriously. \"We rigorously evaluate frontier AI models, including xAI, through a comprehensive internal review process. In this instance, we followed established procedures and maintain our determination to keep it on schedule,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Two weeks ago, Matthew Johnson, the Pentagon's chief of responsible AI, stepped down in part over his concerns that safety and governance had become an afterthought amid the Defense Department's intense push to expand AI capabilities, people familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Previously, Johnson's team had circulated memos that had highlighted Grok's safety issues and questioned whether it was aligned with government ethics and standards. Those notes had been sent up their chain of command at the Pentagon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reached for comment, Johnson pointed to a LinkedIn post announcing his departure where he said he was proud of his team of \"true, quiet professionals, who had outsized impact and undersized recognition\" in the DOD's Responsible AI Division: \"We were continually faced with impossible situations, but somehow always delivered through a combination of grit &amp; repeated all-nighters.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that the department \"is excited to have xAI, one of America's national champion frontier AI companies onboard and looks forward to deploying Grok to its official AI platform GenAI.mil in the very near future.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The National Security Agency, which oversees much of the country's intelligence gathering and processing, conducted a classified review in November 2024 of large language models, including Grok. It determined Grok had particular security concerns that other models, including Anthropic's Claude, didn't, people familiar with the review said. Its conclusion served as a red flag that deterred some parts of the Pentagon from using Grok, the people said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The use of Anthropic's Claude in the U.S. military's operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro last month intensified its tense dispute with the Pentagon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic's usage guidelines prohibit Claude from being used to facilitate violence, develop weapons or conduct surveillance, and the company has refused to let the military use its models in all lawful scenarios. xAI has agreed to that language.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>xAI got a foothold in the Pentagon through a July contract from the AI office worth up to $200 million, which was also awarded to Google, OpenAI and Anthropic. Google and OpenAI have approval for use in unclassified settings but not classified activities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman told staff Thursday that the company was working with the Defense Department to see if its models could be used in classified settings while maintaining the same safety guardrails Anthropic has, The Wall Street Journal reported. Employees at Google and OpenAI signed an online petition urging their companies to maintain the same red lines.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Until recently, the military has leaned on Claude over Grok because it is seen by many in the industry as a more reliable model, AI and security analysts said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I do not believe they are peers in performance right now across all of the capabilities that matter to a customer like the Department of War,\" said Gregory Allen, a senior adviser focused on AI at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. He previously worked on the Defense Department's AI strategy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the Biden administration, the Chief Digital and AI Office, which is part of the Pentagon, declined to pursue any use of Grok, people familiar with the matter said. The concerns included that Grok made it difficult to track the data sources used to train the model, didn't follow federal government standards for responsible AI and had weak guardrails for safety. xAI didn't sufficiently try to hack its own technology to identify and fix vulnerabilities, a process known in technology as red teaming, the people said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>People who have reviewed Grok in the government setting said that recent testing shows the chatbot is more susceptible than other models to \"data poisoning,\" in which manipulated, biased or inaccurate data corrupts the underlying data sets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, U.S. officials have determined Grok to be effective at imitating an adversarial actor, which is useful, for example, in war gaming, people familiar with the discussions said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Shalini Ramachandran at Shalini.Ramachandran@wsj.com, Heather Somerville at heather.somerville@wsj.com and Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Adam Levine</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Thursday morning, I woke up to an inbox full of analyst notes praising another great quarter from the artificial-intelligence chip leader, Nvidia, which had reported its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings the previous afternoon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Acceleration at a Scale Never Seen\" was the title of Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes' note.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Generational growth at inspirational valuation,\" said Vivek Arya of Bank of America.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The laudatory missives multiplied.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, the stock fell by 5.5% on Thursday. Despite strong results and the accelerating 2026 AI data-center buildout — of which Nvidia remains the primary beneficiary — the stock has been stuck in the mud for months. Since October, it has moved sideways, down about 1%, while the S&amp;P 500 index rose by 3.3%. And despite beating earnings expectations 13 quarters in a row, the stock declined the next day by an average of 3% after the last three of them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Negative narratives have crept in:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Growth deceleration. This once seemed like a real concern. Year-over-year sales growth peaked at 265% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, and it declined through the second quarter of 2026. But the growth rate turned back up in the second half of the fiscal year, and Nvidia's guidance was for more acceleration in the current quarter. This narrative is on life support.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Competition. Nvidia's largest customers, the \"hyperscalers,\" are looking to diversify their supply chains and not be so dependent on Nvidia. Meta Platforms just signed a deal with Advanced Micro Devices for its AI chips. The three big cloud providers -- Amazon.com, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- all make their own custom chips they would like customers to use, and there are many chip start-ups. Alphabet is getting the most traction so far. Nvidia has a deal with start-up Groq for its AI chips.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Risky commitments. To deal with supply-chain shortages, Nvidia has committed to $95 billion of inventory purchases, almost all of which will be spent this year. In all of fiscal 2026, Nvidia had $62 billion in cost-of-goods-sold, so this is a major supply commitment, and some of these orders may not be cancelable. A year from now, this will either look like a genius move that kept Nvidia's industry-leading gross profit margin high or a disastrous example of hubris that destroyed its gross margin.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Limitations of the data-center boom. Nvidia's main vendors are seeing tight supply. Land, skilled construction crews, and power are becoming harder to come by. The hyperscaler customers have given sky-high guidance for 2026 capital expenditures, but how long can that last? They have substantial cash flow of their own, but they are reaching the limits of it with their even larger capital budgets. They are already dipping into debt. How much will investors stomach?</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Circular financing. Nvidia had over $100 billion in operational cash flow last year, and it has been spreading that wealth around throughout the AI start-up ecosystem. In fiscal 2026 it made $17.5 billion in start-up equity investments, and another $13 billion to Groq -- and it has commitments for another $11.4 billion this year. On Friday, Nvidia invested $30 billion in OpenAI. Many of these companies are Nvidia customers, or customers of customers, and a good portion of those investments will wind up in Nvidia's pockets. These are big numbers, but they pale in comparison to Nvidia's sales: $216 billion in fiscal 2026 and a projected $350 billion this year. Nvidia is supporting the ecosystem, not the other way around, and in the process it is taking a stake in a range of AI start-ups.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Nothing seemed to change this week for Nvidia, but there was some light at the end of the tunnel for enterprise software makers, and they're hoping it's not a train headed their way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These stocks hit the bricks at the end of last year, and this year they have been getting demolished. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector exchange-traded fund was down 27% through this past Monday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But then one of their tormentors became a patron saint.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Much of the stocks' woes were attributable to AI start-up Anthropic's agent software. Agents use language models like Anthropic's Claude to accomplish a complex series of tasks from simple conversational prompts, which led to fears that business software is replaceable by AI. On Feb. 5, Anthropic released tools for specific agent tasks in several areas like legal and finance. The software ETF capped eight straight trading days of declines with a 5% drop in what felt like capitulation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But on Tuesday, Anthropic gave a presentation aimed at increasing AI adoption among business customers, something that's been slow going. The demonstration was all about how Anthropic's agents work...with software. Only four minutes into the hourlong show, Anthropic presenters began bragging about how much enterprise software from Microsoft, Salesforce, Google, Docusign, and others works with Claude agents. The company also announced a new integration with Intuit's financial software the same day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Anthropic wants to partner with Intuit, not kill Intuit. They want to partner with Salesforce. They don't want to replace Salesforce,\" said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill in a Barron's Q&amp;A this week. \"They're not going to replace some of these systems that we use. They will make them better. There's no doubt they will create new applications that potentially can compete. But we think it's more of a partnership than a full eviction of everyone in the software city.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And software stocks did turn on the Anthropic demonstration. The software ETF rose three days running, up 7.4% in all. But I'm not ready to call the bottom yet. Sentiment around the sector remains on a hair trigger, and it won't take much to knock it back down, like a fictional Substack post on Monday that sent the software ETF down 4.8%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Friday, the mood turned again, and the software ETF was down 2% in midday trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",
