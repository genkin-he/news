            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Mark Hulbert</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investment professionals rarely outperform in a bull market. If you want stock picking to pay off, you're essentially rooting for a crash.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Will this year bring a bear market?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If this really is a time for stock pickers to get greedy, then a market downturn is likely.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investment advisers hoping for a return of a \"stock-pickers market\" should be careful what they wish for. I'm referring to the age-old distinction between an investment environment in which most stocks march to the beats of their own individual drummers (a so-called \"market of stocks\") and its opposite, an environment in which most stocks rise and fall in tandem with each other (a so-called \"stock market\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a \"stock market\" the best strategy is simply investing in a broad stock-market index fund, while in a \"market of stocks\" the strategy most likely to beat the market is picking and choosing individual stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There have been a rash of declarations that we have entered a market-of-stocks environment. Bloomberg even declared that \"for stock pickers, now might be the time to get greedy.\" But what many analysts don't appreciate is that the distinction between these two market environments is correlated with the market's cycle. Stock picking is far more likely to be successful when the overall market is falling than when it's rising. To hope for a \"market of stocks\" is functionally equivalent in many ways to hoping for a bear market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This functional equivalence is illustrated in the accompanying chart. Each dot represents one of the calendar years since 1981; its place on the vertical axis represents the percentage of investment newsletter portfolios that beat the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index XX:W5000FLT in that calendar year (as measured by the portfolios tracked by my performance auditing firm). Each dot's place along the horizontal axis reflects the Wilshire 5000's return in that year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notice the steep downwardly sloping trendline that best fits these dots, the statistical significance of which is quite high (as signified by its impressive r-squared). That means, on average, more portfolios beat the market when the stock market is falling - and vice versa. The implication: If it's really time for stock pickers to get greedy, then the market as a whole is likely to fall.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last year is a good case in point. The broad market, as measured by the Wilshire 5000's total return, gained 17.1% in 2025 - well-above the U.S. stock market's long-term average rate of return. Sure enough, stock pickers struggled: Just 31% of monitored investment newsletter portfolios beat the market, in fact. A similarly low proportion of actively-managed equity funds and ETFs beat the market, according to Morningstar's Active/Passive Barometer - just 38%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Of course, none of this discussion sheds any light on whether there actually will be a bear market in 2026, and therefore whether or not the odds favor stock picking. But unless you have an unusually good crystal ball about when the next bear market will begin, there's no reason to change your investment strategy for making money in the stock market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 212,000 for the week ended February 21, data showed.

In order to effect the delivery of shares, the board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on a directed new issue of shares to Nazgero on the following terms and conditions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on a directed new issue of not more than 53,295,593 shares, entailing an increase in the share capital of not more than SEK 72,924.1642982568. The issue shall otherwise be governed by the following terms and conditions:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>In deviation from the shareholders’ pre-emption rights, the new shares may only be subscribed for by Nazgero Consulting Services Ltd.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The subscription price per share shall amount to SEK 0.09. The share premium shall be transferred to the unrestricted share premium reserve.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Subscription for the shares shall take place through set-off no later than three weeks from the date the general meeting has resolved on the new issue. The board of directors is entitled to extend the subscription period.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Payment for the shares subscribed for shall be made through set-off of a claim consisting of accrued consulting fees.

The subscription price of SEK 0.09 per share is identical to the subscription price in the directed issue to external investors, which has been determined through arm’s length negotiations. The board acknowledges that the subscription price represents a significant discount to the current market price. The board has nevertheless concluded that the subscription price is justified for the following reasons: (i) the CEO receives shares on exactly the same terms as the external investors in the Directed Issue, and there is no preferential treatment; (ii) Fenja Capital II A/S, an independent external holder of convertible instruments, converted at a price of SEK 0.09 per share on 23 February 2026, confirming that the price level has been accepted by an independent third party; (iii) the issue relates to a debt conversion, not a purchase of shares at a discounted price – the CEO has already rendered services to the Company and is now electing to convert those claims into equity at a price consistent with third-party transactions; and (iv) the subscription price is consistent with, or at a premium to, subscription prices in the Company’s capital raises over the past twelve months: the rights issue of September 2025 (SEK 0.06 per share), the exercise of warrants of series TO6 in May 2025 (SEK 0.09 per share), and the Fenja Capital conversion of February 2026 (SEK 0.09 per share).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The maximum dilution effect as a result of the new issue of shares proposed under this item 7 amounts to approximately 6 per cent based on the number of outstanding shares in the Company at the time of this notice.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Roberto Garcia Martinez has not participated in the preparation of the proposal under this item 7.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A valid resolution requires the approval of shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Personal data</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Personal data obtained from the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB, notification of attendance at the meeting and information about representatives, proxies and assistants will be used for registration, preparation of the voting list for the meeting and, where applicable, minutes of the meeting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Other</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The required documents, complete proposals for resolutions and proxy forms will be available at the company's office at Strandvägen 7a, 114 56 Stockholm, Sweden, and on the company's websiteeurobatteryminerals.comno later than two weeks prior to the general meeting and will be sent to shareholders who so request and state their postal address.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shareholders have the right to request information in accordance with Chapter 7, Section 32 of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551).</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Eurobattery Minerals</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Eurobattery Minerals AB is a Swedish mining company listed on Swedish Nordic Growth Market (BAT) and German Börse Stuttgart (EBM).
