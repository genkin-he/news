The company's stock is still facing an overhang due to pressure from the White House to lower the prices of its GLP-1 drugs and the potential impact of Novo Nordisk's Medicare pricing negotiations for its semaglutide GLP-1. But Eli Lilly shares are set up well to keep rising through the end of the year with updates on its eloranlitide, retatrutide and orforglipron drugs coming. Shares rise 3.4%.
