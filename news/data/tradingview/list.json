SUMMARY OF RESULTS Current Quarter Previous Quarter % age Change Average Net Production Rate (BOEPD) 251* 303 -17% Average Oil Price Brent (US$/bbl) US$69.07 US$67.82 +2% Sales Revenue (cash received) A$ 3.2 million A$ 2.6 million +23% Cash Unrestricted A$ 4.0 million** A$ 4.8 million** -17% * Production primarily reduced due to well down time at the Vienna Basin Fields – 5 well workovers are scheduled during Q4 2025 to restore production. ** Excludes restricted funds secured for bonds and guarantees totalling A$ 1.3 million Past Quarter Highlights * Land secured, drilling and environmental permitting for three Shallow Gas Prospects (HOCH, GOLD and SCHOE) drilling in February 2026. Ongoing maturation of over 6 follow up shallow gas prospects. * Discussions with potential farmin parties for funding ADX' 100% interest ADX-AT-II GOLD Area cluster. * Welchau-1 Environmental Clearance objection overturned by Courts - flow testing in January 2026. * Welchau Deep prospect generation – 125 BCF Mean prospective Estimate Resource*** (refer Schedule 1). * Formal award of Sicily Channel Gas Exploration Permit, Offshore Italy - 369 BCF Best Estimate Prospective Resource*** (Refer ASX Release Dated 30.8.2022) * Commitment to purchase of Anshof Permanent Production Facility - 3,000 barrel per day processing capacity. * Upper Austria Prospect Inventory Update - 374 BCF Gas and 31 MMBLs Oil Mean Estimate Prospective Resource*** (refer Schedule 1). * Settlement of 20% interest in Anshof Field Area purchased in exchange for partners outstanding debt. *** Cautionary Statement: Prospective Resources are those estimated quantities of petroleum that may potentially be recovered by the application of a future development project(s) relate to undiscovered accumulations. These estimates have both a risk of discovery and a risk of development. Further exploration appraisal and evaluation is required to determine the existence of a significant quantity of potentially recoverable hydrocarbons. Next Quarter Planned Activities * Investigate and prepare for a potential dual listing on Oslo Børs' Euronext Growth market. * Trading access for European investors, enhanced visibility, improved liquidity, broaden shareholder base and support future growth opportunities. * Finalise preparations for 2026 Upper Austria testing and drilling work program. * Ongoing maturation of new shallow gas prospect generation in 100% equity held ADX-AT-I licence area. * Conclude farmout transaction for funding ADX' 100% interest in the ADX-AT-II GOLD Area cluster. * Mature Anshof Near Field Oil prospects and Jurassic aged oil and gas plays utilising reprocessed 3D Seismic. * Italy resources review incorporating additional licence data as well as new data from nearby analogous fields. ADX Executive Chairman, Mr Ian Tchacos, said \"During the past quarter ADX has assembled an outstanding opportunity for organic growth based on low-risk shallow gas targets capable of providing multiples of production growth in a short period of time as well as a near field appraisal well. What stands out about the program is its low-risk nature and the ability to efficiently and economically develop both gas and oil discoveries. The following graphic illustrates the potential build up production from the 2026 work program.\" \"Success with the initial shallow gas play program can be followed up with an additional 6 (six) shallow gas targets exhibiting similar seismic characteristics. \"The decision by the Upper Austrian State Administrative Court to overturn the Welchau environmental objections is very positive. It is not only important for the resumption testing at Welchau as well as potential future operations to explore the Welchau -Deep prospect, it is an important indication of the ongoing support for gas exploration due to the strong public interest for securing clean domestic natural gas resources in Austria. \"While the operational focus in the near term is on Upper Austria, our new Offshore Sicily Channel permit is a potentially transformational asset in a predictable geological setting. The permit's potential is validated by historic data in the permit as well as nearby analogous gas fields at Lippone Mazarra and Argo Cassiopeia. The economic potential of any discovery in the permit is enhanced by highly productive reservoirs, shallow water and drill depths, nearby infrastructure, low royalty rates and strong gas pricing. \"We expect a positive revision of prospective resource estimates for Sicily Channel permit in the coming quarter incorporating additional data from within our permit and the surrounding analogous gas fields.\" For more information please see the PDF files.

Its forthcoming five-year economic plan outlines ways to \"safeguard the multilateral trading system and promote broader international economic flows.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beyond messaging, China has also taken action. During a trip to Malaysia last week, Chinese Premier Li Qiang attended the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Kuala Lumpur and signed an upgraded China-ASEAN free trade deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As was the case at APEC, the contrast with the U.S. was palpable. Trump's six-hour blitz of meetings at the ASEAN forum achieved four trade deals — but none of them reduced U.S. trade barriers and some included further threats. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They stipulated that if a country deepens relations with another that \"jeopardizes essential U.S. interests\" it would face more levies, in what experts say is a reference to China.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The upgraded free trade agreement only reinforces China's dominant posture in terms of regional economic engagement,\" Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center think-tank, said in reference to the China-ASEAN deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"In comparison, U.S. bilateral trade deals with individual countries are much more circumstantial and limited in their scope.\" </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>PRICE OF FREE TRADE</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Although no policy breakthroughs are expected at APEC, Xi's presence at the summit, along with Li's at ASEAN, sends a powerful message about China investing in relationship-building with regional countries, say analysts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sun said that compared to China's consistent presence, U.S. \"inevitably appears selective and conditional\".</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Xi will hold meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Japan's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Friday and both meetings are likely to be difficult, given Takaichi's hardline conservative bent and China's ongoing trade dispute with Canada.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But countries in the region are also wary of China's economic dominance, its own willingness to use trade barriers as a weapon, and its export-led model flooding other countries with cheap goods that creates fears of deindustrialisation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China this month said it would dramatically ratchet up its restrictions on rare earths exports, including outside of China's borders, sending shockwaves through already brittle global supply chains. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"China is very powerful, a big country in terms of economy, and they try to make use of these U.S. tariff issues in order to pretend as if they are the guardian or champion of the free trade system,\" said Japanese foreign ministry spokesperson Toshihiro Kitamura on the sidelines of the ASEAN meeting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"But for Japan, it's not true. As I said, for example, the rare earths issue, they try to utilise their own resources in order to impose their positions on politics to others. So we don't think that they are champions of the free trade system.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Eric Olander of the China Global South Project added that China's strategy was \"through expanded trade, infrastructure development, and supply chain logistics to bind this region to the Chinese economy to the point where it eventually becomes totally unfeasible for countries to extricate themselves from their reliance on Chinese economic engagement.\"</span></p></span></div></div>",
