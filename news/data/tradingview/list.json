According to the Dusk Foundation’s announcement, the release is described as the project’s most significant upgrade so far, focused on strengthening the network and hardening security while laying technical groundwork for future features. For traders, successful execution reduces protocol and security risk, which can support a higher valuation multiple if market confidence increases. However, any implementation issues, node fragmentation, or unforeseen bugs around activation could temporarily disrupt network reliability and weigh on DUSK price.</span></p><div class=\"container-n2KCMK3i\" data-qa-id=\"tweet-widget-container\"><blockquote class=\"blockquote-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"header-n2KCMK3i\"><span class=\"profile-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"avatar-n2KCMK3i\"></div><div class=\"name-n2KCMK3i\">Dusk</div><div class=\"username-n2KCMK3i\">@DuskFoundation</div></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"logo-n2KCMK3i\" role=\"img\"><svg height=\"28\" viewbox=\"0 0 28 28\" width=\"28\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M19.75 5h3.07l-6.7 7.62L24 23h-6.17l-4.84-6.3L7.46 23H4.4l7.17-8.16L4 5h6.33l4.37 5.75L19.75 5Zm-1.24 16h1.7L9.54 7H7.7l10.8 14Z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path></svg></span></div><div class=\"description-n2KCMK3i\"><p class=\"\"><span>Aegis Protocol Upgrade is coming.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our most significant upgrade to date that strengthens our network, hardens security and lays the foundation for what's next.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Activation: 3rd March at 11AM UTC</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is a mandatory upgrade for all node operators. </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://t.co/IBlfaPrVDS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/IBlfaPrVDS</a></p></div><span class=\"date-n2KCMK3i\">Feb 27, 2026</span><span class=\"border-n2KCMK3i\"></span><span class=\"socials-n2KCMK3i\"></span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DuskFoundation/status/2027417964786634814\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"></a></blockquote><div></div></div></span></div></div>",

As outlined in THORWallet’s post, merged unlocks allow holders to consolidate and use unlocked tokens to boost rewards, with top wallets targeting 200,000+ TITN. Mechanically, this creates a short-term incentive to accumulate or retain TITN to maximize airdrop allocation, which can generate buy pressure and higher on-chain activity into the event. After distribution, increased circulating supply and concentrated large rewards may introduce sell pressure, so traders should watch vesting behavior and on-chain flows closely.</span></p><div class=\"container-n2KCMK3i\" data-qa-id=\"tweet-widget-container\"><blockquote class=\"blockquote-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"header-n2KCMK3i\"><span class=\"profile-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"avatar-n2KCMK3i\"></div><div class=\"name-n2KCMK3i\">THORWallet - Onchain Finance</div><div class=\"username-n2KCMK3i\">@Thorwallet</div></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"logo-n2KCMK3i\" role=\"img\"><svg height=\"28\" viewbox=\"0 0 28 28\" width=\"28\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M19.75 5h3.07l-6.7 7.62L24 23h-6.17l-4.84-6.3L7.46 23H4.4l7.17-8.16L4 5h6.33l4.37 5.75L19.75 5Zm-1.24 16h1.7L9.54 7H7.7l10.8 14Z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path></svg></span></div><div class=\"description-n2KCMK3i\"><p class=\"\"><span>TITN Community Unlock</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>March 3rd · 15:00 CET ️</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Merged TITN unlocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You can now use your unlocked TITN to actively increase your share of the 5,000,000 TITN airdrop.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Top wallets estimate 200,000+ TITN rewards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unlock → Participate → Compound</span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://t.co/EsyLhCM8Tx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.co/EsyLhCM8Tx</a></p></div><span class=\"date-n2KCMK3i\">Feb 27, 2026</span><span class=\"border-n2KCMK3i\"></span><span class=\"socials-n2KCMK3i\"></span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Thorwallet/status/2027363016711274540\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"></a></blockquote><div></div></div></span></div></div>",

In the project’s teaser, the team confirms that a fresh “Illuvium Beyond” wave will drop on that date, signaling another cycle of collectible or ecosystem-related releases. For ILV, new content waves can drive user engagement, secondary-market activity, and speculative interest around the broader Illuvium ecosystem, which may translate into higher demand for ILV exposure if participants expect increased platform traction. However, the direct on-chain economic impact depends on how much this wave actually uses ILV or contributes to protocol revenue, so price reaction may be driven more by sentiment than fundamentals.</span></p><div class=\"container-n2KCMK3i\" data-qa-id=\"tweet-widget-container\"><blockquote class=\"blockquote-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"header-n2KCMK3i\"><span class=\"profile-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"avatar-n2KCMK3i\"></div><div class=\"name-n2KCMK3i\">Kieran.eth</div><div class=\"username-n2KCMK3i\">@KieranWarwick</div></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"logo-n2KCMK3i\" role=\"img\"><svg height=\"28\" viewbox=\"0 0 28 28\" width=\"28\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M19.75 5h3.07l-6.7 7.62L24 23h-6.17l-4.84-6.3L7.46 23H4.4l7.17-8.16L4 5h6.33l4.37 5.75L19.75 5Zm-1.24 16h1.7L9.54 7H7.7l10.8 14Z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path></svg></span></div><div class=\"description-n2KCMK3i\"><p class=\"\"><span>Illuvium Beyond. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>New wave dropping March 12. </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://t.co/Kq8RnEXdYv\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/Kq8RnEXdYv</a></p></div><span class=\"date-n2KCMK3i\">Feb 27, 2026</span><span class=\"border-n2KCMK3i\"></span><span class=\"socials-n2KCMK3i\"></span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KieranWarwick/status/2027293622094492107\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"></a></blockquote><div></div></div></span></div></div>",
