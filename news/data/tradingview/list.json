Things appear to be stabilizing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Friday, AGCO reported third-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.35 from sales of $2.5 billion. Wall Street was looking for $1.22 and $2.5 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Full-year earnings guidance was increased to $5 from a prior range of $4.75 to $5. Guidance implies fourth-quarter earnings of about $1.89. Wall Street is projecting $1.81.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The stock was up more than 5% in premarket trading, but slid to $105.34 down 0.7%, after the opening bell. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Barid analyst Mig Dobre noted that margins were a little better than expected, but a portion of the earnings \"beat\" was because of a lower tax rate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A year ago, AGCO reported earnings per share of 68 cents from sales of $2.6 billion. Third-quarter sales fell with farmer incomes squeezed by cost inflation amid lower prices for agricultural commodities. Benchmark corn prices have averaged roughly $4.50 per bushel for the past 12 months, down from closer to $5.50 the prior 12 months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Corn prices hit about $8 per bushel in 2022, when AGCO generated almost $13 billion in sales. Wall Street expects sales of just under $10 billion for 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AGCO stock traded at nearly $150 a share in early 2022. Coming into Friday trading, shares were at $106.12, up 6% over the past 12 months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"AGCO delivered another solid quarter of navigating a complex global landscape shaped by challenging farm economics, high interest rates, and cautious capital investment,\" said CEO Eric Hansotia. \"Our continued investments in precision agriculture, autonomous solutions, and sustainable technologies helped maintain demand for our premium brands.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sales are expected to grow in 2026 for the first time since 2023. Growth would be a good sign that the farm business is getting better.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The economy contracted in August after growth was revised up a touch in July, and September looks to be on track for slight growth. Holt says that what comes out in the wash is that 3Q GDP is tracking at about 0.4% growth annualized, in touch with the Bank of Canada's just released forecast for a 0.5% expansion. And Holt notes the central bank forecast and the tracking estimate are rooted in different concepts, so you can't definitively that the Bank of Canada's estimate is off.

Revenue totaled $85.3 billion, falling short of Wall Street's call for $86.5 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But profit declined to $7.55 billion from $8.61 billion as the price of crude weakened and costs rose. Oil futures have declined 16% this year, and falling prices have weighed on Exxon's results.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, daily production rose to 4.77 million barrels from 4.58 million barrels a year ago. Analysts had expected 4.7 million barrels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We delivered the highest earnings per share we've had compared to other quarters in a similar oil-price environment,\" said CEO Darren Woods, referring to periods in the last decade when prices ranged from $65 to $75 a barrel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The stock was off 2.1% in premarket trading. It has risen 6.6% this year as of Thursday's close.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Peer Chevron traded slightly higher. The energy giant posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue in its third quarter, even as profit took a from lower oil prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is breaking news. Read a preview of Exxon's earnings below and check back for more analysis soon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Exxon Mobil is growing its oil production at a time of falling oil prices — a decision that has historically led to problems for energy companies. The wisdom of that strategy could be tested when the company reports third quarter earnings on Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So far, Exxon's moves have paid off. The oil giant has invested to expand production during good times and bad over the past few years, and investors have mostly rewarded the decision. Its oil-equivalent production — a metric that includes products like natural gas — is on track to grow to 5.4 million barrels a day by 2030, from 4.3 million in 2024. Shares are up 6.6% this year even though oil prices are down.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company is expected to report $1.82 of earnings per share, down from $1.92 in the same quarter last year. Results should be hurt by low oil prices, but helped by strong refining margins.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Exxon may need to make some tough decisions if international oil prices fall into the $50 range, however. They have dropped about 14% this year to a recent $64 per barrel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
