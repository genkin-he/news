Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies and persons involved in the Acquisition disclaim any responsibility or liability for the violation of such restrictions by any person. This announcement has been prepared in accordance with and for the purpose of complying with English law, the Takeover Code, the Market Abuse Regulation, the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the UK Listing Rules and information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside of the UK.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The availability of the Acquisition to Walker Crips Shareholders who are not resident in and citizens of the UK may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located or of which they are citizens. Persons who are not resident in the UK should inform themselves of, and observe, any applicable legal or regulatory requirements of their jurisdictions. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the UK to vote their Voting Scheme Shares with respect to the Scheme at the Court Meeting, or to execute and deliver Forms of Proxy appointing another person to vote at the Court Meeting on their behalf, may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located.

Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any formal documentation relating to the Scheme and the Acquisition are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents (including, without limitation, custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute or send them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction. Doing so may render invalid any related purported vote in respect of the Acquisition. If the Acquisition is implemented by way of an Offer (unless otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), the Offer may not be made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of mails or any means or instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile, e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction and the Offer may not be capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom should inform themselves of, and observe, any applicable legal or regulatory requirements.

An acquisition effected by means of a scheme of arrangement is not subject to the tender offer rules or the proxy solicitation rules under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"U.S. Exchange Act\"). Accordingly, the Acquisition is subject to the disclosure requirements and practices applicable in the UK to schemes of arrangement which differ from the disclosure requirements of the U.S. tender offer and proxy solicitation rules. Neither the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, nor any securities commission of any state of the United States, has approved or disapproved any offer, or passed comment upon the adequacy or completeness of any of the information included in this announcement. The financial information included in this announcement and the Scheme Document (or, if the Acquisition is implemented by way of an Offer, the Offer Document) has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United Kingdom and thus may not be comparable to financial information of U.S. companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If, in the future, PhillipCapital exercises its right, with the consent of the Panel (where necessary) and subject to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, to implement the Acquisition by way of an Offer, which is to be made into the United States, such Offer will be made in compliance with the applicable U.S. laws and regulations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It may be difficult for U.S. holders of Walker Crips Shares to enforce their rights and any claim arising out of the U.S. federal laws in connection with the Acquisition, since PhillipCapital and Walker Crips are located in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, and some or all of their officers and directors may be residents of a non-U.S. jurisdiction. U.S. holders of Walker Crips Shares may not be able to sue a non-U.S. company or its officers or directors in a non-U.S. court for violations of the U.S. securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel a non-U.S. company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a U.S. court's jurisdiction or judgement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In accordance with normal UK practice and pursuant to Rule 14e-5(b) of the U.S. Exchange Act, PhillipCapital, its nominees, or their brokers (acting as agents), may from time to time make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, Walker Crips Shares outside of the U.S., other than pursuant to the Acquisition, until the date on which the Acquisition becomes Effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private Acquisitions at negotiated prices and comply with applicable law, including the U.S. Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK, will be reported to the Regulatory News Service of the London Stock Exchange and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. Walker Crips Shareholders should be aware that the Acquisition contemplated herein may have tax consequences in the U.S. and, that such consequences, if any, are not described herein. U.S. Walker Crips Shareholders are urged to consult with legal, tax and financial advisers in connection with making a decision regarding this Acquisition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Forward-Looking Statements</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This announcement (including information incorporated by reference in this announcement), oral statements made regarding the Acquisition, and other information published by PhillipCapital and Walker Crips, contains statements which are, or may be deemed to be, \"forward-looking statements\". Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and projections of the management of PhillipCapital and Walker Crips (as applicable) about future events, and are therefore subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The forward-looking statements contained in this announcement include statements relating to the expected effects of the Acquisition on PhillipCapital and Walker Crips (including their future prospects, developments and strategies), the expected timing and scope of the Acquisition and other statements other than historical facts. Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as \"prepares\", \"plans\", \"expects\" or \"does not expect\", \"is expected\", \"is subject to\", \"budget\", \"projects\", \"synergy\", \"strategy\", \"scheduled\", \"goal\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"cost-saving\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\" or \"does not anticipate\", or \"believes\", or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"should\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements may include statements relating to the following: (i) future capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, dividend policy, losses and future prospects; (ii) business and management strategies and the expansion and growth of PhillipCapital, Walker Crips, any member of the PhillipCapital Group's or any member of the Walker Crips Group's operations and potential synergies resulting from the Acquisition; (iii) the effects of global economic conditions and governmental regulation on the business of any member of the PhillipCapital Group or any member of the Walker Crips Group; and (iv) the expected timing and scope of the Acquisition. Such forward-looking statements should therefore be construed in the light of such factors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Although PhillipCapital and Walker Crips believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, PhillipCapital and Walker Crips can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Neither PhillipCapital nor Walker Crips assumes any obligation to update or correct the information contained in this announcement (whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise) except as required by applicable law.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the ability to complete the Acquisition; the ability to obtain requisite regulatory and shareholder approvals and the satisfaction of other Conditions on the proposed terms; changes in the global political, economic, business and competitive environments and in market and regulatory forces; changes in future exchange and interest rates; changes in tax rates; future business combinations or disposals; changes in general economic and business conditions; changes in the behaviour of other market participants; and changes in the anticipated benefits from the proposed Acquisition not being realised as a result of: changes in general economic and market conditions in the countries in which PhillipCapital and Walker Crips operate, weak, volatile or illiquid capital and/or credit markets, changes in tax rates, interest rate and currency value fluctuations, the degree of competition in the geographic and business areas in which PhillipCapital and Walker Crips operate and changes in laws or in supervisory expectations or requirements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected, estimated or projected in the forward-looking statements. If any one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialises or if any one or more of the assumptions proves incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those expected, estimated or projected. Such forward-looking statements should therefore be construed in the light of such factors. Neither PhillipCapital nor Walker Crips, nor any of their respective associates or directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements in this announcement will actually occur. You are cautioned not to place any reliance on these forward-looking statements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Specifically, statements of estimated cost savings and synergies related to future actions and circumstances, by their nature, involve risks, uncertainties and contingencies. As a result, the cost savings and synergies referred to may not be achieved, may be achieved later or sooner than estimated, or those achieved could be materially different from those estimated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other than in accordance with their legal or regulatory obligations, neither PhillipCapital nor Walker Crips is under any obligation, and PhillipCapital and Walker Crips expressly disclaim any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dealing and Opening Position Disclosure requirements</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under Rule 8.3(a) of the Takeover Code, any person who is interested in one (1) per cent. or more of any class of relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of the Offer Period and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s).

Today, several types of dentures are available, each designed to fit different needs and offered at varying costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Understanding denture costs can give you insight into the available options, helping you feel informed before speaking with a Miami dentist about the right fit for your situation. In this guide, we'll explain the various types of dentures and explore payment options and the associated expenses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Types of dentures available</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dentures come in different forms depending on the number of missing teeth that need to be replaced.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Full dentures are used when all the teeth in the upper and lower arches of the mouth are missing. They are custom-made to fit the shape of your mouth and rest directly on your gums. They restore the normal eating and speaking function of the mouth.1</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Partial dentures are used to replace a certain number of missing teeth while preserving the remaining natural teeth. They help fill the gaps by attaching to the remaining ones using small clasps while maintaining teeth alignment.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Implant-supported dentures are installed on dental implants screwed into the jawbone. They don't shift during eating or speaking, hence providing better stability than traditional dentures.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Immediate dentures are easily removable and placed on the gumline on the day of tooth removal. They are a temporary solution during healing and require adjustments as the gum changes shape.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Each denture type serves not just a different purpose but also differs in fit and stability, so ensure you make the right choice to fit your lifestyle needs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>What affects denture costs</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The national average cost for dentures in the United States can range anywhere from $452 to $6,514, depending on factors like the following:2</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The type of denture you choose:</span></strong><span> Complete dentures tend to be more expensive than partial dentures because they require more materials and labor to produce. Implant-supported dentures also cost more than traditional dentures, as they require dental implant treatment.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Materials used:</span></strong><span> Basic dentures made with acrylic are less expensive than those made with porcelain. Dentures made with metal frameworks like titanium are very durable, so the cost can be higher. Naturally, better materials usually mean better durability and appearance.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The level of customization:</span></strong><span> Choosing a premium option that is more detailed and custom fit to match your smile costs more than the standard fitting process due to the extra adjustments and precision work needed.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Preparatory work:</span></strong><span> Oral exams, tooth extractions if needed, pain management options, impressions, multiple fittings, and follow-up adjustments are all factors that affect denture costs.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Each individual has a different denture journey. Dentists in Miami should inform you of all viable options and provide a detailed cost breakdown during your consultation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Insurance and payment options</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Depending on the insurance coverage you have, a portion of denture costs is covered by your insurance plan. Coverage for complete and partial dentures differs, so it is important you understand your specific benefits and plan accordingly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a situation where your insurance doesn't cover all your costs, having a payment plan is necessary. In Miami, most dental offices offer financing options with flexible monthly payment arrangements that are not too demanding, and some even offer interest-free periods. Another way to finance your dentures is by using flexible spending accounts or health savings accounts funds to pay for dentures with pre-tax dollars. This reduces the expenses that come out of your pocket directly, especially if you plan your treatment around contribution periods.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most importantly, discuss options with a dentist, as this allows the financial coordinators to give you a detailed breakdown of costs, keeping you informed on all your options while finding an arrangement that best fits your budget.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The bottom line</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before getting dentures, you must understand the various types and what they cost, so you can plan properly. It is also important to ask the right questions of your Miami dentist, as their guidance can help you make the right choice.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>MIDLAND, TX / ACCESS Newswire / February 26, 2026 / Waste Energy Corp (OTCQB:WAST) (\"WEC\" or the \"Company\"), a clean-energy company converting non-recyclable waste into usable fuel and renewable energy products, today announced that is will present at the Clean Energy &amp; Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5, 2026, hosted by OTC Markets Group. Management will walk through the Company's waste conversion model, its first facility in Midland, Texas, and the operational milestones it expects to hit as commissioning draws near.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Permian Basin: A Deliberate Starting Point</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Midland facility wasn't placed in the Permian Basin by accident. The region offers something most early-stage energy infrastructure companies spend years chasing established distribution networks, industrial-scale fuel demand, and a deep base of energy capital that understands long-cycle infrastructure investment. Waste tire feedstock is also concentrated in the area, reducing inbound logistics costs and simplifying supply chain management.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Management sees the Permian not just as a first market, but as a template. If the model works here, it travels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>What the Facility Actually Does</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Running Phase 1 at full capacity 30 tons per day, 330 days a year, the Midland plant is designed to process around 10,000 tons of waste tires annually. That's north of 300,000 passenger tires, or roughly 140,000 heavy truck tires, every year. Beyond the headline fuel output, the process recovers carbon black, syngas to run the system and high grade steel, all of which have established regional buyers. Steel alone could represent 990 to 1,485 tons of recoverable material annually, based on typical tire composition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company is also working with local partners on landfill diversion and tire stockpile remediation in the Permian Basin, a community angle that has drawn interest from regional stakeholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Rethinking How Carbon Credits Get Made</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The voluntary carbon market has a credibility problem. Credits get challenged, methodologies get disputed, and human reporting introduces errors that undermine confidence in the underlying asset. Waste Energy Corp has filed a patent for a system designed to fix that at the source.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company's patent-pending carbon credit automation system uses on-site video monitoring and sensor data to capture the conversion process in real time. That data is then run through a carbon credit algorithm when a match is confirmed, a credit is created automatically, minted as an NFT, and deposited directly into a digital wallet. The credits will be tradeable on the Company's own blockchain-based platform.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The logic is straightforward: remove the human from the reporting chain, and you remove the most common source of error and dispute. The result is a carbon credit with a verifiable, immutable record of exactly how and when it was generated, something the market has struggled to produce consistently.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For investors, this matters beyond the environmental angle. A carbon credit with a clean chain of custody and blockchain-based provenance is a more defensible asset. It's also a potential competitive advantage as regulators and institutional buyers apply increasing scrutiny to voluntary market integrity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Carbon Credit Opportunity</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Based on combustion-equivalent emission factors, full-capacity throughput at the Midland facility could translate to roughly 12,800 metric tons of CO₂e annually. Whether that supports a meaningful credit position still depends on third-party validation and registry methodology, a process that hasn't concluded. Conservative estimates put potential annual credits in the 7,000 to 17,000 range, with a theoretical ceiling around 22,000 to 28,000. Management isn't booking that revenue yet, but the automated issuance system is designed to make the validation process faster, cleaner, and more defensible when it does get there.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Midland Facility Commissioning &amp; Timelines</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Midland facility is approaching commissioning. Management has committed to regular updates tied to actual milestones production ramp, first revenue, and expansion decisions rather than forward-looking timelines that tend to slip.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We are building Waste Energy Corp around disciplined execution and measurable results,\" said Scott Gallagher, Chairman &amp; CEO. \"Our first priority is to demonstrate a model that works operationally and economically. The Permian Basin deployment is not simply a site launch, it is the foundation for a scalable environmental infrastructure platform designed to generate diversified revenue streams, including fuel, recovered materials, and carbon-linked assets.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gallagher continued, \"As we move toward commissioning, transparency becomes increasingly important. During the March 5th presentation, I will provide a clear framework outlining our expected path to revenue for the Midland facility. Shareholder value is created through execution, consistency, and scale and our focus in 2026 is to deliver on each of those.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The broader context isn't lost on the Company either. U.S. electricity demand hit record highs in 2025 and is projected to keep climbing, driven largely by the data center and AI infrastructure buildout that shows no sign of slowing. Data center electricity demand has grown more than 400% over the past decade. Carbon credits, and U.S. data center power demand is forecast to reach 134 gigawatts by 2030, nearly triple current levels. That kind of structural demand creates a sustained need for new domestic energy sources, particularly ones that don't require greenfield grid infrastructure. Waste Energy Corp's model, modular, deployable near existing waste streams, and producing fuel that can flow through established regional distribution networks is designed for exactly that environment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, institutional capital continues its rotation toward ESG-aligned infrastructure. Corporate power purchase agreements for zero-carbon electricity reached 29.5 gigawatts in 2025, the highest annual total on record, a signal that large buyers are actively seeking credible, verifiable clean energy and carbon assets. The Company believes its combination of waste diversion, domestic fuel production, and blockchain-verified carbon credits positions it squarely in that flow of capital. The Midland facility will ultimately have to prove the model but the market conditions for doing so have rarely been better aligned.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Conference Details</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Waste Energy Corp will present at the Clean Energy &amp; Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5, 2026.

Previous initiatives have not been fully adopted, which has led to criticism of the mechanism's effectiveness.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    When an initiative gathers a million signatures of support, the Commission must issue a formal written response.   </span></p></span></div></div>",
