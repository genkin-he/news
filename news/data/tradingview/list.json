            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Connor Hart</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Krispy Kreme said margins improved during the fourth quarter as the chain's turnaround gained momentum, though revenue fell after it exited underperforming locations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The margin gains stemmed from operational improvements such as optimized production, increased productivity and an outsourcing program for logistics that reduced costs, Chief Executive Josh Charlesworth said in an interview.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, revenue fell 2.9% to $392.4 million. The decline reflected Krispy Kreme's decision last year to pull out of lower-trafficked, less-profitable distribution points and prioritize sales in locations with retail partners such as Walmart, Target and Costco.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On an organic basis, revenue fell 3.9%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We saw really meaningful progress in the fourth quarter on that turnaround, which shows the plan is working,\" Charlesworth said. The company added roughly 1,100 high-traffic locations last year while completing its exit from underperforming stores, positioning itself to return to growth in 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shares jumped 23%, to $3.67, in premarket trading Thursday. Through Wednesday's close, the stock had lost roughly half of its value over the past year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Krispy Kreme ended 2025 with about 7,160 fresh-delivery locations, nearly 200 more than at the end of the third quarter. The company guided for systemwide sales to grow 2% to 4% in constant currency this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The outlook came as the company widened its fourth-quarter loss to $29.1 million, or 17 cents a share, from a loss of $22.2 million, or 13 cents a share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings of 9 cents a share topped analyst expectations of 3 cents a share, according to FactSet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Technology, including artificial intelligence, is also supporting Krispy Kreme's turnaround operations. While AI isn't a major factor in day-to-day production currently, it is being used in back-office functions such as demand planning and route management.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"AI isn't a big part of the productivity journey so far,\" Charlesworth said. \"It's more down to optimizing production, looking at yields and making sure our shops have the right people at the right time.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To meet changing consumer preferences, Krispy Kreme has introduced smaller portion options, including bite-sized and mini doughnuts, and the company plans to launch a line of mini cake donuts later this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company also positions its brand as a treat for special occasions. The majority of the company's doughnuts are purchased for sharing, typically two to three times per year, often around holidays or events such as Valentine's Day and Halloween. Younger consumers drive much of the company's traffic, with shoppers under 35 representing more than half of the business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"They really enjoy those special occasions,\" Charlesworth said, adding the company leverages social media and its loyalty program to keep younger consumers engaged with the brand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking ahead, Krispy Kreme is shifting toward a franchise-led growth model, particularly in international markets, Charlesworth said. The company recently announced the refranchising of its Japan operations and it expects to complete additional refranchising deals this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Currently, company-owned operations account for roughly 75% of systemwide sales, but the company aims to reduce that to about 50% by the end of the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is part of an overall strategy to grow with a more capital-efficient, right-size approach while developing new distribution and expansion opportunities,\" Charlesworth said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Connor Hart at connor.hart@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
