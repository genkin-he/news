(“Sixty Six”), a Canada-based Bitcoin treasury company listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the ticker SIX, for a purchase price of approximately CAD 4.7 million, corresponding to 95 percent of the net asset value (“NAV”) attributable to the shares acquired. K33 has today entered into an addendum to the Agreement (the “Addendum”). The Addendum adjusts the purchase price to reflect a correction to the NAV calculation and amends the settlement mechanics of the cash consideration. For more information about Sixty Six and the strategic rationale, please refer to the press release published by the Company on 15 February 2026.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Terms of the Addendum</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The adjusted purchase price amounts to CAD 4,678,961, compared to the originally stated purchase price of CAD 4,738,296.

Accordingly, the adjusted purchase price will result in a reduced number of newly issued shares in K33. The share component of the purchase price will now represent a dilution of approximately 2.53 percent of the total number of shares in K33, compared to the originally stated dilution of approximately 2.56 percent.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Further, the Addendum sets forth that the cash consideration shall be settled in USD Coin issued as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, rather than by wire transfer in CAD to the sellers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In all essential respects, the other terms of the Agreement are unaltered, including the provisions of the Agreement relating to a potential earn-out payment, which remains payable in cash.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Adam J. White</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Making a government — a good, republican government, at least — requires nothing short of a miracle. Americans know this firsthand, from the creation of our own Constitution. Near the end of his life, James Madison observed that \"there never was an assembly of men, charged with a great and arduous trust, who were more pure in their motives, or more exclusively or anxiously devoted to the object committed to them, than were the members of the Federal Convention of 1787.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And that was only the first step. Nearly a year after Madison and his compatriots sent their proposed constitution out to the people for ratification, Alexander Hamilton observed that \"the establishment of a Constitution, in time of profound peace, by the voluntary consent of a whole people, is a prodigy.\" A miracle indeed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But unmaking a government requires something different. The Declaration of Independence was preceded by a decadeslong swell of resentment, incitement and violence. In 1768 King George III filled Boston with armed troops, creating a powder keg; in two years the spark of a single rifle shot would explode the Boston Massacre. It took violence, punitive taxes, the Intolerable Acts and more to spur Americans to take the extraordinary step of breaking with Britain. Making the constitution took \"reflection and choice,\" as Hamilton put it; breaking the old order took not only reflection but rage.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Those dueling impulses, rage and reason, are the focus of \"Rage and the Republic: The Unfinished Story of the American Revolution\" by Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. The question of democratic rage is timeless, and Mr. Turley's historical narrative is sweeping — from the trial of Socrates to the rhetoric of Huey Long. But, as a study of American history at the Declaration's 250th anniversary, he focuses mainly on three things: the American Revolution; the French Revolution that soon followed; and today. Mr. Turley emphasizes the revolutions' ominous echoes, especially with an eye to recent social, economic and political trends.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For Americans, King George's abuses of power in the 1760s and '70s stirred discontent and outrage, but even then, the choice to break with Britain was not self-evident. It took the speeches and writings of prominent Americans, especially Thomas Paine, to convince Americans to revolt.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paine's rhetoric involved more than mere ideas. \"While intellectuals like James Iredell had written on the right of the colonies to maintain their own laws and government,\" Mr. Turley writes, \"it was Paine who seemed to speak for the nation in expressing a growing detachment and anger toward England.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When this anger boiled over, it threatened to scald more than the British. Mr. Turley describes the Philadelphia mob's 1779 assault on the home of James Wilson — what would come to be known as the Fort Wilson riot. Wilson survived the attack and went on to be a major part of the Constitutional Convention and one of America's first great constitutional jurists. Astonishingly, his firsthand experience with mob violence did not prevent him from being one of the convention's most significant populists.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, Mr. Turley observes, the newly independent Americans' rage \"would prove transformative for many framers in appraising the promise and the perils of democratic systems.\" By 1787 Madison and the other Founders knew that the great challenge for a new constitution was to channel democratic energy into republican institutions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Their wisdom was confirmed by what followed soon after in France, where calls for democracy, seemingly similar to America's own rhetoric, quickly descended into something profoundly different. Here, too, Mr. Turley emphasizes Paine, who arrived in France enthusiastic for revolution and \"saw the fall of the Bastille as the rise of a new humanity in the Age of Enlightenment.\" By the end Paine would be lucky to escape France alive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Coming so soon after 1776, France's revolution has always served as the brutal counterpoint to America's. To highlight the contrast, Mr. Turley recounts France's descent into madness, from Jean-Jacques Rousseau's theory of democratic government carrying out the people's \"general will, \" to the Terror of Robespierre and Saint-Just, until the revolution eventually devoured its own children.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fifty years ago, at America's bicentennial, Martin Diamond, a political scientist, celebrated our founding as \"the revolution of sober expectations.\" Mr. Turley's account of the American and French revolutions reminds us that ours was also a revolution of sober institutions. Even in declaring independence, the American Revolution channeled revolutionary energy through state governments, the Continental Congress and Washington's army. The French Revolution, by contrast, concentrated its energy into the Committee of Public Safety and cults of personality.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Such institutional questions are the center of Mr. Turley's closing section. Calls for anti-institutional revolt \"are again being heard in the United States, 250 years later,\" from an increasingly \"disassociated elite of politicians, professors, and pundits,\" he writes. \"Once again, the public is being told that the problem lies in a constitutional system that is too limiting on democratic change.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is, indeed, a disconcerting trend of anticonstitutional rhetoric in America, from partisans impatient with the slow pace of our institutions. Mr. Turley spotlights many of them, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who recently played down the murder of a health-insurance executive. \"Violence is never the answer,\" she said, \"but you can only push people so far, and then they start to take matters into their own hands.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mr. Turley focuses on anticonstitutional rhetoric on the political left, but political rage is a bipartisan sport. Ascribing it mainly to one faction risks exacerbating the problem.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Moreover, Mr. Turley's criticism sometimes misfires. He castigates Mary Ann Glendon, a professor of law at Harvard, for favoring \"collective interests and responsibilities\" over individual rights. But Ms. Glendon does not denigrate rights; far from it. In \"Rights Talk\" (1991), she emphasizes her \"patriotic conviction that, where freedom is concerned, the United States was there first with the best and the most.\" She believes in constitutional rights but warns that framing political issues mainly in terms of competing claims of absolute rights makes our political debates more pointed and less productive. Such arguments echo Edmund Burke, one of the heroes of Mr. Turley's book.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mr. Turley is right to warn against modern anticonstitutional sentiments. He also observes keenly that the problem is exacerbated by concentrating power in the hands of the executive. Americans have now seen this across multiple presidential administrations, where political debates have become mostly debates about presidents.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking back to the French Revolution, when, in 1791, Louis XVI was struggling to keep his throne, Mr. Turley quotes Paine: \"You see the absurdity of monarchical governments . . . a whole nation disturbed by the folly of one man.\" Plus ça change.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Mr. White is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise and directs the Antonin Scalia Law School's Gray Center for the Study of the Administrative State.</span></li></ul></span></div></div>",

Profit has dropped 14% over the last five years. Its shift away from diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the wake of Donald Trump's return to the White House angered part of its consumer base and many long-time merchants.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The DEI rollback prompted a boycott that hurt sales, then CEO Brian Cornell admitted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company's market value is now $52 billion, about half of what it was in 2021, while Costco's value has risen to more than $430 billion, and Walmart's market cap has surpassed $1 trillion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Against that backdrop, several groups of Target investors are agitating for change. Major New York and California pension funds are supporting a proposal that would ensure independent board chairs after Cornell was elevated to board chair. Another investor group is pushing for answers to what it sees as missteps that have harmed its reputation with customers and cut into sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We are concerned that a series of recent public-facing decisions and communications by the company may have introduced reputational, operational, and financial risks at a moment when Target is already navigating a challenging competitive and macroeconomic environment,\" a group of 27 investors wrote in a Friday letter to the company's board and executive leadership, seen exclusively by Reuters. The investors did not propose specific fixes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It adds up to a challenging road for CEO Michael Fiddelke, who officially took the helm on February 1. He is expected to discuss his priorities for the year when the company reports results on March 3, which he has stated include the need to improve merchandise quality, value and style; ensure a consistent shopper experience; and expand technology use across operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Target did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company is expected to report a 2.65% decline in same-store sales for 2025, according to LSEG data. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since Fiddelke was named the next CEO in August 2025, he has cut 1,800 corporate roles and announced $1 billion in store investments. He later elevated two veteran merchandising executives to chief operating officer and chief merchandising officer and named two new board directors.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We believe the refresh of C‑suite roles meaningfully improves execution potential and injects renewed strategic momentum into the organization,\" said Corey Tarlowe, Jefferies analyst, saying it \"reinforces our view that TGT is taking deliberate steps to position the company for its next chapter of growth.\"  </span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1025.540275049116px;aspect-ratio:1.7092337917485265\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2026:newsml_L6N3YH110-2393d12f445ddf77606dadd992f6ad6d-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"Line chart showing the stock performance of Target vs Amazon, Walmart and Costco\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2026:newsml_L6N3YH110-2393d12f445ddf77606dadd992f6ad6d-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#f7f4f4\"/></picture></div></button><figcaption class=\"caption-CvWHk7Ya\"><span class=\"copyright-CvWHk7Ya\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-CvWHk7Ya\">Target's stock has sharply underperformed peers over the past decade</span></figcaption></figure><p class=\"\"><span>           HEIGHTENED COMPETITION</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Target’s merchandise was once a competitive advantage, earning it the playful name \"Tar-zhay\" for its cheap-chic apparel, but it has lost ground as competition from Walmart, Amazon </span><span> and Costco intensifies. Shoppers have complained about out‑of‑stock issues and long checkout lines.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The strategy needs correction and execution needs improvement,\" Gerald Storch, Target's vice chairman between 1993 and 2005, told Reuters. \"You see long lines, hyper‑promotional deals, and a loss of focus on value,\" Storch said, pointing to the mix of buy‑one‑get‑one offers and perks that contrast with everyday low prices at Walmart and Costco.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The 27 investors asked how the retailer is evaluating reputational risks, including customer boycotts, and its plan to avoid letting external pressures undermine efforts to rebuild trust, increase traffic and stabilize earnings. Those investors collectively manage $150.5 billion in assets, and are led by Trillium Asset Management and Mercy Investment Services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Their letter added that \"backlash from recent strategic adjustments\" had affected \"customer loyalty and foot traffic.\" According to a source familiar with the letter, this was a reference to Target's decision to back away from DEI, and its silence before speaking out about raids conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers at stores in the Minneapolis area, where the company is based. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>QUESTIONS ABOUT STRUCTURE</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other shareholders are upset with Target's decision to elevate longtime CEO Cornell to executive chairman, a position that continues to have operational oversight over Fiddelke. At least six investors that collectively own $500 million in Target shares, including the New York State Comptroller’s Office, the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), are in support of a push from shareholder advocacy group The Accountability Board that would make future board chairs independent.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The proposal will be put to a non-binding vote at Target's annual meeting in June.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Target's independent board members did not respond to multiple calls and emails seeking comment on the investors' corporate governance concerns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Officials at the New York State Comptroller's Office, which holds roughly $50 million in shares, told Reuters that they want Cornell to relinquish his board seat, citing disappointment with Target's retreat from diversity initiatives and the level of oversight surrounding these changes. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Six similar proposals since 2014 at Target have failed, with support peaking in 2014 at 45.8%. Matt Prescott, president of The Accountability Board, believes the campaign has more momentum this year with the arrival of an activist investor.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Activist investor Toms Capital Investment Management took a 0.6% stake as of December 31, seeking to turn around Target's grocery business among other priorities, according to a source familiar with its thinking.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>TCIM declined comment; co‑founder Ben Pass did not respond to multiple requests for comment. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After Reuters asked Target about investor concerns related to its governance structure, the company added a statement to its website emphasizing that all board members except Cornell and Fiddelke are independent under New York Stock Exchange standards, and that no other directors are current or former employees. The website now includes a table listing directors’ affiliations with other corporate boards. </span></p></span></div></div>",

Amazon will make an initial $15 billion investment, with the remaining $35 billion coming after certain conditions are met.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The partners pledged to create a computing environment powered by OpenAI models that will be available for AWS customers \"to build generative AI applications and agents at production scale.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OpenAI and Amazon also plan to develop customized models that can power Amazon's customer-facing applications. The agreement comes with a pledge from OpenAI to use 2 gigawatts of capacity from Amazon's Trainium chips.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon shares ticked down 0.8% in premarket trading. Futures tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 1.1%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OpenAI said separately Friday that it had closed a $110 billion funding round, more than double its $40 billion raise last year. The figure includes $50 billion from Amazon, $30 billion from SoftBank, and $30 billion from Nvidia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The investment brings OpenAI to a $730 billion pre-money valuation, up from $500 billion in October.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The partnerships with Amazon, Nvidia, and the like \"expand our global reach, deepen our infrastructure, and strengthen our balance sheet so we can bring frontier AI to more people, more businesses, and more communities worldwide,\" OpenAI said in a blog post.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>More importantly for investors, the latest funding arrives before a possible OpenAI initial public offering. The company has been eyed as a candidate to go public, with multiple reports suggesting it could make its trading debut as soon as the second half of the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The developments come at a time when concerns over artificial-intelligence disruption have reached a fever pitch. Software stocks have been hammered in a broad-based selloff that reflects a deflationary spiral in tech valuations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Although Nvidia reported blowout earnings on Wednesday, the results failed to assuage investor concerns over the longevity of the AI boom. Shares of the chip maker suffered their worst single-day drop in nearly a year on Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
