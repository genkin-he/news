The accounts suggest the prime minister is a reckless \"cult-backed\" leader driving Japan toward war, said Maria Riofrio, a researcher with the Foundation for Defense of Democracy's Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The accounts, part of a network of at least 327 X and other social media accounts, have since December or earlier attacked adversaries of Beijing or pushed pro-China policy positions, and targeted human rights organizations and sought to influence domestic politics in Japan, the United States, the Philippines and Latin America, according to a new analysis by Riofrio.    </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A spokesperson for Takaichi said her office is aware of suspicious foreign social media accounts that have posted content related to Japan's elections. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We consider this to be a national security threat that undermines the very foundations of democracy, including the fairness of elections and freedom of the press. We believe that countermeasures must be urgently prioritized.\" </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Spokesperson Liu Pengyu for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said the \"analysis\" by the FDD was \"groundless.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The Chinese government consistently opposes and combats the use of fake accounts and other tactics to manipulate public opinion or spread disinformation,\" Liu said in a statement to Reuters. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We urge the relevant parties to stop making unfounded accusations and smearing others based on speculation.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Riofrio identified the most recent campaign as a distinct cluster based on its pro-China narratives that has coordinated on messaging content containing overlapping hashtags and other similarities. The cluster is likely part of long-running Chinese information operations that internet security analysts have dubbed Spamouflage or Dragonbridge, she said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Although engagement with the material is low, users do see the content in social media feeds and the operators work algorithms to boost the content. One tweet that accused Takaichi of being in a cult, for example, received only two likes but was viewed more than 1,000 times. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The activity demonstrates \"China has the political will to interfere in Japanese elections and internal affairs,\" Riofrio said, noting that the overall cluster has similar operations targeting other countries, including the United States. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The FDD is a Washington-based nonprofit focused on \"strengthening U.S. national security and reducing or eliminating threats posed by adversaries and enemies of the United States and other free nations,\" according to its website. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ATTACKS ON TRUMP, ASIA-PACIFIC NATIONS</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Nikkei newspaper reported earlier this week on another set of suspected foreign-backed online operations attacking the Japanese elections. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Riofrio said nearly half of the 327 accounts attacked U.S. President </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Trump</a><span>, pushing the narrative that his drug and border policies have worsened America's fentanyl crisis, reversing gains made during the Biden era, while also deflecting blame from China, according to the FDD analysis. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a coordinated sequence of messaging in early February on Trump and fentanyl, six accounts, despite having fewer than 10 followers each, attracted hundreds of likes, retweets and replies and nearly 18,000 views as of February 12, Riofrio said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One account in the network, FentanylFreeA, created in December 2025, Riofrio said, seemingly seeks to emulate the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency’s Fentanyl Free America campaign, using a similar name and identical imagery. The account attacks both the U.S. and India, which it blames as the source of fentanyl precursor drugs. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Neither the White House or the DEA responded to a request for comment. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The operations known as Spamouflage or Dragonbridge have been active since at least 2017 and have repeatedly targeted audiences around the world over the years, according to experts. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A spokesperson for Google’s Threat Intelligence Group said Dragonbridge is the most prolific pro-PRC information operations operator that it tracks as of early 2026 based on “its massive scale and assertive narrative agenda.” </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dragonbridge, while maintaining a foundational focus on targeting the U.S., overseas dissidents, government critics and international NGOs, has become notably more assertive in the Asia-Pacific, the Google spokesperson said, including by targeting the political leadership of Japan, Japan-Taiwan relations, Vietnam over its South China Sea activities, India and the Philippine administration. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OpenAI on Wednesday reported that it had disrupted attempts in mid-October by a Chinese law enforcement official to help plan a multi-stage information attack on Takaichi. </span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Kate Abnett and Dmitry Zhdannikov</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    The stoppage of the last Russian oil flows to Europe, via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline, has triggered a geopolitical clash that has blocked new EU sanctions on Russia and vital funding for Ukraine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here's what you need to know.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WHAT IS DRUZHBA?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Druzhba, which translates as \"friendship\" in English, is a pipeline that carries crude oil from Russia to Eastern Europe, via Ukraine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Soviet-era link was one of the most important Russian oil arteries, delivering crude from West Siberia to the industrial heartland in Europe including Belarus, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Ukraine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At its peak, Druzhba pumped over 1 million barrels per day, over 1% of global oil supply, according to Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most EU countries halted their Russian oil imports following Moscow's full-scale invasion of </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ukraine in 2022</a><span>, and by the start of this year Druzhba was carrying around 200,000 bpd to Hungary and Slovakia, according to Reuters calculations based on official data from the two countries. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The leaders of Hungary and Slovakia are outliers in the EU for maintaining close ties with Russia. They say buying oil elsewhere is more expensive and would endanger their energy security.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On February 12, the government of Ukraine said flows have been suspended for over two weeks, since January 27. Oil flows via Druzhba have been disrupted in the past and were usually reported by the countries involved within hours.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ukraine has accused Russia of damaging the pipeline with drones. Russia, as well as Hungary and Slovakia, have accused Kyiv of stalling the repairs for political reasons.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>HOW BAD IS THE DAMAGE?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ukraine has not publicly disclosed details of the damage, nor a date for when it expects to resume deliveries via Druzhba. Kyiv says repairs are ongoing, but shelling by Russia poses security risks to these efforts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A note submitted by Ukraine to a technical meeting of EU governments on oil supplies on February 25, seen by Reuters, said Russian attacks on January 27 had damaged an oil pumping station near the city of Brody and \"technological and auxiliary equipment\" of the Druzhba pipeline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reuters could not independently verify the extent of damage because it could not access the sites. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WHY IS THE PIPELINE LINKED TO EU SANCTIONS?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hungary retaliated against the stoppage of flows by vetoing new EU sanctions on Russia this week and blocked a new EU loan for Kyiv, straining Europe's pro-Ukrainian consensus on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the Ukraine war.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose party is trailing behind the opposition in polls ahead of an April 12 election, on Wednesday accused Ukraine of an \"oil blockade\". </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Orban has cast the election as a choice between \"war or peace\", saying his opponents would drag Hungary into the Ukraine conflict.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Slovakia has stopped providing emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine in response to the Druzhba dispute. Kyiv relies on emergency electricity from EU countries because of extensive damage to its power infrastructure from Russian drone and missile attacks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WHAT NEXT?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The EU has not said how it plans to break the deadlock on its new Russia sanctions, after talks between ministers on Monday failed to do so.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Croatia has offered to replace oil from Druzhba by supplies via its Adria pipeline with non-Russian supplies shipped in by tankers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pipeline operator Janaf says Adria could deliver as much as 280,000 bpd of oil to Hungary and Slovakia, more than enough to replace the 200,000 bpd coming from Russia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hungary's MOL has previously said Adria cannot deliver those volumes and that maintaining supplies via Druzhba is crucial to its operations. MOL and Janaf said on Wednesday they would start tests to confirm Adria's capacity, with international observers present.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>RUSSIAN EXPORT PROBLEMS MOUNT</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The halt of supplies via Druzhba has not triggered an immediate oil shortage in Hungary or Slovakia. Both countries have ordered an emergency release of stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The cut in Druzhba flows has added to Russian oil production and export problems, according to traders and analysts. Russian oil flows to India and Turkey are set to drop in March-April due to U.S. sanctions, leaving China as the main buyer of crude.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ukrainian drone attacks have also damaged several refineries inside Russia, reducing its ability to process crude, which together with export problems may ultimately lead to production cuts, according to analysts. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Market jitters over supply disruptions from Russia alongside U.S.-Iran tensions have supported benchmark crude oil prices above $70 per barrel, well above analysts' predictions of $60 per barrel this year. </span></p></span></div></div>",
