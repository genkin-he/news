The reduction in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods after the Trump-Xi meeting should boost the price competitiveness of Chinese exports and ease pressure on exporters, while the suspension of shipping levies will benefit Chinese shipbuilders and shipping firms. Although the summit didn't resolve deeper structural issues, it sets the stage for continued high-level exchanges next year that should help contain the risk of significant escalation in tensions, she adds. CGS International believes the improved backdrop strengthens the case for global investors to increase their Chinese equities allocation. (jason.chau@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0831 GMT - Stocks ended lower in Hong Kong, as a lack of specific details on exports of Nvidia's Blackwell chips to China following a meeting between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping likely disappointed market participants, DBS Group Research analysts say in an email. Despite a trade deal between the two countries, there was no concrete timeline or guidance on when Chinese companies might gain access to Nvidia's advanced AI chips, analysts led by Andy Yu write. This ambiguity is likely to weigh on AI infrastructure names, including data-center stocks, and large tech companies that depend on advanced chip availability for their AI-related businesses. Index heavyweights Tencent and Alibaba Group shed 3.4% and 4.1%, respectively, sending the benchmark Hang Seng Index 1.4% lower to 25906.65.
