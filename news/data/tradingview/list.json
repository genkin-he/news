Saefong</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the U.S. attacks Iran, oil prices 'are headed into the sky along with the missiles,' says one energy-market investor</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran ramped up oil exports in recent weeks - a signal that it is \"preparing for some type of military incursion and is trying to get out as much crude as possible ahead of such an event,\" said Matt Smith of Kpler.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oil prices jolted higher on Friday, booking their biggest daily gain in over a week, after President Trump signaled the window for using diplomacy to end Tehran's nuclear program may be closing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I'd love not to use\" the U.S. military to attack Iran, \"but sometimes you have to,\" Trump told reporters outside the White House on Friday. He also said a final decision on whether to attack Iran had not yet been made.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The president's \"sometimes you have to\" bombshell lit the fuse for oil on Friday, said Manish Raj, managing director at Velandera Energy Partners.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oil prices settled at their highest levels in about seven months Friday. U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery (CL.1) (CLJ26) finished at $67.02 a barrel, up 2.8% for the month, while global benchmark Brent crude for April delivery (BRNJ26), which expired at the end of Friday's session, tallied a monthly rise of 2.5%, to $72.48.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Prices rose on fears that this weekend could \"flip the switch from talk to tomahawk,\" said Raj. Traders are \"baking in a fat $10 risk premium,\" or the extra price per barrel of oil beyond \"fair value\" based on supply and demand dynamics. \"This is pure geopolitical nitro, leaving bulls high-fiving over the chokepoint drama,\" he noted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are several \"chokepoints\" to worry about when it comes to oil infrastructure and the flow of crude in and around Iran. The country has been among the world's biggest oil producers, with a 4% share of the world's oil output in 2023.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here's what matters in terms of the oil infrastructure in surrounding Iran.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran's \"last-resort weapon\" has always been a threatened closure of the Strait of Hormuz, according to a report this week from Oxford Analytica. The waterway is a crucial maritime passage for crude transport that connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Seas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From the archives: Strait of Hormuz, the world's biggest oil chokepoint, in focus as U.S.-Iran tensions flare</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A closure of the passageway might prove difficult, but significant disruption and heightened risks would have a major impact on regional trade as well as international oil prices, the Oxford Analytica report said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Iranians don't appear to be making concessions, so \"we should expect U.S. military action,\" said Matt Smith, U.S. head analyst at Kpler. There's a \"near 80% probability\" of some form of U.S. military action against Iran, he added - noting that Trump last week gave a deadline of 10 to 15 days to make a deal with Iran, leaving this weekend as a possibility for a U.S. strike.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's particularly important as Iran has ramped up exports in recent weeks, according to Smith. It's a signal that Iran is \"preparing for some type of military incursion and is trying to get out as much crude as possible ahead of such an event,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran's crude-oil exports climbed significantly in February from a month earlier, data from Kpler show.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last week, Iran exported 26 million barrels, according to Smith, who pointed out that it typically exports less than half that amount. This lifted February crude exports from Iran to the highest monthly pace since July 2018, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But it's not a U.S. strike on Iran itself that would be the key concern, said Velandera Energy's Raj.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The biggest \"oil-market nightmare\" would be Iran \"flipping the Strait of Hormuz switch,\" he told MarketWatch - disrupting maritime passage through the narrow chokepoint, which carries 20% of the world's global crude.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"One missile barrage, and we're staring at a $90 barrel moonshot and sending prices into orbit faster than a Texas wildcatter striking paydirt,\" said Raj.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet a weekend strike is far from guaranteed - especially after Badr Albusaidi, Oman's foreign minister, said \"significant progress\" was made during negotiations on Thursday, while signaling talks between the U.S. and Iran are set to continue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Trump's 'we'll see what happens' vibe screams 'keep negotiating or else,'\" Raj noted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Myra P.

I believe the answer is both,” he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The executive said that firms operating as transactional middlemen and commoditized insurance product lines “should be concerned.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But for his firm he described AI as a “step-function multiplier,” enabling significant gains in productivity and enhancing organizational speed and agility. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This includes in personal lines, which comprises 38% of Baldwin’s total pro forma revenue. Around 80% of this revenue emanates from embedded insurance, which its CEO said represents “one of the ultimate moats in this environment.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“While the market is worrying about consumers asking a chatbot for insurance in our embedded businesses, we are focused on being the insurance solution of convenience sold through a trusted partner alongside a primary transaction such as buying a home, securing a mortgage or renting an apartment,” he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The executive said Baldwin’s Westwood platform, which is inclusive of business acquired from Hippo, generated $190 million in pro forma revenue in 2025 and “seamlessly embeds directly into the home-buying experience for 20 of the top 25 homebuilders in the United States.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Baldwin onboarded 12 new partners on the platform in 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company this week signed a 10-year exclusive agreement with Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation, the sixth largest independent mortgage lender in the U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“We currently expect to go live with Fairway on our Coverage Navigator platform in the second quarter,” Trevor Baldwin said. “The growing momentum here is palpable and will drive deeper moats around our embedded business.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Baldwin’s renters insurance platform, which wrote over $280 million of premium in 2025, embeds directly into property management software, allowing a renter to purchase an insurance policy at point of lease in under 60 seconds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“100% of the premium flowing through this channel is into our own proprietary products built and managed by our MGA platform, MSI. Overall, these embedded solutions are easier, more intuitive and more seamless than initiating a separate process with a stand-alone AI agent,” Trevor Baldwin said.</span></p></span></div></div>",

OpenAI said that with the changes, it would have referred the account belonging to Jesse Van Rootselaar to police if it was discovered today. Police have identified Van Rootselaar as the suspect in a deadly school shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia that left eight dead and dozens injured.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Wall Street Journal has reported that OpenAI considered alerting Canadian law-enforcement authorities about interactions between Van Rootselaar and ChatGPT. OpenAI shut down Van Rootselaar's ChatGPT account after detecting a violation of its policy but didn't notify police.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Solomon said he's also scheduled to speak to OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman next week. A spokeswoman for OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

British Columbia Premier David Eby said he's also set to speak to Altman, and Eby added he wants the CEO to be cognizant of the pain that families in Tumbler Ridge are feeling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Online platforms have long debated how to balance questions of privacy with public safety in their decisions to alert law enforcement about certain users. That debate has now pulled in the AI companies that power the chatbots to which people are confiding the most intimate details of their private thoughts and lives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In its letter to Solomon, OpenAI divulged that Van Rootselaar had a second ChatGPT account. Among OpenAI's pledges is a commitment to strengthen detection systems to prevent efforts to evade safeguards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Taylor Owen, a public-policy professor at Montreal's McGill University with a specialty in media and ethics, said OpenAI has now publicly acknowledged its previous safety protocols were inadequate, and that Van Rootselaar's ability to create a second account discloses a previously unknown system error.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It means the threshold that governed the original decision, the one that resulted in Canadian police not being contacted about violent content flagged by the company's own systems, was one the company itself now considers inadequate,\" Owen said.

The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the Fund's distribution to shareholders may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that a shareholder invested in a Fund is paid back to them. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\" The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV to shareholders for the calendar year that will describe how to report the Fund's distributions for federal income tax purposes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The determination of the actual source of distributions can only be made at year-end. The actual source amounts of all Fund distributions will be included in the Fund's annual or semi-annual reports. In addition, the tax treatment may differ from the accounting treatment used to calculate the source of the Fund's distributions as shown on shareholders' statements. Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after December 31, 2026 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV early in 2027. Since each shareholder's tax situation is unique, it may be advisable to consult a tax advisor as to the appropriate treatment of Fund distributions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Effective on January 1, 2024, Saba Capital Management, L.P. replaced Franklin Templeton Advisers, Inc. as the investment adviser to Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund II (formerly known as the Templeton Global Income Fund).

Annual NAV Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund's NAV over a year, assuming reinvestment of distributions paid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(2) The Annualized Distribution Rate is the dollar value of distributions for the current fiscal period November 1, 2025 through January 31, 2026 (which includes the special dividend paid during the current fiscal period in January 2026) annualized as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of January 31, 2026. The level of distribution amount shown is not guaranteed and special dividends may or may not be paid in the future. Further, no conclusions should be drawn about the Fund's investment performance from the amount or rate of distribution shown.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(3) Cumulative Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund's NAV from October 31, 2025 through January 31, 2026, assuming reinvestment of distributions paid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(4) The Cumulative Fiscal Year-To-Date Distribution Rate is the dollar value of distributions for the current fiscal period November 1, 2025 through January 31, 2026 (which includes the special dividend paid during the current fiscal period in January 2026) as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of January 31, 2026. The level of distribution amount shown is not guaranteed and special dividends may or may not be paid in the future. Further, no conclusions should be drawn about the Fund's investment performance from the amount or rate of distribution shown.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Managed Distribution Plan. The above distribution was declared in accordance with the Fund's currently effective managed distribution plan (the \"Plan\"), whereby the Fund will make monthly distributions to shareholders at a fixed amount of $0.058 per share. Thus, the distribution amount shown excludes special dividends (which are not paid pursuant to the plan). The Fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund's Plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund's common shares, but there is no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the Plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. As a result, long-term capital gains and/or return of capital may be a material source of any distribution. No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's distributions or from the terms of the Fund's Plan. The Board of Trustees (the \"Board\") may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to Fund shareholders. No level of distribution can be guaranteed. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's common shares. The Plan is subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the annual minimum fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Past Performance is No Assurance of Future Results. Investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investors should consider the investment objective, risks and expenses carefully.

The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the Fund's distribution to shareholders may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that a shareholder invested in a Fund is paid back to them. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\" The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV to shareholders for the calendar year that will describe how to report the Fund's distributions for federal income tax purposes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The determination of the actual source of distributions can only be made at year-end. The actual source amounts of all Fund distributions will be included in the Fund's annual or semi-annual reports. In addition, the tax treatment may differ from the accounting treatment used to calculate the source of the Fund's distributions as shown on shareholders' statements. Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after December 31, 2026 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV early in 2027. Since each shareholder's tax situation is unique, it may be advisable to consult a tax advisor as to the appropriate treatment of Fund distributions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Effective after the close of business on June 4, 2021, Saba Capital Management, L.P. replaced Voya Financial as the investment adviser to Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund (formerly known as the Voya Prime Rate Trust).

Annual NAV Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund's NAV over a year, assuming reinvestment of distributions paid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(2) The Annualized Distribution Rate is the dollar value of distributions for the current fiscal period November 1, 2025 through January 31, 2026 annualized as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of January 31, 2026. The level of distribution amount shown is not guaranteed and special dividends may or may not be paid in the future. Further, no conclusions should be drawn about the Fund's investment performance from the amount or rate of distribution shown.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(3) Cumulative Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund's NAV from October 31, 2025 through January 31, 2026, assuming reinvestment of distributions paid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(4) The Cumulative Fiscal Year-To-Date Distribution Rate is the dollar value of distributions for the current fiscal period November 1, 2025 through January 31, 2026 as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of January 31, 2026. The level of distribution amount shown is not guaranteed and special dividends may or may not be paid in the future. Further, no conclusions should be drawn about the Fund's investment performance from the amount or rate of distribution shown.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Managed Distribution Plan. The above distribution was declared in accordance with the Fund's currently effective managed distribution plan (the \"Plan\"), whereby the Fund will make monthly distributions to shareholders at a fixed amount of $0.085 per share. Thus, the distribution amount shown excludes special dividends (which are not paid pursuant to the plan). The Fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund's Plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund's common shares, but there is no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the Plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. As a result, long-term capital gains and/or return of capital may be a material source of any distribution. No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's distributions or from the terms of the Fund's Plan. The Board of Trustees (the \"Board\") may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to Fund shareholders. No level of distribution can be guaranteed. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's common shares. The Plan is subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the annual minimum fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Past Performance is No Assurance of Future Results. Investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investors should consider the investment objective, risks and expenses carefully. You can obtain the Fund's most recent periodic reports and filings by visiting https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=826020&amp;owner=exclude.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other Information and Certain Risk Factors: The Fund's investment objective is to provide investors with a high level of current income, with a secondary goal of capital appreciation. There can be no assurance that the Fund will meet its investment objective. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing globally in debt and equity securities of public and private companies, which includes, among other things, investments in closed--end funds, special purpose acquisition companies (\"SPACs\"), reinsurance, and public and private debt instruments. The Fund also may utilize derivatives including but not limited to total return swaps, credit default swaps, options and futures, in seeking to enhance returns and/or to reduce portfolio risk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The value of the Fund's investments in equity securities of public and private, listed and unlisted companies and equity derivatives generally varies with the performance of the issuer and movements in the equity markets more generally. As a result, the Fund may suffer losses if it invests in equity instruments of issuers whose performance diverges from the Fund's investment manager's expectations or if equity markets generally move in a single direction and the Fund has not hedged against such a general move. The Fund invests in closed-end funds and SPACs, which are subject to additional risks and considerations. The performance of reinsurance-related securities and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various triggering events, including but not limited to weather, natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.), non-natural large catastrophes and other specified events causing physical and/or economic loss. To the extent the Fund invests in reinsurance-related securities for which a triggering event occurs, losses associated with such event could result in losses to the Fund's investment, and a series of major triggering events affecting a large portion of the reinsurance- related securities held by the Fund could result in substantial losses to the Fund's investment. The Fund may invest in high yield securities, which are speculative in nature and are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default, illiquidity of the security, and changes in value based on changes in interest rates. Changes in short-term market interest rates may directly affect the yield on the Fund's common shares. If such rates fall, the Fund's yield may also fall. If interest rate spreads on bonds and loans owned by the Fund decline in general, the yield on the bonds and loans will likely fall and the value of such bonds and loans may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short-term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on bonds and loans in the Fund's portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for certain bonds and loans, the Fund's ability to sell such securities in a timely fashion and/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new bonds and loans acquired by the Fund, and it may also increase the price of bonds and loans purchased by the Fund in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the price of bonds and loans in the Fund's portfolio, which would cause the Fund's net asset value to decrease. The Fund's use of leverage, if any, through borrowings or issuance of preferred shares can adversely affect the yield on the Fund's common shares. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including but not limited to potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Fund may engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge, as closely as practicable, all of the economic impact to the Fund arising from foreign currency fluctuations. Other risks include, but are not limited to, the use of derivatives, the potential lack of diversification in the Fund's portfolio, and the fact that the Fund's portfolio may be concentrated in a small group of industries or industry sectors from time to time. Investors should consult the Fund's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the materials on the Fund's website for a more detailed discussion of these or other risk factors that affect the Fund.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund.

The condition is characterized by generalized xerosis and fine, white to gray scales that are prominent on the abdomen, chest, and extensor surfaces of the extremities.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mr. Salva concluded: \"2026 promises to be an important year for Azitra with several anticipated milestones including topline data for both our Phase 1b study in Netherton Syndrome and the Phase 1/2 study in EGFRi-associated rash.

Azitra's lead program, ATR-12, uses an engineered strain of S. epidermidis designed to treat Netherton syndrome, a rare, chronic skin disease with no approved treatment options. Netherton syndrome may be fatal in infancy with those living beyond a year having profound lifelong challenges. The ATR-12 program includes a Phase 1b clinical trial in adults with Netherton syndrome. ATR-04, Azitra's additional clinical program, utilizes another engineered strain of S. epidermidis for the treatment of EGFR inhibitor (\"EGFRi\") associated skin toxicity; a Phase 1/2 clinical trial has been initiated for this program. Azitra has received Fast Track designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration for this program to treat EGFRi associated rash, which impacts approximately 150,000 people in the United States. The ATR-12 and ATR-04 programs were developed from Azitra's proprietary platform of engineered proteins and topical live biotherapeutic products that includes a microbial library comprised of approximately 1,500 bacterial strains. The platform is augmented by artificial intelligence and machine learning technology that analyzes, predicts, and helps screen the library of strains for drug like molecules.
