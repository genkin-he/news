            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Giulia Petroni</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here's a look at what happened in oil markets in the week of Oct. 27-31 and what the focus will be in the days to come.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OVERVIEW: Crude benchmarks are on track for weekly losses of more than 2% on a stronger U.S. dollar and as concerns over rising global supply outweigh the impact of U.S. sanctions on Russian oil exports. Brent crude trades around $64 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate is above $60 a barrel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MACRO: The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point earlier this week, but Chair Jerome Powell said further cuts in December are far from certain. The U.S. government shutdown has paused economic data releases, complicating the path ahead.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Traders scaled back their bets and now see a 65% chance that the U.S. bank will lower rates at its December meeting, according to the FedWatch tool.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>GEOPOLITICAL RISKS: President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping reached a trade agreement following a summit in South Korea, de-escalating a conflict that threatens to impact global economic growth and demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deal includes a reduction in stiff U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for China's commitment to crack down on the trade in the chemicals used to produce fentanyl. China also agreed to delay the introduction of its latest round of export controls on rare earths, though many underlying issues between the two superpowers haven't been addressed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The U.S.-China trade deal failed to tackle purchases of Russian oil,\" analysts at ANZ Research said. \"There has been no indication on the Chinese side as to whether they will stop buying.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, traders are closely monitoring Russian oil exports after the U.S. imposed sanctions on the country's largest oil companies, with Rystad Energy estimating that between 500,000-600,000 bpd of Russian oil production is currently at risk of being curtailed in the next two months. However, oil's reaction suggests that the market isn't convinced a significant amount of Russian supply will be lost, according to market watchers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SUPPLY AND DEMAND: The latest data from the Energy Information Administration showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 6.9 million barrels last week, against expectations of a 200,000-barrel decline. Gasoline inventories dropped by 5.9 million barrels, sending positive signals about demand in the world's largest oil consumer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies are expected to opt for another modest output increase for December at their upcoming meeting this week. \"The uncertainty surrounding sanctions on Russia also supports this increase,\" analysts at ING said. \"The move will only reinforce the bearish outlook for the market, adding to the substantial surplus expected through 2026.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WHAT'S AHEAD: Key members of the OPEC+ alliance are scheduled to meet virtually on Sunday to discuss their production plans. Most market watchers expect the group to approve an increase of 137,000 barrels a day, consistent with October and November levels. \"Only a larger increase would lead to a negative price reaction,\" said Carsten Fritsch from Commerzbank Research.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the macroeconomic front, markets are awaiting speeches from Federal Reserve officials next week to gauge the future direction of U.S. monetary policy. Meanwhile, Trump urged Senate Republicans to end the filibuster--the longstanding rule requiring 60 votes to advance most legislation--in a bid to reopen the government without Democratic support.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Giulia Petroni at giulia.petroni@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
