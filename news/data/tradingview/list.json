Our strategy combines current production and cashflow generation with transformational growth driven by expansions of its operating assets, exploration, and development projects. Aris Mining intends to unlock value through scale, diversification and execution. The Company is listed on the TSX (ARIS) and the NYSE (ARIS) and is led by an experienced team with a strong track record of value creation, operational excellence, financial discipline and good corporate governance in the gold mining industry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aris Mining operates two underground gold mines in Colombia: Segovia and Marmato, which together produced approximately 257,000 ounces of gold in 2025. With expansions underway, the Company is targeting an annual production rate of 500,000 ounces of gold, driven by the commissioning of a second mill at Segovia, completed in June 2025 and ramping up since, and the construction of the CIP plant at Marmato, with first gold expected in Q4 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beyond its operating assets, Aris Mining has a development pipeline that supports its longer-term growth outlook to achieve annual production of approximately 1.0 million ounces of gold(1) . Aris Mining owns the Toroparu gold project in Guyana, where a Preliminary Economic Assessment was completed in October 2025 and a Prefeasibility Study is in progress, positioning the project to advance toward construction. In Colombia, Aris Mining also owns the high-grade Soto Norte gold project, where a Prefeasibility Study was completed in September 2025 that balances scale and strong economics with industry leading environmental and social design features. Environmental studies are being finalized and on schedule for submission in Q2 2026 to initiate the Soto Norte licensing process.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Additional information on Aris Mining can be found at www.aris-mining.com, www.sedarplus.ca, and on www.sec.gov.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cautionary Language</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Qualified Person</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pamela De Mark, P.Geo., Senior Vice President Geology and Exploration of Aris Mining, is a Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101, and has reviewed and approved the technical information contained in this news release.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Forward-Looking Information</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This news release contains \"forward-looking information\" or forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Canadian securities legislation.
