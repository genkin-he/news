The effective tax rate for the first nine   months of 2025 was 18.9% compared to 17.8% in the comparable period in   2024.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Net income was $10,005,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2025,   which was $2,469,000 more than the net income for 2024's comparable   period due to an increase in net interest income after the provision for   credit losses of $3,116,000. The effective tax rate for the three months   ended September 30, 2025 was 19.1% compared to 18.5% in the comparable   period in 2024.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Net interest income before the provision for credit losses was   $71,790,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of   $8,208,000, or 12.9%, over the same period a year ago and was primarily   due to an increase in investment income and a decrease in interest   expense.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The provision (release) for credit losses for the three and nine months   ended September 30, 2025 was $500,000 and $1,875,000, respectively   compared to $(200,000) and $2,587,000 for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2024, respectively. The provision for the 2025 periods was   driven by the current economic forecasts. The provision for 2024 was   significantly impacted by loans that were not sold as part of the sale of   a division known as Braavo that occurred in the first quarter of 2024.   The vast majority of the Braavo loans that were retained after the sale   were originated by Huntington Valley Bank in 2023 prior to the   acquisition and were current as of the acquisition date in 2023. The   provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, directly   attributable to these loans was $1,806,000.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Return on average equity for the three and nine months (annualized) ended   September 30, 2025 was 12.52% and 11.15% compared to 10.31% and 9.23% for   the three and nine months (annualized) ended September 30, 2024. If the   provision for the credit losses attributable to the Braavo loans and the   gain on the sale of Braavo were excluded, the return on average equity   for the nine months (annualized) ended September 30, 2024 would have been   9.56% (non-GAAP). (1)   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Return on average tangible equity (non-GAAP) for the three and nine   months (annualized) ended September 30, 2025 was 17.29% and 15.56%   compared to 14.82% and 13.39% for the three and nine months (annualized)   ended September 30, 2024. If the provision for the credit losses   attributable to the Braavo loans and the gain on the sale of Braavo were   excluded, the return on average tangible equity for the nine months   (annualized) ended September 30, 2024 would have been 13.87% (non-GAAP).   (1)   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Return on average assets for the three and nine months (annualized) ended   September 30, 2025 was 1.33% and 1.16% compared to 1.01% and 0.89% for   the three and nine months (annualized) ended September 30, 2024. If the   provision for the credit losses attributable to the Braavo loans and the   gain on the sale of Braavo were excluded, the return on average assets   for the nine months (annualized) ended September 30, 2024 would have been   0.92% (non-GAAP). (1)   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Non-performing assets decreased $5,618,000, or 19.6% since December 31,   2024 and totaled $22,994,000 as of September 30, 2025, which is   $1,051,000 less than the balance as of September 30, 2024. During the   third quarter of 2025, the Bank recognized additional interest income of   $473,000 from the pay-offs of three relationships that for portions of   the last year were considered non-performing. The decrease since December   reflects three large relationships being placed back on accrual status   due to making contractual payments for at least six consecutive months   and the pay-offs of three large relationships in the third quarter of   2025 offset by placing two large relationships on non-accrual status. As   a percent of loans, non-performing assets totaled 0.98%, 1.24% and 1.03%   as of September 30, 2025, December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024,   respectively. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to 2024</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net income totaled   $26,089,000 which compares to net income of $19,835,000 for the first   nine months of 2024, an increase of $6,254,000. Basic earnings per share   of $5.44 for the first nine months of 2025 compared to $4.14 for the   first nine months last year. Annualized return on equity for the nine   months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was 11.15% and 9.23%, while   annualized return on assets was 1.16% and 0.89%, respectively. The   increase in performance when comparing 2025 to 2024 was due to an   increase in the net interest margin from 3.09% to 3.44% and a decrease in   the provision for credit losses.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Net interest income before the provision for credit losses for the nine   months ended September 30, 2025 totaled $71,790,000 compared to   $63,582,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in an   increase of $8,208,000, or 12.9%. Average interest earning assets   increased $39,854,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2025   compared to the same period last year, primarily due to an increase in   taxable investments and outstanding student loans.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>NEW YORK, Oct. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — IQSTEL Inc. </span><span>, a Global Connectivity, AI, and Digital Corporation, today announced its 2026 organic revenue forecast of $430 million, representing a 26% increase over the company's $340 million revenue forecast for 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>IQSTEL reported $283 million in revenue for fiscal year 2024 and has reaffirmed that it remains on track to meet its $340 million 2025 forecast, driven by continued organic expansion across its Telecom, Fintech, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Cybersecurity services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Importantly, IQSTEL has built a strong track record of meeting or exceeding its financial forecasts, demonstrating consistent execution and disciplined management across its diversified operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company also reiterated its strategic plan to acquire two to three accretive businesses as part of its roadmap to achieve $15 million in EBITDA by 2026, while maintaining a clear focus on profitable organic growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Our forecast reflects the strength of our business platform and our ability to deliver consistent, organic growth while preparing for high-margin expansion,\" said Leandro Iglesias, CEO of IQSTEL. \"We are building toward a balanced model of growth that combines innovation, efficiency, and scale — positioning IQSTEL for sustained profitability and long-term shareholder value.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The $430 million organic revenue forecast for 2026 marks another milestone in IQSTEL's transformation into a diversified, technology-driven corporation, operating across more than 20 countries and serving over 600 of the world's largest telecom operators.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Once the company completes any of its potential acquisition targets, IQSTEL plans to update the 2026 revenue forecast accordingly. The company continues accelerating its growth trajectory on the path to becoming a $1 billion revenue corporation by 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About IQSTEL Inc.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>IQSTEL Inc. </span><span> is a Global Connectivity, AI, and Digital Corporation providing advanced solutions across Telecom, High-Tech Telecom Services, Fintech, AI-Powered Telecom Platforms, and Cybersecurity. With operations in 21 countries and a team of 100 employees, IQSTEL serves a broad global customer base with high-value, high-margin services. Backed by a strong and scalable business platform, the company is forecasting $340 million in revenue for FY-2025, reinforcing its trajectory toward becoming a $1 billion tech-driven enterprise by 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: The Company uses certain financial calculations such as Adjusted EBITDA, Return on Assets and Return on Equity as factors in the measurement and evaluation of the Company's operating performance and period-over-period growth. The Company derives these financial calculations on the basis of methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), primarily by excluding from a comparable GAAP measure certain items the Company does not consider to be representative of its actual operating performance. These financial calculations are \"non-GAAP financial measures\" as defined under the SEC rules. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures in operating its business because management believes they are less susceptible to variances in actual operating performance that can result from the excluded items, other infrequent charges and currency fluctuations. The Company presents these financial measures to investors because management believes they are useful to investors in evaluating the primary factors that drive the Company's core operating performance and provide greater transparency into the Company's results of operations. However, items that are excluded and other adjustments and assumptions that are made in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company's financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with, and are not a substitute for, the Company's GAAP financial measures. Further, because these non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, the non-GAAP financial measures, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized accounting measurement under GAAP; it should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as a measure of operating results, or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. It is presented here not as an alternative to net income, but rather as a measure of the Company's operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA excludes, in addition to non-operational expenses like interest expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortization; items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, such as:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities: These adjustments reflect   unrealized gains or losses that are non-operational and subject to market   volatility.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Loss on Settlement of Debt: This represents non-recurring expenses   associated with specific financing activities and does not impact ongoing   business operations.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Stock-Based Compensation: As a non-cash expense, this adjustment   eliminates variability caused by equity-based incentives. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA offers a clearer view of the cash-generating potential of its business, excluding non-recurring, non-cash, and non-operational impacts. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating the Company's operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes, non-cash and certain other items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance and also believes this information is useful to investors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Safe Harbor Statement: Statements in this news release may be \"forward-looking statements\". Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that express our intentions, beliefs, expectations, strategies, predictions, or any other information relating to our future activities or other future events or conditions. Words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend\", \"could\" and similar expressions, as they relate to the company or its management, identify forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about our business based partly on assumptions made by management. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our ability to successfully market our products and services; our continued ability to pay operating costs and ability to meet demand for our products and services; the amount and nature of competition from other telecom products and services; the effects of changes in the cybersecurity and telecom markets; our ability to successfully develop new products and services; our ability to complete complementary acquisitions and dispositions that benefit our company; our success establishing and maintaining collaborative, strategic alliance agreements with our industry partners; our ability to comply with applicable regulations; our ability to secure capital when needed; and the other risks and uncertainties described in our prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may and are likely to differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to numerous factors. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this news release, and IQSTEL Inc. undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this news release.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For more information, please visit www.IQSTEL.com.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Official Investors Landing Page: www.landingpage.iqstel.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investor Relations Contact:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>IQSTEL Inc.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>300 Aragon Avenue, Suite 375, Coral Gables, FL 33134</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Email: investors@IQSTEL.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iqst--iqstel-announces-430-million-organic-revenue-forecast-for-2026-reflecting-26-organic-growth-and-building-on-strong-momentum-302599220.html</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SOURCE iQSTEL</span></p></span></div></div>",
