The gas station unit could then get fresh capital from the bank, the sources said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The idea fell flat with creditors who want to keep the company intact to ensure a quick turnaround and are pressuring shareholders to inject as much fresh capital into Raizen as possible, sources said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Raizen, Cosan, BTG Pactual and Shell declined to comment on the matter. Shell reiterated that it is working with Raizen and Cosan to support Raizen's deleveraging. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Concerns over Raizen's future have drawn the attention of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who met with officials from BNDES and state oil firm Petrobras to discuss the sugar company's situation last year and again this month, according to sources. Raizen shareholders were on hand for the latest meeting, in which Lula expressed concern, but made no call to action, a source said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Neither BNDES nor Petrobras, which is evaluating other potential biofuels investments, has shown interest in capitalizing Raizen, sources said. Petrobras is restricted from investing in fuel distribution after spinning off its own gas station chain, now called Vibra Energia </span><span>.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Petrobras is not assessing the acquisition of Raizen assets, the company said. BNDES did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Raizen needs more than 20 billion reais in fresh capital, said one of the sources, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that Shell was open to injecting some 3.5 billion reais into Raizen.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The beleaguered sugar and biofuels producer saw its net debt climb to 55.3 billion reais by the end of December, due to a combination of heavy investments, erratic weather and wildfires, which led to weaker harvests and lower crushing volumes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>($1 = 5.1491 reais)</span></p></span></div></div>",

Investors also worry that AI could wipe out millions of computer‑based jobs, squeeze consumer spending, and even tip the global economy into a deflationary slide.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The benchmark 10-year yield, which moves inversely to prices, fell to a three-month low, while 30-year yields slid to a more than one-week trough.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We're hearing more about the potential negative impact from AI on certain industries and what that could be going forward,\" said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed income strategy at WisdomTree.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>        \"The conversations I've had with clients involve people asking if there is a way we can mitigate risks to some of the industries that could have unintended consequences from AI. That seems to be a narrative in the market right now.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>        In the very near term, Iran is also a nagging concern for bond investors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>        Iran and the United States held indirect talks in Geneva on Thursday to avert a conflict over their long-running nuclear dispute. Oman, which acted as mediator during the meeting, said  both parties made significant progress, after U.S. President Donald Trump had recently ordered a huge military build-up in the region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran, which has said its nuclear program is peaceful, agreed in principle to accept curbs to its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions but rejects tying the talks to other issues.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There's some fear of what's going on with Iran,\" said Stan Shipley, fixed income strategist at Evercore ISI in New York. \"The question is: Are we going to war with Iran? So there's some flight to safety here.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In afternoon trading, the benchmark 10-year yield fell 3.2 basis points (bps) to 4.016% </span><span>, after hitting its lowest since late November at 4.014%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>         \"The macro environment is not supportive of a 10-year yield at 4% or below,\" said WisdomTree's Flanagan. \"Some of the macro data have been good and the Fed minutes a week ago showed a Fed that is either at or near the end of this rate cycle.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. 30-year yields also slid, touching a more than one-week low, and were last down 2.8 bps at 4.666% (US30YT=RR).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the front end of the curve, the two-year yield, which reflects rate expectations, declined 2.7 bps to 3.444% (US2YT=RR).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>        AUCTION ROUGHLY IN LINE WITH FORECAST    </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. Treasury on Thursday sold $44 billion in seven-year notes and the result was roughly in line with expectations. The auction cleared at 3.790%, more or less matching the expected rate at the bid deadline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bid-to-cover ratio, a demand metric, was 2.50X, marginally higher than the six-auction average of 2.46X.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Post-auction, U.S. seven-year yields sank 4 bps to 3.772% (US7YT=RR). Since the January auction, seven-year yields have declined by roughly more than 20 bps and are now trading near six-month lows. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>        In other parts of the bond market, the yield curve was slightly flatter on the day, with the gap between two-year and 10-year yields slipping to 56 bps (US2US10=TWEB) from 57.9 bps late on Wednesday. It was last at 57 bps.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The curve has flattened in 11 of the last 12 sessions as short‑term yields climbed relative to long-term Treasuries. The 2/10 gap had narrowed for 10 consecutive sessions at one stage, marking its longest tightening run since November 2015.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Analysts attributed the flattening to expectations of fewer rate cuts following a January nonfarm payrolls report that showed an unexpected increase in new jobs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bond investors continued to factor in a more gradual pace of easing from the Federal Reserve in 2026, given a recent batch of data showing a steadier economy that will likely avoid recession this year and next.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thursday's economic data supported that view. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 212,000 for the week ended February 21, data showed. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 215,000 claims.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. fed funds futures on Thursday priced in about 55 bps of easing this year, equivalent to about two rate cuts of 25 bps each, a scenario that has been in place since the start of the year. The first rate cut is not expected until July or September.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Now, Prime Minister Mark Carney wants New Delhi as his newest friend as he travels the world building alliances with so-called middle powers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Carney departed on Thursday for India in a bid to make up with India after years of disputes with his predecessor Justin Trudeau and deepen commercial ties that could reduce Canada's heavy economic reliance on the U.S. To do so, he'll have to iron out disagreements over Canada's Sikh population, which India accuses of stoking separatist sentiment on its soil.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But underlying the trip is Carney's call for closer partnerships among countries that have struggled to stand up on their own to China and the U.S. under President Trump. In a speech that drew a standing ovation at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, Carney said middle powers such as Canada had to work together to counter the rise of hard power.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This year, Carney has also traveled to China, where he negotiated a trade detente with America's biggest rival. Canada agreed to reduce tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, and China eased duties on Canadian food products. This marked a turnaround after years of tension fueled by Canada's arrest in 2018, at the U.S.'s behest, of a senior Huawei Technologies executive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After India, Carney is traveling to other middle powers, Australia and then Japan. But the stakes are highest with India-the world's largest country by population-which could offer Canada's farmers, oil producers and miners a vast new market. For India, Canada offers a stable trading partner after it got hit hard by Trump's tariffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is a moment where two middle powers have to come together-and are coming together-with a very similar strategic and economic agenda,\" said Harsh Pant, head of strategic studies at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Davos crowd may have applauded Carney for a focus on free trade and alliances at a time of rising protectionism and nationalism led by Trump, but the approach has risks. Trump has criticized the China trade deal and called out Carney at Davos, saying: \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump has imposed stiff tariffs of up to 50% on specific Canadian sectors-steel, aluminum, automobiles and forest products-which are throttling business investment and hiring in Canada. Most goods still arrive duty-free under a trade agreement, but the U.S. intends to review the pact. Its uncertain future remains a risk to Canada's economic outlook, officials say.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>CUPERTINO, Calif., Feb. 26, 2026 /CNW/ - </span><span> </span><span> — Boardwalktech Software Corp. (\"Boardwalktech\" or the \"Company\"), a leading digital ledger platform and enterprise software solutions company, is pleased to report its financial results for the three-month period ended December 31, 2025 (\"Q3-FY26\"). All figures are reported in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated. Boardwalktech's financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). Please refer to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&amp;A\") for the three-month period ended December 31, 2025, filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca for more information.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financial Highlights:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Revenues for Q3-FY26 totaled $1 million, unchanged from $1 million of   revenue reported in Q2-FY26. Revenues for Q3-FY26 decreased 25% from $1.3   million of revenue in Q3-FY25, primarily due to a decline in software and   subscription services revenue from two previously disclosed non-renewals   in Fiscal 2025.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Annual Recurring Revenue (\"ARR\"), a non-IFRS measure, at December 31,   2025 was $3.8 million. The Company defines ARR, as the annual recurring   revenue expected based on trailing quarterly revenue from license   subscriptions and certain recurring services.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Gross margin for Q3-FY26 was 86.9%, versus 86.7% in Q2-FY26 and 88.4% in   Q3-FY25. The improvement over Q2-FY26 is due to a decrease in cost of   sales, primarily hosting costs that are anticipated to continue at a   lower rate. The decrease from Q3-FY25 is due to lower revenue levels.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA for Q3-FY26 was a loss of $(0.2) million, which was a 35%   improvement versus $(0.4) million of adjusted EBITDA in Q2-FY26 and a 19%   improvement over $(0.4) million in Q3-FY25.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Net loss for Q3-FY26 was $(0.4) million ($(0.01) per basic and diluted   share), versus a $(0.5) million loss in Q2-FY26 ($(0.01) per basic and   diluted share), and a $(0.6) million loss in Q3-FY25 ($(0.01) per basic   and diluted share). This represented an 18% sequential improvement over   Q2-FY26 due to an increase in revenues and a decrease in costs. Total   selling, general and administration (\"SG&amp;A\") expenses in Q3-FY26 totaled   $1.1 million, a $0.1 million decrease from $1.2 million reported in   Q2-FY26 and a $0.3 million decrease from the $1.4 million reported in   Q3-FY25, as the Company continues to recognize savings from previously   announced cost alignment efforts.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Non-IFRS net loss for Q3 Fiscal 2026 (as defined in the Non-IFRS   Financial Measures section) totaled $(0.3) million ($(0.00) per basic and   diluted share), versus $(0.4) million in Q2 Fiscal 2026 ($(0.01) per   basic and diluted share) and $(0.4) million in Q3 Fiscal 2025 ($(0.01)   per basic and diluted share).   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Cash ending Q3-FY26 was $0.1 million, plus $0.4 million of accounts   receivables, while cash burn from Operations decreased by $0.9 million in   Q3-FY26 versus Q3-FY25, to a burn rate of $33,000 per month.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Outstanding debt as at December 31, 2025 was $2.5 million which was drawn   against the previously announced $4 million line of credit from Celtic   Bank. Due to requirements under IFRS, this debt was reclassified under   current liabilities even though the final debt maturity remains unchanged   at March of 2027. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Q3-FY26 Operational Highlights</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On November 4, 2025, the Company announced several contract renewals and   expansions increasing recurring revenue across multiple major enterprise   customers. The world's largest social media company renewed its services   agreement for another year, extending the partnership and expanding the   scope of work. A large global multinational IT services firm, both a   customer and partner, also expanded its engagement. A leading global   chemical manufacturer continues to expand its use of Unity Central to   improve supply chain visibility and enhance AI-driven information   management. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Subsequent to Q3-FY26 Operational Highlights:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On January 6, 2026, the Company announces the expansion and extension of   its contract with a leading global IT services firm to support a   top--five U.S. financial institution. Boardwalktech and the global IT   services firm have been jointly servicing this marquee U.S. bank since   2024, transforming manual workflows and processes into automated and   compliant solutions running on the Boardwalktech Velocity platform   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On January 20, 2026, the Company announced the launch of Boardwalk   Verity(TM), its next--generation Intelligent Controls Platform.   Purpose--built for highly regulated organizations, including banks,   insurers, and global financial institutions, Verity leverages Generative   AI and Agentic AI for controls automation, execution, validation, testing,   and continuous monitoring across thousands of business controls. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Management Commentary</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We continue to see existing customers expand deployments across Velocity and our Digital Ledger platform,\" said Andrew T. Duncan, CEO of Boardwalktech. \"Recent upgrade initiatives and new opportunities are expected to drive incremental professional services revenue and increase high-margin ARR. During the quarter, we enhanced Velocity with AI capabilities and subsequent to quarter-end we formally launched Verity, our first purpose-built AI product focused on automating internal controls testing and monitoring for financial institutions. Early traction with large banks and global partners reinforces our confidence in Verity as a meaningful growth driver. Unity Central also continues to gain momentum with AI enhancements improving enterprise data management and one supply chain customer already live and expanding usage based on measurable ROI. With previous cost reductions now taking effect and improved operating efficiency, we remain focused on accelerating revenue growth and moving toward Adjusted EBITDA breakeven in the near term. We believe the combination of Verity's launch, Velocity expansion, partner leverage, and continued cost discipline sets the stage for improved year-over-year performance and organic growth into Fiscal 2027 and beyond.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About Boardwalktech Software Corp.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Boardwalktech has developed a patented Digital Ledger Technology Platform currently used by Fortune 500 companies running mission-critical applications worldwide.
