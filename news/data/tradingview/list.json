The Japanese Finance Ministry's auction earlier of 2-year sovereign notes looks somewhat weak. The bid-to-cover ratio, a measure of demand in bond auctions, stood at 3.32, below 3.88 at the previous 2-year sale in January. In another indication of weak appetite, the auction's tail, or gap between the average accepted price and the lowest, was 0.013 yen, larger than 0.010 yen at the prior auction. Yield on 2-year JGBs is down 1 bp at 1.225%; 10-year yield falls 3 bps to 2.120%; 40-year yield drops 5.5 bps to 3.550%. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
