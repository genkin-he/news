            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Nick Devor</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As sports betting became ubiquitous, so did one phone number: 1-800-Gambler.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The helpline digits appear in fine print on gambling ads and lottery tickets nationwide, offering gamblers an immediate source of support if their play turns problematic. Call volume soared in recent years as dozens of states legalized sports betting and the industry centralized its problem gambling efforts to one point of contact. Some 326,000 calls went to the number over a recent 12-month period, along with another 8,500 texts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But in September, the helpline was thrown into disarray after a New Jersey court stripped 1-800-Gambler of its national sponsor and millions in donations. The ruling transferred control of 1-800-Gambler from the National Council on Problem Gambling, or NCPG, to a New Jersey advocacy group that launched the number four decades ago.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The legal battle and sharp accusations among advocates threaten to undermine years of progress in treating gambling addiction in the U.S. At the core of the debate are disagreements around national standards versus individual care.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Any disruption in helpline services can have life-or-death consequences; call-center operators have stories of talking people off a ledge. People with gambling disorders have higher suicide rates relative to other mental health conditions. Research from the American Association on Suicidality has found that helplines significantly decrease crisis states and hopelessness.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's just a little bit horrifying to see this happening, because I think we all want the same thing, ultimately, which are our pathways to connect people to treatment or information on this issue that are easily memorable and accessible,\" says Ted Hartwell, a former executive director of the Nevada Council on Problem Gambling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Problem gambling treatment faces a scarcity of funding across the country, as Barron's has previously reported. The federal government, for its part, has no programs in place for gambling addiction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2021, the National Football League stepped into the void with a $6.2 million grant to the NCPG, which also receives backing from major casino companies and online sportsbooks. The NFL funds boosted the council's revenue by 450% year over year, giving the group the firepower to nationalize problem gambling efforts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The NCPG used the money to license the 1-800-Gambler number, develop nationwide text and chat features, and spark an advertising blitz. The council, which says it is \"neutral on legalized gambling,\" leveraged industry connections to get big brands on board with the helpline, while lobbying state regulators to mandate use of the number.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The NFL told Barron's that its grant \"enabled the NCPG to unify helpline access nationwide under 1-800-Gambler, making it easier for anyone, anywhere in the U.S., to get help when they need it.\" The grant was renewed in 2024, bringing the NFL's promised contributions to $12.6 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But as the problem gambling effort grew on a national scale, longstanding local advocates felt sidelined. The Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey, which created 1-800-Gambler in 1983 and still owns the number, began to have second thoughts on its licensing deal with the NCPG after the group imposed requirements on local call centers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>New data-collection efforts from the NCPG also created tension with local groups. In some cases, gamblers were asked to answer survey questions before receiving assistance, according to state advocates in New Jersey, Florida, and New Mexico.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The NCPG and the NFL say national data are crucial in the fight against gambling addiction. Local counselors say data collection is incompatible with a need for anonymity, since gambling addicts often experience a level of shame around their behavior.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If they were sharing identifiable information, I don't think people would share with us as much as they do,\" says Candice Cookson, who answers problem gambling calls in Ohio and leads helpline operations for the United Way of Greater Cleveland.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gathering information on 1-800-Gambler callers became a priority for the NCPG after the NFL's investment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In November 2022, the NCPG's helpline committee prepared a document outlining data collection recommendations. \"As call centers begin collecting the same key data points and using similar language, it will enable comparisons across states and will give us the ability to spot trends in real time,\" reads the document, which was reviewed by Barron's. Age, gender, race, military service, and information on the caller's relationship to gambling are all recommended data points for collection.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Data-collection efforts are key to providing NCPG with insights into contact trends, allowing the organization to better advocate for federal funding that supports problem gambling prevention, education, and treatment efforts,\" the national group said in announcing a renewal of the NFL's multimillion-dollar grant in 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Florida helpline operators, who handled 33,000 calls and texts via 1-800-Gambler over a recent 36-month period, never collected that kind of data and pushed back on the changes, saying that additional friction on calls could result in hang-ups and untreated callers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This past May, the NCPG cut operators at the Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling out of the national system. The move was \"due to FCCG's lack of communication surrounding the Network Contact Center Standards,\" Jaime Costello, the NCPG official overseeing helpline operations, told the organization in an email viewed by Barron's. \"Because we are unable to verify whether or not FCCG meets the requirements, we were forced to reroute contacts,\" Costello wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Florida's removal ran counter to a recent audit conducted for the NCPG, which had lauded the Florida council's helpline operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On April 30, the Florida council answered a call to its helpline from a caller who identified herself as Julia seeking help for her gambling problem, according to a recording of the call reviewed by Barron's. After nearly a half-hour of the operator answering her questions and assembling a list of resources, Julia revealed that it had \"actually been a quality-assurance call paid for by the National Council on Problem Gambling.\" She praised the operator for his handling of their interaction. \"You did awesome,\" Julia said. \"You conducted this call in a manner that is high quality.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By the next day, the NCPG had begun rerouting helpline calls away from its Florida affiliate, according to an official familiar with the decision. Callers with a Florida area code were sent to a call center contracted by the NCPG where critics say disconnects and unreturned messages frequently occur.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Costello says the rerouting was about a lack of communication from the group. As for the audit, she says that \"one call does not signify consistent quality care.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Calls from New Mexico numbers saw a similar rerouting in May after the state's problem gambling council also resisted the NCPG's new data collection efforts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before the NCPG rerouted calls earlier this year, Kandace Blanchard, the New Mexico council's executive director, says her call center was picking up 1-800-Gambler calls from New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. Her operators developed long-term relationships, she says, with frequent callers looking to speak to the same person each time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Blanchard's helpline had also handled calls from the Navajo Nation, whose territory stretches across the New Mexico and Arizona border. She has Navajo-speaking counselors on-call 24/7. A 2014 study found that Native Americans experience more than double the rate of problem gambling compared with the broader U.S. population.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After the rerouting, some Navajo callers to 1-800-Gambler found that no one could understand them. On multiple occasions, Blanchard says, the NCPG's call center was forced to transfer a Navajo-speaker back to the New Mexico line in the middle of the night. The delay in service compromised care, Blanchard says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Costello says she was unaware of those instances. Her group offers interpretive services through a third party. Blanchard says she had flagged the issue to Costello and provided Barron's with emails that corroborate her claims.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During a meeting of the NCPG's helpline committee in May, the group's chair said the decision to reroute callers from Florida and New Mexico was made to ensure that they received a certain level of care. He added that the NCPG was \"trying to be discreet\" about the rerouting, according to a meeting attendee who spoke with Barron's.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The New Mexico and Florida councils \"refused to provide any documentation that they met any of our standards,\" Costello says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling declined to comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The dispute over 1-800-Gambler has brought a long-simmering debate to the forefront: whether to nationalize problem gambling treatment even as casinos face a patchwork of state regulations and rules.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the NFL donation supercharged 1-800-Gambler, problem gambling treatment remains fragmented. There are nearly two dozen state-specific numbers run by local advocacy groups like the New Mexico and Florida councils.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The NCPG and other nationally minded officials believe that gambling's omnipresence in popular culture requires a streamlined helpline system with one memorable number; state-based advocates say problem gambling treatment requires a regional approach tailored to the specific challenges of local communities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unification of the helpline system was a longtime goal for Keith Whyte, who spent 26 years as the executive director of the NCPG before he left in January to start a responsible gambling consultancy firm. \"It's an embarrassment in some ways that the field has not been able to unify behind a number,\" he says. The move to 1-800-Gambler was a crowning achievement for Whyte, but his national system has splintered in the months since he left the NCPG.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Last week, investment funds reduced their net position in the TTF gas futures market by 14 terawatt hours, indicating they expect lower prices ahead, DNB analysts say.

The adoption of the FSP is subject to the ratification of shareholders to be sought by way of ordinary resolution at a General Meeting (\"GM\") of the Company to be held at 111 Park Street, London W1K 7JF at 15:00 on Tuesday, 18 November 2025, notice of which will be mailed to shareholders today. If the resolution is not passed, the FSP will lapse, and the awards made will have no effect.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Background and Rationale</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company has adopted the FSP and the SOP to provide a framework to support the Company's recruitment, retention and incentivisation of highly qualified Directors, senior management and staff.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Subject to shareholder ratification of the FSP, the Company has made awards under the FSP to its two Executive Directors, Scott Gilbert and Geraldine Geraldo. The Company considers that the FSP provides a compelling structure to retain and incentivise the Executive Directors to deliver strong and sustained performance, material share price growth and substantial shareholder value over the long term.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company has adopted the SOP and made share option awards with a market value exercise price to its Executive Directors and other senior employees. Options with the same terms have been made to the Company's Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Directors as detailed below.  These awards have been made to support retention, incentivisation and alignment with shareholders over the long term.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In designing both the FSP and the SOP, the Company has taken independent advice from H2G Remuneration Advisory LLP, which benchmarked the plans against market comparators within the AIM energy and natural resources sector. The resulting structures are considered to be in line with prevailing market practice, in particular by ensuring that rewards are directly linked to value creation for all shareholders. The Company has also consulted with certain major shareholders in respect of both the FSP and the SOP.  This exercise provided valuable feedback which has been taken on board in finalising the terms of the FSP and the SOP.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company is also considering the establishment of an employee benefit trust, in due course, whereby shares may be purchased in the market to support options granted under the FSP and SOP, in order to limit shareholder dilution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pradeep Kabra, Corcel's Independent Non-Executive Chair, commented: \"These new incentive plans are designed to align our leadership team's interests directly with those of our shareholders. The Board believes these arrangements, developed with independent expert advice and reflecting feedback from major shareholders, provide an appropriate and competitive framework to retain and motivate our key executives as we pursue our growth objectives.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Key terms of the 2025 Founder Share Plan</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The FSP is a value creation plan based on delivering increased equity value over next three years above a share price of 0.34p per Corcel share (the \"Base Price\"), the price at which the Company last raised equity capital in July 2025 and yesterday's closing mid-market price. The FSP is intended to provide the potential for participants to be meaningfully rewarded for generating material shareholder value above the Base Price with the main parameters being that the rewards will amount to 10% of shareholder value created (increases share price together with any dividends and other distributions) over the next three years above a compounded annual return of 15%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The FSP will be performance tested and awards will vest based on the average share price over the final 20 dealing days of the three-year performance period, which commenced on the date the awards were made (the \"End Share Price\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Awards have been granted as units equally (50:50) to the Company's Executive Directors, Scott Gilbert and Geraldine Gerado. The value of the awards at the end of the three-year performance period will be delivered to the Executive Directors by the grant of nominal cost share options which will be exercisable up to 5 years from the adoption of the FSP.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The FSP is subject to an overall cap that the number of options issuable pursuant to the FSP will not exceed 8% of the shares in issue at the date of grant of the share options.
