            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Ashley Ogawa Clarke</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you work in a casual office you've probably seen them. You may own a pair. Like the devil, they go by many names: tech, athleisure, golf or performance pants. Typically snap-buttoned, flat-fronted and cut slim, they come in safe shades like chino-beige, gray and navy. All the athleisure brands sell them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tech pants offer the comfort of track pants, thanks to stretchy, mostly synthetic fabrics (usually a mix of polyester and elastane). When viewed from a distance — and with considerable squinting — they almost look sharp. In the era of relaxed corporate dress codes and athleisure everything, tech pants have become an It item for regular guys for work and play.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Andrew Weitz, founder of Beverly Hills style consultancy the Weitz Effect, put it this way: \"No matter whether you're the assistant, the CEO or Joe Schmoe,\" you're wearing tech pants. Turner Allen, a personal stylist in New York who works with tech guys, concurs. \"Most of my clients have some version of the ABC pant,\" he said, referring to Lululemon's famously comfy model: ABC stands for \"anti-ball-crushing.\" Lululemon says the $138 pants — made from polyester blends with nerdy-sounding names like \"Elastomultiester\" and \"Warpstreme\" — are among the brand's top-selling lines. Popular alternatives include Vuori's $128 Meta model and Rhone's $138 Commuter Pant. Costco's Kirkland Signature brand offers sub-$50 performance pants with four-way stretch.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The problem? Lots of people despise tech pants as uncool and artificial-looking — evidence that the athleisure trend has gone too far. In July, GQ declared: \"We must end the scourge of tech pants.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Attached to your tech pants and unwilling to retire them? On the hunt for an upgraded pair? No idea what tech pants were until just now? Read on for answers to burning questions about these stretchy specimens, including  styling tips to make them presentable, and strategies to avoid  looking like you're dressed for  a fencing match.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1. Why do so many men love these pants?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beyond praising their comfort, fans consider them unfussy and just sharp enough for many offices today. \"They don't wrinkle, stain or fade in the wash, and I don't need to have them dry cleaned,\" said Fred Cibelli, a principal at EY in New York who has worn tech pants since a friend recommended them during the pandemic. He owns them in navy, black, gray and, \"for the summer,\" cream. \"What more do you need?\" said the 48-year-old.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cibelli, a technology consultant focused on financial services, has no issues wearing tech pants to the office, even when meeting with clients. \"In my circles in New York, I don't see much of a backlash,\" he said, though he admitted he wouldn't wear them if he were a banker. Other guys save them for outside the office. Jason Hodes, a 50-year-old who works in the entertainment industry in New York, wears his Rhone pants to golf and travel. \"They're what I'll wear to replace a sweatpant,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2. That all sounds pretty good. So why the hate?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That GQ article called tech pants \"a damning symptom of our society's obsession with putting comfort and efficiency above all else.\" Other critics say that tech pants look weirdly smooth and shiny and, at their worst, like cheap, highly flammable leggings. \"Men love them and want to live in them. But I can tell you that their partners, both business and personal, have gotten sick of them,\" said Weitz. \"Guys who care about the way they present themselves want to move on\" from these pants.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Eugene Park, a 35-year-old marketing manager in Costa Mesa, Calif., used to own tech pants in multiple colors, but in the past year he has replaced them with what he calls \"real\" pants (trousers made from wool or cotton). \"Once you get more into fashion, you realize there are other good options out there,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>3. So...should I throw all my tech pants into a bonfire?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>No! The chemical fumes will choke you. In all seriousness, if you love your tech pants you can hold on to them. \"I don't think these pants are horrible to the point where I need to completely eliminate them from a client's closet,\" said Allen, speaking with the deadpan conviction of a pest exterminator. For him, \"the issue is when men begin to wear them in a very formal context.\" Avoid pairing them with a blazer and tie — and don't even think about wearing them to the wedding of anyone you consider a friend.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>4. Are any types of tech pants especially bad? What should I avoid?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Weitz recommends sticking to straight-leg versions — absolutely no skinny cuts (unless you plan to make leggings part of your office uniform). Park is wary of tapered cuts: Since they narrow at the calves and ankles, it \"looks like you're wearing clown shoes.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Check the fabric composition on tags before you buy. Allen recommends designs with only a small amount of elastane — say, 2% — so you get a bit of stretch but not \"that athletic sheen.\" Travis Ruttkamp, founder of Archer, a brand making elevated performance pants from merino blends, experimented with a number of fabrics before landing on his recipe. In his experience, when pants contain more than 3% elastane they can become clingy, bunch up and \"look sloppy.\" A high percentage of polyester, he said, can lead to a \"synthetic shine.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>5. Can you recommend any sharp tech pants?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sure. Archer's $298 Tropical Performance Trouser (TPT) is made from merino wool spiked with 1.5% Roica V550, an eco-friendly stretch yarn. That makes them breathable and a little stretchy, suitable for the golf course but also for even the strictest offices. \"I didn't want them to look at all like a tech pant,\" said Ruttkamp, who sought to make elevated trousers \"you'd still be able to squat in.\" Hodes, the entertainment-industry worker, owns a few pairs of TPTs. He finds them \"dressier and much more classic\" than regular tech pants.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other brands that should be on your radar: J. Hilburn, which offers custom-made wool-elastane pants for around $370; Nothings Something, maker of sharp, streamlined designs in black crepe; and Literary Sport, a cool sports label that sells suave, black track pants and other lounge-about designs (check out its Austin model).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Allen gets his tech pant-loving clients into slightly stretchy chinos. He likes the standard pleated chino from Alex Mill, 98% cotton with 2% elastane. With subtle pleats, they're an approachable option, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>6. I own a bunch of tech pants. How should I style them?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You can make them look cool,\" said Weitz. Keep the rest of the outfit relatively casual, he suggests. (Attempts to smarten up these pants with a sport coat won't fool anyone.) One neat option: Channel a Starship Enterprise commander and go uber-minimal in head-to-toe dark shades. For the office, Cibelli wears black or navy tech pants with matching simple, long-sleeved crewnecks from Theory and Saturdays NYC. \"It's clean and it's crisp,\" he said. Another fail-safe option for chill offices: a classic pinstripe shirt, a waffle-knit (or ribbed) crewneck sweater and loafers (see below). The sweater adds texture, which saves the outfit from reading eerily smooth, while the loafers stop it from registering as overly athleisure-y.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>7. I'm ready to ditch sporty pants and move onto 'real pants.' What are some great comfy options for a casual office?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you're doing away with stretch, Allen would go for pants with a relaxed fit that won't suffocate, such as the Hoche style by Officine Générale (available in fabrics such as 100% virgin wool). He praised its \"clean, tapered silhouette from the knee down.\" For a more voluminous, insouciant look, he called out the Justin, a $340 drapey dress pant from NN.07 with an easy-to-adjust back waist buckle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Park, who ended up selling his tech pants to his local Crossroads, has landed on a handful of cool alternatives. In casual settings he favors M43 cargo pants, a baggy style he picks up at flea markets or on eBay. Slightly sharper are his army fatigues from RRL and Japan's Orslow, which come in shades of green and khaki and are cut from robust cotton that softens over time. He finds them as comfy as tech pants — their wider cut gives his legs room to breathe — and much easier to style. \"They just look better.\"</span></p></span></div></div>",

Readers are cautioned that mineral resources are not mineral reserves and that the economic viability of resources that are not mineral reserves has not been demonstrated. The mineral resource estimates disclosed in this news release may be materially affected by geology, environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to an indicated or measured mineral resource category, however, it is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration. The mineral resource estimate is classified in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum's \"CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves\" incorporated by reference into NI 43-101. Under NI 43-101, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies or economic studies except for preliminary economic assessments. Readers are cautioned not to assume that further work on the stated resources will lead to mineral reserves that can be mined economically.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>SOURCE:</span></strong><span> McFarlane Lake Mining Limited</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire</span></p></span></div></div>",

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeOne Medicines Ltd. or Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.), the performance of Otezla(R) (apremilast), our acquisitions of ChemoCentryx, Inc. or Horizon Therapeutics plc (including the prospective performance and outlook of Horizon's business, performance and opportunities, and any potential strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities expected as a result of such acquisition), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems on our business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions, including those resulting from geopolitical relations and government actions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected. We may not be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our sustainability objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CONTACT: Amgen, Thousand Oaks</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Elissa Snook, 609-251-1407 (media)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Casey Capparelli, 805-447-1746 (investors)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amgen-announces-2025-fourth-quarter-dividend-302601323.html</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SOURCE Amgen</span></p></span></div></div>",

The decline was largely due to reduced income from discontinued operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>(Loss) Earnings from Continuing Operations Per Share, Basic and Diluted:</span></strong><span> The loss per share from continuing operations was ($0.02), down from $0.00 in the previous year.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Business Highlights</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Revenue Segments:</span></strong><span> For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, all revenues were generated by DLT Telecom, Inc.

Wall Street expects about $0.69 in earnings per share, roughly 43% below last year, on revenue of roughly $13.3 billion, up 19% YoY. The stock is up 55% so far this year, a sign of renewed confidence in the company's ability to scale profitably across both mobility and delivery.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the second quarter, Uber reported $12.7 billion in revenue, up 18% from a year ago, with gross bookings reaching $46.8 billion. Mobility revenue was up about 16%, while delivery grew close to 20%. Uber said it handled roughly 36 million trips a day. The results showed strong demand but also reminded investors that insurance costs, incentives, and unit economics remain significant factors. For this quarter, management guided for gross bookings between $48.25 to $49.75 billion, suggesting volume growth remains steady through the second half.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The spotlight this time is on execution and margin discipline. Investors will want to see that mobility profitability is holding steady and that delivery continues to build leverage after years of investment. Updates on freight restructuring, where performance has lagged, could also influence sentiment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The call could also bring new insight into Uber's capital allocation priorities. If the company reports solid bookings growth and shows cost control, the rally that pushed shares up this year could extend further. But if expenses creep higher or demand softens heading into 2026, investors might rethink how much efficiency is already priced in.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Lately, however, the approach hasn't delivered.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So far this year, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Quality ETF has returned 11.5%, far behind the broad market's 17% total return. Over the past five years, returns for quality stocks have lagged behind by about one percentage point a year, on average.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are plenty of theories about why quality has struggled. One is that the runaway performance of top tech names has made it difficult for any investing strategy that doesn't lean directly into artificial intelligence to keep up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another is gloomy consumer sentiment. Concern about people's willingness to spend, as well as shoppers actually tightening their belts, has weighed on blue-chip consumer stocks like Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca-Cola and Colgate-Palmolive. All three are otherwise known as reliable performers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a note Friday, Trivariate Research offered another theory. It argues that the underperformance results from new market dynamics tied to volatility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It has long been known that a big part of nearly every stock's returns is driven by the broad market's own ups and downs. The change Trivariate flagged is that the number of high-volatility stocks, which tend to move more dramatically than the market on any given day, has surged. At the same time, so has the number of stocks exhibiting below-average volatility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That leaves relatively few stocks in the middle, with average amounts of volatility, Trivariate says. While the dynamic hasn't necessarily hurt quality stocks, it has made it difficult for their strong fundamentals to shine through because so much of investors' recent returns have been driven by the market's overall direction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Quality matters less in the current market environment,\" writes Trivariate founder Adam S. Parker.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So should investors give up on the strategy? Not necessarily.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Quality's travails have been frustratingly persistent, stretching back to around 2020. But most investors' timelines are measured in decades, not years.

OPEC+ is widely expected to agree at the weekend to unwind another 137,000 barrels a day of output cuts in December, and analysts see additional OPEC barrels likely covering any loss of supply from U.S. sanctions against Russian oil companies. Reports that the U.S. is considering strikes against military targets in Venezuela gave prices a lift to end of the week, with WTI settling up 0.7% at $60.98 a barrel, and Brent up 0.1% at $65.07.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Audi's latest earnings call carried a sharper tone than usual. The Volkswagen AG subsidiary, home to the Audi, Lamborghini, Bentley, and Ducati brands, trimmed its full-year operating margin forecast to between 4% and 6%, down from as high as 7%. Chief Financial Officer Jurgen Rittersberger said tariffs alone could cost the group about 1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) this year, a figure that captures the dual strain of slowing global demand and rising trade friction. The move also follows Porsche's decision to scale back its EV pushsignaling that Volkswagen's luxury arm is bracing for a more defensive phase in its transition strategy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rittersberger called the environment very demanding, pointing to an uneven recovery across markets and persistent supply constraints. Audi's third-quarter operating margin stood at 2%, generating 280 million in profit, up from a small loss a year earlier tied to the Brussels factory closure. But headwinds remain: tariffs in the US, weaker momentum in China, and renewed pressure from semiconductor shortages, particularly after disruptions at Dutch chipmaker Nexperianow caught in geopolitical crossfire. Management said securing chip supplies and cutting costs will be critical to keeping its model rollout on track.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The tension is playing out across the broader EV sector. BYD's (BYDDF) earnings slump, Tesla </span><span>'s string of recalls, and Rivian's delayed financing all highlight how fragile profitability can be in a capital-intensive cycle. Audi is exploring production in the US to offset tariff exposure, with a final decision expected before year-end. For investors, the message is cautious but clear: this isn't about chasing volume anymoreit's about preserving margin, protecting brand equity, and surviving a high-stakes reset in the global luxury EV race.</span></p></span></div></div>",
