            "title": "Worksport Is \"Showing Its Work\" as 2026 Momentum Targets Record-Setting Performance",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>WEST SENECA, NY / ACCESS Newswire / February 27, 2026 / Projections often capture attention. Measurable progress builds confidence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At Worksport Ltd. (\"Worksport\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:WKSP), the sequence of developments extending back through Q4 2025 reflects the latter principle. This is not a company relying on narrative alone. It's increasingly demonstrating execution alongside opportunity. As 2026 begins, the emphasis is clear: documented milestones and operational advancement are taking precedence over distant ambition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That tone was established before the new year even turned. In December 2025, Worksport reported that November revenue marked the highest monthly total in Company history, creating a record baseline entering 2026. A single month does not define a trajectory, but it can reveal acceleration. When revenue peaks within a compressed timeframe, it often signals traction building beneath the surface, which can show up in broader quarterly performances.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Against that backdrop, the early 2026 announcements read less like routine updates and more like coordinated steps within a structured expansion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Growth Through Intention</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>On January 27, Worksport's subsidiary Terravis Energy selected a major Asian manufacturing partner for its Aetherlux heat pump platform with Zerofrost anti-frosting technology. The move was less about headlines and more about infrastructure. Clean energy hardware does not scale on concept alone. It requires supply chain alignment, cost discipline, and production readiness. By securing manufacturing capacity ahead of broader commercialization, Worksport signaled preparation and a willingness to lay foundational infrastructure before expanding market visibility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then, on February 3, the Company announced a strategic partnership with Potomac International Partners to accelerate federal government and commercial market engagement for its clean energy ecosystem. Federal procurement is structured, compliance-driven, and relationship-based. Rather than attempting to navigate that terrain independently, Worksport aligned with a partner designed to open institutional doors. The SOLIS solar system, COR portable energy platform, and Aetherlux heat pump technology are now positioned within structured procurement conversations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Momentum is far more compelling when numbers support it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Record-Setting Revenues Posted</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>On February 11, Worksport reported Q4 revenue growth of 65% year over year, with gross profit increasing 380%. Full-year revenue climbed 91% to approximately $16.2 million, and gross margins expanded into the low 30% range. Revenue growth draws attention. Margin expansion commands respect. Together, they indicate that scaling efforts are not occurring at the expense of discipline. In other words, operational leverage appears to be emerging alongside expansion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The next development added another layer. On February 12, Worksport confirmed that a government entity is evaluating its Aetherlux Pro heat pump, with AHRI and ENERGY STAR certification processes continuing to advance. Government evaluation is not casual engagement. It involves technical scrutiny, regulatory review, and structured assessment. While outcomes remain subject to process, the engagement itself signals that the technology is being tested within serious institutional channels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That momentum carried forward on February 19, when Worksport secured key certifications for its COR portable energy system, including transport and federal compliance approvals. The Company indicated that final UL and CSA certifications are expected within the first quarter of 2026. Those certifications are often prerequisites for large-scale retail and enterprise distribution, again showing that commercialization gates are being addressed in accretive sequence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Viewed collectively, the pattern becomes harder to dismiss. Revenue momentum. Manufacturing readiness. Federal channel access. Certification advancement. Margin expansion. These are not disconnected headlines. They represent synchronized movement across production, distribution, compliance, and financial performance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Worksport's broader 2026 business update reinforces that alignment. Management has stated that clean energy products are shipping, that OEM and major distribution discussions are progressing, and that growth is expected to continue in 2026 - language that reflects forward movement supported by visible operational steps.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Summing The Parts</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's also important to remember the foundation beneath this expansion. Worksport's core automotive accessory business, particularly tonneau covers, continues to contribute revenue stability. The SOLIS solar integration platform, COR portable energy system, and Aetherlux heat pump portfolio are not replacements. They are extensions. The Company is layering clean energy capabilities onto an existing operational base rather than attempting to build from scratch.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Market opportunity narratives, including references to multibillion-dollar industry segments, only carry weight when paired with tangible advancement. What distinguishes Worksport's current phase is that incremental barriers are being addressed methodically. Production alignment reduces supply risk. Certifications reduce compliance friction. Institutional evaluation adds credibility. Margin expansion suggests scalability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Taken together, the progression suggests coordination between strategy and execution. Moreover, Worksport's updates show it's not merely outlining where it intends to go in 2026. It's describing the intermediate steps designed to support that trajectory. For observers evaluating emerging clean energy participants within the small-cap landscape, the distinction between aspiration and implementation matters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As importantly, Worksport's first-quarter developments continue to reflect a company intent on showing its work as it provides answers to serve multiple market opportunities. In a market environment that increasingly values operational clarity and disciplined advancement, that distinction could prove meaningful.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Worksport</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Worksport Ltd. </span><span>, through its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, and owns the intellectual property on a variety of tonneau covers, solar integrations, portable power systems, and clean heating &amp; cooling solutions. Worksport has an active partnership with Hyundai for the SOLIS Solar cover. Additionally, Worksport's hard-folding cover, designed and manufactured in-house, is compatible with all major truck models and is gaining traction with newer truck makers including the electric vehicle (EV) sector. Worksport seeks to capitalize on the growing shift of consumer mindsets towards clean energy integrations with its proprietary solar solutions, mobile energy storage systems (ESS), and Cold-Climate Heat Pump (CCHP) technology.

This gave SPC a total of 13 CLNs at a nominal value of £3,250,000. Each tranche of loan notes has an initial term of 3 years from the date of the certificate being issued to the relevant noteholder.

This was proposed to the shareholders on 10 October 2025 and approved on 7 November 2025 as an event after the reporting date. Accordingly, the Board carried out a subdivision and reclassification of the existing and to be issued Ordinary Shares by 200:1 so that each Existing Ordinary Share would be subdivided and reclassified into one (1) new ordinary share of £0.000005 each (\"New Ordinary Share\") and (2) 3,999 deferred shares of £0.000005 each (\"Deferred Shares\") (\"Subdivision\"), followed by a consolidation of the New Ordinary Shares and Deferred Shares by 200 so that every 200 New Ordinary Shares and every 200 Deferred Shares will be consolidated into one New Ordinary Share and one Deferred Share of £0.001 each (\"Consolidation\", together with the Subdivision, \"Capital Reorganisation\"). The Deferred Shares have no right to vote or participate in the capital of the Company and the Company did not issue any certificates or credit CREST accounts in respect of them. The Deferred Shares were not admitted to trading on any exchange. The rights of the Ordinary Shares and the Deferred Shares are set out in the new articles of association proposed to be adopted by the Company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition to the above the Company sought approval to amend the articles of association.

The Deferred Shares will have no dividend or voting rights and, upon a return of capital, the right only to receive the amount paid up thereon after the holders of the Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company have received the aggregate amount paid up thereon. The Deferred Shares will not be traded on the Main Market or any other market, and no share certificates will be issued in respect of the Deferred Shares, nor will the CREST accounts of holders of New Ordinary Shares be credited with any Deferred Shares.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·      The Company will be able to hold general meetings and annual general meetings by means of electronic facility or facilities.

At any electronic general meeting, the Board may impose any necessary requirements or restrictions to verify the identity of those taking part and the security of the electronic communications.

Gross profit is an indication that the underlying business is profitable. This is because gross profit is turnover less any direct costs. With our new group formed we will look to grow turnover in the knowledge that it is profitable. We have achieved a 30% (2024: 25%) gross profit margin, which is healthy and a metric we will continue to target as PL grows. This approach will allow the business to grow and reinvest in itself or pay out to its shareholders in the longer term.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a Company that invests in companies, having direct access to capital via the ability to issue further CLN's/equity to our supportive substantial investor/ shareholder is invaluable to cover ongoing costs and also to be able to invest in new businesses. Investment opportunities can arise from anywhere and by having adequate access to funds, the Group is able to actively scour the market for these opportunities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the comparative period the Group, including discontinued operations, has pre-tax profits of £4.125 million, this is not a direct indication of performance due to the transactions undertaken in the year. The Group profit pre-tax takes into consideration of the unwinding of the loan outstanding to K2 from DI. As a result, there is a large finance income receivable, further details on the discontinued operations are documented in note 4. The Group continues to pivot the business to focus on a UK and European focus with retail footprint rather than manufacturing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We would hope to see improvements in these KPIs as we move forward.

In circumstances where the Company were to undertake a Reverse Takeover (or analogous transaction) requiring the eligibility of the Company to be re-assessed, the Company would be required to meet the minimum market capitalisation requirement of £30,000,000 to maintain its listing as well as satisfy the requirements of the Equity Shares (commercial companies) category of the new UK listing rules which came into effect on 29 July 2024. In the event that the Company is unable to satisfy these requirements, the Company would be unable to meet the eligibility requirements to maintain its listing and would be required to de-list, meaning the shareholders of the Company would hold shares in a non-trading public company (assuming it would be unable to secure a listing or quotation on another exchange).</span></p></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>iv.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Reliance on consistent supply</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>The beverage industry is dependent on prompt supply and quality transportation of beverage ingredients and finished goods.

This relates to the goodwill created on acquisition of PL. The reason for this impairment was the result of a poorer outlook on the revenue generation on the recently opened third store in Teddington within PL.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Convertible Loan Note Activity</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As set out in the prior year's report, the Company constituted a Loan Note Instrument on 15 August 2024 pursuant to which it may issue up to £50 million of convertible loan notes ('CLNs') in tranches of £250,000. The CLNs are unsecured, carry an interest rate of 6% per annum, and have an initial term of three years from the date of issue. During the year ended 31 October 2025, the following material CLN events occurred:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Repayment of £1,500,000: On 29 August 2025, the Company repaid CLNs to the value of £1,500,000 to Surich Real Estate Opportunity Fund SPC ('SPC'). The repayment was requested by SPC on the basis that the funds had not been fully deployed within the expected timeframe. The repayment was settled as to £1,491,731 in cash, with the remaining £8,269 added to the balance of the loan advance previously made by SPC in November 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Following the repayment, SPC held seven CLNs with an aggregate principal value of £1,750,000 under the Loan Note Instrument.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Continued related party position: SPC is wholly owned and controlled by Mr Ziwei Peng. Mr Peng is the owner and controller of Golden Nice International Group Limited, which holds a 24.55% interest in the issued share capital of the Company. Accordingly, all CLN transactions with SPC constitute related party transactions for the purposes of Rule 7.3 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After the reporting date events</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On 26 November 2025, the Company issued a further six CLNs of £250,000 each to SPC, raising an additional £1,500,000 under the Loan Note Instrument. The funds were received on 25 November 2025. The CLNs are convertible into new ordinary shares at a price of £8.00 per share (reflecting the post re-organisation share structure) and carry the same material terms as previously disclosed. The proceeds will be applied to working capital and capital expenditure requirements, as well as to support the Company's ongoing acquisition strategy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On 18 February 2026, the Company released an RNS to confirm that a number of CLNs that had expired during the year had been extended for 3 years and now have a maturity date of 31 March 2028.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Outlook</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group continues to actively seek strategic acquisitions within the food and beverage distribution and production sector in the United Kingdom and across Europe. We remain disciplined in our approach, ensuring that any prospective target presents an appropriate risk profile and capital structure before proceeding. The capital re-organisation completed in November 2025 positions the Company favourably for future fundraising initiatives, and the ongoing availability of the Loan Note Instrument provides a flexible source of funding should an appropriate opportunity present itself.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The shares in issue at the year-end were as follows:</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Total number of Ordinary Shares in issue and listed on 31 October 2024</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>77,388,855</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>No Ordinary Shares issued during the year</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>-</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Total number of Ordinary Shares in issue and listed on 31 October 2025</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>77,388,855</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><span>After the reporting date we completed a capital reorganisation and the issued shares is as follows:</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Total number of Ordinary Shares in issue and listed on 31 October 2025</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>77,388,855</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Number of Ordinary Shares issued during the year to ensure consolidation</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>145</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Total number of Ordinary Shares in issue and listed on 10 November 2025</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>77,389,000</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Consolidation ratio</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>200:1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>New Ordinary Shares in issue on 10 November 2025</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>389,945</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><span>The strategic focus for 2026 remains consistent with that of the prior year, centred on expanding the food and beverage business through acquisitions and joint ventures.

2025</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1.   General information</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Everest Global Plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. Details of the registered office, the officers and advisers to the Company are presented on the directors and professional advisers page at the back of this report (page 106). The Company is admitted to the Official List (by way of a Standard Listing under Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules) (subsequent to the year end the Company is admitted to the equity Shares (transition) category of the Official List) and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities. The information within these financial statements and accompanying notes has been prepared for the year ended 31 October 2025 with comparatives for the year ended 31 October 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2.   Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The consolidated financial statements of Everest Global Plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the United Kingdom (IFRS as adopted by the UK), IFRS Interpretations Committee and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in the Group's reporting currency of Pound Sterling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 3. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Although these estimates are based on management's experience and knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only that year or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>c.   Going concern</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These consolidated financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis. The going concern basis assumes that the Group will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Group has incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations as the Group pivoted to new opportunities during the year under review.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There remains an active and liquid market for the Group's shares.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As at 31 October 2025 the Group held £1,063,463 (2024: £279,725) in cash and cash equivalents.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Furthermore, the Group continues to seek further investment opportunities to develop its UK and European-focused food and beverage operations. It will be necessary to raise further funding to achieve these objectives. The Company has the ability to issue up to £50 million CLNs, of which the Company has issued £3.25 million of CLNs since this facility was agreed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts. These forecasts consider operating cash flows and capital expenditure requirements for the Company and PL, available working capital and forecast expenditure, including overheads and other costs. The Directors are of the opinion that the Group has sufficient working capital and that no additional funding is required. However, funding is being raised to provide adequate cash flow to cover the business for unforeseen costs that might occur.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After careful consideration of the matters set out above, the Directors are of the opinion that the Group will be able to undertake its planned activities for the period to 28 February 2027 from current cash and debtor positions and have prepared the consolidated financial statements on the going concern basis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>d.   New and amended standards adopted by the Company</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group has implemented IFRS as adopted by the UK. At the point of transition from IFRS as adopted by the EU the underlying requirements were identical. The following standards, amendments and interpretations are new and effective for the year ended 31 October 2025 and have been adopted. None of the IFRS standards below had a material impact on the financial statements.</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>IFRS S1</span></p></td><td rowspan=\"7\"><p class=\"\"><span>General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information</span></p></td><td rowspan=\"7\"><p class=\"\"><span>IFRS S1 sets out overall requirements for sustainability-related financial disclosures with the objective to require an entity to disclose information about its sustainability-related risks and opportunities that is useful to primary users of general-purpose financial reports in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>1 January 2024</span></p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>IFRS S2</span></p></td><td rowspan=\"5\"><p class=\"\"><span>Climate-related Disclosures</span></p></td><td rowspan=\"5\"><p class=\"\"><span>IFRS S2 sets out the requirements for identifying, measuring and disclosing information about climate-related risks and opportunities that is useful to primary users of general-purpose financial reports in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>1 January 2024</span></p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><span>The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued, but are not effective for the financial year beginning 1 November 2024 and have not been early adopted:</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>IFRS 18</span></p></td><td rowspan=\"4\"><p class=\"\"><span>Presentation and Disclosures in Financial Statements </span></p></td><td rowspan=\"4\"><p class=\"\"><span>IFRS 18 includes requirements for all entities applying IFRS for the presentation and disclosure of information in financial statements.</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>1 January 2027</span></p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><span>The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and the interpretations in future periods will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>e.   Basis of consolidation</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 October each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by other members of the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group's equity therein. Those interests of non-controlling shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests' share of subsequent changes in equity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Changes in the Group's ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group's interests and the non- controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Where certain assets of the subsidiary are measured at revalued amounts or fair values and the related cumulative gain or loss has been recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are accounted for as if the Company had directly disposed of the related assets (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings). The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IFRS 9 \"Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement\" or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a jointly controlled entity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Business combinations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment transactions of the acquiree or the replacement of an acquiree's share-based payment transactions with share-based payment transactions of the Group are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment at the acquisition date; and</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Goodwill</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Associates</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company's interest in an associate is carried in the statement of financial position at its share in the net assets of the associate together with goodwill paid on acquisition, less any impairment loss. When the share in the losses exceeds the carrying amount of an equity-accounted Company, the carrying amount is written down to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>f.    Property, plant &amp; equipment</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial year in which they are incurred. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to write of their cost over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>      Leasehold improvements                                                                                   33.33%</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>      Furniture, fixtures &amp; equipment                                                                           10.00% - 25.00%</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>      Plant &amp; machinery                                                                                             20.00% - 33.33%</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant asset and is recognised in profit or loss in the year in which the asset is derecognised.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>g.   Leased assets</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group leases various retail premises. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The right-of-use asset is depreciated over lease term on a straight-line basis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received any initial direct costs; and</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     restoration costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Payments associated with short term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise moving equipment rented on a day to day basis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>h.   Investments in subsidiaries</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>i.    Inventories</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost of completion and applicable selling expenses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When the inventories are sold, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense in the year in which the related revenue is recognised. The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventories are recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories is recognised as an expense in the year in which the reversal occurs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>j.    Impairment</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-derivative financial assets</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Credit-impaired financial assets</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt securities at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income ('FVTOCI') are credit-impaired. A financial asset is \"credit-impaired\" when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets have occurred.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A 12-month approach is followed in determining the Expected Credit Loss ('ECL').</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Presentation of allowance for ECL in the statement of financial position</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For debt securities at FVTOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income ('OCI').</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write-off</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. For corporate customers, the Group individually makes an assessment with respect to the timing and amount of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures of recovery of the amounts due.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>k.   Financial instruments</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories: loans and receivables and Fair Value through Profit and Loss ('FVTPL') and FVTOCI financial assets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the following category: other financial liabilities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>i.    Non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities - recognition and derecognition</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group initially recognises loans and receivables on the date when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred, or it neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control over the transferred asset. Any interest in such derecognised financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire. Gains or losses on derecognition of financial liabilities are recognised in profit or loss as a finance charge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ii.   Loans and receivables - measurement</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These assets are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>iii.  Assets at FVTOCI - measurement</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These assets are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses, are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the revaluation reserve.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When these assets are derecognised, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>iv.  Non-derivative financial liabilities - measurement</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other non-derivative financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>v.   Convertible loan notes and derivative financial instruments</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The presentation and measurement of loan notes for accounting purposes is governed by IAS 32 and IFRS 9. These standards require the loan notes to be separated into two components:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     a derivative liability; and</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     a debt host liability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is because the loan notes are convertible into an unknown number of shares, therefore failing the 'fixed-for- fixed' criterion under IAS 32. This requires the 'underlying option component' of the loan note to be valued first (as an embedded derivative), with the residual of the face value being allocated to the debt host liability (refer financial liabilities policy above).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Compound financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible notes denominated in British pounds that can be converted to ordinary shares at the option of the holder, when the number of shares to be issued is fixed and does not vary with changes in fair value.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The liability component of compound financial instruments is initially recognised at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option. The equity component is initially recognised at the difference between the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not remeasured.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interest related to the financial liability is recognised in profit or loss. On conversion at maturity, the financial liability is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss is recognised.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group's financial liabilities include amounts due to a director, trade payables and accrued liabilities. These financial liabilities are classified as FVTPL are stated at fair value with any gains or losses arising on re-</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>measurement recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities, including borrowings are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>l.    Borrowings</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Borrowings are presented as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the reporting period, in which case they are presented as non-current liabilities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs and subsequently carried for at amortised costs using the effective interest method. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in profit or loss over the year of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings which are due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period are included in current borrowings in the statement of financial position even though the original term was for a period longer than twelve months and an agreement to refinance, or to reschedule payments, on a long-term basis is completed after the reporting period and before the financial statements are authorised for issue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>m.  Revenue recognition</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Performance obligations and service recognition policies</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer.

However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset, if the asset is no-longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>p.   Taxation</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years, and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Current or deferred tax for the year is recognised in profit or loss, except when it relates to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the current and deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>q.   Cash &amp; cash equivalents</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, demand deposits with banks and other financial institutions, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, having been within three months of maturity at acquisition. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are also included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>r.    Provisions and contingencies</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors' best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the statement of financial position date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When the effect of discounting is material, the amount recognised for a provision is the present value at the reporting date of the future expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. The increase in the discounted present value amount arising from the passage of time is included in finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements. They are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. A contingent asset is not recognised in the financial statements but disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>s.   Share capital</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new ordinary shares are deducted against share capital and share premium.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>t.    Foreign currencies</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In preparing the financial statements of each individual Group entity, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of that entity (foreign currencies) are recorded in the respective functional currency (i.e. the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates) at the rates of exchanges prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At the end of the reporting year, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical costs in a foreign currency are not retranslated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on translation of monetary items, are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they arise. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non- monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the year except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains, and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in which cases, the exchange differences are also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the purposes of presenting the consolidated financial statements, assets and liabilities of the Group's foreign operations are translated from South African Rand into the presentation currency of the Group of Pound Sterling at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of the reporting year, and their income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the year, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that year, in which case, the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The principal exchange rates during the year are set out in the table below:</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p class=\"\"><span>Rate compared to £ (GBP)</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Foreign</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>currency</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>For the year ending</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>31 October 2025</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>For the year ending</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>31 October 2024</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>South African Rand</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>-</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>23.3074</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>US Dollar</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>1.3153</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>1.2990</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Hong Kong Dollar</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>10.2281</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>10.0944</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><span>u.   Employee benefits</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Salaries, annual bonuses, paid annual leave and the cost to the Group of non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in which employees of the Group render the associated services.

The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Executive Director who makes strategic decisions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>3.   Critical accounting estimates and judgements</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the application of the Group's accounting policies, which are described above, management is required to make estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and assumptions that had a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed below.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>a.   Share based payments</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The fair value of share-based payments recognised in the income statement is measured by use of the Black Scholes model, which considers conditions attached to the vesting and exercise of the equity instruments. The expected life used in the model is adjusted; based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The share price volatility percentage factor used in the calculation is based on management's best estimate of future share price behaviour based on past experience, future expectations and benchmarked against peer companies in the industry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>b.   Equity portion of convertible loan notes</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group provides for the equity portion of convertible loan notes by applying an estimated interest rate in determining the present values of the convertible loan notes and the interest payable thereon over the life of the convertible loan notes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>c.   Impairment of goodwill</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The group applies judgement in determining whether the carrying value of goodwill has any indication of impairment on an annual basis. Both external and internal factors are monitored for indications of impairment. When preforming the impairment review, management's approach for determining the recoverable amount of a subsidiary is based on the higher of value in use or fair value less cost to dispose. The value in use is compared with the carrying amount of the subsidiary.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>4.   Segmental reporting</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company operates in a single segment

Brazil and Paraguay are expected to follow soon, Von der Leyen said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, the agreement can only be fully concluded with consent from the European Parliament, the bloc's legislative arm. Lawmakers voted last month to demand a ruling on the legality of the Mercosur deal.

France--where farmers have long made their opposition to the deal known with high-profile protests and tractor rallies--is among the member states that have opposed the deal's ratification, pending new safeguards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Any boost to Europe's trade flows from the provisional application of the deal won't be immediate, economists at Dutch bank ING wrote in a recent note.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Most of the impact will probably materialise later than 2026 as tariffs will be phased out gradually,\" ING said. \"For now, the symbolic value of strategic independence and the signalling effect outweigh trade benefits.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Joshua Kirby at joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby</span></p></span></div></div>",

We expanded our addressable markets and validated technologies that position us at the center of next-generation satellite and private wireless connectivity. Throughout the year, we have made significant progress with our satellite and ground station partners and are now poised to deploy not only the satellites to replenish our existing constellation but also extend our reach with our third-generation system.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dr. Jacobs continued, \"As we enter 2026, we believe the momentum we have built gives us a strong foundation to scale. With replacement 2nd generation satellites rolling off the line, continued progress on key regulatory and network infrastructure initiatives, the commercial rollout of two-way IoT capabilities, and traction for XCOM RAN, we are moving decisively from groundwork to growth.

The increase in total revenue was due primarily to performance bonuses earned during the fourth quarter of 2025, as well as higher wholesale capacity services revenue resulting from additional service fees associated with the reimbursement of network-related costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Revenue was also impacted favorably by (1) an increase in Commercial IoT related revenue due to higher average subscribers and device sales, which was offset partially by a decline in Duplex and SPOT driven revenue due to subscriber churn; and (2) revenue recognized under our service agreement with Parsons Corporation as we moved beyond the proof of concept phase during 2025, which was offset by a decrease in revenue from XCOM RAN sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Loss from Operations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Loss from operations was $0.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to a loss from operations of $4.2 million during the prior year's fourth quarter. This improvement was due to higher revenue (as discussed above) offset partially by an increase in operating expenses (as discussed below).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the fourth quarter of 2025, higher cost of services, marketing, general and administrative (\"MG&amp;A\") expenses and cost of subscriber equipment sales were offset partially by lower stock-based compensation expenses. Higher cost of services resulted primarily from network operating costs to support the build out of our next-generation satellite and ground network infrastructure, a significant portion of which are reimbursed to us, and this consideration is recognized as revenue. Additionally, costs increased to support the development of XCOM RAN technology and new MSS products. MG&amp;A expense was higher than the prior year's fourth quarter due primarily to legal and professional fees.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The cost of subscriber equipment sales increased during the fourth quarter of 2025 due to higher hardware sales as well as $1.1 million in expense related to tariffs on equipment imported and re-exported to foreign subsidiaries. These tariffs were previously recorded as recoverable duty drawbacks but are no longer deemed probable of being refunded.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net Loss</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net loss was $11.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to net loss of $50.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. This improvement was due primarily to a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the paydown of the 2023 13% Notes recorded during the fourth quarter of 2024. Favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the remeasurement of intercompany balances as well as a non-cash gain on the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment of our derivative asset gain were offset by higher interest expense resulting from our recognition of non-cash imputed interest related to the 2024 Prepayment Agreement (as defined in our periodic reports).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA increased to $32.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to $30.4 million for the same period in 2024. This 7% increase was due to an increase in revenue of $10.8 million offset partially by a $8.8 million increase in operating expenses (excluding adjustments for non-cash or non-recurring items).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to \"Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ANNUAL FINANCIAL REVIEW</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Revenue</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total revenue was $273.0 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, including $257.3 million of service revenue and $15.7 million of revenue generated from subscriber equipment sales. Total revenue increased 9% from 2024, reaching a record high for the fourth consecutive year. This increase was due to higher service revenue and higher revenue from subscriber equipment sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Service revenue increased $19.6 million, or 8%, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024 due to increases in wholesale capacity services. Revenue from subscriber equipment sales increased $3.0 million, or 24%, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024 due to a higher volume of Commercial IoT device sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Income (Loss) from Operations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Income from operations was $7.4 million during 2025 compared to loss from operations of $0.9 million during 2024 due to higher revenue (as discussed above) offset partially by higher operating expenses (as discussed below).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Higher cost of services, MG&amp;A expense and cost of subscriber equipment sales were offset partially by lower stock-based compensation expenses. A non-cash loss on disposal of assets during the first quarter of 2025 also increased operating expenses. The drivers of higher cost of services, MG&amp;A expense and cost of subscriber equipment sales for the full year 2025 compared to 2024 are generally consistent with the quarterly increases noted above. Costs incurred to enhance and develop our XCOM RAN product and service offerings were also impacted by our recognition of certain non-cash amortized costs beginning in May 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Operating expenses were partially offset by employee retention credits received in 2025 as a result of our eligibility under the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act for 2021. The total credits of $3.9 million reduced operating expenses during 2025, of which $2.7 million was allocated to cost of services and $1.2 million was allocated to MG&amp;A expense, based on the employee costs incurred during the eligible period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net Loss</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net loss was $8.7 million for 2025 compared to $63.2 million for 2024. This improvement was due primarily to higher revenue (discussed above), net foreign currency gains due to the remeasurement of intercompany balances and non-cash gains on the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment of our derivative asset. This improvement was also due to a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the paydown of the 2023 13% Notes recorded during the fourth quarter of 2024. These favorable items were offset partially by higher operating expenses (discussed above) as well as higher interest expense resulting from our recognition of non-cash imputed interest related to the 2024 Prepayment Agreement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA was $136.1 million in 2025, reaching a record high for the Company and representing a margin of 50%. This increase from 2024 was due to a $22.6 million increase in total revenue (for reasons previously discussed), offset partially by a $21.9 million increase in operating expenses (excluding adjustments for non-cash or non-recurring items) primarily due to investment in growth opportunities. Specifically, while we continue to enhance and develop our XCOM RAN product and service offerings, we incur costs, primarily for personnel, in advance of significant revenue.

Cash and cash equivalents were also positively impacted by a $1.2 million change in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating cash flows during 2025 included $430.6 million received in connection with the Infrastructure Prepayment and other cash flows generated from the business.

These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words \"believe,\" \"project,\" \"might,\" \"could,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"strategy,\" \"plan,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"will be,\" \"will continue,\" \"will likely result,\" and similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause or contribute to such differences include, without limitation, those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as may be further updated by subsequent filings with the SEC. Further, new risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risk factors, nor can we accurately assess the ultimate impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this press release to reflect actual results, future events or circumstances or changes in our assumptions, business plans or other changes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This press release contains measures such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted free cash flow, which are not recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to amounts reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements are provided in this press release. For forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA margin, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable effort because estimating such GAAP measures and providing a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and requires a level of precision that is unavailable for these future periods and the information needed to reconcile these measures is dependent upon future events, many of which are outside of our control as described above. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures are estimated consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions.</span></p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><span>

=======    =======    =======    ======= </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>(1)    EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, </span><br/><span>       amortization, accretion and derivative (gains)/losses. Adjusted EBITDA </span><br/><span>       excludes non-cash compensation expense, reduction in the value of </span><br/><span>       assets, foreign exchange (gains)/losses, and certain other non-cash or </span><br/><span>       non-recurring charges as applicable. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to </span><br/><span>       manage the Company's business and to compare its results more closely </span><br/><span>       to the results of its peers. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not </span><br/><span>       represent and should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP </span><br/><span>       measurements, such as net loss. These terms, as defined by us, may not </span><br/><span>       be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The </span><br/><span>       Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measurement of its </span><br/><span>       operating performance. The Company believes it best reflects changes </span><br/><span>       across time in the Company's performance, including the effects of </span><br/><span>       pricing, cost control and other operational decisions. The Company's </span><br/><span>       management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the </span><br/><span>       preparation of its annual operating budget. The Company believes that </span><br/><span>       Adjusted EBITDA also is useful to investors because it is frequently </span><br/><span>       used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in </span><br/><span>       their evaluation of companies in similar industries. As indicated, </span><br/><span>       Adjusted EBITDA does not include interest expense on borrowed money or </span><br/><span>       depreciation expense on our capital assets or the payment of income </span><br/><span>       taxes, which are necessary elements of the Company's operations. </span><br/><span>       Because Adjusted EBITDA does not account for these expenses, its </span><br/><span>       utility as a measure of the Company's operating performance has </span><br/><span>       material limitations. Because of these limitations, the Company's </span><br/><span>       management does not view Adjusted EBITDA in isolation and also uses </span><br/><span>       other measurements, such as revenues and operating profit, to measure </span><br/><span>       operating performance. </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>(2)    In connection with the License Agreement with XCOM, the Company entered </span><br/><span>       into a Support Services Agreement (the \"SSA\"). Fees payable by </span><br/><span>       Globalstar pursuant to the SSA were paid in shares of its common stock </span><br/><span>       prior to its termination in 2025. Costs also include the non-cash </span><br/><span>       intangible asset technology amortization associated with the initial </span><br/><span>       purchase of certain intangible assets made in the form of Globalstar </span><br/><span>       common stock. </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>                         GLOBALSTAR, INC. </span><br/><span>              SCHEDULE OF SELECTED OPERATING METRICS </span><br/><span>         (In thousands, except subscriber and ARPU data) </span><br/><span>                            (unaudited) </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>                     Three Months Ended      Twelve Months Ended </span><br/><span>                        December 31,            December 31, </span><br/><span>                   ----------------------  ----------------------- </span><br/><span>                         2025      2024          2025       2024 </span><br/><span>                       --------   -------      --------   -------- </span><br/><span>Service revenue: </span><br/><span> Wholesale </span><br/><span>  capacity </span><br/><span>  services          $    46,291  $ 36,150   $   172,731  $ 145,299 </span><br/><span> Subscriber </span><br/><span> services </span><br/><span> Commercial IoT           6,765     6,442        27,263     26,245 </span><br/><span> SPOT                     9,264    10,074        37,311     41,140 </span><br/><span> Duplex                   3,383     4,481        15,238     20,156 </span><br/><span> Government and </span><br/><span>  other services          1,688       534         4,766      4,849 </span><br/><span>                       --------   -------      --------   -------- </span><br/><span> Total service </span><br/><span>  revenue                67,391    57,681       257,309    237,689 </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Subscriber </span><br/><span> equipment sales          4,570     3,496        15,677     12,660 </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Total revenue       $    71,961  $ 61,177   $   272,986  $ 250,349 </span><br/><span>                       ========   =======      ========   ======== </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Average Subscribers </span><br/><span> Commercial IoT         553,129   514,918       539,283    509,452 </span><br/><span> SPOT                   215,597   235,785       222,534    241,980 </span><br/><span> Duplex                  18,267    24,853        20,684     27,033 </span><br/><span> Other                      216       268           235        288 </span><br/><span>                       --------   -------      --------   -------- </span><br/><span> Total                  787,209   775,824       782,736    778,753 </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>ARPU (1) </span><br/><span> Commercial IoT     $      4.08  $   4.17   $      4.21  $    4.29 </span><br/><span> SPOT                     14.32     14.24         13.97      14.17 </span><br/><span> Duplex                   61.73     60.10         61.39      62.14 </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>(1)    ARPU measures service revenues per month divided by the average number </span><br/><span>       of subscribers during that month.
