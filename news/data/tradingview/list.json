As previously announced, TXNM Energy does not plan to issue 2026 earnings guidance during pendency of the proposed transaction with Blackstone Infrastructure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"PNM and TNMP continue to grow and we remain focused on meeting our customer needs across New Mexico and Texas, with TNMP supporting a 28% increase in system peak demand and PNM delivering 80% carbon free energy in 2025,\" said Don Tarry, President and CEO of TXNM Energy. \"Our proposed transaction with Blackstone Infrastructure will provide the necessary capital to support this growth and New Mexico's transition to clean energy. We look forward to bringing the benefits of this transaction to our customers and communities.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>TRANSACTION UPDATE</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On May 19, 2025, TXNM Energy announced an agreement under which affiliates of Blackstone Infrastructure will acquire the outstanding common stock of TXNM Energy for $61.25 per share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shareholders approved the proposed transaction on August 28, 2025. In February 2026, approval was received from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Public Utility Commission of Texas (\"PUCT\") approved a unanimous settlement agreement on the proposed transaction. Clearance has been received from the Federal Communications Commission and the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act has expired without any objections or concerns having been raised. Approvals continue to be pursued from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (\"NMPRC\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>TXNM Energy continues to anticipate that the closing of the acquisition will occur in the second half of 2026, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the remaining customary closing conditions, including among other things, receipt of other required state and federal regulatory approvals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>REGULATORY UPDATE</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On November 14, 2025, Texas New Mexico Power (\"TNMP\") filed a general rate proceeding with the PUCT requesting recovery of $2.8 billion of rate base as of June 30, 2025, a requested return on equity of 10.4%, and a 47.54% equity ratio. The TNMP base rate review also includes increases in operations and maintenance expenses that are not recovered through semi-annual Transmission Cost of Service (\"TCOS\") and Distribution Cost Recovery Factor (\"DCRF\") filings, excludes increases in interest expense resulting from refinancing of debt associated with the proposed Blackstone Infrastructure transaction, and requests recovery of $20.5 million associated with Hurricane Beryl restoration costs over a five-year period. If approved by the PUCT, the new rates are expected to become effective in mid-2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On December 29, 2025, Public Service Company of New Mexico (\"PNM\") filed an application with the NMPRC for approval of two economic development projects related to New Mexico Senate Bill 170 at an estimated cost of $165.5 million. Senate Bill 170 allows a utility to defer costs of economic development projects that serve sites certified by the New Mexico Economic Development Department.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On February 25, 2026, PNM filed an application with the NMPRC for approval of a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for a new 345 kV transmission line, existing station expansions, and a new substation at an estimated cost of $247 million. This project aims to enhance reliability and resilience in the Albuquerque area, facilitate the integration of renewable energy, and support economic development.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the fourth quarter of 2025, PNM initiated its 2026 Integrated Resource Plan (\"IRP\") process which will cover the 20-year planning period from 2026 through 2046. Consistent with historical practice, PNM is receiving public input from interested parties as part of this process. PNM expects to file its 2026 IRP with the NMPRC on or before September 1, 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>TNMP's second DCRF filing for 2025 was approved and implemented in the fourth quarter, providing recovery for $19 million of rate base.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SEGMENT REPORTING OF 2025 EARNINGS</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>PNM -- a vertically integrated electric utility in New Mexico with   distribution, transmission and generation assets.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>TNMP -- an electric transmission and distribution utility in Texas.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Corporate and Other -- reflects the TXNM Energy holding company and other   subsidiaries.

Readers are cautioned that all forward-looking statements are based upon current expectations and estimates and apply only as of the date of this report. TXNM, PNM, and TNMP assume no obligation to update this information. Because actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, TXNM, PNM, and TNMP caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. TXNM's, PNM's, and TNMP's business, financial condition, cash flow, and operating results are influenced by many factors, which are often beyond their control, that can cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. For a discussion of risk factors and other important factors affecting forward-looking statements, please see the Company's Form 10-K, Form 10-Q filings and the information included in the Company's Form 8-K's with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which factors are specifically incorporated by reference herein and the risks and uncertainties related to the proposed transaction with Blackstone Infrastructure, including, but not limited to: the expected timing and likelihood of completion of the pending transaction, including the timing, receipt and terms and conditions of any required governmental and regulatory approvals of the pending transaction that could reduce anticipated benefits or cause the parties to abandon the transaction, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the transaction agreement, including in circumstances requiring TXNM Energy to pay a termination fee, the risk that the parties may not be able to satisfy the conditions to the proposed transaction in a timely manner or at all, the outcome of legal proceedings that may be instituted against TXNM Energy, its directors and others related to the proposed transaction, risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction, the risk that the proposed transaction and its announcement could have an adverse effect on the ability of TXNM Energy to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with its customers and suppliers, and on its operating results and businesses generally, the amount of costs, fees, charges or expenses resulting from the proposed transaction, and the risk that the price of TXNM Energy's common stock may fluctuate during the pendency of the proposed transaction and may decline significantly if the proposed transaction is not completed. Other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this communication could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. Ongoing earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of net unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on economic hedges, the net change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, pension expense related to previously disposed of gas distribution business, and certain non-recurring, infrequent, and other items that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Company's operations. The Company uses ongoing earnings and ongoing earnings per diluted share to evaluate the operations of the Company and to establish goals, including those used for certain aspects of incentive compensation, for management and employees. While the Company believes these financial measures are appropriate and useful for investors, they are not measures presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not intend for these measures, or any piece of these measures, to represent any financial measure as defined by GAAP. Furthermore, the Company's calculations of these measures as presented may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company uses ongoing earnings guidance to provide investors with management's expectations of ongoing financial performance over the period presented. While the Company believes ongoing earnings guidance is an appropriate measure, it is not a measure presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not intend for ongoing earnings guidance to represent an expectation of net earnings as defined by GAAP. Since the future differences between GAAP and ongoing earnings are frequently outside the control of the Company, management is generally not able to estimate the impact of the reconciling items between forecasted GAAP net earnings and ongoing earnings guidance, nor their probable impact on GAAP net earnings without unreasonable effort, therefore, management is generally not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for ongoing earnings guidance. Reconciliations between GAAP and ongoing earnings are contained in schedules 1-4.</span></p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><span> </span><br/><span>

This measure reflects the economics of each refinery exclusive of the   financial impact of inventory price risk mitigation programs and   marketing uplift strategies;   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Refining production margin per throughput barrel - calculated as   refining production margin divided by our average refining throughput in   barrels per day (excluding purchased barrels) multiplied by 1,000 and   multiplied by the number of days in the period; and   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Net debt - calculated as long-term debt including both current and   non-current portions (the most comparable GAAP measure) less cash and   cash equivalents as of a specific balance sheet date. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>We believe these non-GAAP operational and financial measures are useful to investors, lenders, ratings agencies and analysts to assess our ongoing performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable GAAP financial measure, they provide improved relevant comparability between periods, to peers or to market metrics through the inclusion of retroactive regulatory or other adjustments as if they had occurred in the prior periods they relate to, or through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying results and trends. \"Net debt,\" also a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Additionally, because Adjusted net income or loss, Adjusted net income or loss per share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Refining Margin and Refining Production Margin or any of our other identified non-GAAP measures may be defined differently by other companies in its industry, Delek US' definition may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

class=\"\"><span>Restructuring Costs</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2022, we announced that we are progressing a business transformation focused on enterprise-wide opportunities to improve the efficiency of our cost structure. For the fourth quarter 2025, we recorded restructuring costs totaling $18.8 million ($14.6 million after-tax) associated with our business transformation. Restructuring costs of $10.4 million are recorded in general and administrative expenses, $5.7 million are included in operating expenses, and $2.7 million are included in other operating (income) and expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>General and Administrative Expenses</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Excluding transaction costs and restructuring costs, general and administrative expenses were $43.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Citi Inventory Intermediation Agreement Amendment</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the fourth quarter, we amended the Inventory Intermediation Agreement, further reducing interest expense and other associated fees while increasing our flexibility on liquidity and inventory financing options for all refineries associated with the Inventory Intermediation Agreement. We exercised optionality to exclude certain volumes related to the agreement and our obligation under the agreement was reduced by $289.2 million between December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other Inventory Impact</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Other inventory impact\" is primarily calculated by multiplying the number of barrels sold during the period by the difference between current period weighted average purchase cost per barrel directly related to our refineries and per barrel cost of materials and other for the period recognized on a first-in, first-out basis directly related to our refineries. It assumes no beginning or ending inventory, so that the current period average purchase cost per barrel is a reasonable estimate of our market purchase cost for the current period, without giving effect to any build or draw on beginning inventory. These amounts are based on management estimates using a methodology including these assumptions. However, this analysis provides management with a means to compare hypothetical refining margins to current period average crack spreads, as well as provides a means to better compare our results to peers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Small Refinery Exemptions</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In August of 2025, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") announced its decisions on the backlog of 175 Small Refinery Exemption (\"SRE\") petitions from refineries seeking an exemption from their Renewable Fuel Standard obligations. Delek fully complied with Renewable Identification Number (\"RIN\") obligations for all years, incurring significant costs to finance our compliance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>EPA granted Delek full and partial exemptions for substantially all of our 20 petitions for the 2019-2024 calendar years. Because RINs are valid for a one-year period, a majority of the refunded RINs were expired and therefore had no value, and are the subject of ongoing litigation. The RINs received from prior year SREs resulted in a reduction of our Consolidated Net RIN Obligation and therefore a reduction within cost of materials and other of approximately $75.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Intercompany Leases</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a result of amendments to intercompany lease agreements in August 2024, we had to reassess lease classification for the agreements that contain leases under Accounting Standards Codification 842. As a result of these lease assessments, certain of these agreements met the criteria to be accounted for as sales-type leases for Delek Logistics and finance leases for the Refining segment. Therefore, portions of the minimum volume commitments under these agreements subject to sales-type lease accounting are recorded as interest income with the remaining amounts recorded as a reduction in net investment in leases. Prior to the amendments, these agreements were accounted for as operating leases and these minimum volume commitments were recorded as revenues in the Logistics segment. Similarly, these minimum volume commitments were previously recorded as costs of sales for the Refining segment, as the underlying lease was reclassified from an operating lease to a finance lease, and these payments are now recorded as interest expense and reductions in the lease liability. These accounting changes have no impact to the Delek US consolidated results as these amounts eliminate in consolidation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Subsequent Events - Transactions with Delek Logistics</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In January 2026, we entered into asset purchase agreements with Delek Logistics, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire a Tyler refinery tank for total consideration of $19.0 million and El Dorado tank and terminal assets for total consideration of $66.0 million. The Tyler Tank Purchase and the El Dorado Terminal Purchase are expected to close on April 1, 2026 and October 1, 2027, respectively.</span></p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\"

However, based on our history of being granted the exemptions </span><br/><span>     and expected future activity, we have adjusted the non-GAAP measure to </span><br/><span>     include the benefit of receiving exemptions equal to approximately 50% of </span><br/><span>     our recorded current-period obligation. </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Reconciliation of Income

Quarter Impacting Results\" section. </span><br/><span>(2)  Starting with the quarter ended March 31, 2025, we updated our non-GAAP </span><br/><span>     financial measures to include the impact of fair value adjustments to the </span><br/><span>     net RINs obligation under the EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard to reflect </span><br/><span>     the period end market price of the underlying RINs. The impact to </span><br/><span>     historical non-GAAP financial measures is immaterial. </span><br/><span>(3)  During the second quarter 2024, we realigned our reportable segments for </span><br/><span>     financial reporting purposes to reflect changes in the manner in which </span><br/><span>     our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, assesses financial </span><br/><span>     information for decision-making purposes. The change represents reporting </span><br/><span>     the operating results of our 50% interest in a joint venture that owns </span><br/><span>     asphalt terminals located in the southwestern region of the U.S. within </span><br/><span>     the refining segment. Prior to this change, these operating results were </span><br/><span>     reported as part of corporate, other and eliminations. While this </span><br/><span>     reporting change did not change our consolidated results, segment data </span><br/><span>     for previous years has been restated and is consistent with the current </span><br/><span>     year presentation. </span><br/><span>(4)  Starting with the quarter ended June 30, 2025, we updated our non-GAAP </span><br/><span>     financial measures to include the impact of the DPG inventory for price </span><br/><span>     and volume inventory impacts. The impact to historical non-GAAP financial </span><br/><span>     measures is immaterial. </span><br/><span>(5)  Starting with the quarter ended September 30, 2025, we have updated our </span><br/><span>     non-GAAP financial measures to include the benefit related to small </span><br/><span>     refinery exemptions expected to be received specific to the current year </span><br/><span>     obligation based on current laws and regulations. Consistent with our </span><br/><span>     historical accounting practice, we have recorded the full amount of our </span><br/><span>     Consolidated Net RINs Obligation assuming no future exemptions are </span><br/><span>     granted. However, based on our history of being granted the exemptions </span><br/><span>     and expected future activity, we have adjusted the non-GAAP measure to </span><br/><span>     include the benefit of receiving exemptions equal to approximately 50% of </span><br/><span>     our recorded current-period obligation. </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>

We also made meaningful progress advancing sour gas gathering and acid gas injection capabilities, while achieving record crude gathering volumes in our Delaware Basin operations.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Based on this strong momentum, we are providing 2026 EBITDA guidance of $520 to $560 million, which includes $10 million in negative impact from Winter Storm Fern in the first quarter. In addition, we are proud to have delivered our 52nd consecutive quarterly distribution, marking 13 consecutive years of distribution growth,\" Soreq continued. \"Looking ahead to 2026, we are increasingly optimistic about the opportunities in front of us, driven by the continued advancement of our integrated acid gas injection and sour gas treating solution at the Libby Complex. This industry leading sour gas solution will set DKL for multi year growth in the Delaware Basin and allow it to further expand its \"Full-Suite\" strategy. We remain committed to strengthening and growing Delek Logistics through a prudent management of liquidity and leverage, and a continued focus on long-term value creation for our unitholders,\" Mr. Soreq continued.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Delek Logistics reported fourth quarter 2025 net income of $47.3 million or $0.88 per diluted common limited partner unit.

Statements concerning current estimates, expectations and projections about future results, performance, prospects, opportunities, plans, actions and events and other statements, concerns or matters that are not historical facts are \"forward-looking statements,\" as that term is defined under the federal securities laws. These statements contain words such as \"possible,\" \"believe,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"predict,\" \"plan,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"anticipate,\" \"will,\" \"if,\" \"expect\" or similar expressions, as well as statements in the future tense. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, anticipated performance and financial position; statements regarding future growth at Delek Logistics; distributions and the amounts and timing thereof; potential dropdown inventory; projected benefits of the Delaware Gathering, Permian Gathering, H2O Midstream and Gravity Water Midstream acquisitions; expected earnings or returns from joint ventures or other acquisitions; expansion projects; ability to create long-term value for our unit holders; financial flexibility and borrowing capacity; and distribution growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors are cautioned that the following important factors, including among others, may affect these forward-looking statements: the fact that a significant portion of Delek Logistics' revenue is derived from Delek US, thereby subjecting us to Delek US' business risks; political or regulatory developments, including tariffs, taxes and changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, refined products or renewables; risks and costs relating to the age and operational hazards of our assets including, without limitation, costs, penalties, regulatory or legal actions and other effects related to releases, spills and other hazards inherent in transporting and storing crude oil and intermediate and finished petroleum products; Delek Logistics' ability to realize cost reductions; the impact of adverse market conditions affecting the utilization of Delek Logistics' assets and business performance, including margins generated by its wholesale fuel business; risks and uncertainties with respect to the possible benefits of the Delaware Gathering, Permian Gathering, H2O Midstream and Gravity transactions, as well as from integration post-closing; risks related to exposure to Permian Basin crude oil, such as supply, pricing, gathering, production and transportation capacity; uncertainties regarding actions by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producing countries impacting crude oil production and pricing; an inability of Delek US to grow as expected as it relates to our potential future growth opportunities, including dropdowns, and other potential benefits; projected capital expenditures; scheduled turnaround activity; the results of our investments in joint ventures; and other risks as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or management's good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Delek Logistics undertakes no obligation to update or revise any such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur, or which Delek Logistics becomes aware of, after the date hereof, except as required by applicable law or regulation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DPG Drop</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On May 1, 2025, Delek Holdings transferred the Delek Permian Gathering purchasing and blending business to Delek Logistics (the \"DPG Dropdown\"). In connection with the DPG Dropdown, Delek Logistics assumed all of Delek Holdings' rights and obligations to purchase crude oil under certain contracts associated with Delek Logistics' existing Midland Gathering System. In addition, line fill inventory amounting to $6.9 million was transferred to Delek Logistics. Total consideration included the cancellation of $58.8 million in existing receivables owed to Delek Logistics by Delek Holdings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sales-Type Leases</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the third quarter of 2024, Delek Logistics and Delek US renewed and amended certain commercial agreements. These amendments required the embedded leases within these agreements to be reassessed under Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases. As a result of these amendments, certain of these agreements met the criteria to be accounted for as sales-type leases. Therefore, portions of our payments received for minimum volume commitments under agreements subject to sales-type lease accounting are recorded as interest income with the remaining amounts recorded as a reduction in net investment in leases. Prior to the amendments, these agreements were accounted for as operating leases and these minimum volume commitments were recorded as revenues.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-GAAP Disclosures</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our management uses certain \"non-GAAP\" operational measures to evaluate our operating segment performance and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate past performance and prospects for the future to supplement our financial information presented in accordance with United States (\"U.S.\") Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). These financial and operational non-GAAP measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization   (\"EBITDA\") - calculated as net income before interest, income taxes,   depreciation and amortization, including amortization of customer   contract intangible assets, which is included as a component of net   revenues, and proportional interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization   of equity method investments.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA - EBITDA adjusted for (i) significant, infrequently   occurring transaction costs and (ii) throughput and storage fees   associated with the lease component of commercial agreements subject to   sales-type lease accounting.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Distributable cash flow - calculated as net cash flow from operating   activities adjusted for changes in assets and liabilities, maintenance   capital expenditures net of reimbursements, sales-type lease receipts,   net of income recognized and other adjustments not expected to settle in   cash.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Distributable cash flow, as adjusted - calculated as distributable cash   flow adjusted to exclude significant, infrequently occurring transaction   costs. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distributable cash flow, as adjusted, measures are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Delek Logistics' operating performance as compared to other publicly   traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to   historical cost basis or, in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA,   financing methods;   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make   distributions to our unitholders on a current and on-going basis;   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Delek Logistics' ability to incur and service debt and fund capital   expenditures; and   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects   and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provide information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations and assists in evaluating our ongoing operating performance and liquidity for current and comparative periods. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings, net cash provided by operating activities and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Additionally, because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distributable cash flow, as adjusted may be defined differently by other partnerships in our industry, our definitions may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other partnerships, thereby diminishing their utility. See the accompanying tables in this earnings release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. However, due to the inherent difficulty and impracticability of estimating certain amounts required by U.S. GAAP with a reasonable degree of certainty at this time without unreasonable effort and imprecision, we have not provided a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA guidance.</span></p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><span>

In 2025, </span><br/><span>      restructuring and other impairment charges primarily </span><br/><span>      stemmed from the Bank's ongoing efforts to streamline </span><br/><span>      its technology infrastructure and organizational structure, </span><br/><span>      as well as from revised estimates related to lease </span><br/><span>      contracts for corporate office premises.

Laurentian Bank and National Bank also entered into a definitive agreement in respect of the sale to National Bank of Laurentian Bank's syndicated loan portfolio (the \"Syndicated Loan Transaction\" and, collectively with the Retail/SME Transaction, the \"National Bank Transactions\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In parallel, Fairstone Bank of Canada entered into a definitive agreement (the \"Acquisition Transaction Agreement\") to acquire all issued and outstanding common shares of Laurentian Bank (the \"Laurentian Bank Shares\") (the \"Acquisition Transaction\" and, collectively with the Retail/SME Transaction, the \"Transactions\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Refer to the Business Highlights section in the Bank's First Quarter 2026 Report to Shareholders, including the MD&amp;A for the period ended January 31, 2026, for additional information about the Transactions and the Syndicated Loan Transaction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Summary of latest transaction developments</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On January 12, 2026, Laurentian Bank announced that it had filed its management proxy circular (the \"Circular\") and related materials in connection with a special meeting of Laurentian Bank Shareholders (the \"Meeting\"). The Circular provides details regarding the proposed Acquisition Transaction, including the background and rationale for the Acquisition Transaction, voting information, and the matters to be considered at the Meeting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On February 5, 2026, at the Meeting, the common shareholders of the Bank voted in favour of the Acquisition Transaction pursuant to which Fairstone Bank of Canada will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Bank. The special resolution requiring approval by at least 66(2/3) % of the votes cast was obtained, with 98.8% of votes cast in favour. Assuming the timely receipt of all required key regulatory approvals, and the satisfaction of other closing conditions, the Transactions are expected to close by late 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On February 17, 2026, the Bank completed the sale of its syndicated loan portfolio to National Bank of Canada (the Syndicated Loan Transaction). The outstanding principal balance of the syndicated loans was approximately $705 million as at closing. Certain liabilities were also assumed by National Bank. The cash consideration received at closing by Laurentian Bank was $646 million, subject to customary post--closing adjustments, and reflected a discount of $50 million to the outstanding balance of the syndicated loans. In the second quarter of 2026, the Bank will record a loss of approximately $20 million before taxes ($15 million after taxes) on the Syndicated Loan Transaction, reflecting the aforementioned discount and the impact of reversing previously recognized allowances for credit losses. The closing of the Syndicated Loan Transaction was not conditional upon the closing of the Retail/SME Transaction or the Acquisition Transaction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consolidated Results</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Three months ended January 31, 2026 financial performance A net loss of $20.5 million and a diluted loss per share of $0.58 were recorded for the first quarter of 2026, compared with net income of $38.6 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.76 for the first quarter of 2025. Of note, reported results for the first quarter of 2026 included restructuring and other impairment charges of $61.2 million ($45.0 million after income taxes), or $0.89 per share, related the Bank's strategic shift to a specialty commercial bank, resulting in its exit from the retail and SME banking business. Reported results also included transaction and conversion costs of $11.0 million ($8.1 million after income taxes), or $0.18 per share, related to the Transactions announced on December 2, 2025 (defined below). Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures section and to the Business Highlights section on pages 8 to 10 of the Bank's MD&amp;A for additional information. Adjusted net income was $34.2 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.65 for the first quarter of 2026, compared with $39.4 million and $0.78 for the first quarter of 2025. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures section for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total revenue</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total revenue increased by $1.9 million to $251.6 million for the first quarter of 2026, compared with $249.6 million for the first quarter of 2025, attributable to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in other income, as detailed below.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net interest income increased by $8.7 million or 5% to $194.9 million for the first quarter of 2026, compared with $186.2 million for the first quarter of 2025. This growth was mainly due to favourable loan repayments and shifts in the Bank's business mix. The net interest margin was 1.89% for the first quarter of 2026, an increase of 4 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2025, primarily for the same underlying reasons.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other income decreased by $6.7 million to $56.7 million for the first quarter of 2026, compared with $63.4 million for the first quarter of 2025. Of note, reported other income for the first quarter of 2025 included a $0.9 million profit from the sale of assets under administration of LBS' discount brokerage division. The decrease in other income for the quarter was primarily driven by lower income from financial instruments compared with the first quarter of 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Provision for credit losses</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The provision for credit losses was $16.5 million for the first quarter of 2026, compared with $15.2 million for the first quarter of 2025, representing an increase of $1.3 million. This increase primarily reflects higher provisions on performing loans driven principally by increased volumes and lower releases, partially offset by lower provisions on impaired loans. The provision for credit losses as a percentage of average loans, including those classified as assets held for sale, was 18 basis points for the quarter, compared with 17 basis points for the same quarter one year ago. Refer to the \"Credit risk management\" section on pages 17 to 19 of the Bank's MD&amp;A and to Note 5 to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on provision for credit losses and allowances for credit losses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-interest expenses</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-interest expenses amounted to $267.4 million for the first quarter of 2026, an increase of $80.4 million compared with the first quarter of 2025. Adjusted non-interest expenses increased by $8.0 million or 4% to $192.9 million for the first quarter of 2026, compared with $184.9 million for the first quarter of 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Salaries and employee benefits amounted to $102.7 million for the first quarter of 2026, an increase of $5.8 million compared with the first quarter of 2025. The increase mainly reflects regular annual salary increases, as well as higher employer--related contributions and benefit costs. The Bank also recorded a net loss of $2.2 million related to the settlement of certain pension plans resulting from an annuity purchase. Refer to the Business Highlights section on pages 8 to 10 of the Bank's MD&amp;A and to Note 12 of the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details concerning the annuity purchase transaction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Premises and technology costs were $55.0 million for the first quarter of 2026, an increase of $4.1 million compared with the first quarter of 2025. The increase mainly reflects higher IT--related costs, driven by continued investment in strategic technology initiatives and increased amortization from completed technology projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Impairment and restructuring charges were $61.2 million for the first quarter of 2026, compared with $2.0 million for the first quarter of 2025. In the first quarter of 2026, charges recorded result from the Bank's strategic shift to a specialty commercial bank and its exit from the retail and SME banking businesses. The charges primarily reflected the impairment of right--of--use assets and leasehold improvements affected by the exit of related activities, provisions for onerous contracts and unavoidable costs under contractual arrangements linked to the retail and SME operations, severance and employee benefit costs associated with anticipated workforce reductions, and the impairment and accelerated amortization of software and other intangible assets. Refer to the Business Highlights section on pages 8 to 10 of the Bank's MD&amp;A and to Note 17 of the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. In the first quarter of 2025, the Bank recorded restructuring charges of $2.0 million related to the streamlining of its technology infrastructure and organizational structure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Transaction and conversion costs amounted to $11.0 million for the first quarter of 2026. In connection with the Transactions announced on December 2, 2025, the Bank recognized transaction and conversion costs that are attributable to the successful completion of the Transactions. These costs primarily relate to legal fees, professional fees and other incremental expenditures incurred as a direct result of the Transactions. Costs that are conditional upon the closing of the Transactions will be recognized as they are incurred in subsequent periods. No such costs were recognized in the first quarter of 2025. Refer to the Business Highlights section on pages 8 to 10 of the Bank's MD&amp;A and to Note 17 of the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other non-interest expenses were $37.4 million for the first quarter of 2026, mainly unchanged compared with the first quarter of 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Efficiency ratio</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The efficiency ratio on a reported basis increased to 106.3% for the first quarter of 2026, compared with 74.9% for the first quarter of 2025. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the impairment and restructuring charges recognized in the quarter, as well as transactions and conversion costs. The adjusted efficiency ratio increased to 76.7% for the first quarter of 2026, compared with 74.3% for the first quarter of 2025, for reasons outlined in the analysis above.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Income taxes</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the first quarter of 2026, the income tax recovery was $11.8 million, and the effective income tax rate was 36.6%. The higher effective income tax rate compared to the statutory income tax rate reflects the impact of the loss recorded for the quarter and was essentially attributed to a lower taxation level on income from foreign operations. For the first quarter of 2025, the income tax expense was $8.9 million, and the effective income tax rate was 18.7%. The lower effective income tax rate compared to the statutory income tax rate was essentially attributed to a lower taxation level on income from foreign operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financial Condition</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As at January 31, 2026, total assets amounted to $49.9 billion, compared with $50.1 billion as at October 31, 2025, with the modest decrease primarily attributable to lower liquid assets, partially offset by higher loans including those classified as assets held for sale.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Liquid assets</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As at January 31, 2026, liquid assets as presented on the balance sheet amounted to $12.4 billion, a decrease of $0.7 billion compared with $13.1 billion as at October 31, 2025.

Total commercial loans amounted to $18.6 billion as at January 31, 2026, an increase of $0.7 billion or 4% since October 31, 2025 resulting from our key growth engines, namely commercial real estate, inventory financing and equipment financing. Total personal loans amounted to $2.0 billion as at January 31, 2026, relatively unchanged from October 31, 2025. Total residential mortgage loans amounted to $15.8 billion as at January 31, 2026, a decrease of $0.3 billion or 2% from October 31, 2025, mainly due to easing housing market activity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Assets held for sale Assets held for sale amounted to $4.7 billion as at January 31, 2026, with no such balance recognized as at October 31, 2025.
