LeBlanc cited, for instance, talks last fall between Ottawa and Washington to ease tariffs on key sectors like steel, aluminum and automobiles, which President Trump later terminated due to anger over a Canadian ad that questioned the use of tariffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LeBlanc said Canada wants the U.S. to recommit to a trilateral trade pact. Furthermore, he added, \"there have always been bilateral arrangements as between the three countries. That's not new… [And] we need to get a bilateral deal with the United States to take pressure off the sectoral tariffs.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The sectoral tariffs, of up to 50%, have squeezed Canada's manufacturing sector. Nonfarm payrolls data issued Thursday indicated that factories shed workers in December, for a year-over-year decline of 2.6%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LeBlanc said he expects to meet U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in the coming days. Greer told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. on Tuesday that Canada will have to live with U.S. tariffs as part of a revised USMCA.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If Canada wants to agree that we can have some level of higher tariff on them while they open up their markets to us on things like dairy and other things, then that's a helpful conversation,\" Greer said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earlier this week, LeBlanc told Canadian senators he remained optimistic about USMCA's future, noting that the White House provided an exemption to a new U.S. tariff, of up to 15%, so long as the goods entering the U.S. comply with the trilateral pact. The Bank of Canada has labeled the pending review of USMCA as a key risk to the economic outlook.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The company is also benefiting from continued demand for protein and a second round of price increases, which were enacted last month in response to persistent inflation across commodities such as beef, pork trim and nuts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Our restructuring program is progressing as planned,\" interim Chief Executive Jeff Ettinger said. \"The financial benefits from this program will start to materialize more meaningfully in the second quarter.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Austin, Minn., company expects to post another quarter of top-line growth in its fiscal second quarter, after sales ticked 1.3% higher, to $3.03 billion, during its three months ended Jan. 25. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected sales of $3.07 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Profit rose to $181.8 million, compared with $170.6 million a year earlier, while adjusted earnings of 34 cents a share topped the 32 cents a share that Wall Street modeled.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hormel said its bottom line was pressured during the recent quarter, though, by higher-than-expected transport expenses due to adverse winter weather, as well as continually rising costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"As expected, commodity input costs mainly for beef, pork trim and nuts were a headwind in the first quarter,\" interim Financial Chief Paul Kuehneman said. \"For context, beef remained a significant inflationary pressure across the industry, and pork trim increased 12% compared to last year.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company continues to expect a modest improvement in commodity markets during the back half of the year, he added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, Hormel is operating in a challenging consumer environment, executives said, marked by limited industry-wide retail consumption growth and notable pressure in food-service channels as operators and consumers remain cautious.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hormel said it would address these challenges in part by continuing to reshape its portfolio. The company has recently exited some of its non-core businesses, and it additionally plans to divest its whole-bird turkey business by the end of the current quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The sale will support the company's goal to reduce exposure to volatile, commodity-driven businesses, Ettinger said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The sale involves the hen side of our turkey complex, which are the female birds that you would typically enjoy during the holidays,\" he said, as well as a production facility and feed mill, both in Minnesota, and associated transportation assets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The sale will not affect our value-added turkey products, and we will continue to own and use the Jennie-O brand name,\" Ettinger added. \"Value-added turkey will remain a strategic and important part of our growth story.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking forward, Hormel guided for adjusted per-share earnings to be flat to up slightly in the current quarter, compared with a year earlier. The company backed its fiscal-year outlook for adjusted earnings of $1.43 a share to $1.51 a share, on sales of $12.2 billion to $12.5 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Connor Hart at connor.hart@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
