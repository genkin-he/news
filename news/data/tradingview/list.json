The company doubled its dividend for 2025 to S$0.03, but said it doesn't have a formal dividend payout policy as its business is in \"the growth stage,\" the analyst notes. Still, he expects the Singapore offshore and marine company's stronger earnings growth and cash flow, as well as asset sales, this year to enable it to boost dividends. He raises his 2026 and 2027 recurring profit projections by 4.0% and 23%, respectively, to reflect higher revenue and margin estimates. Citi raises its target price to S$2.70 from S$2.60 and maintains a buy rating. Shares rise 3.5% to S$2.36. (megan.cheah@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
