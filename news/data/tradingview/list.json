The Consolidation has reduced the number of issued and outstanding Common Shares from 324,152,832 Common Shares to 21,610,189 Common Shares. As previously announced, no fractional Common Shares were issued in connection with the Consolidation. Where the exchange resulted in a fractional post-Consolidation Common Share representing less than 0.5 of a post-Consolidation Common Share, the holder of pre-Consolidation Common Shares was not entitled to receive one whole post-Consolidation Common Share, and where the exchange resulted in a fractional post-Consolidation Common Share representing 0.5 or more of a post-Consolidation Common Share, the holder of pre-Consolidation Common Shares received one whole post-consolidation Common Share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Common Shares are expected to begin trading on the TSX Venture Exchange (the \"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>TSXV</span></strong><span>\") on a post-Consolidation basis at markets open on November 4, 2025.

No action is required by beneficial shareholders of the Company to receive post-Consolidation Common Shares in connection with the Consolidation. Beneficial shareholders who hold their pre-Consolidation Common Shares through intermediaries (e.g., a broker, bank, trust company investment dealer or other financial institution) and who have questions regarding how their Common Shares will be processed in connection with the Consolidation should contact their intermediaries.
