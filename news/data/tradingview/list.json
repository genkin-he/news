The   company selected Docebo over its incumbent HCM provider and another   competitor to modernize its global learning and development   infrastructure, centralizing onboarding, operational training, leadership   development, and compliance on a single, scalable platform. By enabling   mobile-first access for frontline employees, the organization aims to   accelerate speed to proficiency and drive a consistent guest experience   across its locations worldwide.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Following a competitive evaluation process, a global quick-service   restaurant leader serving millions of guests daily across more than   35,000 locations worldwide selected Docebo to modernize and scale its   global franchisee training platform, with a focus on frontline restaurant   employees. This win underscores Docebo's strength in the quick-service   restaurant sector and highlights the power of our extended enterprise   capabilities in supporting large, distributed franchise networks with   standardized, high-impact learning at scale.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>A global leader in AI-powered logistics and planning platform   technology, selected Docebo through a competitive RFP process to replace   its incumbent LMS and unify sales enablement with customer and partner   education on a single platform. The company chose Docebo for our   scalability, flexible e-commerce, built-in integrations, AI automation,   and ability to measure learning ROI, reinforcing our strength in complex,   global SaaS environments.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>A European-based multinational engineering and design software provider   with nearly 50,000 employees, selected Docebo after a nearly three-year   RFI, RFP, and proof-of-concept process to replace its internally   developed LMS. In a highly competitive evaluation, we prevailed over a   legacy provider to unify Sales Enablement with Customer Support,   Professional Services, and Engineering Enablement on a single enterprise   platform.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>A major U.S. financial services regulator overseeing U.S.   broker-dealers, selected Docebo to modernize and unify its learning   ecosystem. Working with a partner, Docebo replaced a legacy solution to   centralize the organization's complex internal training requirements. The   decision was driven by Docebo's robust product roadmap that addresses AI   innovation, user experience, and advanced analytics, reinforcing Docebo's   strength in supporting highly regulated, mission-critical organizations   at scale.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>In Q4, Docebo's Public Sector team secured a notable win with   Miami-Dade and expanded its footprint within the Department of War Cyber   Crime Center (DC3) Cyber Training Academy in partnership with Deloitte.   These engagements reflect continued traction across Federal and SLED   markets as government agencies advance workforce modernization   initiatives. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Update on Substantial Issuer Bid</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company also announced today, in accordance with U.S. securities laws, that it has waived the \"share price condition\" related to its previously announced substantial issuer bid (the \"Offer\") under which the Company has offered to repurchase for cancellation up to US$60,000,000 of its outstanding common shares (\"Common Shares\") at a price of US$20.40 per Common Share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Offer provides that the Company shall not be required to accept for purchase any deposited Common Shares, and may withdraw, terminate, extend, vary or cancel the Offer if, at any time there shall have occurred a decrease in excess of 10% of the market price of the Common Shares on the TSX or Nasdaq Global Select Market measured from the close of business on February 1, 2026. Notwithstanding that this has occurred, the Company remains committed to the Offer, as it believes that the current trading price of the Common Shares is not fully reflective of the value of the Company's business and future prospects.

Texas is the bedrock of Republican power as California is for Democrats, and no Democrat has won a statewide race there since 1994.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cornyn has intensified his rhetoric in the final days of the campaign, arguing that nominating Paxton could lead to an \"electoral massacre\" for Republicans and jeopardize their slim Senate majority.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Ken Paxton will be the kiss of death for Republicans on the ticket in November of 2026,\" the senator told reporters after addressing a small group of supporters outside an organic eatery and sports bar in Houston on February 19.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paxton accuses his opponent of fear-mongering and says he is confident his track record as state attorney general will help him prevail in November should he win the primary.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You look at my record, I've done more in two weeks for the voters and the constituents of Texas than he's done in 40 years,\" he told reporters after a February 20 rally outside of Houston.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tuesday's primary will be one of the most closely watched when Texas, North Carolina and Arkansas formally kick off the 2026 election season as the first states where voters will choose nominees for the midterm contests.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The party that controls the White House historically suffers losses in midterms, and Democrats only need to flip four seats in November to gain control of the Senate for the final two years of Trump's presidency. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>PROXIMITY TO TRUMP   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cornyn and Paxton are in a three-way primary with two-term U.S. Representative Wesley Hunt, 44. Political experts expect the race to be decided in a runoff between Cornyn and Paxton.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The race hinges more on the candidates' perceived closeness to President Donald Trump than on policy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At a campaign event on February 18 inside a barbecue restaurant in the eastern Texas city of Nacogdoches, Hunt paused briefly after noticing Trump on a nearby muted television.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I was with him last week,\" he told supporters. \"He is a good man.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All three candidates are Trump allies, but political analysts consider Cornyn the least conservative because of his bipartisanship, Paxton the least electable because of his past controversies and Hunt the least known.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump travels to Texas on Friday to deliver a speech on the economy. He has yet to endorse a candidate, a move that could help to sway undecided voters. He told reporters aboard Air Force One earlier this month that he likes and supports \"all three of them.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'THINKS HE'S BULLETPROOF'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cornyn is backed by Senate Republican leadership and former Governor Rick Perry. His allies have pumped more than $60 million into the race to try to slow Paxton's rise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cornyn has staked his campaign on the premise that character matters to voters, repeatedly pointing to Paxton's long list of controversies, including his 2023 impeachment by the Texas House on allegations of misuse of public resources, bribery and abuse of public trust, for which he was acquitted in the state Senate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I know he still thinks he's bulletproof even with all the scandals and the baggage ... Well, I guarantee in a general election it will be a dead weight around the neck of Republicans up and down the ticket,\" Cornyn told reporters at the Houston campaign stop.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paxton dismissed Cornyn’s character‑focused attack as political posturing, telling Reuters: “He's being completely dishonest about his record, and he's being very dishonest about me.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>State opinion polls show Paxton in the lead, a sign of his appeal among conservative voters. Voters don't care about scandals like they used to, political analysts say, and conservative voters in Texas want an uncompromising fighter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paxton's aggressive legal campaigns, particularly his high-profile attacks on Texas immigration groups and what he calls illegal voting, have won praise from conservative activists.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cornyn has built his career on legislative compromise and has worked across the aisle with Democrats. He raised the ire of Trump supporters by saying in 2023 that Trump could not win another election, and earlier by refusing to join efforts in 2021 to overturn former President Joe Biden's election victory.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>His last contest was in 2020, when he won reelection by nearly 10 points, outpacing Trump's five-and-a-half point win in the state. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>TEXAS REPUBLICAN SHIFT</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Paxton win would underscore how much Texas Republican politics has shifted in recent years, analysts said, with candidates aligned with the party’s more hardline wing steadily displacing older, more establishment-oriented Republicans. Trump carried the state by 14 percentage points in the 2024 presidential election.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If we were talking about the general election, we'd be talking about Cornyn winning comfortably,\" said Cal Jillson, a Southern Methodist University political science professor. \"But the Republican primary electorate is just such a sliver of the total electorate and so skewed toward MAGA at this point that it gives Paxton a clear advantage.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Analysts said Paxton has already demonstrated he can win statewide, pointing to his attorney general elections in 2014, 2018, and 2022. But they agree with Cornyn on one point - a Paxton nomination would make the state more competitive and require significant party resources to fend off a Democratic challenger. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Recent polls show Paxton holding the smallest advantage in general election matchups against the Democratic candidates: U.S. Representative Jasmine Crockett and state Representative James Talarico. Representative Hunt has the lowest name recognition in the Republican field but holds the largest lead over Democrats.</span></p></span></div></div>",

His abrupt resignation came while a third-party committee is still compiling a report on its investigation into the company's inappropriate accounting practices, with the report expected to be complete within this month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to Nidec, Nagamori requested to resign. Despite allegations that the founder and other executives were involved in the scandal, Nagamori has refrained from speaking about his resignation. Instead, the 81-year-old issued a statement that expressed his strong attachment to the company, saying, \"Nidec will last forever.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the statement, Nagamori said that he decided to step down \"based on my firm determination to do everything in my power to revitalize Nidec.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since May last year, a series of inappropriate accounting practices at the company have come to light. However, it was not until September that the committee began its investigation. The company is still struggling to get the management back on track.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In January, Nidec released a plan to improve its internal management system based on an in-house investigation. The plan pointed out that the inappropriate accounting practices stemmed from a corporate culture in which Nagamori's demands and short-term profit were prioritized. The involvement and responsibility of top-level management, including Nagamori, are expected to be a point of focus in the committee's report.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nagamori is known as a charismatic business leader whose guidance turned Nidec into a global company. In December, he assumed the post of chairman emeritus after resigning as representative director and global group representative. According to Nidec President and CEO Mitsuya Kishida, chairman emeritus is an \"honorary post without management authority.\" However, voices expressing concerns about Nagamori's influence on the company remained strong even after he entered that post.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nagamori likely concluded that it was necessary for him to completely step aside from Nidec to restore trust in the company. In the statement, Nagamori said that he deeply regrets the company's inappropriate accounting practices. \"Now is high time for me to leave. My chapter of Nidec ends today, followed by an era for next-generation employees to create a new story,\" he stated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gone into hiding?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some have voiced questions over Nagamori's abrupt resignation before the release of the committee's report. Nagamori is known for his outspoken remarks at press conferences and shareholder meetings, yet he refrained from speaking publicly about both resignations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Resigning at this time could actually give off a negative impression,\" said a Nidec source. \"I think it's unavoidable that people will assume he's running away.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As of September 2025, Nagamori held 8.61% of Nidec's shares personally and 3.52% through an asset management company, making him the company's de facto largest shareholder. A possibility therefore remains that he will continue to influence Nidec.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>----</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This article is from The Yomiuri Shimbun.
