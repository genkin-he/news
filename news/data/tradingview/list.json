Potential trade tensions among major economies and possible escalation of geopolitical conflicts could drive up production costs and raise global economic policy uncertainty. \"Such conditions could dampen global investment flows and trade activity, ultimately weighing on overall global growth,\" Gan says. Recent tariff developments also show the unpredictability of President Trump's trade policies. Singapore remains particularly vulnerable to global supply chain shifts and external demand conditions, given that it is a small and highly trade-dependent economy.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Paul Vieira and Georgia Wells</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The leader of the Canadian province of British Columbia says he's secured a meeting with OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman to advocate for stronger safety protocols among artificial-intelligence companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>David Eby leads the province where one of Canada's deadliest school shootings in decades occurred this month, leaving eight people dead and dozens injured. He has been among the most forceful voices in Canada demanding accountability from OpenAI for not informing law-enforcement officers about allegedly troubling interactions the suspect in the Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, shooting had with the company's ChatGPT chatbot.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In an interview Thursday with The Wall Street Journal, Eby said he declined OpenAI's offers to meet company vice presidents. \"I said that I would only meet with the head of OpenAI,\" Eby said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Eby said OpenAI heeded his request, but added that the timing for the meeting remains unclear. A spokeswoman for the company didn't respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I think it's important at the most senior levels to understand the consequences of decisions that are made on people's lives,\" Eby said. \"It's important that this doesn't get abstracted away into a policy or statistical discussion, that the real-life harms are apparent for the people at the top of the food chain at these companies.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Wall Street Journal reported last week that OpenAI considered alerting Canadian law enforcement authorities about interactions between Jesse Van Rootselaar and ChatGPT. Some OpenAI employees worried the suspect's writings were a warning about potential real-world violence, the Journal reported.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OpenAI banned Van Rootselaar's account but determined that her activity didn't meet the criteria for reporting to law enforcement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Police identified Van Rootselaar as the suspect in a fatal shooting at a school in British Columbia this month. Police said Van Rootselaar, an 18-year-old trans woman, was found dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted injury at the school scene.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earlier Thursday, OpenAI made a series of pledges to the Canadian government to bolster its safety protocols. In a letter to Canada's minister in charge of artificial intelligence, the company said its new protocols would have prompted the company to refer Van Rootselaar's ChatGPT interactions to law enforcement if they were discovered today.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Eby said he \"really struggled\" on how to respond to OpenAI's new commitments, which emerged after the company met with federal officials in Ottawa. Senior cabinet ministers in attendance said they were disappointed by OpenAI's failure to produce specific measures to strengthen safety protocols, like when to refer accounts to police.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Many tech companies have not found the right balance in public safety, the safety of children, and the interests of their shareholders around user numbers. And that failure to find that balance is exactly where the government needs to weigh in and ensure that there's a consistent standard,\" Eby said. He is pushing the federal Liberal government for new rules that set common thresholds for when tech companies need to report suspicious and disturbing behavior to authorities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"OpenAI has demonstrated that companies are not going to get this right and that the consequences are profound and tragic and unfixable. When you're talking about dead children, there's just no going back and getting it right the next time,\" Eby said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The premier added there's a \"100% chance\" that there will be some form of public inquiry so British Columbia's citizens can learn how and why the shooting happened. Once the police complete their investigation, Eby said if there's no clarity on \"what OpenAI knew and when...then we will ensure that is, in fact, delivered not just to British Columbians but to the broader public.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires, has a content-licensing partnership with OpenAI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com and Georgia Wells at georgia.wells@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The forecast includes a projection for $50 billion in artificial-intelligence revenue, double what Dell (DELL) posted for fiscal 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"AI server demand remains exceptional,\" CFO David Kennedy said on the company's earnings call.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dell shares were up 10% in Thursday's extended session.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At a time when the market is jittery about the impact of component shortages and rising memory prices on consumer-electronics businesses, Dell posted a 20.5% gross-margin rate for the fiscal fourth quarter, slightly above its forecast. The company is also comfortable with the supply it has to fulfill its revenue guidance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From an operating-margin standpoint, the company has been benefiting from a greater mix of storage products as well as more sales of its own intellectual property. Both of those things have favorable profit profiles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Don't miss: Memory-chip stocks are still quite cheap - especially if you look overseas</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the fiscal fourth quarter, Dell posted a 14.8% operating margin for its infrastructure-solutions business, which includes servers and storage offerings. The company posted a 240-basis-point improvement there relative to its performance in the fiscal third quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dell COO Jeff Clarke also expressed confidence in the company's ability to meet its mid-single-digit operating-margin target for AI servers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We clearly have a lot of backlog to clear, with $43 billion in backlog,\" he said on the earnings call. \"That backlog will ship at mid-single digits.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Management discussed how \"input costs are rapidly changing,\" forcing strategic decisions for the company. Dell raised prices on traditional servers in December, a move that helped stabilize margins. With its client-solutions group, which includes personal computers, Dell was more deliberate as it has also been focused on winning market share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Our business grew 18% in a market that grew 10%,\" management said, indicating that the focus on market-share gains has yielded results. The company did raise prices in January and saw stabilization of margins as a result.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See also: Arista succeeds where Cisco came up short - to the benefit of its stock</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the fiscal fourth quarter, Dell posted adjusted earnings per share of $3.89 on revenue of $33.4 billion.

Analysts tracked by FactSet were modeling $3.53 and $31.7 billion, respectively.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dell also boosted its quarterly dividend by 20% and increased its buyback authorization by $10 billion.

That still left it a fraction firmer for the week, but the Aussie needs to clear the recent three-year peak of $0.71465 to keep the rally going.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The currency was also up 1.1% for the week on the Japanese yen and just off a 35-year high of 111.45 </span><span>.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The kiwi dollar had barely budged at $0.5981 </span><span>, and was flat on the week. It remains corralled between support around $0.5930 and resistance at $0.6092.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bonds have fared better as a safety bid boosted Treasuries, helping Australian 10-year yields </span><span> drop 8 basis points for the week to 4.658%, the lowest since mid-January.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That was still a tempting 65 basis points above U.S. yields, providing a buffer for the Aussie.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A high reading on inflation this week has left markets implying an 80% chance the Reserve Bank of Australia will hike the 3.85% cash rate a quarter point in May.

Those results arrived just two days after Sweetgreen launched new wrap sandwiches, priced a bit lower than some of its bowls and salads, after more expensive fare kept some customers away last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shares of Sweetgreen (SG) were down 4.9% after hours on Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The drop in Sweetgreen's stock price came after shares of rival Cava (CAVA) rocketed higher on Wednesday, following a forecast for a same-store sales gain this year. The Mediterranean fast-casual chain's CEO said customers could be getting tired of chasing discounts. However, other chains, like McDonald's (MCD) and Chipotle (CMG), have been more tempered in their expectations for the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shares of Cava were down 0.6% after hours Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sweetgreen's management on Thursday said it would move ahead with more urgency to strengthen service standards, introduce new menu items and speed up checkout times. It also plans to improve marketing around things like high-quality ingredients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CEO Jonathan Neman said that the company was currently testing new wrap sandwiches, which it introduced on Tuesday in parts of New York, the Midwest and California. If those items do well, he said Sweetgreen plans to expand the offerings beyond that trial run in the middle of the year. The prices for those wraps start at $10.95.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sweetgreen said fourth-quarter sales fell 3.5% to $155.2 million, with a per-share loss of 42 cents. Both figures were worse than analysts expected. Same-stores sales were down 11.5%, which weren't as bad as anticipated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The chain said it expects same-store sales to fall 2% to 4% this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Over the past year, fast-casual restaurants - which try to offer the quality of a sit-down chain at the speed of fast food - have been squeezed by value offerings from rivals like Chili's and McDonald's. Against that backdrop, Sweetgreen's stock is down 73.5% over the past 12 months. Over recent months, consumers have showed signs of waning interest in often-pricey salad and bowl offerings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ahead of the results, UBS analysts said Sweetgreen faced concerns over spending among younger consumers, who make up about a third of the people who visit the chain. They also noted that the chain has struggled in cities like Los Angeles and areas in the Northeast. During an earnings call in November, Sweetgreen said New York was its \"most challenged market.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many restaurants, after raising prices to cover for the past several years of supply shocks, are now trying to find ways to cut them after scaring customers away. But the discount war has weighed on margins and, in some cases, stock prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Bill Peters</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
