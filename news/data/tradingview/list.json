            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Teresa Rivas</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After living through a pandemic, new wars, political upsets, and the rise of artificial intelligence — in the first half of the decade alone — investors may feel they're entitled to a few years of normalcy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That doesn't mean they'll get them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Although they may not come to pass, there are plenty of potential black swan events that could be lurking in the back half of the 2020s. A group of Citi strategists led by Daniel Tobon take a look at these \"wildcards\" in a new note Thursday, noting that they \"don't expect many — if any — of these to actually materialize. However, they are probable enough that they cannot be entirely dismissed.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Increasing global fragmentation is one key worry. President Donald Trump's choice to use his second term to remake the role of the U.S. in the world has led to heightened uncertainty — chiefly around trade but touching on multiple factors from migration to climate change.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Citi expects tariffs to be a fact of life in the near-term, but there's always the risk that global trade and political tensions ratchet higher, leading to worsening relationships between both the U.S. and Europe and the U.S. and China.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's not small potatoes considering \"these are the three largest economies in the world and this scenario would have material ramifications for the global economy,\" the strategists write. It would affect trade first, but then quickly spread to other spheres and \"would likely mean (substantially) lower growth in all three economies and consequently softer global growth.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The global economy has been remarkably resilient and may continue to adapt as needed. But if it gets pushed beyond that point \"many countries (and companies) would likely face difficult and costly trade-offs in an environment of rapid decoupling of the world's largest economies.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is also the chance that the U.S. takes extreme steps in regard to Latin America and/or Iran.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the U.S. were to blockade all oil exports from Latin America and nearby nations like Mexico it would lead to severe dislocations to oil price benchmarks in the Americas vs. the rest of the world, and a shock on par with the 1973 Arab oil embargo.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Elsewhere, tensions with Iran could erupt into potential attacks on that nation's nuclear and missile facilities as well as its oil-related infrastructure, leading to retaliatory actions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Alternatively, Iran's fragile domestic situation could fracture into leadership succession uncertainties, breaking down into factions attacking or vying for control of the country and its strategic oil infrastructure, similar to the situation in Libya since 2011,\" the strategists note.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Europe is another wild card. While it's long underperformed the U.S. in terms of growth and earnings performance, the region could once again take the lead as it did in 2002-2007.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Given the Trump administration's moves, Europe has accelerated its inward focus, to the benefit of domestic supply chains, military spending, and manufacturing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Overall, Eurozone nominal GDP growth could inch up to 4.5% annually for the next four to five years,\" the strategists write, leading to higher earnings from European companies that support higher valuations for their stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then there's artificial intelligence. Recent trading has reflected fears that AI will take over whole industries in tech and beyond, leading to the Nasdaq Composite falling into the red year to date and big selloffs in everything from logistics to financials that's left the S&amp;P 500 treading water this year. And leveraged credit markets also have plenty of AI risk, the firm notes, given its heavy exposure to software and insurance, two industries potentially most at risk from AI. But on the other hand, the potential for a bubble that ultimately bursts remains as well.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Citi thinks that we are in a bubble, just one that's not quite ready to pop, considering liquidity remains ample. Yet if the burst does come sooner rather than later, it warns that a \"recession would be likely given that the wealth effect would be much larger than in 2000.\" The Federal Reserve would likely be pushed to aggressively slash rates, potentially to zero, leading to a Treasury rally and weakening of the dollar.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Taking 2000 as a template, money would flow out of tech as well as most cyclicals, and into defensives (Healthcare, Staples), and rates-sensitive sectors (Utilities, Real Estate),\" Citi writes. \"Diversification across countries would be much less helpful, as in 2000, global equity markets were unable to decouple from the U.S. market, with emerging markets in Asia actually underperforming the U.S.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's already been a tumultuous 2026 for the stock market, for the U.S. and for the world as a whole. Yet if the past few years have taught us anything, it's to expect the unexpected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
