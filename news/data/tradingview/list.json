            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Al Root</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sometimes the market gives investors a gift. They should take it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's the view of Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard, who urged investors to buy the post-earnings dip in shares of Heico.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Wednesday evening, the aerospace parts manufacturer reported fiscal first-quarter earnings per share of $1.35, about seven cents ahead of Wall Street estimates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company's flight support division, which makes replacement parts for commercial aircraft, grew sales year over year by about 12% on a comparable basis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Heico doesn't provide formal guidance, but management expects \"continued sales momentum\" in that and other business segments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It all seemed fine. Shares, however, dropped more than 9% on Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"When you are a stock that has done as well as Heico, with the highest valuation in the Aerospace &amp; Defense space, there is always the risk of expectations getting ahead of reality,\" wrote Stallard on Friday. \"We think investors have reacted negatively to the free cash flow miss and the soft [segment] margin, even though both have been impacted by short-term issues. We would thus be using this sell-off as an opportune entry point for what has been a proven, successful compounder business model over the last 30-plus years.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A \"compounder\" is a Wall Street term for a company that has a history of successful capital deployment, typically with bolt-on acquisition, leading to consistent, strong earnings growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stallard rates shares Buy and has a $403 price target for the stock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He isn't alone. On Friday, Citi analyst John Godyn put a \"upside 90-day catalyst watch\" on Heico stock. That means he expects shares to rise over the coming three months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We believe recent weakness represents an attractive entry point into what we've described as a Best of Breed Megatrend Compounder, given the company's unusually long history of compounding value in Aerospace &amp; Defense,\" wrote Godyn. The megatrend he sees is strong, lasting demand growth for commercial air travel. \"Big picture, our constructive fundamental view on Heico is based on its dominant niche aftermarket position, robust M&amp;A pipeline, cash generation, and diversified growth.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>His price target for shares is $400.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Overall, Heico is a relatively popular stock on Wall Street, with 61% of analysts covering shares rating it Buy, according to FactSet. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&amp;P 500 is about 55%. The average analyst price target for Heico stock is about $375.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The biggest complaint about Heico might be its valuation. Shares trade for about 55 times earnings expected over the next 12 months. That's just about the same valuation as the stock had five years ago. Through midday trading, shares were up about 150% over that span. Earnings per share have risen from $2.29 to $4.90.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Heico stock was up 1.6% in midday trading on Friday, while the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.6% and 1.2%, respectively.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Trump says on Truth Social that agencies will have a six-month phase out period, during which he says \"Anthropic better get their act together\" and threatens civil and criminal consequences. The AI startup said Thursday it would reject demands from the Pentagon to let the military use its Claude models in all lawful cases. If Anthropic loses its federal contracts, that could create an opportunity for competing AI models like Google's Gemini to increase their work with the federal government.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Mark Karpelès, the former CEO of defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox, has published a proposal calling for a Bitcoin hard fork that would allow roughly 79,956 BTC, worth more than $5.2 billion at current prices, to be recovered from a long-dormant address linked to the exchange’s 2011 hack.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The proposal targets the address 1Feex...sb6uF, which received nearly 80,000 BTC following a documented compromise of Mt. Gox’s systems in June 2011. The coins have not moved in more than 15 years, suggesting the attacker may have lost the private keys or has chosen not to move or return the funds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under current Bitcoin rules, those funds can only be spent with the corresponding private key.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The proposal says it would \"add a consensus rule that allows spending the unspent outputs locked to the theft address using a signature from the Mt. Gox recovery address, so that the funds can be returned to Mt. Gox creditors through the existing court-supervised rehabilitation process.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The draft is framed as a starting point for debate, which Karpelès describes as \"an attempt to start a discussion about whether the Bitcoin community considers this specific, exceptional case worth addressing.\" He also specifies that the rule change would apply only to that single address and would activate at a future block height if adopted by the network.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Arguments for and against</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In outlining the rationale, Karpelès describes the theft as \"unambiguous,\" notes the coins have remained inactive for 15 years, and points out that a court-supervised rehabilitation process is already in place to distribute any recovered funds to verified creditors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He also frames the change as technically limited and narrow, writing that it is a “one-time, hardcoded exception for a specific case with unique characteristics,” not a general mechanism for reversing transactions or recovering stolen funds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, the proposal acknowledges obvious downsides.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Among them is the concern that altering ownership rules for a specific address would set a precedent that could undermine Bitcoin’s immutability. \"If it can be done once, the argument goes, it can be done again,\" the draft states. It also raises the question of who decides which cases merit protocol intervention, noting that other major hacks could seek similar treatment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The document further concedes that coordinating a hard fork would carry risks, including the possibility of a chain split if parts of the network refuse to upgrade.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Existing Mt. Gox repayments</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The coins referenced in the proposal are not part of the assets currently being distributed to creditors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Following Mt. Gox’s 2014 collapse, roughly 200,000 BTC were later recovered and placed under the control of court-appointed trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi as part of Japan’s civil rehabilitation process. Those holdings have formed the basis of creditor repayments that began in mid-2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As previously reported, the trustee pushed the repayment deadline to October 2026, marking the third extension. According to Arkham Intelligence data, the estate still holds 34,689 BTC across its wallets, and past movements, including a 10,608 BTC transfer in November, have typically preceded distributions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
