The debt then reappears on the balance sheet a few days after quarter end, it added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Our key takeaway from this behavior is that distribution cuts are so worrisome that some bad actors are playing Enron-like accounting games,\" the letter said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The firms are using repo-like loans from one particular investment bank to mask debt, the letter says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rubric Capital did not name the bank nor the BDCs involved and Reuters was unable to independently verify whether this practice is being deployed and at what scale.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rubric Capital declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The private credit market has been gripped by anxiety in recent months since the bankruptcies of auto-parts maker First Brands and subprime lender Tricolor last year. The fallout has sharpened scrutiny of a market that has grown quickly, drawing large institutional investment and rising corporate lending in recent years. A renewed bout of uncertainty has flared up in recent weeks. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The BDC industry oversees over $300 billion in assets under management and accounts for roughly one quarter of direct lending in the U.S., according to a Bank for International Settlements note in July. The closed-end investment vehicles can be private or listed on stock exchanges.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Enron went bankrupt in 2001 after using off-balance-sheet vehicles and other accounting tricks to hide tens of billions of dollars of debt.    </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before starting Rubric, founder David Rosen worked for 10 years at Point72, formerly called SAC Capital, and began his career at the Blackstone Group in restructuring, according to a Morgan Stanley note from June.

If redemption requests reach 10% of net assets, investors can eventually become locked out of their money as the funds halt any further flows.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rising costs and an ever-present investor demand for distributions have put BDC managers under pressure, said Rubric Capital.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is leading to dodgy industry behavior with funds increasing leverage instead of taking their medicine and reducing distributions,\" said the hedge fund's letter.</span></p></span></div></div>",

A liquidity pool is a crowdsourced collection of crypto assets that can be used to facilitate buy and sell transactions on a decentralized exchange.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Goliath told prospective investors that money placed in the liquidity pools would \"facilitate passive income generation, enhance market efficiency, and provide qualified investors with access to innovative financial opportunities,\" according to the affidavit in support of the Justice Department's criminal complaint. Prosecutors say Delgado fraudulently told clients that their investments would net them monthly returns, sometimes describing the investments as \"guaranteed\" or \"low risk.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"[I]n reality, the funds were primarily used to pay purported returns to earlier investors, to return principal to investors who requested it, and for Goliath's extravagant business gatherings, holiday parties, and luxury travel accommodations,\" the Justice Department says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of Delgado's lawyers, Sean Shecter, with the law firm Lewis Brisbois in Fort Lauderdale, declined to comment on the charges.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition to the alleged Ponzi-like payments to early investors and other expenses, Delgado used some of the money he raised to purchase real estate in Florida, according to the Justice Department. The affidavit details four real estate purchases Delgado allegedly made with investors' money, ranging in cost from $1.15 million to an $8.5 million property in Windermere, Fla., purchased in September 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Prosecutors say the alleged scheme ran from January 2023 through January 2026. Delgado allegedly took several steps to conceal the true state of investors' holdings with Goliath Ventures, including issuing fabricated statements \"to show returns where there were none,\" according to the affidavit, filed by IRS special agent Steven Chandler.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Delgado allegedly offered some clients bogus explanations for why they couldn't immediately redeem their investments and issued some investors more money than they had originally invested, \"which allowed Goliath to continue operating because investors did not realize their returns were paid from other investors' money,\" Chandler wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In late 2025, facing pressure from investors to withdraw their principal or their purported gains, \"Goliath delayed payments, provided shifting explanations, and ultimately restricted or terminated investor access to purported information about their investments,\" according to the affidavit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The wire fraud and money laundering charges carry a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
