Analyst Roger Samueltells clients in a note that the ASX-listed company's A$500 million offering is prudent and provides additional flexibility at an attractive price. It also means that NextDC, which still has A$4 billion in headroom on its current facilities, can raise more senior debt in future if needed. Samuel says he's confident that NextDC can deliver faster ramp-up in its billing capacity. Jefferies raises its target price 3.3% to A$18.70 and keeps a buy rating on the stock, which is down 4.0% at A$13.77. (stuart.condie@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

Potential trade tensions among major economies and possible escalation of geopolitical conflicts could drive up production costs and raise global economic policy uncertainty. \"Such conditions could dampen global investment flows and trade activity, ultimately weighing on overall global growth,\" Gan says. Recent tariff developments also show the unpredictability of President Trump's trade policies. Singapore remains particularly vulnerable to global supply chain shifts and external demand conditions, given that it is a small and highly trade-dependent economy.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Paul Vieira and Georgia Wells</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The leader of the Canadian province of British Columbia says he's secured a meeting with OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman to advocate for stronger safety protocols among artificial-intelligence companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>David Eby leads the province where one of Canada's deadliest school shootings in decades occurred this month, leaving eight people dead and dozens injured. He has been among the most forceful voices in Canada demanding accountability from OpenAI for not informing law-enforcement officers about allegedly troubling interactions the suspect in the Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, shooting had with the company's ChatGPT chatbot.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In an interview Thursday with The Wall Street Journal, Eby said he declined OpenAI's offers to meet company vice presidents. \"I said that I would only meet with the head of OpenAI,\" Eby said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Eby said OpenAI heeded his request, but added that the timing for the meeting remains unclear. A spokeswoman for the company didn't respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I think it's important at the most senior levels to understand the consequences of decisions that are made on people's lives,\" Eby said. \"It's important that this doesn't get abstracted away into a policy or statistical discussion, that the real-life harms are apparent for the people at the top of the food chain at these companies.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Wall Street Journal reported last week that OpenAI considered alerting Canadian law enforcement authorities about interactions between Jesse Van Rootselaar and ChatGPT. Some OpenAI employees worried the suspect's writings were a warning about potential real-world violence, the Journal reported.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OpenAI banned Van Rootselaar's account but determined that her activity didn't meet the criteria for reporting to law enforcement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Police identified Van Rootselaar as the suspect in a fatal shooting at a school in British Columbia this month. Police said Van Rootselaar, an 18-year-old trans woman, was found dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted injury at the school scene.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earlier Thursday, OpenAI made a series of pledges to the Canadian government to bolster its safety protocols. In a letter to Canada's minister in charge of artificial intelligence, the company said its new protocols would have prompted the company to refer Van Rootselaar's ChatGPT interactions to law enforcement if they were discovered today.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Eby said he \"really struggled\" on how to respond to OpenAI's new commitments, which emerged after the company met with federal officials in Ottawa. Senior cabinet ministers in attendance said they were disappointed by OpenAI's failure to produce specific measures to strengthen safety protocols, like when to refer accounts to police.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Many tech companies have not found the right balance in public safety, the safety of children, and the interests of their shareholders around user numbers. And that failure to find that balance is exactly where the government needs to weigh in and ensure that there's a consistent standard,\" Eby said. He is pushing the federal Liberal government for new rules that set common thresholds for when tech companies need to report suspicious and disturbing behavior to authorities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"OpenAI has demonstrated that companies are not going to get this right and that the consequences are profound and tragic and unfixable. When you're talking about dead children, there's just no going back and getting it right the next time,\" Eby said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The premier added there's a \"100% chance\" that there will be some form of public inquiry so British Columbia's citizens can learn how and why the shooting happened. Once the police complete their investigation, Eby said if there's no clarity on \"what OpenAI knew and when...then we will ensure that is, in fact, delivered not just to British Columbians but to the broader public.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires, has a content-licensing partnership with OpenAI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com and Georgia Wells at georgia.wells@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
