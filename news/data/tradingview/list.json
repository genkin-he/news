Since that time, the company has verified gold assay data relating to historical drilling (see press release dated October 22st, 2025) and has identified numerous gold prospects located within the property and proximal to old gold mine workings. Drill core totalling 32,685 meters is stored at the Scadding Gold Mine site in the western part of the ESP.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Drilling Gold Lens 1</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>A review of historical drilling and assay information has confirmed a well-defined zone of gold mineralization located beside and beneath the past producing North Pit gold mine. The mineralized zone consists of a series of high-grade lenses developed within a broad zone of lower grade material measuring 80 m X 3m X 100 m and dipping north-east at an estimated 60 degrees. The zone has been intersected by at least 46 drill holes during three drilling campaigns by previous workers (Trueclaim Exploration Inc. between 2009 - 2011; Northern Sphere Mining, 2017; and MacDonald Mines Exploration Ltd, 2019 - 2025). There are also an unknown number of holes drilled in the 1980's for which precise locations and assay information are not available.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Assays from historical drill intersections within the mineralized zone range from less than a gram to highs up to 735.51 g/t, the latter over an intersected width of 0.96 m (Hole SM-20-026) with the best reported intersection being 36.27 g/t Au over 12.27 m (Hole # SM-19-001). A minimum of 15 holes within the zone are planned for this phase, all designed to provide fill-in information for areas not previously tested by drilling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Two additional near surface zones of gold mineralization are currently recognized in close proximity to Zone 1, and will be tested by drilling after the current program is completed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This drilling program is designed to provide infill data around two closely related gold zones which have previously been identified and confirmed beside the historical North Pit gold mine workings. The infill data we seek with this drill program is expected to be sufficient for us to calculate a 'maiden' Mineral Resource Estimate for what we are now labelling as Gold Lens 1,\" stated Christopher Berlet, President &amp; CEO of Canuc Resources Corp.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Calculating a 'maiden' Mineral Resource Estimate for Gold Lens 1 is a required first step in formulating a mine plan and seeking extractive permits. Our objective with this work is ultimately to confirm that several profitable, high-grade, gold mining opportunities, 'gold lenses', are still present today and in place near to the historical gold mine workings which are found at various locations across the company's East Sudbury Project (ESP).\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Canuc's updated website and PowerPoint can be found at: www.canucresources.ca.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Drilling at ESP, October 2025</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>https://youtube.com/shorts/FnsIx75zbLQ</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>https://youtu.be/qbOxrfD19JY</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The technical information in this release has been reviewed and approved by Seymour Sears, B.A., B.Sc., P.Geo, a non-independent qualified person as defined by NI 43-101, who is currently managing exploration activity on the ESP Project.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Canuc Resources Corp.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Canuc Resources Corporation is a junior resource company developing its 100% interest in the East Sudbury Project (\"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>ESP</span></strong><span>\") which spans 19,710 hectares and is centered approximately 20 kilometers northeast of the Prolific Sudbury Mining Camp and near to the extensive infrastructure of the adjacent Sudbury Mining District. </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>ESP</span></strong><span> encompasses several centers of critical and precious metal mineralization interpreted to be related to a mineral system that can form IOCG and affiliated critical and precious mineral deposits.
