            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>The US-Israel strikes on Iran, which killed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and led to Iranian retaliation against Israel and US bases in the Gulf, have pushed oil markets into focus. The concern is possible supply disruption through the Strait of Hormuz.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Brent crude was already trading higher at around $72 to 73 per barrel in late February as tensions rose. For the markets reopening, analysts expect prices to move higher again. If shipping through key routes is affected, crude could move toward $80 or higher.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For India, the situation brings back familiar risks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Around 50% of India’s crude imports — about 2.6 million barrels per day — pass through the Strait of Hormuz. Any disruption could raise the import bill, add to inflation, widen the current account deficit, and pressure margins in several sectors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Experts say spare capacity within OPEC+ could prevent prices from staying elevated for long. Saudi Arabia has indicated it can raise output if needed. However, a prolonged disruption would still have a meaningful impact.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bhavik Patel, Senior Analyst, Tradebulls Securities, said some geopolitical risk was already priced in.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“WTI was already trading at $68. After this pre-emptive strike, we expect prices to move higher,” she said. “How far crude goes now depends on US actions. If Iran’s export infrastructure is hit or shipping through the Strait of Hormuz is disrupted, global supply could tighten. That could add a $4 to $8 premium.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He pointed to supply-side support.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“Saudi Arabia has said it is willing to increase capacity if there is supply disruption from Iran. OPEC+ is also expected to raise production from April 1 by about 1,67,000 bpd because of this, the move in crude prices may be sharp but not sustained,\" Patel added. Prices would remain high only if disruption in the Strait continues, as importers would need longer routes, increasing cost and time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ponmudi R, CEO – Enrich Money, said the issue extends beyond geopolitics.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“This starts as an oil issue but quickly feeds into inflation and liquidity for global markets,” he said. Even a short disruption through the Strait of Hormuz could push crude sharply higher. A sustained rise in Brent toward the $83 to $95 range could lift inflation expectations globally. That would complicate central banks’ plans for rate cuts and put pressure on equity markets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For India, he said every $10 increase in oil prices significantly raises the import bill. It also adds to current account pressure and increases fiscal risks if steps are taken to protect consumers. Oil marketing companies, aviation, paints, autos and logistics could see margin pressure. IT stocks may stay volatile due to global risk-off sentiment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Strong domestic institutional flows, he added, could help limit broader market damage, keeping this a phase of high volatility rather than a deeper unwind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Prashant Vasisht, Senior Vice President and Co-Group Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA Limited, said the conflict would increase volatility in crude prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“The Strait of Hormuz is a critical energy route. About 20% of global petroleum liquids and 20% of global liquefied natural gas move through it,” he said. A prolonged or wider conflict involving multiple oil and gas producers could disrupt supplies and push global energy prices higher.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For Indian refiners, sourcing crude from the US, Africa or South America is possible. However, higher crude prices would still raise the import bill.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Elevated input costs would also weigh on marketing margins and profitability for oil marketing companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kunal Sodhani (Broader India Impacts) said nearly 50% of India’s crude — about 2.6 mb/d — moves through the Strait. A sustained 25% rise in oil prices could add around $15 billion to the import bill. It could widen the current account deficit by about 0.3% of GDP, raise inflation by roughly 0.7 percentage points, and reduce real GDP growth by around 0.2% if the situation persists.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Risks also extend to trade and remittances from the Gulf, estimated at $40 to 50 billion a year, and to the 9+ million Indians living in the region. Safe-haven demand could support gold and silver. Equity markets may see risk-off pressure, along with weakness in the rupee. India VIX typically rises 20–40% during such geopolitical events.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Market snapshot for India</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Upstream companies (ONGC, Oil India) may benefit in the short term from higher realizations. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Downstream companies and OMCs (IOC, BPCL, HPCL), along with aviation, autos, paints and logistics, face higher input costs and delayed price pass-throughs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The broader economy faces risks from inflation, current account pressure, fiscal strain and a cautious RBI stance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the global side, OPEC+ output increases from April and Saudi spare capacity could limit price gains if disruptions remain brief.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Markets reopen on Monday with volatility expected. Crude futures, tanker movement and any further developments overnight will be closely watched.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

This strategic agreement represents a key step in advancing the Company's rare earth mineral exploration strategy and expanding its footprint in West Africa's emerging critical minerals sector.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A recent geological assessment conducted across the 267-acre project area identified anomalous concentrations of Rutile, Ilmenite, Zircon, Monazite, and associated rare earth minerals. These encouraging indicators suggest significant exploration upside potential and position the Vaama project as a promising asset within Sierra Leone's expanding mineral development landscape.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the terms of the MOU, JP Anderson and the leadership of Vaama Chiefdom will collaborate to:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Conduct detailed geological mapping, sampling, and feasibility studies</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Establish transparent and structured community engagement programs</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Promote local employment, training, and workforce development</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Implement environmentally responsible and internationally aligned mining practices</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Support long-term community infrastructure and social development initiatives</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>JP Anderson remains committed to working closely with traditional authorities, regulatory agencies, and local stakeholders to ensure responsible resource development aligned with both national regulations and global ESG standards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This agreement marks an important milestone in our long-term growth strategy,\" said James Price, CEO of JP Anderson. \"Rare earth and critical minerals are essential to electrification, renewable energy systems, defense technologies, and advanced manufacturing. We believe the Vaama project has the potential to become a meaningful contributor to regional economic development while creating long-term shareholder value.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beyond the Vaama initiative, JP Anderson is aggressively expanding its acquisition and exploration pipeline. The Company is actively pursuing additional mining concessions and joint venture opportunities targeting lithium, nickel, copper, coltan, and other strategic rare earth and critical minerals. These commodities are increasingly vital to global battery production, electric vehicle manufacturing, grid storage, and clean energy infrastructure, positioning the Company to participate in rapidly growing international supply chains.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sierra Leone is globally recognized for its mineral wealth, including iron ore, gold, rutile, and heavy mineral sands. The Company believes that continued exploration success within the country may further enhance its standing as a premier destination for responsible mineral investment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Subject to regulatory approvals and completion of technical planning, expanded exploration activities at Vaama are expected to commence in the coming phases of development.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Leone Asset Management</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Leone Asset Management, Inc., is a multi-national, multi-industry conglomerate with subsidiary companies that operate in, Infrastructure Development, Rare Earth Mineral Exploration and Mining and Agriculture Management.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Forward-Looking Statements Disclosure:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>This press release may contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

The price action seen during the last 30 minutes of Friday's trading session is testimony to that. The Nifty, trying to protect 25,300 for a better part of the session, slumped to 25,150, all in a matter of two minutes, and could not recover from that fall by close.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Global markets will only react to all of the developments over the weekend on Monday. This includes the US futures, who will resume trading on Sunday evening local time, while Asian equities, Indian equities, and other markets will also react to these developments on Monday morning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Before the markets open here in India, the bigger reaction will be seen on other asset classes beyond equities. Crude oil prices, Gold prices, moves on the US Dollar, the Yen, all of which will be significant and keenly monitored by the street. In fact, Barclays has already written in a note to clients that oil prices could go up to as high as $100 per barrel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> In case that does happen, it will be negative for the Indian downstream oil refiners, but beneficial for upstream companies such as ONGC and Oil India. Any potential rise in oil prices could also pressure the currency and that will also be one aspect that the street will closely monitor.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> More than the attack on Iran, there could be a bigger ramification on Indian companies that have a significant exposure to the middle east, particularly after Iran's retaliation, that has hit regions across the GCC, including Dubai, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi. Stocks like L&amp;T, Kalyan Jewellers, Welspun Corp, KEC International, all have exposure to the Middle East.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> The Nifty is already below the 200-Day Moving Average. Part of the accelerated sell-off on Friday could also be attributed to that. That now opens up levels on the downside, first of course being 25,000. Then come the January 21 swing low of 24,919 and the brief, budget-day intraday lows of 24,571 and 24,679 on February 2.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Any potential strengthening in the US Dollar could have ramifications for Metal stocks. The Nifty Metal index was the third-best performing sectoral index in February.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> \"The underlying trend of Nifty is sharply down. The overall negative chart pattern signals further downside to 24,700 levels in the near term. Immediate resistance is placed at 25,400,\" Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> The Nifty Bank had defended the 60,800 mark all through the week, but failed to do so on Friday. The index has closed at a very important support level of 60,500 and further downside could not be ruled out, particularly so if the markets open gap down on Monday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> \"Immediate support is placed around 59,800, followed by a stronger base near 59,000. Resistance is seen around the 61,000 zone,\" Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking said.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By James Mackintosh</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Forget AI. The big trade last year was to buy the idea that Europe has finally woken up to the need to spend big to defend itself.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But, after the best year ever for German defense stocks, investors now face the question of whether the trade is already over.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For those who haven't been paying attention, start with the case for investing in defense. Fracturing geopolitics and concern about U.S. defense guarantees have combined with Russia's assault on Ukraine to push European politicians, led by Germany, to commit to massive increases in military spending. The nationalistic shift and threats to supply chains have persuaded Europe to break with its traditional willingness to rely on foreign military suppliers, too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And not just Europe. \"There's been a fundamental shift in priorities away from economic efficiency and globalization towards national security and resilience,\" says Thomas Mucha, geopolitical strategist at Wellington Management.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Given all the extra money likely to come into defense companies, how could their stock prices not beat the market?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are two risks: Price and politics, where a lesson from the fall of the Berlin Wall should induce caution. Prices have soared, so a positive outlook for defense spending is already reflected in the jump in stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sure, Germany's spending has risen from just over 1% of gross domestic product a decade ago to more than 2% last year, with plans to rise to 3.5% before 2030. But German defense stocks — dominated by the tank maker Rheinmetall — more than tripled in the first nine months of last year, before easing a little.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Profits will rise a lot, but they need to. The German sector trades at 38 times forecast earnings, up from 20 times at the start of last year and far above the 15 times of the German market as a whole.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The politics argument is that as governments spend a lot more on defense, they will want to control how much of that leaks out again in the form of profits for shareholders. That's especially the case when companies are likely to be much more reliant on domestic sales than in the recent past.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We're talking about large public spending which will most likely be under scrutiny,\" says Vincent Mortier, chief investment officer at Amundi. \"The bigger they grow, the more there will be\" political pressure on margins, he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here we come to the lesson from the fall of the Berlin Wall. U.S. weapons manufacturers actually performed better in the years since the end of the Cold War than during it. That's despite U.S. military spending plummeting from around 7% of the economy in 1988 to about 3.7% today, as politicians spent the peace dividend elsewhere.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From just before the Wall fell to now, the \"guns\" sector had the third-best total return out of 49 U.S. sectors defined by Kenneth French, a Dartmouth finance professor. It came in behind software and microchips. Aerospace, where major defense stocks including Boeing sit, also did well, coming in sixth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But from 1963 to 1988 the double splurge in spending for Vietnam and the Cold War did little to help military stocks. They came in 25th. At the top were the sectors that might be more associated with a peace dividend: tobacco (\"smoke\" in Prof. French's definition), \"fun,\" \"meals\" and \"soda.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This counterintuitive ranking wasn't because the period included the Swinging Sixties. It's politics. For all the left-wing concern at the time about the military-industrial complex, profit margins were much lower in the 1980s than since 2010. They hit their highest in 2022, in data going back to the early 1980s.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some of the post-1989 margin improvement is because companies were allowed to merge, although that has been true of other sectors. Some of it is because corporate taxes came down. But I would argue a lot is because companies increasingly sell to foreign customers that have less ability to extract lower prices by pointing to fat profits.

Iranian state media said an explosion was heard in Tehran on Sunday morning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Saturday, Iran launched hundreds of missiles and drones in response to the initial attacks, targeting U.S. troops in the region and cities in Israel and Arab countries allied with Washington and leading to widespread flight cancellations in the region. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Pentagon said there were no U.S. deaths or injuries, but the strikes raised concerns of new risks for Americans. A senior U.S. intelligence official told Reuters that while the largest threat stemming from the attack was against U.S. military personnel in the Middle East, cyber attacks could also target critical U.S. infrastructure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dubai's international airport and its landmark Burj Al Arab hotel sustained damage and four people were injured. Abu Dhabi Airports said in a post on X that an incident at Zayed International Airport in the UAE's capital resulted in one fatality involving an Asian national and seven injuries.

Russia's U.N. envoy Vasily Nebenzya said Iran had been \"stabbed in the back\" and disputed the U.S. claim that preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon justified the attacks. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Senior U.S. officials said on Saturday that the latest talks showed Iran was not willing to give up its ability to enrich uranium, which the Iranians argued they wanted for nuclear energy but U.S. officials said would enable the country to build a nuclear bomb.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Dov Lieber in Tel Aviv, Alexander Ward in Washington and Laurence Norman in Berlin</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Israeli and U.S. military intelligence had long watched and waited for a rare opportunity: senior political and military leaders in Iran holding a meeting — where they could all be killed at once.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The day finally came Saturday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Intelligence officers had identified not just one meeting but three, Israeli officials said. And they had a fix on Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, Iran's top decision maker and spiritual leader.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The moment was so unique that U.S. and Israeli warplanes struck in full daylight. Israeli jets dropped 30 bombs on Khamenei's compound leaving it scorched and shattered. President Trump said the Iranian leader was killed in the strike.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Israel also said it had killed a number of other top political and military officials including Ali Shamkhani, a top security adviser to Khamenei; Mohammad Pakpour, commander of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps; and Defense Minister Amir Nasirzadeh.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The attacks once again highlighted the capabilities of Israel's intelligence services and its ability to catch its enemies vulnerable and unaware.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Everybody waited for a target at midnight, when there is cover of darkness,\" said Amos Yadlin, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, adding that Israel struck late at night at the start of its surprise attack on Iran last June. The daylight attack, he said, \"was a tactical surprise.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran hasn't said whether Khamenei is dead, but if confirmed, the ayatollah's killing would be a remarkable capstone on more than two years of war in which Israel has also killed the top leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, indirectly precipitated the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, and created the most severe crisis in Iran's regime in its half-century in power.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But it also ushers in a period of uncertainty and possible instability that alarms other Persian Gulf governments, and reveals an ambition for regime change that has led to frustrating failures for prior American administrations. Both Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu encouraged Iranians to rise up and take control of their country. Few activists or analysts say there is a clear path for them to do so.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran retaliated by striking at targets not only in Israel but across the Persian Gulf, with explosions in Dubai, Bahrain and Qatar — countries that aren't usually caught up in the region's wars. Israeli air defenses intercepted missiles over northern Israel, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Israel and the U.S. said they were continuing to carry out strikes. Officials said they could be heavy for days.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This fateful operation will continue as long as necessary, and it requires patience,\" Netanyahu said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the lead-up to the campaign, Israel's military brass had been flying in and out of Washington to plan the offensive, including its top general, air force chief, head of military intelligence and Mossad director. Netanyahu met with Trump in December at the president's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, where they agreed publicly that military action would be justified if Iran persisted in its nuclear and ballistic-missile programs, and met with him again in early February at the White House.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, Israeli intelligence was gathering targets in Iran and sharing them with the U.S., Israeli officials said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Iranian government's precarious hold on power came into focus with an outbreak of protests that started in late December and spread quickly around the country. Trump warned he would intervene if Iran killed protesters and came close to ordering a strike in mid-January, but his advisers convinced him the U.S. didn't have enough firepower in the region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump ordered the largest buildup of American firepower in the Middle East in two decades, dispatching two aircraft carriers, about a dozen destroyers and a host of advanced fighter planes to the seas and bases around Iran.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, the president reopened a diplomatic track, saying he would rather cut a deal than attack. The U.S. team pushed tough demands — Iran would have to dismantle its nuclear facilities, turn over its stockpile of uranium and give up nuclear enrichment, none of which were acceptable to Iran.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran appeared to show an openness to compromises that it had rejected outright in the past.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But one of its latest proposals would have left Iran with thousands of advanced centrifuges and permitted Iran to enrich uranium as much as 20% — far in excess of the initial caps on Iran's nuclear program under the 2015 nuclear deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Iranian position wasn't anywhere close to the token enrichment program the U.S. was willing to consider, U.S. officials said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump got on the phone Thursday with his two envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, U.S. officials said. They told him the talks had gone badly: Tehran wasn't willing to end its nuclear enrichment or dismantle its missile program, the officials said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That further confirmed for Trump that he had one option left, the officials said. The U.S. also had intelligence that Iran considered attacking American targets before Trump authorized strikes, a senior administration official said, adding a sense of urgency to the president's decision. U.S. casualties and damage to American interests would be higher unless the U.S. moved first, the senior official said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The attack began just before 10 a.m. Iran time with enormous waves of missiles and jets. By evening, about 200 Israeli fighters had struck close to 500 different targets, in the largest single air campaign in Israel's history, the Israeli military said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. forces struck hundreds of targets of their own and defended against hundreds of Iranian missile and drone attacks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Israeli strikes focused on high-value officials and Iran's missile capabilities, while the U.S. attacks went after missile infrastructure and military targets, people familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In parallel with the strikes, Israel hit Iran with broad cyberattacks that targeted media and phone apps with messages calling on Iranians to rise up against their government, said people familiar with the matter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Israel hacked an app widely that helps Muslims track prayer times and is widely used in Iran, causing it to send messages calling on Iran's armed forces to defect and telling the population that \"help has arrived.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The state news agency IRNA was also hacked. One message on its front page referred to the unfolding strikes, calling it \"A terrifying hour for the security forces of the Ayatollahs' regime; the IRGC and the Basij have suffered a crippling blow.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Dov Lieber at dov.lieber@wsj.com, Alexander Ward at alex.ward@wsj.com and Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The reason? AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The blowback was quick and severe.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After Block CEO Jack Dorsey announced that his financial-technology firm was laying off 4,000 people, text threads between workers outside Block erupted, while executives began furiously dissecting the move. And then, they went public.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Square is just the beginning,\" former Meta and Salesforce executive Clara Shih  warned on X.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"A lot of the jobs that we've thrown human beings at the last 20 or 30 years, you won't need as many human beings doing those same jobs,\" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy  said in a television interview Friday, while noting new roles will also be created.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Everyone will point the finger at everyone else,\" investor Brian Norgard predicted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some saw Block's move as evidence of the company's mismanagement and overhiring. Plenty raised concerns that other executives might now follow suit and more aggressively lay off their own employees.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even if some considered AI a convenient excuse for the layoffs, the downsizing sparked outrage among technology workers. Many viewed the move as the clearest sign yet that companies would be far smaller in the future — and that employees would bear the pain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"When things crystallize like this, it brings out the pitchforks and the torches,\" said Marc Cenedella, CEO of the jobs platform Ladders. \"People are angry at the destabilizing impact that AI is inevitably going to have on our economy and our work life.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Backlash to AI has been simmering for months. In a YouGov survey released in December, 77% of respondents said they worried AI could pose a threat to humanity. A separate survey from the Pew Research Center showed many people were more concerned than excited about AI. Fearing higher utility costs or job losses, communities around the country have sought to block or delay new data-center projects, part of growing resistance to such projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Until recently, AI messaging from the business and tech elite in public has been largely focused on the benefits to economic growth, innovation and, naturally, bottom lines. Yes, there may be a bumpy transition and many roles will change, but businesses and the broader economy will emerge more prosperous, creating a raft of new jobs, the narrative goes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now, as angst over the AI boom shows up in stock-market jitters and viral online posts, more executives are saying that a key part of harnessing AI's promise will be to confront the economic and societal upheaval that could come with it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"AI will create more productivity, but it could create other derivative effects,\" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told investors Monday. \"Laying those people off will cause a problem, even if it creates more productivity in society. That's why society's got to think this through a little bit. It may happen faster than we can adjust to it.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The vibe shift around AI has been undeniable of late.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fears of its more destructive potential have rippled through markets in recent weeks, sending the stocks of software makers, insurers and even food-delivery apps like DoorDash lower. A viral thought experiment by Citrini Research foretelling mass white-collar unemployment, cratering consumer spending and financial contagion tapped into deep anxieties about the technology both on Wall Street and among the broader public.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some AI leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have rebutted the doom-and-gloom scenarios. Huang told a conference in February that the idea that AI will replace software is \"the most illogical thing in the world.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Growing AI fears</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To white-collar workers, it doesn't feel that illogical, especially as more companies initiate layoffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thomas Kerr, an accountant in Cleveland, said he has told friends and professional acquaintances that they should prepare for white-collar jobs to go away, and to find a sense of meaning in potentially new occupations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's the industrial revolution — people going from farmland into factories — but we don't know what the factories are yet,\" Kerr said of the AI era. As people lose their jobs, \"we're going to have to help people holistically find purpose and to let them know it's OK, and it's not your fault, and it's not your boss's fault.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On earnings calls, more companies are mentioning AI when referencing layoffs, according to AlphaSense, a financial-research platform.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Companies are also more explicitly including the backlash to AI as a potential threat to their companies. The number of S&amp;P 500 companies that included AI as a material risk in securities filings jumped to 72% last year from 12% in 2023, according to an analysis by the Conference Board and ESGAUGE. The game maker Roblox puts it like this in its annual report: \"Failure to address AI ethics issues by us or others in our industry could undermine public confidence in our use of AI.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The disclosures reflect a reality, analysts say, that much remains unclear about AI. \"Companies have realized this is so transformative, and there's still so many unknowns, that they do have to make sure to disclose these risks because they could have large implications,\" said Sarah Hoffman, director of AI thought leadership at AlphaSense.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Smaller teams</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Block expanded rapidly during the pandemic, as it built out its Cash App business alongside Square. The payments firm ended 2019 with 3,835 workers and employed 12,985 people by the end of 2023. Dorsey wrote on X that the company had overhired during the pandemic, and told analysts that he also believed other companies would undertake similar restructurings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Within the next year, I believe the majority of the companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes,\" Dorsey told analysts. \"I don't think we're early to this realization. I think most companies are late.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many longtime technology executives agree.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Smaller teams do better than larger teams, always,\" Mo Koyfman, founder and general partner at the venture-capital firm Shine Capital, said in an interview. \"Every additional body that you throw at a problem adds more process, more bureaucracy, more politics, more inefficiency, more coordination.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The rapid pace of change with AI has also led to a shift in how executives talk about AI. Many are beginning to be far more candid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since taking the top job at the telecom giant Verizon last fall, CEO Dan Schulman has predicted that artificial intelligence could trigger 20% to 30% unemployment over the next two to five years. He warns that humanoid robots might encroach on the manual-labor jobs some see as AI-proof. And he has called for more reskilling efforts to help tame the coming tech storm.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We are at a precipice right now that if you say to your employees there's not gonna be any job disruption, I think you lose all credibility — because all of them get it that there's going to be,\" Schulman said in a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, earlier this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Verizon said in November it planned to cut more than 13,000 jobs, its largest reduction ever. As part of the move, the company also created a $20 million reskilling and career-transition fund for affected workers. Verizon has said its layoffs weren't related to AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite his warnings, Schulman is also an AI believer. The technology is likely to lead to breakthroughs in health, material science, longevity and other realms, he has said. \"Ideas are going to blossom, and maybe there'll be a bunch of new jobs that happen as a result,\" he said in January.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For bosses to maintain trust, they must be transparent with workers about what is happening, said Arianna Huffington, CEO of the behavior-change company Thrive Global, who has served on the boards of Uber Technologies and other companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With AI, \"it's not like we know exactly the impact it's going to have on jobs,\" Huffington said in an interview. \"But, of course, it's going to have an impact on jobs.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Chip Cutter at chip.cutter@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
