(the \"Company\") </span><span>, the holding company for Somerset Regal Bank (the \"Bank\"), announced net income of $693,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2025 (unaudited), or $0.09 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (unaudited). Excluding $303,000 of net accretion income related to fair value adjustments resulting from the acquisition of Regal Bank in September 2023, net income would have been $475,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2025. Excluding $1.0 million of net accretion income related to fair value adjustments resulting from the acquisition of Regal Bank in September 2023, net income would have been $627,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" contained herein for additional information.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total assets were $1.11 billion at September 30, 2025, an increase of $25.7 million, or 2.4%, from $1.08 billion at June 30, 2025. Net loans were $826.4 million, an increase of $29.2 million, or 3.7%, from $797.2 million at June 30, 2025. Total deposits were $869.6 million, an increase of $23.6 million, or 2.8%, from $846.0 million at June 30, 2025. The increase in loans was funded primarily through increased deposits and an additional $5.0 million of borrowings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>General. Net income decreased $674,000, or 49.3%, to $693,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to net income of $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 included $303,000 and $1.0 million, respectively, of net accretion income related to fair value adjustments resulting from the acquisition of Regal Bank in September 2023.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interest Income.  Interest income increased $468,000, or 4.1%, to $11.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from $11.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to a $50.6 million increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets, offset by a 6 basis point decrease in the yield. The increase resulted from a $609,000, or 5.9%, increase in interest income on loans, offset by a $64,000, or 12.3%, decrease in interest income on interest-bearing deposits at other banks and a $77,000, or 11.6%, decrease in interest income on securities. The increase in interest income on loans was due to a $60.7 million increase in the average balance of loans from $748.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to $809.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, offset by an 11 basis point decrease in the yield on loans. The decrease in interest income on securities was primarily due to a $14.5 million decrease in the average balance of securities resulting from maturities and repayments. The decrease in interest income on interest-bearing deposits at other banks was due to a 107 basis point decrease in the yield.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased $467,000, or 12.1%, to $4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from $3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to a $55.1 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and an nine basis point increase in the cost. The increase in the average balance was primarily due to a $22.6 million, or 187.4%, increase in the average balance of borrowings for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024 and an increase of $61.4 million, or 22.5%, in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits.  The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase of 51 basis points in the cost of interest-bearing deposits to 1.87% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from 1.36% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as the Bank raised rates on certain interest-bearing deposit products in an effort to remain competitive in the market area, offset by a 50 basis point decrease in the average rate of certificates of deposit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net Interest Income.  Net interest income was $7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively. Net interest rate spread decreased 14 basis points to 2.56% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from 2.70% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Net interest margin decreased 16 basis points to 3.05% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from 3.21% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Net interest-earning assets decreased $4.5 million, or 2.0%, to $219.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from $223.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in the Bank's net interest rate spread and net interest margin were primarily a result of the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increasing while the yield on interest-earning assets decreased.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Provision for Credit Losses.  The Bank establishes provisions for credit losses, which are charged to operations to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level it considers necessary to absorb probable credit losses attributable to loans that are reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date. In determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Bank considers, among other factors, past and current loss experience, evaluations of real estate collateral, economic conditions, the type and volume of lending, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's repayment capacity, while adjusting for delinquency trends, classified or criticized loans, and other risk factors. The allowance is developed using reasonable and supportable forecasts and quantitative modeling techniques, combined with qualitative factors to address risks not captured in historical data, including emerging loan products or localized economic changes. Actual losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change. The Bank assesses the allowance for credit losses and records provisions for credit losses in the income statement on a quarterly basis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Bank recorded a provision for credit losses of $171,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2025 reflecting the loan growth during the period, compared to a recovery for credit losses of $154,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting updates made to the risk levels of certain qualitative factors in the calculation of the Bank's allowance. The Bank had no charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2025 or 2024. The Bank had no non-performing loans at September 30, 2025 and $9,000 of non-performing loans at September 30, 2024. The Bank's allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.67% at September 30, 2025 compared to 0.66% at September 30, 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Noninterest Income.  Noninterest income decreased $236,000, or 29.5%, to $565,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from $801,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in other income of $123,000 and a decrease in service charges and fees of $66,000 primarily due to a lower volume of account fees and card charges incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Noninterest Expense.  Noninterest expense increased $275,000, or 4.0%, to $7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from $6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a $613,000, or 18.9%, increase in salaries and employee benefits expense primarily driven by the recognition of stock-based compensation during the three months ended September 30, 2025, whereas no such expense was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was offset by a decrease of $210,000 in other expenses, driven by a decrease of $71,000 in the amortization expense of fair value adjustments resulting from the acquisition of Regal Bank in September 2023, a decrease of $96,000 in occupancy expenses due to the closure of a retail branch location and a decrease of $89,000 in data processing fees.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Income Tax Expense.  The provision for income taxes was $202,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $363,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Bank's effective tax rate was 22.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 21.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Assets increased $25.7 million, or 2.4%, to $1.11 billion at September 30, 2025 from $1.08 billion at June 30, 2025.

Cash and cash equivalents increased $526,000, or 0.9%, to $58.3 million at September 30, 2025 from $57.8 million at June 30, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Securities.

Loans receivable, net, increased $29.2 million, or 3.7%, to $826.4 million at September 30, 2025 from $797.2 million at June 30, 2025, driven by residential mortgage loan growth of $12.5 million and commercial loan growth of $16.0 million as a result of strong market demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Deposits. Deposits increased $23.6 million, or 2.8%, to $869.6 million at September 30, 2025 from $846.0 million at June 30, 2025. Increases in interest-bearing deposit accounts resulted from the Bank having raised rates on certain money market and time deposit accounts in an effort to remain competitive in the market area. At September 30, 2025, $116.9 million, or 13.4%, of total deposits consisted of noninterest-bearing deposits.

Equity decreased $1.8 million, or 1.0%, to $191.9 million at September 30, 2025 from $193.8 million at June 30, 2025.

All repurchased shares of common stock were retired upon acquisition and are no longer outstanding.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About Somerset Regal Bank</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Somerset Regal Bank is a full-service New Jersey commercial bank headquartered in Bound Brook, New Jersey that operates 14 branches in Essex, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union Counties, New Jersey.
