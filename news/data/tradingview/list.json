The franc's falls sparked speculation that the SNB intervened to curb its strength. However, it's difficult to verify this as estimates based on sight deposit data are often inaccurate and fourth-quarter figures aren't published until March, he says. Moreover, the SNB has repeatedly indicated it would only intervene if the franc moves significantly. Commerzbank's fourth-quarter forecast of 0.92 for the euro versus the franc has been almost reached, and it's \"unlikely to fall much further.\" The franc has fallen in recent days and last trades slightly weaker at 0.9283 per euro.

BlueBay had previously hoped that a continuation of the recent rally would give it the opportunity to add a short trade, but yields failed to reach levels where the asset manager hoped to pull the trigger on this, Dowding says. The two-year Treasury yield is flat at 3.608%, while the 30-year yield is up 2.1 basis point at 4.668%, according to Tradeweb.

Overall cargo throughput has slowed in the recent weeks and turned negative, as a higher base kicks in, Citi says. \"The positive signals from the U.S.-China presidential summit are clearly a sentiment relief, while the immediate economic impact could be smaller,\" the analysts say. If anything, the tariff reductions could provide some support for China's direct exports to the U.S. in 2026, they add. Citi expects China's exports be flat year-on-year in October.

The opposition is calling for Reeves to resign after she failed to obtain a license to rent out her home but Prime Minister Keir Starmer has backed her and her letting agent has taken responsibility. In July when Reeves appeared close to leaving, gilt fell sharply alongside sterling. Markets are wary that her resignation would \"herald more relaxed fiscal rules and additional borrowing at a time when gilt issuance remains elevated.\" Sterling falls 0.1% to $1.3141, while the euro rises 0.1% to 0.8802 pounds.

The ECB left interest rates unchanged, as expected, and gave few signals about future decisions. Price action is led more by Wednesday's Federal Reserve decision, when it cut rates as expected but said another cut in December wasn't a done deal. There's some speculation in the market that the euro could fall below $1.15 but this looks unlikely given prospects of further weak U.S. jobs data, Pesole says. The eurozone economy is also showing a slight improvement, he says. The euro trades steady at $1.1569, having hit a two-week low of $1.1546 Thursday, LSEG data show.

This comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates Wednesday but said rates wouldn't necessarily fall in December. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank held rates steady Thursday and pointed to a resilient economy. As U.S. and eurozone rate-cut expectations have fallen, so U.K. rate-cut expectations have also slipped. Money markets price a 62% chance of the Bank of England cutting rates by the end of 2025, down from 72% a week ago, LSEG data show.

KBW's earnings forecasts for the continent's banks assume that rates stay at that level until 2028. Another potential 25 basis point cut wouldn't move estimates much given that, as banks increase the resilience of their net interest income, each 25 basis point parallel shift is worth only around 1% of sector earnings.

Tech stocks fell on concerns over increased spending outlooks for Meta and Microsoft. Reduced market bets for another interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve in December following comments at Wednesday's meeting also weighed on risk appetite. Meanwhile, the U.S. and China agreed a trade truce but \"structural differences persist, and it's easy for there to be some skepticism of the deal's scope due to the lack of concrete commitments,\" Deutsche Bank analysts say in a note.

(renae.dyer@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0742 GMT - Asean looks set to continue benefiting from rising foreign direct investment and fixed investments, as the diversification of the manufacturing supply chain strengthens, Maybank economists and analysts write in a report. FDI in the region have largely held up, despite initial fears that higher U.S. reciprocal tariffs would dampen the region's appeal, they note. U.S. corporates, which are highly dependent on Chinese factories and sales, are facing more pressure to diversify their manufacturing bases given risks of abrupt U.S. tariff rates hike and Chinese authorities' regulatory actions. \"Fragmentation of U.S.-China tech supply chains will favor Asean as a more neutral investment destination,\" Maybank says.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

These assumptions include: the potential quantity, grade and metal content of the mineralized material at El Cubo and San Ignacio, the geotechnical and metallurgical characteristics of such material conforming to sampled results and metallurgical performance; available tonnage of mineralized material to be mined and processed; resource grades and recoveries; assumptions and discount rates being appropriately applied to production estimates; prices for silver, gold and other metals remaining as estimated; currency exchange rates remaining as estimated; availability of funds for the Company's projects and to satisfy current liabilities and obligations including debt repayments; capital, decommissioning and reclamation estimates; prices for energy inputs, labour, materials, supplies and services (including transportation) and inflation rates remaining as estimated; no labour-related disruptions; no unplanned delays or interruptions in scheduled construction and production; all necessary permits, licenses and regulatory approvals are received in a timely manner; and the ability to comply with environmental, health and safety laws. The foregoing list of assumptions is not exhaustive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements and information are neither promises nor guarantees, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause future results, level of activity, production levels, performance or achievements of GSilver to differ materially from those expected including, but not limited to, market conditions, availability of financing, currency rate fluctuations, high inflation and interest rates, geopolitical conflicts including wars, actual results of exploration, development and production activities, actual grades and recoveries of silver, gold and other metals from the Company's existing mines including El Cubo, Pinguico, San Ignacio, VMC and Topia, availability of third party mineralized material for processing, unanticipated geological or structural formations and characteristics, environmental risks, future prices of gold, silver and other metals, operating risks, accidents, labor issues, equipment or personnel delays, delays in obtaining governmental or regulatory approvals and permits, inadequate insurance, and other risks in the mining industry. There are no assurances that GSilver will be able to continue to increase production, tonnage milled and recoveries rates, improve grades and reduce costs at El Cubo, Pinguico, San Ignacio, VMC and/or Topia to process mineralized materials to produce silver, gold and other concentrates in the amounts, grades, recoveries, costs and timetable anticipated. In addition, GSilver's decision to process mineralized material from El Cubo, Pinguico, San Ignacio, VMC and Topia is not based on a feasibility study of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability and therefore is subject to increased uncertainty and risk of failure, both economically and technically. Mineral resources and mineralized material that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability, are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them, and may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, and other relevant issues. There are no assurances that the Company's projected grades of gold and silver at El Cubo and San Ignacio and the anticipated level of production therefrom will be realized. In addition, there are no assurances that the Company will meet its production forecasts or generate the anticipated cash flows from operations to satisfy its scheduled debt payments or other liabilities when due or meet financial covenants to which the Company is subject or to fund its exploration programs and corporate initiatives as planned. There is also uncertainty about impact of any future global pandemic, ongoing global conflicts, elevated inflation and interest rates and the impact they will have on the Company's operations, supply chains, ability to access mining projects or procure equipment, contractors and other personnel on a timely basis or at all and economic activity in general. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements or information.
