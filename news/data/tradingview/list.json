Net Income at €0.5bn on the back of strategic transformation and favorable environment - Strong operational performance across all businesses, especially in international markets - FY25 dividend of €0.60 per share</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>HELLENiQ ENERGY Holdings S.A. (the \"Company\") announced its FY25 consolidated financial results, with Adjusted EBITDA amounting to €1,132m and Adjusted Net Income to €503m. Strategic transformation benefits, a favorable international refining backdrop, strong operating performance across all our businesses, as well as increased international markets profitability, led to improved results.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In Downstream, refining production and sales volume remained high - at 15m MT and 15.6m MT respectively -, despite the Elefsina refinery turnaround.  This, alongside stronger refining margins and a improved international sales, partly aided by the launch of HELLENiQ Petroleum Trading operations in Geneva contributed to better realized margins. At the same time, contribution from Domestic and International Marketing was substantial, with historically high profitability.  Overall, international business accounts for a significant proportion of our profitability (~40%).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In Power, which includes Enerwave's results from July 2025 onwards and Renewables Energy Sources (RES), the creation of a new vertically integrated power and gas platform establishes a new profitability pillar; on a pro-forma basis, Adjusted EBITDA exceeds €100m.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>FY25 reported Net Income reached €173m (2024 at €60m), primarily due to inventory valuation impact on declining international crude oil prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Following FY25 financial results, the Board of Directors will propose to the Annual General Meeting the distribution of a final dividend of €0.40 per share. As a result, including the interim payment of €0.20 per share in January 2026, total dividend amounts to €0.60 per share (2024: €0.45€/share[1]). This distribution results in a total dividend yield of 7%, based on the share price at the end of 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Main developments - Strategy implementation</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Vision 2025 strategic plan was successfully completed ahead of schedule.  Its implementation yielded substantial, measurable results across all our businesses, leading to a significant performance uplift. Emphasis was placed on strengthening our core activities, while creating a strategic new pillar in the RES, electricity and natural gas sectors, further strengthening our position in the energy market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our strategy remains focused on value creation for shareholders through growth and continuous competitiveness improvement in Downstream, as well as further expansion in international markets. At the same time, we continue evolving the RES and Power &amp; Gas business into a standalone, vertically integrated platform, materialising synergies with other Group activities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In Refining, Supply &amp; Trading, our strategic initiatives include the implementation of projects that enhance energy autonomy and efficiency, the further development of digital transformation and the strengthening of our international presence through HELLENiQ Petroleum Trading. At the same time, we are evaluating growth investments in the Refineries facilities, along with sustainable fuels projects and carbon capture technologies, which are expected to contribute to the reduction of our environmental footprint.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In Marketing, investments and operational transformation in recent years are now consistently delivering strong results, both in Greece and internationally. Our strategy focuses on upgrading customer experience, expanding the company-controlled retail network in Greece and pursuing targeted expansion in Southeastern Europe. The re-opening of the Thessaloniki-Skopje pipeline after 13 years is a key milestone, an important development that improves access to Southeastern Europe markets, increasing opportunities for further growth in the region, while strengthening Greece's role as an energy hub in the region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our RES business is expanding with a target of 1.5 GW of installed capacity within the next three years. Our diversification is strengthened both geographically, with presence in five countries, as well as technologically, through a balanced mix of wind, PV and storage projects. A major milestone for the Group was the integration of Enerwave (formerly ELPEDISON), with redesigned commercial policy and services, following the relaunch of its corporate identity. The synergies between RES and Enerwave, as well as the Downstream business, create a strong vertically integrated pillar in electricity and natural gas, making a significant contribution to the Group's financial performance and growth. Furthermore, the acquisition of the portfolio and team of ABO Energy Hellas during the year strengthens our ability to accelerate development and enhance our implementation capabilities of new projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In Exploration &amp; Production, we are managing an expanded portfolio through HELLENiQ Upstream Holdings, maintaining smaller participation interests, but in partnership with larger and more experienced international groups. The recent signing, together with Chevron, of lease agreements with the Hellenic Republic for hydrocarbon exploration and production in four new offshore blocks in Greece, as well as the partnership with ExxonMobil and Energean in Block 2 in the NW Ionian, significantly strengthen the Group's portfolio. The exploratory drilling in Block 2, planned by the consortium in 2027, is expected to provide a clear assessment of the area's hydrocarbon potential.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lower crude oil prices - Higher international refining margins</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2025, crude oil prices declined, with Brent averaging $69/bbl, 15% lower y-o-y, while the EUR/USD strengthened to 1.13 on average vs 1.08 in 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Natural gas prices experienced a slight increase, +3% y-o-y on average. At the same time, electricity prices in Greece rose by 3% y-o-y, averaging €104/MWh, although they were down 8% y-o-y in 4Q25. CO₂ prices (EUAs) averaged €74/ton, 12% higher y-o-y.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During 2025, the global refining environment strengthened, reflecting a tighter supply-demand balance, driven by increased oil product demand growth in and ongoing supply disruptions. As a result, refining margins increased significantly, with our refineries system's benchmark margin averaging $7.5/bbl in 2025 vs $5.3/bbl in 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Increased fuel demand in all markets</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Domestic market demand in 2025 reached 6.9m MT, 2% higher y-o-y, with automotive fuels consumption increasing by 1.5% y-o-y. Demand for aviation fuels grew by 6%, while marine fuel consumption increased by 1%, driven by higher demand for marine diesel, following new sulfur content regulations in the Med, effective 1 May 2025. Overall, economic growth continues to support higher demand, while relatively low pre-tax prices in Euro terms, benefits consumers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Balance sheet and capital expenditure</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Operating cash flow in 2025 amounted to €0.67bn due to strong profitability. Capital expenditure, including the Enerwave acquisition, amounted to €757m, a historic high. Net debt reached €2.1bn, or €1.8bn excluding non-recourse project finance, while total financing costs were reduced by 8% y-o-y due to lower base rates and spreads.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Andreas Shiamishis, Group CEO, commented on the results:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"For the 4th consecutive year, Adjusted EBITDA exceeded €1bn, while FY25 Adjusted Net Income was above €0.5bn, significantly higher than in FY24. The results were achieved within a favorable refining environment, but also as a result of improvements in sectors less dependent on external factors. Marketing for instance recorded strong performance, with EKO claiming a leading position in all its markets in Greece and abroad. At the same time, our international trading activity has expanded, and growth has accelerated in new areas such as renewables and electricity. A new first for the Group is the set-up of a platform for our power and gas business, which is fully controlled.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The financial performance demonstrates the successful completion of the first phase of our strategic transformation, VISION 2025, which led to portfolio diversification, operational improvements, cultural change, and the adoption of a more effective governance framework. The past few years have been successful at strengthening and transforming the Group.  Examples are the establishment of HELLENiQ PETROLEUM Trading in Switzerland, enhancing the Group's international footprint and extroversion. The acquisition of Enerwave completed in 2025, creates a strong platform in renewables, electricity, and natural gas, with ambitions for further growth. In hydrocarbons exploration and production, as working with major international energy groups such as ExxonMobil and Chevron progressed, we doubled the exploration portfolio in Western and Southern Greece. Finally, the restart of Thessaloniki-Skopje pipeline operation for diesel transport opens up new opportunities to the Group's regional position and improves not only cost-to-serve but also safety and environmental footprint.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alongside our business performance, it is important to refer to the Group's substantial contribution to society. Through targeted social and environment protection initiatives in 2025, we create a positive impact on the daily lives of more than 2 million fellow citizens.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all HELLENiQ ENERGY employees for their contribution to the Company's progress, as well as to our shareholders for their continued support and trust.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Key highlights and contribution for each of the main business units in 4Q/FY25 were:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Refining, Supply &amp; Trading</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-  Refining, Supply &amp; Trading Adjusted EBITDA came in at €330m in 4Q25 and €891m in FY25, higher y-o-y, primarily due to higher refining margins ($16.4/bbl vd 13.3/bbl in FY24).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-  Refineries' production in FY25 amounted to 15m MT, -3% y-o-y, due to the scheduled three-month turnaround at the Elefsina refinery, while sales volume reached 15.6m MT. The launch of HELLENiQ Petroleum Trading in Geneva enabled improved crude oil supply and export opportunities during the year, with the latter accounting for 54% of total sales in FY25.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Petrochemicals</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-  Particularly weak polypropylene (PP) margins, due to oversupply, affected the profitability of the business, with FY25 Adjusted EBITDA amounting to €18m, lower y-o-y despite increased sales volume by 7%. Exports accounted for 64% of total sales, demonstrating the international orientation of the business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Marketing</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     In FY25, Domestic Marketing's Adjusted EBITDA increased by 46% to €71m, driven by higher sales volume and improved contribution from premium fuels and non-fuel sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     International Marketing's Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €89m (+18% y-o-y), a record high, primarily supported by improved sales volume and margins. The retail network expanded to 336 stations vs 329 in FY24.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>RES, Power &amp; Gas</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     In FY25, RES and Power &amp; Gas contributed €71m to Adjusted EBITDA compared to €46m in the corresponding period last year, primarily supported by the integration of Enerwave, which is consolidated in the Group's results from 15 July 2025. The total installed capacity in thermal units and RES amounted to 1,346 MW, while power production from RES and thermal units reached 3.7 TWh (pro forma) for 2025.</span></p><p

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies and persons involved in the Acquisition disclaim any responsibility or liability for the violation of such restrictions by any person. This announcement has been prepared in accordance with and for the purpose of complying with English law, the Takeover Code, the Market Abuse Regulation, the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the UK Listing Rules and information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside of the UK.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The availability of the Acquisition to Walker Crips Shareholders who are not resident in and citizens of the UK may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located or of which they are citizens.

In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the UK to vote their Voting Scheme Shares with respect to the Scheme at the Court Meeting, or to execute and deliver Forms of Proxy appointing another person to vote at the Court Meeting on their behalf, may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located.

Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any formal documentation relating to the Scheme and the Acquisition are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents (including, without limitation, custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute or send them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction.

An acquisition effected by means of a scheme of arrangement is not subject to the tender offer rules or the proxy solicitation rules under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"U.S. Exchange Act\"). Accordingly, the Acquisition is subject to the disclosure requirements and practices applicable in the UK to schemes of arrangement which differ from the disclosure requirements of the U.S. tender offer and proxy solicitation rules. Neither the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, nor any securities commission of any state of the United States, has approved or disapproved any offer, or passed comment upon the adequacy or completeness of any of the information included in this announcement. The financial information included in this announcement and the Scheme Document (or, if the Acquisition is implemented by way of an Offer, the Offer Document) has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United Kingdom and thus may not be comparable to financial information of U.S. companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If, in the future, PhillipCapital exercises its right, with the consent of the Panel (where necessary) and subject to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, to implement the Acquisition by way of an Offer, which is to be made into the United States, such Offer will be made in compliance with the applicable U.S. laws and regulations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It may be difficult for U.S. holders of Walker Crips Shares to enforce their rights and any claim arising out of the U.S. federal laws in connection with the Acquisition, since PhillipCapital and Walker Crips are located in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, and some or all of their officers and directors may be residents of a non-U.S. jurisdiction. U.S. holders of Walker Crips Shares may not be able to sue a non-U.S. company or its officers or directors in a non-U.S. court for violations of the U.S. securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel a non-U.S. company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a U.S. court's jurisdiction or judgement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In accordance with normal UK practice and pursuant to Rule 14e-5(b) of the U.S. Exchange Act, PhillipCapital, its nominees, or their brokers (acting as agents), may from time to time make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, Walker Crips Shares outside of the U.S., other than pursuant to the Acquisition, until the date on which the Acquisition becomes Effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private Acquisitions at negotiated prices and comply with applicable law, including the U.S. Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK, will be reported to the Regulatory News Service of the London Stock Exchange and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. Walker Crips Shareholders should be aware that the Acquisition contemplated herein may have tax consequences in the U.S. and, that such consequences, if any, are not described herein. U.S. Walker Crips Shareholders are urged to consult with legal, tax and financial advisers in connection with making a decision regarding this Acquisition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Forward-Looking Statements</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This announcement (including information incorporated by reference in this announcement), oral statements made regarding the Acquisition, and other information published by PhillipCapital and Walker Crips, contains statements which are, or may be deemed to be, \"forward-looking statements\". Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and projections of the management of PhillipCapital and Walker Crips (as applicable) about future events, and are therefore subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The forward-looking statements contained in this announcement include statements relating to the expected effects of the Acquisition on PhillipCapital and Walker Crips (including their future prospects, developments and strategies), the expected timing and scope of the Acquisition and other statements other than historical facts. Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as \"prepares\", \"plans\", \"expects\" or \"does not expect\", \"is expected\", \"is subject to\", \"budget\", \"projects\", \"synergy\", \"strategy\", \"scheduled\", \"goal\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"cost-saving\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\" or \"does not anticipate\", or \"believes\", or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"should\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements may include statements relating to the following: (i) future capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, dividend policy, losses and future prospects; (ii) business and management strategies and the expansion and growth of PhillipCapital, Walker Crips, any member of the PhillipCapital Group's or any member of the Walker Crips Group's operations and potential synergies resulting from the Acquisition; (iii) the effects of global economic conditions and governmental regulation on the business of any member of the PhillipCapital Group or any member of the Walker Crips Group; and (iv) the expected timing and scope of the Acquisition. Such forward-looking statements should therefore be construed in the light of such factors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Although PhillipCapital and Walker Crips believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, PhillipCapital and Walker Crips can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Today, several types of dentures are available, each designed to fit different needs and offered at varying costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Understanding denture costs can give you insight into the available options, helping you feel informed before speaking with a Miami dentist about the right fit for your situation. In this guide, we'll explain the various types of dentures and explore payment options and the associated expenses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Types of dentures available</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dentures come in different forms depending on the number of missing teeth that need to be replaced.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Full dentures are used when all the teeth in the upper and lower arches of the mouth are missing. They are custom-made to fit the shape of your mouth and rest directly on your gums. They restore the normal eating and speaking function of the mouth.1</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Partial dentures are used to replace a certain number of missing teeth while preserving the remaining natural teeth. They help fill the gaps by attaching to the remaining ones using small clasps while maintaining teeth alignment.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Implant-supported dentures are installed on dental implants screwed into the jawbone. They don't shift during eating or speaking, hence providing better stability than traditional dentures.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Immediate dentures are easily removable and placed on the gumline on the day of tooth removal. They are a temporary solution during healing and require adjustments as the gum changes shape.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Each denture type serves not just a different purpose but also differs in fit and stability, so ensure you make the right choice to fit your lifestyle needs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>What affects denture costs</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The national average cost for dentures in the United States can range anywhere from $452 to $6,514, depending on factors like the following:2</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The type of denture you choose:</span></strong><span> Complete dentures tend to be more expensive than partial dentures because they require more materials and labor to produce. Implant-supported dentures also cost more than traditional dentures, as they require dental implant treatment.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Materials used:</span></strong><span> Basic dentures made with acrylic are less expensive than those made with porcelain. Dentures made with metal frameworks like titanium are very durable, so the cost can be higher. Naturally, better materials usually mean better durability and appearance.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The level of customization:</span></strong><span> Choosing a premium option that is more detailed and custom fit to match your smile costs more than the standard fitting process due to the extra adjustments and precision work needed.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Preparatory work:</span></strong><span> Oral exams, tooth extractions if needed, pain management options, impressions, multiple fittings, and follow-up adjustments are all factors that affect denture costs.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Each individual has a different denture journey. Dentists in Miami should inform you of all viable options and provide a detailed cost breakdown during your consultation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Insurance and payment options</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Depending on the insurance coverage you have, a portion of denture costs is covered by your insurance plan. Coverage for complete and partial dentures differs, so it is important you understand your specific benefits and plan accordingly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a situation where your insurance doesn't cover all your costs, having a payment plan is necessary. In Miami, most dental offices offer financing options with flexible monthly payment arrangements that are not too demanding, and some even offer interest-free periods. Another way to finance your dentures is by using flexible spending accounts or health savings accounts funds to pay for dentures with pre-tax dollars. This reduces the expenses that come out of your pocket directly, especially if you plan your treatment around contribution periods.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most importantly, discuss options with a dentist, as this allows the financial coordinators to give you a detailed breakdown of costs, keeping you informed on all your options while finding an arrangement that best fits your budget.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The bottom line</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before getting dentures, you must understand the various types and what they cost, so you can plan properly. It is also important to ask the right questions of your Miami dentist, as their guidance can help you make the right choice.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>MIDLAND, TX / ACCESS Newswire / February 26, 2026 / Waste Energy Corp (OTCQB:WAST) (\"WEC\" or the \"Company\"), a clean-energy company converting non-recyclable waste into usable fuel and renewable energy products, today announced that is will present at the Clean Energy &amp; Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5, 2026, hosted by OTC Markets Group. Management will walk through the Company's waste conversion model, its first facility in Midland, Texas, and the operational milestones it expects to hit as commissioning draws near.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Permian Basin: A Deliberate Starting Point</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Midland facility wasn't placed in the Permian Basin by accident. The region offers something most early-stage energy infrastructure companies spend years chasing established distribution networks, industrial-scale fuel demand, and a deep base of energy capital that understands long-cycle infrastructure investment. Waste tire feedstock is also concentrated in the area, reducing inbound logistics costs and simplifying supply chain management.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Management sees the Permian not just as a first market, but as a template. If the model works here, it travels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>What the Facility Actually Does</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Running Phase 1 at full capacity 30 tons per day, 330 days a year, the Midland plant is designed to process around 10,000 tons of waste tires annually. That's north of 300,000 passenger tires, or roughly 140,000 heavy truck tires, every year. Beyond the headline fuel output, the process recovers carbon black, syngas to run the system and high grade steel, all of which have established regional buyers. Steel alone could represent 990 to 1,485 tons of recoverable material annually, based on typical tire composition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company is also working with local partners on landfill diversion and tire stockpile remediation in the Permian Basin, a community angle that has drawn interest from regional stakeholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Rethinking How Carbon Credits Get Made</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The voluntary carbon market has a credibility problem. Credits get challenged, methodologies get disputed, and human reporting introduces errors that undermine confidence in the underlying asset. Waste Energy Corp has filed a patent for a system designed to fix that at the source.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company's patent-pending carbon credit automation system uses on-site video monitoring and sensor data to capture the conversion process in real time. That data is then run through a carbon credit algorithm when a match is confirmed, a credit is created automatically, minted as an NFT, and deposited directly into a digital wallet. The credits will be tradeable on the Company's own blockchain-based platform.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The logic is straightforward: remove the human from the reporting chain, and you remove the most common source of error and dispute. The result is a carbon credit with a verifiable, immutable record of exactly how and when it was generated, something the market has struggled to produce consistently.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For investors, this matters beyond the environmental angle. A carbon credit with a clean chain of custody and blockchain-based provenance is a more defensible asset. It's also a potential competitive advantage as regulators and institutional buyers apply increasing scrutiny to voluntary market integrity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Carbon Credit Opportunity</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Based on combustion-equivalent emission factors, full-capacity throughput at the Midland facility could translate to roughly 12,800 metric tons of CO₂e annually. Whether that supports a meaningful credit position still depends on third-party validation and registry methodology, a process that hasn't concluded. Conservative estimates put potential annual credits in the 7,000 to 17,000 range, with a theoretical ceiling around 22,000 to 28,000. Management isn't booking that revenue yet, but the automated issuance system is designed to make the validation process faster, cleaner, and more defensible when it does get there.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Midland Facility Commissioning &amp; Timelines</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Midland facility is approaching commissioning. Management has committed to regular updates tied to actual milestones production ramp, first revenue, and expansion decisions rather than forward-looking timelines that tend to slip.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We are building Waste Energy Corp around disciplined execution and measurable results,\" said Scott Gallagher, Chairman &amp; CEO. \"Our first priority is to demonstrate a model that works operationally and economically. The Permian Basin deployment is not simply a site launch, it is the foundation for a scalable environmental infrastructure platform designed to generate diversified revenue streams, including fuel, recovered materials, and carbon-linked assets.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gallagher continued, \"As we move toward commissioning, transparency becomes increasingly important. During the March 5th presentation, I will provide a clear framework outlining our expected path to revenue for the Midland facility. Shareholder value is created through execution, consistency, and scale and our focus in 2026 is to deliver on each of those.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The broader context isn't lost on the Company either. U.S. electricity demand hit record highs in 2025 and is projected to keep climbing, driven largely by the data center and AI infrastructure buildout that shows no sign of slowing. Data center electricity demand has grown more than 400% over the past decade. Carbon credits, and U.S. data center power demand is forecast to reach 134 gigawatts by 2030, nearly triple current levels. That kind of structural demand creates a sustained need for new domestic energy sources, particularly ones that don't require greenfield grid infrastructure. Waste Energy Corp's model, modular, deployable near existing waste streams, and producing fuel that can flow through established regional distribution networks is designed for exactly that environment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, institutional capital continues its rotation toward ESG-aligned infrastructure. Corporate power purchase agreements for zero-carbon electricity reached 29.5 gigawatts in 2025, the highest annual total on record, a signal that large buyers are actively seeking credible, verifiable clean energy and carbon assets. The Company believes its combination of waste diversion, domestic fuel production, and blockchain-verified carbon credits positions it squarely in that flow of capital. The Midland facility will ultimately have to prove the model but the market conditions for doing so have rarely been better aligned.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Conference Details</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Waste Energy Corp will present at the Clean Energy &amp; Renewables Virtual Investor Conference on March 5, 2026.
