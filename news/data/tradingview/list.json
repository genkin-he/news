The Company operates through three segments: Urban Solutions, Energy Solutions, and Mission Solutions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Throughout 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, Fluor's Urban Solutions segment accounted for the largest portion of the Company's revenue and profit. The Urban Solutions segment offers EPC and project management services to the advanced technologies and manufacturing, life sciences, mining and metals, and infrastructure industries, as well as provides professional staffing services. The Company's infrastructure projects in this segment include work on, </span><em><span>inter alia</span></em><span>, the Gordie Howe International Bridge (\"Gordie Howe\"), as well as the Interstate 365 Lyndon B. Johnson (\"I-635/LBJ\") and Interstate 35E (\"I-35\") highways in Texas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In February 2025, Fluor provided financial guidance for the full year (\"FY\") of 2025, including adjusted EBITDA of $575 million to $675 million and adjusted earnings per share (\"EPS\") of $2.25 per share to $2.75 per share. Defendants reaffirmed the foregoing financial guidance in May 2025, notwithstanding their acknowledgement of the potential negative impacts of ongoing economic uncertainty on Fluor's business resulting from trade tensions and other market conditions. Contemporaneously, Defendants touted, </span><em><span>inter alia</span></em><span>, the purported health and stability of Fluor's and its customers' operations and the strength of the Company's risk mitigation strategy, both for itself and its clients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding Fluor's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) costs associated with the Gordie Howe, I-635/LBJ, and I-35 projects were growing because of, </span><em><span>inter alia</span></em><span>, subcontractor design errors, price increases, and scheduling delays; (ii) the foregoing, as well as customer reduction in capital spending and client hesitation around economic uncertainty, was having, or was likely to have, a significant negative impact on the Company's business and financial results; (iv) accordingly, Fluor's financial guidance for FY 2025 was unreliable and/or unrealistic, the effectiveness of the Company's risk mitigation strategy was overstated, and the impact of economic uncertainty on the Company's business and financial results was understated; and (v) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On August 1, 2025, Fluor issued a press release reporting its financial results for the second quarter (\"Q2\") of 2025. Among other results, the press release reported Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.43, missing consensus estimates by $0.13, and revenue of $3.98 billion, representing a 5.9% year-over-year decline and missing consensus estimates by $570 million. Defendants blamed these disappointing results on, </span><em><span>inter alia</span></em><span>, growing costs in multiple infrastructure projects due to subcontractor design errors, price increases, and scheduling delays, as well as reduced capital spending by customers. The same press release also provided a negatively revised financial outlook for FY 2025, guiding to adjusted EBITDA of $475 million to $525 million, down significantly from Defendants' prior guidance of $575 million to $675 million, and adjusted EPS of $1.95 per share to $2.15 per share, down significantly from Defendants' prior guidance of $2.25 per share to $2.75 per share, citing \"client hesitation around economic uncertainty and its impact on new awards and project delays and results for the quarter[.]\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The same day, Fluor hosted a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss the Company's Q2 2025 financial results.

Even the best deals often require paying large, fixed premiums - whether or not you ever need to file a claim.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's clear that the insurance system isn't built to benefit responsible drivers. Maybe it's time to look for an innovative solution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Meet GDM: A New Way for Safe Drivers to Save</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Enter GDM (Good Driver Mutuality)- an AI-powered platform that reimagines how accident costs are shared. GDM isn't insurance; it's a mutuality system where responsible drivers support each other by contributing only when needed. The platform rewards careful driving and builds a trusted community focused on lowering costs through safety and accountability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What makes GDM different is transparency and technology. Here's how it works:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When you join GDM, you pay just 20% of your quote upfront as a service fee. The remaining 80% stays in your own bank account as a Pledge Amount. If you remain accident-free, your Pledge Amount is only used to help others through Weekly Sharing - and any unused Pledge Amount at the end of the six-month period stays as your surplus.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Each week, GDM announces Eligible Events and details for all members to see. This level of openness ensures that everyone knows exactly how funds are being used, creating a system that feels fair, modern, and community-driven.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>GDM also screens its members carefully, inviting only safe, responsible drivers to join. The result is a transparent, trustworthy environment where members share mutual respect and genuine support.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Real Story: How Mary Took Back Control</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mary, a mom from Silicon Valley, had always paid her car insurance without much thought - until she bought a new car for her 18-year-old son. Over the next two years, the family's auto costs skyrocketed. By 2025, she received a bill so high it made her pause.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We haven't had an accident in years,\" Mary said, \"but we're paying what feels like half a year's salary to our insurance company. It just didn't make sense.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's when she discovered GDM. She kept her existing liability insurance and added GDM as an alternative to collision and comprehensive coverage. If no incidents occurred during her six-month period, she could realize potential savings at the end. Plus, with GDM's network of over 5,000 partner repair shops, she felt confident help was always close by.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mary soon began sharing GDM with her friends:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's not just about saving money - it's about joining a community that rewards responsibility. That's what GDM stands for, and I love being part of that.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If rising premiums have left you frustrated, GDM could be the smarter alternative you've been waiting for. Join today to experience a more transparent, fair, and affordable way to drive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Good Driver Mutuality</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Good Driver Mutuality (GDM) is an innovative non-insurance alternative to collision and comprehensive insurance, fostering a strong network of responsible drivers who share automotive repair costs. By leveraging AI-powered technology and rewarding safe driving habits, GDM helps reduce accidents and lower costs for its members, ultimately enhancing road safety.
