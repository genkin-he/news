and (ii) other net income and losses not related to the performance of the investment portfolio.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company has three primary variables that impact its performance: (i) net interest margin on assets held within the investment portfolio; (ii) realized and unrealized gains or losses on assets held within the investment portfolio, including any impairment or reserve for expected credit losses; and (iii) the Company's operating expenses and taxes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company's definition of earnings available for distribution excludes certain realized and unrealized losses, which although they represent a part of the Company's recurring operations, are subject to significant variability and are generally limited to a potential indicator of future economic performance. Within other net income and losses, management primarily excludes equity-based compensation expenses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With regard to non-capitalized transaction-related expenses, management does not view these costs as part of the Company's core operations, as they are considered by management to be similar to realized losses incurred at acquisition. Non-capitalized transaction-related expenses generally relate to legal and valuation service costs, as well as other professional service fees, incurred when the Company acquires certain investments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Management believes that the adjustments to compute \"earnings available for distribution\" specified above allow investors and analysts to readily identify and track the operating performance of the assets that form the core of the Company's activity, assist in comparing the core operating results between periods, and enable investors to evaluate the Company's current core performance using the same financial measure that management uses to operate the business. Management also utilizes earnings available for distribution as a financial measure in its decision-making process relating to improvements to the underlying fundamental operations of the Company's investments, as well as the allocation of resources between those investments, and management also relies on earnings available for distribution as an indicator of the results of such decisions. Earnings available for distribution excludes certain recurring items, such as gains and losses (including impairment) and non-capitalized transaction-related expenses, because they are not considered by management to be part of the Company's core operations for the reasons described herein. As such earnings available for distribution is not intended to reflect all of the Company's activity and should be considered as only one of the factors used by management in assessing the Company's performance, along with GAAP comprehensive (loss)/income which is inclusive of all of the Company's activities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company views earnings available for distribution as a consistent financial measure of its portfolio's ability to generate income for distribution to common stockholders. Earnings available for distribution does not represent and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, comprehensive (loss)/income or as a substitute for, or superior to, cash flows from operating activities, each as determined in accordance with GAAP, and the Company's calculation of this financial measure may not be comparable to similarly entitled financial measures reported by other companies. Furthermore, to maintain qualification as a REIT, U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that the Company distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income annually, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. Because the Company views earnings available for distribution as a consistent financial measure of its ability to generate income for distribution to common stockholders, earnings available for distribution is one metric, but not the exclusive metric, that the Company's board of directors uses to determine the amount, if any, and the payment date of dividends on common stock. However, earnings available for distribution should not be considered as an indication of the Company's taxable income, a guaranty of its ability to pay dividends or as a proxy for the amount of dividends it may pay, as earnings available for distribution excludes certain items that impact its cash needs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reconciliation of GAAP Comprehensive (Loss)/Income to Earnings Available for Distribution</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>($ in thousands except per share amounts)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The table below provides a reconciliation of earnings available for distribution to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:</span></p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><span> </span><br/><span>                                             Three months ended </span><br/><span>                                   --------------------------------------- </span><br/><span>                                    September 30, 2025     June 30, 2025 </span><br/><span>                                   --------------------  ----------------- </span><br/><span>Comprehensive (loss)/income -- </span><br/><span> GAAP                               $             (381)   $       1,393 </span><br/><span>Adjustments: </span><br/><span>    Net income attributable to </span><br/><span>     noncontrolling interest                        --                1 </span><br/><span>    Realized and unrealized gains                 (272)          (1,265) </span><br/><span>    Other adjustments(1)                           (47)               5 </span><br/><span>                                       ---------------       ---------- </span><br/><span>Earnings Available for </span><br/><span> Distribution -- Non-GAAP           $             (700)   $         134 </span><br/><span>                                       ===============       ========== </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Weighted average shares - basic             45,422,527       45,418,752 </span><br/><span>Weighted average shares - diluted           45,422,527       45,420,364 </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Basic Earnings Available for </span><br/><span> Distribution per common share      $            (0.02)   $        0.00 </span><br/><span>Diluted Earnings Available for </span><br/><span> Distribution per common share      $            (0.02)   $        0.00 </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>_________________________ </span><br/><span>(1)    Other adjustments include amortization and income taxes. </span><br/><span> </span></pre><p class=\"\"><span>CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This press release contains certain information which constitutes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The ECB targets an inflation rate of 2%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The slowdown was largely due to a smaller increase in food prices over the year through October.

But inflation could also pick up if the tariffs scramble global supply chains.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We will take the necessary measures and steps on the basis of data, meeting by meeting, to make sure that we stay in a good place,\" Lagarde said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The ECB's economists expect the inflation rate to fall further in 2026 and average just 1.7%, before picking up to 1.9% in 2027. The central bank Friday said that economists at banks and other institutions it surveyed in early October expect inflation to be 1.8% next year, and 2% in 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a separate report summarizing its recent contacts with eurozone businesses, the ECB said they had reported a \"further slight slowdown\" in their selling prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This was mainly driven by price moderation in the services sector, reflecting some cooling in price growth in labour-intensive sectors such as hospitality,,\" the ECB said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Policymakers have said they wouldn't change the key rate in response to what they perceive as short-lived deviations in the pace of price rises from their target, but would respond to larger shocks that threaten to move inflation away from 2% for a prolonged period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
