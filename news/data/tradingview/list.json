The reduction of the metal entitlement by the total expense ratio (which may be varied by the Issuer in certain circumstances with notice to securityholders) and the imposition of the fees on subscriptions and buy-backs may prove unattractive to investors who are interested solely in the price movement of precious metals and there can be no assurance that the performance of the Metal will be sufficient to offset the effect of the total expense ratio and such fees.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·      The Issuer may elect to redeem all the Securities of the Series early on giving not less than 10 calendar days' notice to securityholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·      VAT may become due on transfers of Metal to or by the Issuer in certain circumstances.

The underlying \"Metal\" for the ETC Securities is: gold.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Each ETC Security relates to a specific amount in weight of Metal, specified in the Final Terms, known as the \"Metal Entitlement per ETC Security\".</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On any particular day, the ETC Security can be viewed as giving an exposure to that ------amount of Metal as the amount payable in respect of each ETC Security and the value per ETC Security (the \"Value per ETC Security\") is linked to the value of the Metal. In order to back its obligations under the ETC Securities, the Issuer will seek to hold enough Metal to meet its obligations under the ETC Securities. The precise amount it holds at any time may be more or less than the aggregate amount of the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security to reflect the periodic payment of product fees. The proceeds from the disposal of the underlying Metal, plus any interest received on the proceeds of such disposal less any negative interest, net of any deductions, will equal the amount due under the ETC Securities (subject to certain minimum amounts owed).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Metal will be held for the Issuer by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (or any successor or replacement) (the \"Secured Account Custodian\") and will be generally held on an \"allocated\" basis. This means that specifically identifiable physical items of the Metal are allocated to the Issuer and are segregated from metal held for other clients of the custodian. However, for operational purposes, small amounts of Metal may be held on an \"unallocated\" basis. This means that the Secured Account Custodian maintains an account in the name of the Issuer which shows them as being entitled to delivery of a particular amount of the Metal but without specific physical metal having been identified. Where Metal is held on an \"unallocated\" basis the right to delivery is a purely contractual right and, as such, the Issuer is an unsecured creditor of the custodian and is exposed to the credit risk of the custodian.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Security</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The obligations of the Issuer under the ETC Securities will be secured pursuant to a security deed governed by the laws of Ireland and a security deed governed by English law by security interests over the rights of the Issuer under the agreements entered into by it in respect of the ETC Securities and any underlying Metal. The assets and property that are the subject of such security interests are known as \"Secured Property\" for this Series. Securityholders will not, by reason of holding such Series, have any claim against the Secured Property with respect to any other series of ETC Securities. The security will become enforceable if payment of the redemption amount in respect of such ETC Securities is not made when due on the Scheduled Maturity Date or the Scheduled Early Redemption Date (defined below) (if applicable).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Final Redemption Amount</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the Scheduled Maturity Date, each ETC Security will become due and payable at an amount (the \"Final Redemption Amount\") equal to the greater of (i) the Final Metal Redemption Amount (defined below) plus the Specified Interest Amount (defined below) and (ii) 10 per cent. of the issue price per ETC Security as at the series issue date (the \"Minimum Debt Principal Amount\") plus the Specified Interest Amount. The \"Final Metal Redemption Amount\" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Final Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the volume-weighted average prices per metal unit at which the Metal Agent (defined below) is able to sell the underlying Metal (\"Average Metal Sale Price\") during the Final Redemption Disposal Period (defined below).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The \"Final Redemption Disposal Period\" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Final Redemption Valuation Date.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Final Redemption Valuation Date\" is the date specified in the Final Terms  or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Specified Interest Amount\" is the amount of interest per ETC Security equal to that ETC Security's pro rata share of the amount of interest which has accrued (if any) on the proceeds of realisation of the underlying Metal deposited into the Series Cash Account (defined below) during or relating to the relevant redemption disposal period. Whilst interest may accrue at a positive, zero or negative rate on the Series Cash Account, the Specified Interest Amount is subject to a minimum of zero and any negative interest shall instead be deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the underlying Metal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Early Redemption Amount</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If any of the early redemption events occur, each ETC Security will become due and payable at an amount (the \"Early Redemption Amount\") equal to the greater of (i) the Early Metal Redemption Amount (defined below) plus the Specified Interest Amount and (ii) the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The \"Early Metal Redemption Amount\" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Early Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the Average Metal Sale Price during the Early Redemption Disposal Period (defined below).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The \"Early Redemption Disposal Period\" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Early Redemption Valuation Date.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The \"Scheduled Early Redemption Date\" is the 8th business day following the Early Redemption Disposal Period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The \"Early Redemption Valuation Date\" is the date of the occurrence of an early redemption event or the date on which the Trustee gives notice that, due to the occurrence of an event of default, the ETC Securities shall become due and payable at their Early Redemption Amount on the Scheduled Early Redemption Date, or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There can be no assurance that the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, will be greater than or equal to the amount invested by any securityholder.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the Final Metal Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, plus the Specified Interest Amount falls below the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount, then due to the limited recourse nature of the ETC Securities, securityholders are unlikely to receive payment of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, in full and may receive zero.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount per ETC Security, as applicable, will be determined by reference to the Average Metal Sale Price of the underlying Metal held in respect of the ETC Securities sold during the Final Redemption Disposal Period or Early Redemption Disposal Period, as applicable, by JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (or any successor or replacement) as \"Metal Agent\", net of associated deductions and taxes. The Issuer will, on or prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date or Scheduled Early Redemption Date, publish the determination of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, (which shall include publication of the price, volume and date of each sale of underlying Metal during the relevant redemption disposal period, including information on any fees, deductions and/or taxes imposed on such sale, and the determination of the Average Metal Sale Price) on the website maintained on behalf of the Issuer at www.etf.dws.com (or such other website notified by the Issuer for the ETC Securities from time to time).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Metal Agent will pay the aggregate proceeds of such disposals (converted, if necessary, into the currency of the ETC Securities) to the cash account for the Series (the \"Series Cash Account\") maintained by J.P. Morgan SE as \"Account Bank\" as directed by the Programme Administrator (defined below).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interest</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The ETC Securities will not pay periodic interest. On early or final redemption of the ETC Securities, a Specified Interest Amount may be payable by the Issuer as part of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount payable per ETC Security, as the case may be.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fees</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The ETC Securities are subject to a product fee that accrues on a daily basis. Accrued product fee is paid by a daily reduction in the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security which, as a result of such reduction, operates as a charge on securityholders.

The company reported steady growth in revenue and active patient numbers, alongside significant progress in its clinical and product development pipelines.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Financial Highlights</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>For the third quarter of 2025, Novocure reported total net revenues of $167.2 million, marking an 8% increase compared to the same period in 2024. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in active patient numbers and favorable exchange rate benefits amounting to $3.3 million. However, the company experienced a decline in gross margin to 73%, down from 77% in the previous year, due to the rollout of new products and increased costs associated with treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients prior to broad reimbursement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net loss for the quarter was $37.3 million, translating to a loss per share of $0.33. Adjusted EBITDA stood at $(3.0) million. As of September 30, 2025, Novocure held cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling $1,033.5 million.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Business and Operational Highlights</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>Novocure reported 4,416 active patients on TTFields therapy globally as of September 30, 2025. The company received 1,675 prescriptions for Optune Gio for the treatment of glioblastoma, a 7% increase from the same period in 2024. Additionally, there were 130 total prescriptions for Optune Lua, with 109 for NSCLC and 21 for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Geographically, the U.S., Germany, France, and Japan were significant contributors to revenue, with the U.S. market alone generating $96.6 million. Revenue from Novocure’s partnership with Zai Lab in Greater China totaled $5.6 million.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>In August 2025, Novocure’s premarket approval (PMA) application for the use of TTFields therapy in treating locally advanced pancreatic cancer was accepted for filing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This submission is supported by data from the Phase 3 PANOVA-3 trial. Additionally, the company announced the coverage of Optune Gio through the Spanish National Health System for newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In September 2025, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved the use of Optune Lua concurrently with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for adult patients with unresectable advanced/recurrent NSCLC who progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Management's Perspective</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>Ashley Cordova, CEO of Novocure, commented, “Q3 was a solid quarter with steady commercial execution in glioblastoma, geographic expansion, and material progress for our clinical and product development pipelines. With four indications expected in market by year-end 2026, we are well on our way to becoming a platform therapy company — and we remain sharply focused on reaching profitability and expanding patient impact.”</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Future Outlook</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>Looking ahead, Novocure plans to submit a PMA application to the FDA for the treatment of brain metastases from NSCLC based on results from the Phase 3 METIS clinical trial in Q4 2025.
