These statements relate to, among other things, the company's financial condition, strategic initiatives, and the timeline of the consummation of the asset purchase agreement. These forward-looking statements are based on Sonim's current expectations, estimates and projections about its business and industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by Sonim, all of which are subject to change. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"achieve,\" \"aim,\" \"ambitions,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"committed,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"designed,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"forecast,\" \"future,\" \"goals,\" \"grow,\" \"guidance,\" \"intend,\" \"likely,\" \"may,\" \"milestone,\" \"objective,\" \"on track,\" \"opportunity,\" \"outlook,\" \"pending,\" \"plan,\" \"position,\" \"possible,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"progress,\" \"promises,\" \"roadmap,\" \"seek,\" \"should,\" \"strive,\" \"targets,\" \"to be,\" \"upcoming,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" and variations of such words and similar expressions or the negative of those terms or expressions. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to vary materially from those expressed in or indicated by the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, the following: the availability of cash on hand; potential material delays in realizing projected timelines; Sonim's ability to meet expectations regarding the timing and completion of the declared strategic initiatives to return value to stockholders; Sonim's ability to complete the asset purchase agreement and the consequences if Sonim fails to do so; Sonim's ability to consummate a strategic transaction complementary to the asset purchase agreement and ensure the continuation of its business following the disposition of the legacy business; Sonim's material dependence on its relationship with a small number of customers who account for a significant portion of Sonim's revenue; Sonim's entry into the data device sector could divert our management team's attention from existing products; risks related to Sonim's ability to comply with the continued listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market and the potential delisting of Sonim's common stock; Sonim's ability to continue to develop solutions to address user needs effectively, including its next-generation products; the U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs; Sonim's reliance on third-party contract manufacturers and partners; Sonim's ability to stay ahead of the competition; Sonim's ongoing transformation of its business; the variation of Sonim's quarterly results; the lengthy customization and certification processes for Sonim's wireless carrier customers; various economic, political, environmental, social, and market events beyond Sonim's control, as well as the other risk factors described under \"Risk Factors\" included in Sonim's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent quarterly filings on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (available at www.sec.gov).

We've nearly tripled our land position to 56,000 hectares and gained control of a district-scale opportunity in one of the world's most underexplored gold belts. What excites me most is the quality of targets we've just added. We have immediate opportunities to extend Upper Antino's high-grade gold mineralization along a 1,000-metre strike extension supported by historical auger data. In the northern part of the new area, there's a multi-kilometre network of high-grade shears plus a separate auger anomaly-larger than Upper Antino-that has never seen a drill hole.
