Trump warned the mission could involve American casualties and said the objective is to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

Price is now sitting on the first meaningful support zone between $62.8K and $64K. The outlook from here is straightforward. Holding and closing back above the gray box could keep BTC chopping within the $62.8K–$66K range in the near term. However, sustained closes below this zone shift focus to $60K.

Through UTA Loan, users can borrow assets via Auto Borrow, triggered automatically by trading activity, or Manual Borrow, initiated in advance. With the introduction of fixed-rate borrowing, users can now choose between floating-rate flexibility and fixed-rate cost certainty, while maintaining access to up to 10x leverage for eligible trading activities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The new fixed-rate option represents a significant expansion of UTA Loan, which previously focused on floating-rate borrowing with interest calculated on an hourly basis and without predefined loan maturities, a structure primarily suited for short-term funding needs. By contrast, the new fixed-rate option allows users to lock in both interest rate and loan duration in advance, enabling longer-term planning while maintaining access to higher leverage of up to 10x under UTA.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Effective Feb. 28, 2026, at 8 a.m. UTC, users can access fixed-rate borrowing through Manual Borrow in UTA, with predefined loan tenors ranging from short-term durations to extended borrowing periods of up to 180 days. Users can access fixed-rate borrowing by navigating to Assets → Unified Trading Account → Borrow. Once approved, borrowing quotas are reserved for the selected term, providing clearer expectations around funding availability and cost over the life of the loan.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By pairing longer-dated fixed-rate borrowing (up to 180 days) with leverage available for eligible activities under UTA — including spot margin trading with leverage of up to 10x — Bybit enables users to deploy leveraged strategies over longer horizons with greater visibility into financing costs. In the broader crypto market, fixed-rate loans are typically limited to shorter durations or offered separately from leveraged trading frameworks, making this integrated structure within UTA notably uncommon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the fixed-rate model, both the interest rate and maturity date are confirmed at the time of borrowing and remain unchanged throughout the loan term. This structure is designed for users who prioritize cost predictability when managing leveraged positions beyond short-term market movements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The fixed-rate UTA Loan also supports continued borrowing within the original loan period. If a loan is repaid before maturity, users may re-borrow during the remaining term without additional interest, while the original maturity date remains unchanged, improving capital efficiency within the same borrowing window.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With the addition of fixed-rate borrowing, extended loan durations of up to 180 days, and access to higher leverage within UTA, Bybit continues to expand its unified account framework to support more structured and long-term capital management in the digital asset market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the maximum fixed-rate loan term is 180 days, users may also choose shorter loan durations to align with different trading strategies and funding needs. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>#Bybit / #CryptoArk </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Bybit</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 80 million users.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Benoît Morenne</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Big Oil has an unusual ask for President Trump: Please stop your battle against offshore wind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oil lobbyists have made the case to Trump officials in recent weeks that his attacks on wind farms off the U.S. coast risk derailing congressional efforts to speed up permits for energy projects, according to people familiar with the matter. The oil-and-gas industry fears missing out on a huge opportunity to ship more of its products to markets via new pipelines.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since coming into office, Trump has repeatedly targeted wind farms he has described as ugly, expensive and destructive for wildlife. His Interior Department suspended all offshore wind projects in the works from Massachusetts to Virginia, prompting energy companies to sue the government. But even as judges have sided with developers against the administration and allowed projects to move forward, Trump has persisted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"My goal is to not let any windmill be built,\" Trump said last month at a White House meeting with oil executives. \"They are the worst form of energy, the most expensive form of energy.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump's actions have plunged the wind industry into turmoil. Now, they risk backfiring against his oil allies and putting their own projects on shaky ground.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The oil-and-gas industry has for months told the administration that its moves to expedite fossil-fuel projects should be enshrined in law — lest a Democratic president reverse them in the future. But Trump's continued blitz against wind is throwing a monkey wrench into a crucial legislative push to do just that.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Senate Democrats have said they would refuse to negotiate a bipartisan law to reform energy permits as long as Trump keeps stalling wind farms. Oil lobbyists see a narrowing window to break the logjam before the midterm elections, when they expect Democrats to regain control of the House.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This administration has done everything that they could do at the administrative level,\" Mike Sommers, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, the U.S. industry's largest trade group, said last week at an energy conference in Houston. \"If you think that permanent reform is hard to get done now, just wait until the Democrats control the United States House of Representatives.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump's escalating feud with wind is forcing the fossil-fuel industry into odd contortions. It was incensed at former President Joe Biden's decisions to cancel the controversial Keystone XL crude pipeline and pause new exports of natural gas. Now, it has become a de facto, albeit begrudging, mediator between wind developers experiencing their own setbacks and the Trump administration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lobbyists have told staff at the National Energy Dominance Council, a body Trump set up to boost energy projects, that the administration's stance against wind makes it much more difficult to get a bipartisan deal in Congress, one of the people familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>API has made it clear to the administration that permitting is its No. 1 legislative priority, and it supports ensuring that all projects that have received a federal nod can be completed — including wind projects, according to people familiar with the matter. API isn't engaged in lobbying for or against wind projects and is focused on advocating for the oil-and-gas industry, the people said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dustin Meyer, senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs at API, said the group has been crystal clear about its priorities with lawmakers and the administration, which include amending a law that imposes federal reviews of the environmental impact of projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A spokeswoman for the White House reaffirmed Trump's position that \"wind farms are a liability that jeopardizes the safety of the American people.\" She said the administration is working closely with its partners in Congress to drive reforms to the permitting process.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The stalemate in Congress could hurt Trump's goals to reshore critical industries and win the AI race. The U.S. faces a daunting challenge to meet new electricity demand from data centers, factories and electric vehicles that it won't sate without a major energy build-out. Cutting the U.S.'s reliance on imports for critical minerals such as lithium and copper requires new mines. For all these reasons, streamlining the complex web of laws and regulations that govern energy projects has become a bipartisan priority on Capitol Hill.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The oil-and-gas industry sees a huge opportunity to build new pipelines. Environmental groups have become proficient at blocking new conduits by stalling projects in the courts. Delays that companies have incurred fighting regulatory and court challenges have spurred many to scrap multibillion-dollar ventures in recent years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Pipelines have been a bottleneck. Infrastructure has been a bottleneck, \" said Toby Rice, chief executive of natural gas producer EQT. \"It's been harder for us to get our gas to market.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump has successfully used his power to block wind farms as leverage to benefit his oil-and-gas allies. After Trump reversed a stop-work order on a major wind project off New York's coast last May, the state approved a natural gas pipeline project that energy company Williams had previously abandoned.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the fossil-fuel industry is adamant that it needs a law to make sure it can build pipelines and not see its permits yanked by a future administration. In December, it praised the House for passing bipartisan legislation to narrow environmental review timelines and litigation windows for energy projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Four days later, the administration paused the federal leases for five offshore wind projects under construction \"due to national security risks identified by the Department of War in recently completed classified reports.\" In protest, Democrats said they were freezing negotiations to pass a Senate version of the House bill as long as Trump didn't reverse his attacks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some oil lobbyists say privately that Trump's deep aversion to wind farms makes no sense to them. Many in the industry say they have been frustrated with the situation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We've been heavily focused on permitting reform as kind of like the cork in the bottle,\" said Sam Sledge, board chair of the Energy Workforce and Technology Council, an industry trade group. \"I think that's been caught in the crosswinds of some other priorities with Trump's administration.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Benoît Morenne at benoit.morenne@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

As we’ve noted before with the Binance employee wrench attack, the physical safety risks of leaked personal data are real. When internal logs create a database of “who has the money,” that database becomes a target. While projects like Hyperliquid launch DeFi policy centers to try and legitimize the space with better standards, incidents like the Axiom scandal drag the industry back into the shadows. For now, the safest bet is to assume that if a human verified your account or built the dashboard, a human can probably see your trades.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>DISCOVER: 5 High-Risk High-Reward Cryptos</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Follow 99Bitcoins on X For the Latest Market Updates and Subscribe on YouTube For Daily Expert Market Analysis.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Key Takeaways</span></strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>ZachXBT exposed Axiom Exchange staff for allegedly using internal tools to spy on and front-run users for insider trading.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The scandal highlights severe security gaps in centralized DeFi front-ends, even those backed by Y Combinator.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Your trading data on these platforms may be visible to employees, posing both financial and privacy risks.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>The post Axiom Exchange Insider Trading Scandal: Is Your Trading Data Being Used Against You? appeared first on 99Bitcoins.</span></p></span></div></div>",

In January, our partner Nuvisan reported challenges in the stability of the ADC constructed for the study, and as such the results were inconclusive. Based upon this experience, we have activated a plan to produce new ADCs using different bioconjugation strategies and several structural variants of Microcystin payloads, with the goal to identify the optimal Pre-Clinical Candidate (PCC) to take into Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Also in December, Simris completed a funding round that included the conversion of a large portion of the Company’s debt as part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen and stabilise the Company’s financial position. This included restructuring outstanding loans, converting debt into equity and completing targeted capital injections. While these measures have been dilutive, they have significantly reduced our debt burden and strengthened our equity base. Importantly, the transactions also brought in new cash to the Company, improving short-term liquidity and giving us the financial runway required to continue operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I am extremely happy that we were able to bring Julian Read back into the business as board member. His strategic thinking, knowledge of the industry, experience in transformation and investor relations are a significant boost for Simris and I am delighted to have him back on board.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Finally, we announced a memorandum of understanding with the French company Immunrise, who are currently concluding legal, technical and operational due diligence for the acquisition of Simris’ assets in Hammenhög, Sweden. We are optimistic that that the Company will close this deal, thereby completing Simris’ transformation from a food supplement to a biotech company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The market for ADC’s continues to grow rapidly and driven by:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The expansion for outpatient ADC administration.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>A rapidly expanding &gt;65-year-old demographic and associated increase in tumour diseases.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The approval of new ADCs for expanded indications.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>ADC revenues were $13bn in 2024 an increase of 25% on the previous year and are forecast to continue growing at a CAGR of 10%* into the 2030’s. In addition to the three points above, further growth of the ADC market will be stimulated by:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Accelerated R&amp;D funding and clinical trial initiations.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Growing pharma investments (M&amp;A and license deals).</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>An increasing demand for effective, low-toxicity drugs.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Novel payload classes, including a growing diversification into other biological inhibitors, contributing to a broader pool of payloads that can be also used in combination to overcome drug resistance.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the optimism, there are some areas that can hold back growth, namely:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Production-related payload supply constraints (mainly auristatin/PBD) creating a bottleneck in ADC production.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>High manufacturing complexity and associated safety measures.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Simris’ unique platform is a game changer for the industry as it is ideal for overcoming these constraints. Our technology platform enables us to develop effective payloads of both high and low-toxicity tailored for the specific cancer type whilst also improving safety of the payload by avoiding its ability to enter healthy cells. Furthermore, the production of cyanotoxins in cyanobacteria is both immensely scalable and cost effective.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The value of cyanobacterial toxins is already evident. Six of the fourteen FDA-approved and commercially available ADC’s, accounting for 40% of the estimated $13bn sales revenue in 2025, are based upon a cyanotoxin (MMAE &amp; MMAF).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Simris can offer multiple new classes of conjugation-ready cyanotoxins, and other cyclic peptides. All of these can be further optimised for both efficacy and safety via structural modifications covered by Simris IP.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I am so impressed and grateful for the energy and passion that the team is applying their work. They believe strongly in the purpose of their work and the potential of our science.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Finally, I wish to thank all of our shareholders for their continued belief and support in what we are working to achieve.

There are a few different ways a Parallel Channel can be categorized based on the orientation of its trendlines.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ascending Channels involve lines that are pointing up, while Descending Channels have a downward slope. These types correspond to periods of parallel consolidation to a net upside and downside, respectively.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the context of the current topic, the third and the most basic type is of interest: a Parallel Channel that’s parallel to the time-axis. As the price moves inside such a channel, it observes a phase of perfectly sideways action.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the weekly price of Solana has potentially been moving inside in recent years:</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:480px;aspect-ratio:0.8\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:39204714b094b-2f943ca53b9704b2d9948b1b6af6af0e-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"Solana Parallel Channel\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:39204714b094b-2f943ca53b9704b2d9948b1b6af6af0e-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#f1f1f1\"/></picture></div></button></figure><p class=\"\"><span>As displayed in the above graph, Solana retested the upper level of the Parallel Channel a couple of times during 2025. Each time, the price ended up topping out and a decline followed. The upper line of a Parallel Channel is considered to be a source of resistance, so these rejections may have been signs of the pattern being in action.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since the latest rejection, SOL has been moving down in a sharp manner as the cryptocurrency sector as a whole has observed a bearish shift. So far, the coin is still contained inside the upper half of the channel, but if momentum weakens, it might end up traveling lower.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to the analyst, these levels could act as support in such a scenario: $50.22, $22.47, and $9.98. These levels correspond to a point 50%, 75%, and 100% down the channel, respectively.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Solana last tested the lower-most of these levels during the bear market of the previous cycle. Back then, it had helped the cryptocurrency reach a bottom. It now remains to be seen which direction the asset will go next and if a retest of any of these levels will take place.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SOL isn’t the only cryptocurrency observing a Parallel Channel setup. As Martinez has highlighted in another X post, the monthly price of Stellar (XLM) has also been moving down such a pattern, with possible support levels existing at 0.147, 0.078, and 0.041.</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:480px;aspect-ratio:0.8\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:39204714b094b-835925eca2c0892ea9408a107a4ee152-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"Stellar Parallel Channel\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:39204714b094b-835925eca2c0892ea9408a107a4ee152-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#f0f0f0\"/></picture></div></button></figure><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>SOL Price</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the time of writing, SOL is floating around $81, down 5.5% in the last 24 hours.</span></p></span></div></div>",
