Miller</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>J.M. Smucker struck an agreement with activist investor Elliott Investment Management and appointed two new members to its board as the jam-and-jelly maker struggles with core parts of its business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Following \"constructive engagement\" with Elliott, Smucker said Woo-Sung \"Bruce\" Chung and David Singer would join its board, effective April 15. Chief Executive Mark Smucker said that the company has met several times with Elliott and that the focus is on boosting Smucker's sales, restoring profit and disciplined capital allocation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The engagement with Elliott is recent and has actually been very constructive,\" said Smucker, speaking on the company's quarterly investor call.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Marc Steinberg, partner at Elliott, said that as one of Smucker's largest investors, the firm believes the new directors and other measures represent critical steps toward ensuring the Ohio-based company reaches its full potential.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Smucker shares closed about 9% higher Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Smucker on Thursday posted higher third-quarter sales, buoyed by price increases in its coffee division, but the company lowered its sales-growth forecast for the year because of a recent fire at one of its manufacturing facilities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company reported a loss of $724.2 million, compared with a loss of $662.3 million the year prior. Adjusted earnings were $2.38 a share, above the $2.27 anticipated among analysts polled by FactSet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net sales rose 7% to $2.34 billion, outpacing analysts' expectations. The sales growth included a 10-percentage-point increase from net price realization, primarily due to higher prices for coffee.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Coffee prices surged last year after adverse weather in top coffee-producing countries hurt supply and President Trump's tariffs increased the cost to import coffee beans. The company raised prices last year in response to those increased costs. It was planning an additional price increase this winter, but held off after the U.S. excluded raw coffee from tariffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sales have struggled for Smucker's Hostess business, acquired in 2023 through a $5 billion deal that added brands like Twinkies and Donettes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Smucker said Thursday comparable sales in its sweet-baked-goods unit, which includes Hostess, declined 11% for the latest quarter. Profit fell 78% and the company said it took two impairment charges tied to Hostess totaling nearly $1 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The path to stabilization is taking longer than we expected,\" said Smucker, the CEO.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Smucker said it has been working to reduce the number of Hostess products by 25%, to focus more on Cupcakes, Twinkies and Donettes. Closing an Indianapolis plant is expected to save $30 million annually, the CEO said, and promotions are being reduced until the end of the company's fiscal year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Smucker Chief Financial Officer Tucker Marshall said it is hard to predict where Hostess's sales will go in the next fiscal year. \"But we should begin to build back profitability because we're at such a low watermark,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company narrowed its forecast for fiscal-year net sales growth to 3.5% to 4%, compared with its previous forecast of 3.5% to 4.5%. It reiterated its adjusted earnings guidance of $8.75 to $9.25 a share. Analysts see adjusted earnings of $8.99 a share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The change in the net-sales guidance was because of a recent fire at the company's Emporia, Kan., manufacturing facility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Jesse Newman at jesse.newman@wsj.com and Nicholas G.

A Technical Report in support of the Mineral Resource Estimate will be filed on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) within 45 days. The Mineral Resource Estimate is effective as of February 26, 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After discovery of the Gemini North Nickel Zone (see News Release dated October 8, 2024), EVNi launched a diamond drilling program (23 holes totalling 6,682 m) to complete a maiden mineral resource estimate in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") which shows Indicated Resources of 9.5M tonnes or 55.6M pounds of contained nickel and Inferred Resources of 84.0M tonnes or 410.7M pounds of contained nickel (Table 1 and Figure 2).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"</span><span>The Gemini North Preliminary Resources Estimate demonstrates the great potential of the CarLang Trend,\" said Paul Davis, Vice President Exploration. \"</span><span>The identification of Mt. Keith Style, nickel-copper-PGM sulphide mineralization at Gemini North with better metallurgical recovery characteristics, only represents a small portion of the overall CarLang C area. When combined with the potential to identify multiple, proximal, large-scale deposits along the CarLang Trend (A, B, C, E and Gemini North), would allow for a single, centralized processing plant to process all the potential zones within the interpreted 10km strike length of peridotites and dunites.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Table 1 - Preliminary Mineral Resource Estimate for the Shaw Dome Project's Gemini North Nickel Zone.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notes to Table 1:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1. The independent Qualified Person for the Mineral Resource Estimate, as defined by National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"), is Dr. Scott Jobin-Bevans (P.Geo., PGO #0183) of Caracle Creek International Consulting Inc. The effective date of the Mineral Resource Estimate is February 26, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Mineral Resources in this MRE are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred Mineral Resources as Indicated or Measured Mineral Resources. However, it is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>3. Estimation domains were built from geological data with the exception of high-grade domains which were constrained using grade thresholds based on statistical analysis of the core assays.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>4. The Mineral Resource is reported at an NSR break-even cut-off of US$7.35/t based on commodity prices, metallurgical recoveries, selling costs, operating costs, and appropriate mine modifying factors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>5. Geological and block models for the MRE used data from a total of 23 surface drill holes, completed by EV Nickel in 2025. The drill hole database was validated prior to resource estimation and QA/QC checks were made using industry-standard control charts for blanks, core duplicates and commercial certified reference material inserted into assay batches by EV Nickel and by comparison of umpire assays performed at a second laboratory.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>6. Estimates have been rounded to two significant figures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>7. The MRE was prepared following the CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources &amp; Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines (November 29, 2019) and the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources &amp; Mineral Reserves (May 19, 2014).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>8. A 10 m x 10 m x 10 m block model was created, and samples were composited at 1.5 m intervals. Grade estimation from drill hole data was carried out for Ni, Co, Pd, Pt, Fe and S using the Ordinary Kriging interpolation method in Micromine software.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>9. The MRE has been constrained by a conceptual pit envelope that was developed using the following optimization parameters:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Mining costs and revenues reported in US dollars (US$)</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Metal prices used were US$21,000/t nickel, US$40,000/t cobalt, US$325/t iron, US$3,860/t chromium, US$1,350/oz palladium, and US$1,150/oz platinum.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Pit slope angle of 45 degrees was applied</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Processing costs and general and administration costs of US$7.35/t for 100 ktpd operation</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Recovery percentage for the metals are: Ni% is 171.63 × S% + 21.2; Co is 11%; Pt is 22%; Pd is 48%; and Fe is 53%.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>10.

Grade estimation was validated by comparison of input and output statistics (Nearest Neighbour and Inverse Distance Squared methods), swath plot analysis, cross-plots of declustered samples against the nearest Ordinary Kriging estimate, and by visual inspection of the assay data, block model, and grade shells in cross-sections.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>12. Density estimation is based on referential density information benchmarked from similar deposits and projects. Lithology-specific values were applied: the average estimated density for peridotite, komatiite, and pyroxenite is 2.76 g/cm³ (t/m³).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Figure 2: Isometric View Showing the pit shell (light grey) with respect to the modelled Indicated and Inferred Resources</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Potential for the Gemini North Nickel Zone- Open along strike and at depth</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The potential exists at Gemini North to sequence the potential extraction of the zone focusing on the higher-grade nickel and sulphur portions of the deposit. Table 2 summarizes the pit constrained Indicated and Inferred Resources and highlights the potential to sequence the open pit to extract higher nickel and sulphur grade material that appear to have better metallurgical recovery characteristics associated with nickel in sulphides as reported in a press release issued January 27, 2026. The Company will continue to explore the potential of the Gemini North, to define a starter open pit to maximize the economic value of the deposit and the potential to improved economic expectations for the area.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Additionally, the Gemini North Nickel Zone is still open along strike to the east, west and at depth as indicated by drill holes not included in the current resource, surface sampling and the extension of the modeled mineralization below the current pit constrained resource.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When taken into consideration that the Gemini North Nickel Deposit covers less than 10% of the overall CarLang C target area, the potential to expand the resources in this area is significant.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Drilling Data Detail</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>EV Nickel's Gemini North drill program targeted the Large-Scale potential of the Gemini North Nickel Zone, forming only the northern portion of the CarLang C target area, and was completed in 2024 and 2025. The maiden mineral resource estimate consists of 23 holes totalling 6,682 m (see Tables 3 &amp; 4 and Figure 3). The Gemini North Nickel Zone is defined across a strike length of 990 metres, a width of 580 metres and a depth of 360 metres. Nickel mineralization extends below 300 metres vertical depth with a number of drill holes bottoming in nickel mineralization.</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table

Golden Queen also replaced the stacker and the agglomeration drum, improvements that enhanced ore stacking quality. The agglomeration process improved the quality of the stacked material, while the new stacker enhanced blending and reduced fine particle segregation. These improvements are expected to result in higher solution percolation rates and reduced particle migration. The Merrill-Crowe Plant is undergoing an upgrade from a capacity of approximately 3,000 gallons per minute (GPM) to 4,000 GPM, with commissioning planned for the fourth quarter. This upgrade is expected to increase gold and silver production from the leach pad by approximately 6 to 10% by directing a higher proportion of lower-grade solution to the Merrill-Crowe process and reducing the volume sent to the operating pond.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>San Bartolome Outlook</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2025, San Bartolome advanced its ore supply strategy by establishing new ore purchase agreements with local communities, supporting long-term operational stability while broadening its network of business partners. In addition, the Company finalized a long-term agreement with COMIBOL to acquire up to 7 million tonnes of oxide ore within a 250-kilometre radius of the processing facility. The first delivery of ore is anticipated by the end of 2026, increasing the diversity of feed sources over the long term and enhancing future feed strategies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Transportation logistics at San Bartolome were notably improved in 2025, contributing to a 21% increase in processing throughput compared to the previous year. Building on this progress, the focus in 2026 will be on improving processing recoveries through automation initiatives and the construction of an additional thickener, scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2027. These process improvements are expected to improve recovery rates by approximately 0.5% to 1.0%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>2026 Guidance </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>At Golden Queen, capital investment in 2026 is primarily directed toward infrastructure and mine development initiatives supporting exploration results and potential mine life extension. Planned expenditures include the expansion of the existing leach pad, detailed engineering and permitting for the construction of a new leach pad, acquisition of three additional haul trucks, deferred waste stripping, and upgrades to the Merrill-Crowe facility. These investments are intended to ensure sufficient processing capacity and operational flexibility to support anticipated future production requirements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At San Bartolome, capital spending in 2026 is focused on processing enhancements and sustaining infrastructure. Planned capital expenditures include the construction of an additional thickener and related plant optimization initiatives designed to improve overall plant performance.</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>2026 Production Guidance</span></strong></td><td><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>2026</span></strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Consolidated</span></strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>Gold ounces (Au, K-Oz)</span></td><td><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span> 46 -
