In early trade, Brent crude and WTI both slip 0.6% to $63.98 and $60.20 a barrel, respectively. The market has largely priced in a modest output increase of 137,000 barrels a day for December, but concerns over a growing supply glut continue to weigh on sentiment. Meanwhile, the trade agreement between the U.S. and China did little to resolve questions over Chinese purchases of Russian oil, analysts say. \"There has been no indication on the Chinese side as to whether they will stop buying,\" according to ANZ. \"There was also hope that China would agree to purchases of U.S. oil and gas as part of a broader U.S.-China deal.\" (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
