Frandsen comments:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>“The encouraging early immunogenicity observations from the ongoing Phase I trial of ES2B-C001 strengthen our confidence in both the program and the ExpreS2 platform. While the data remain preliminary, they support continued execution of the clinical plan as we advance toward key safety and dose-escalation milestones and prepare for additional clinical readouts as the study progresses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Against this clinical backdrop, we believe it is the right time to ensure that the Company is appropriately funded for the next phase of execution. Following a comprehensive review of available strategic and financing alternatives, the Board has determined that the Rights Issue best supports the Company’s objectives. The Rights Issue is intended to ensure that we can progress ES2B-C001 through this important phase and to continue building the capabilities and partnerships that underpin our broader platform, pipeline, and service business. We believe this positions ExpreS2ion to advance multiple value drivers while maintaining a disciplined and capital-efficient approach.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Background and rationale</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>ExpreS2ion is a biotechnology company focused on the development and application of advanced protein expression technologies for vaccines and immunotherapies targeting infectious diseases and cancer. The Company was founded on the recognition that the increasing structural complexity of modern biological drug candidates requires protein expression systems capable of producing high-quality, difficult-to-express proteins at scale. To address this need, ExpreS2ion has developed the ExpreS2 recombinant protein expression platform, which is designed to support all stages of vaccine and biologics discovery and research and development, as well as Good Manufacturing Practice manufacturing for clinical studies. The platform has been applied in multiple therapeutic areas and has been used in the production of antigens evaluated in clinical trials, including late-stage studies conducted by collaboration partners.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The ExpreS2 platform is primarily used to support the Company’s internal and collaborative development activities. As of the date of this press release, ExpreS2ion’s development activities comprise vaccine candidates across four disease areas, including both internally led programs and projects developed in collaboration with academic and industrial partners, where ExpreS2ion’s role may range from antigen design and production to early clinical development support. In addition to its internal and collaborative development activities, ExpreS2ion licenses the ExpreS2 platform to research institutions and pharmaceutical companies. These licensees may independently, or in cooperation with ExpreS2ion, develop biopharmaceutical drugs and vaccines based on proteins produced using the platform. Such agreements may generate revenue through license fees, service income, and, in certain cases, future milestone payments and royalties.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ExpreS2ion’s lead clinical program is ES2B-C001, a therapeutic cancer vaccine aimed at cancers overexpressing the HER2 receptor. A clinical phase I trial in metastatic breast cancer has started in three clinical sites in Austria. On February 3rd, 2026, ExpreS2ion announced that five out of six evaluable patients demonstrated a drug-specific immune response following treatment with ES2B-C001. The Company also reported that patient enrolment and screening continue to progress as planned, and that additional patients are available to proceed once dosing is permitted following the required safety reviews. Based on current visibility, ExpreS2ion remains on track to complete the dose-escalation portion of the study around mid-2026 and the expansion portion toward the end of 2026, subject to ongoing recruitment, safety reviews, and overall study conduct progressing as expected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ES2B-C001 is an investigational immunotherapy product candidate that combines ExpreS2ion’s proprietary ExpreS2™ expression platform with a patented virus-like particle (VLP) technology to create a VLP-based vaccine construct targeting the HER2 receptor, a clinically validated cancer antigen. The VLP platform is in-licensed from AdaptVac (of which ExpreS2ion owns 34%).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Several approved therapies, including monoclonal antibodies such as Herceptin™ (trastuzumab) and Perjeta™ (pertuzumab), as well as antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) such as Enhertu™ (trastuzumab deruxtecan) and Kadcyla™ (trastuzumab emtansine), also target the HER2 receptor. These antibody-based therapies require repeated administration and may be associated with treatment-related adverse events. In the metastatic setting, disease progression due to primary or acquired resistance to HER2-targeted therapies remains a clinical challenge. Accordingly, there continues to be medical interest in therapeutic approaches that may broaden or extend anti-HER2 immune responses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Whereas currently approved monoclonal antibodies bind defined and limited epitopes within the extracellular portion of HER2, ES2B-C001 is designed to present the extracellular domain of HER2 in a VLP format. This design is intended to induce a polyclonal antibody response against multiple epitopes and may also stimulate cellular immune responses. VLP-based vaccines have demonstrated the ability, in other disease settings, to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, including the potential for immunological memory.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ES2B-C001 is being developed as a novel active immunotherapy approach and may have the potential to be evaluated either as monotherapy or in combination with existing HER2-targeted treatments. The clinical safety, efficacy, dosing regimen, and potential advantages relative to existing therapies will need to be established in controlled clinical trials.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The ExpreS2™ platform has previously been used in the development of a VLP-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial involving approximately 4,000 subjects. In addition, multiple pharmaceutical companies, including Merck and GSK, are developing or commercializing VLP-based technologies in oncology and infectious disease, reflecting broader industry interest in this modality.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is estimated that 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. The company predicts that a novel HER-2 targeting treatment paradigm demonstrating benefits similar to those observed in preclinical investigations has the potential to achieve annual sales exceeding 5 billion USD.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company’s Board of Directors believes that the existing working capital is insufficient to meet its current needs for the next 12-month period. The Board of Directors therefore intends to resolve to carry out the Rights Issue in order to strengthen the Company's financial position and to be able to implement the Company's business plan and strategy, including activities for the coming year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the Rights Issue is fully subscribed the Company will receive approximately SEK 53 million which is intended to be used as follows (in the following order of priority, at the approximate amounts stated in brackets):</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Advance ES2B-C001</span></strong><span>Complete Phase I (Ia and Ib) through safety and maximum tolerated dose readout, with potential immunogenicity and early efficacy signals, representing a key value inflection point, and support business development activities to pursue partnering or outlicensing opportunities (approx. 55%).</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Strengthen shared R&amp;D and manufacturing capabilities</span></strong><span>Investment in internal development, CMC-compatibility, and platform capabilities that de-risk execution, improve manufacturability, and compound across programs (approximately 20%).</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Grow the contract research business</span></strong><span>Increase service revenues and margins, and validate the platform with external customers (approx. 20%).</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Co-finance grant projects</span></strong><span>Limited co-financing of externally funded projects with future pipeline/licensing opportunities (approx. 5%).</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Rights Issue</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Provided that the shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors of the Company to resolve on a new issue and resolve on amendments to the Articles of Association and reduction of the share capital, the Board of Directors of the Company is expected to resolve on the Rights Issue on or around 6 April 2026.
