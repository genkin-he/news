The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with consistent distributions each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value (\"NAV\") of the Fund's common shares, but there can be no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so. The Fund is managed with a goal of generating as much of the distribution as possible from net ordinary income and short-term capital gains, that is consistent with the Fund's investment strategy and risk profile. To the extent that sufficient distributable income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that was invested in the Fund is paid back to shareholders. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income\". Even though the Fund may realize current year capital gains, such gains may be offset, in whole or in part, by the Fund's capital loss carryovers from prior years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Board may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to the Fund's shareholders. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's common shares. The Plan will be subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For further information on Franklin Limited Duration Income Trust, please visit our web site at: www.franklintempleton.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Franklin Resources, Inc. is a global investment management organization with subsidiaries operating as Franklin Templeton and serving clients in over 150 countries.

Annualized eurozone growth was 0.9%, from 0.5% in second quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That was a little better than expectations from a consensus of economists, but still reflects the drag on economic growth from weaker exports to the U.S. after President Trump ramped up tariffs at the start of the second quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are some signs of a revival as the adjustment to higher tariffs on eurozone exports advances. The area's composite purchasing managers' index, which tracks around 5,000 companies in the manufacturing and services sectors, showed activity among private-sector companies strengthened to a 17-month high as the fourth quarter got underway. The European Commission's business and consumer survey showed economic sentiment also rose this month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A revival in Germany drove that pickup, and the country's Ifo Institute survey of business sentiment improved in October. Deutsche Bank on Thursday said it expects Germany's economy to grow by 0.2% in the final three months of the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"For those looking at this from a glass-half-full perspective, the eurozone has remained far from recession despite all the global and domestic turmoil,\" ING economist Bert Colijn said in a note to clients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the half-empty take would be that evidence of sustained growth acceleration on the back of extra investment promises isn't there yet, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Germany's economy has borne the brunt of the higher tariffs, since it relies more heavily than other large eurozone economies on exports and manufacturing. The eurozone's largest economy narrowly avoided a slide into recession in the three months through September, extending a period of weak expansion that dates back to before the Covid-19 pandemic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But with the government now implementing a big increase in spending on defense and a repair of frayed infrastructure, there are hopes of a revival.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>German arms manufacturers such as Rheinmetall have seen share prices soar amid promises over defense spending, and as the U.S. talks down its North Atlantic Treaty Organization commitments despite war continuing in Ukraine. Munich has become a growing military-tech hub, and factories that previously made cars are set to be repurposed as production lines for weapons.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The EU also earlier this year pledged to mobilize as much as 800 billion euros ($928.12 billion) as part of its own rearmament program up to the end of the decade.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet the biggest driver of growth could be German investment in infrastructure--as much as 500 billion euros for creaking railways and green-energy transition programs--which is less subject to being redirected to military imports.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, the eurozone's economy is unlikely to grow strongly without a rise in consumer spending, which has been subdued over recent years. Europeans continue to save more than before the pandemic, reflecting the uncertainty they have faced as Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the U.S. subjected their industries to higher trade barriers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"In Europe, purchasing power has improved, the labor market is strong across multiple countries, inflation has come down, but household sentiment is still not great,\" said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, group chief economist of BNP Paribas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But as time passes and people realize they have more money in their pockets and in their bank accounts, and that they still have a job, spending should accelerate again, she added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The European Central Bank, which left its key rate on hold for a third meeting in a row Thursday, expects its previous series of cuts in borrowing costs will help revive household spending and business investment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I would not complain too much about growth at this point in time,\" its President Christine Lagarde said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The central bank is in a \"good place\", she said, repeating comments from the last few months. Investors are on the fence about whether the ECB will cut again in 2026 to support growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Ed Frankl at edward.frankl@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

Microsoft </span><span>, Alphabet </span><span>, and Meta Platforms </span><span> together poured $78 billion into AI infrastructure last quarteran 89% surge from a year earlier. Most of that spending went into new data centers and GPUs as the companies chase dominance in artificial intelligence. Yet instead of cheers, investors met the numbers with caution. Microsoft and Meta shares fell in after-hours trading following their results, while Alphabet's stock climbed more than 6% after stronger-than-expected growth in Google Cloud. Analysts are now openly questioning whether this pace of spending signals long-term convictionor the early stages of an AI bubble.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Microsoft's CFO Amy Hood said the company still cannot meet surging demand for AI services despite a record $34.9 billion in quarterly capital expenditures. Azure's revenue growth remained steady, not faster, which left some investors wondering how soon those massive outlays will translate into higher returns. Alphabet, by contrast, projected confidence. CFO Anat Ashkenazi said the Gemini AI assistant now counts 650 million monthly active usersup 44% in three monthswhile Google Cloud revenue rose 34% to $15.2 billion, exceeding expectations. The company lifted its annual capex forecast to $93 billion and expects a significant increase again next year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meta offered the most unsettling tone. Alongside a $16 billion tax charge, it warned that spending will accelerate sharply through 2026, even as its Reality Labs division lost $4.4 billion last quarter on $470 million in sales. Without a cloud business to rent out excess capacity, Meta's payoff depends on using AI to boost ad targeting and power new products like smart glasses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors that spending more now could be the safer path, arguing that the bigger risk lies in underinvesting. For now, Big Tech's AI gamble sits at an inflection pointone where scale could define the next decade, or where exuberance could test the market's faith in this trillion-dollar story.</span></p></span></div></div>",
