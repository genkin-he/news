So there's some flight to safety here.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, bond investors continued to factor in a more gradual pace of easing from the Federal Reserve in 2026 given the recent batch of data showing a steadier economy that will likely avoid recession this year and next.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thursday's economic data supported that view. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 212,000 for the week ended February 21, data showed. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 215,000 claims.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. fed funds futures on Thursday priced in about 55 bps on easing this year, equivalent to about two rate cuts of 25 bps each, a scenario that has been in place since the start of the year.

At one point, the 2/10 curve had been narrowing its gap for 10 consecutive sessions, the longest such stretch since November 2015.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Analysts attributed the flattening to expectations of fewer rate cuts and a January nonfarm payrolls report that showed an unexpected increase in new jobs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Also on Thursday, the U.S. Treasury will auction $44 billion in seven-year notes and J.P. Morgan said the note could be difficult to absorb given the low level yields, suggesting this debt has become a little more expensive. Since the last auction, seven-year yields have declined by roughly more than 20  bps and now trading near their six-month lows. </span></p></span></div></div>",

The subscription price of SEK 0.09 per share is identical to the subscription price in the directed issue to external investors, which has been determined through arm’s length negotiations. The board acknowledges that the subscription price represents a significant discount to the current market price. The board has nevertheless concluded that the subscription price is justified for the following reasons: (i) the CEO receives shares on exactly the same terms as the external investors in the Directed Issue, and there is no preferential treatment; (ii) Fenja Capital II A/S, an independent external holder of convertible instruments, converted at a price of SEK 0.09 per share on 23 February 2026, confirming that the price level has been accepted by an independent third party; (iii) the issue relates to a debt conversion, not a purchase of shares at a discounted price – the CEO has already rendered services to the Company and is now electing to convert those claims into equity at a price consistent with third-party transactions; and (iv) the subscription price is consistent with, or at a premium to, subscription prices in the Company’s capital raises over the past twelve months: the rights issue of September 2025 (SEK 0.06 per share), the exercise of warrants of series TO6 in May 2025 (SEK 0.09 per share), and the Fenja Capital conversion of February 2026 (SEK 0.09 per share).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The maximum dilution effect as a result of the new issue of shares proposed under this item 7 amounts to approximately 6 per cent based on the number of outstanding shares in the Company at the time of this notice.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Roberto Garcia Martinez has not participated in the preparation of the proposal under this item 7.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A valid resolution requires the approval of shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Personal data</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Personal data obtained from the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB, notification of attendance at the meeting and information about representatives, proxies and assistants will be used for registration, preparation of the voting list for the meeting and, where applicable, minutes of the meeting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Other</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The required documents, complete proposals for resolutions and proxy forms will be available at the company's office at Strandvägen 7a, 114 56 Stockholm, Sweden, and on the company's websiteeurobatteryminerals.comno later than two weeks prior to the general meeting and will be sent to shareholders who so request and state their postal address.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shareholders have the right to request information in accordance with Chapter 7, Section 32 of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551).</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Eurobattery Minerals</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Eurobattery Minerals AB is a Swedish mining company listed on Swedish Nordic Growth Market (BAT) and German Börse Stuttgart (EBM).
