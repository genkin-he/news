The case for keeping interest rates stable was reinforced by Lagarde reiterating her statement that the bank is in \"a good place\" regarding current interest rates, he says. Lagarde noted that risks to the economy have declined due to trade compromises and a ceasefire in the Middle East, though stopped short of describing the overall economic risks as tilted upward. \"We continue to expect the ECB to maintain the deposit rate at 2% at least until the end of next year,\" Kraemer says.
