class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>CEO Kari Sundbäck</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The implementation of the strategy we published in June progressed rapidly during the third quarter. Our strategic focus was reflected in the strengthened order backlog and the improved adjusted EBITDA margin in our core businesses. We sold our Marine and Offshore Unit to Davie at the beginning of the review period, completing the strategic refocusing started in summer 2024 and allowing us to fully concentrate on increasing shareholder value in our core business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tomorrow’s society is powered by clean energy and is built on reliable connections. Electricity consumption in our markets grows significantly, which means accelerating investments in the transmission grid. For example, Fingrid predicts that electricity consumption in Finland will double between 2025 and 2035. Finland’s well-functioning energy market attracts investments in our core businesses' strong areas of expertise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our updated strategy responds to the market change and provides a clear direction for our business. Our strategic goal is to be a trusted lifecycle partner for our customers operating in energy transmission and production, the industrial energy transition, and telecommunications, as well as in growing customer segments such as data centres. We aim for profitable growth in Finland, the Baltics and selectively elsewhere in the Nordics. The foundation of Enersense’s business lies in efficiently and transparently executed projects and services. In addition, we optimise the lifecycle performance of our customers’ networks, systems and production facilities. Our lifecycle offering covers design, construction, operation and maintenance, as well as upgrades and modernisations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The order backlog of our core businesses continued to grow for the second consecutive period, rising to EUR 379 (335) million. We are developing our lifecycle offering in close cooperation with our customers. Third-quarter revenue for the core businesses declined by 11% from the comparison period due to a smaller project portfolio and large projects carried out in the Baltics during the comparison period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The relative profitability of the core businesses has continued to improve throughout the beginning of the year. Adjusted EBITDA for the core businesses improved to EUR 9.2 (8.7) million, and the adjusted EBITDA margin strengthened to EUR 11.2 (9.6) per cent. Strengthening profitability and our financial base are elementary for to advancing the development outlined in our strategy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Journey towards lifecycle partnership progressing</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>We continued our Value Uplift programme, aimed at supporting profitable growth, and made progress in assessing fixed costs and resources. We renewed our operating model to support the implementation of the strategy and to reinforce our ability to respond to future needs with the right kind of expertise. As a result of the renewal, our responsibility areas are clearer and our performance is better. The operating model became effective after the review period on 1 October 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The measures implemented in the Value Uplift programme by the end of September to improve procurement performance will contribute EUR 4 million improvement to the annual EBIT/EBITDA run-rate. During the rest of the year, we will continue to develop our procurement performance and aim for an annual EBIT/EBITDA run-rate improvement of EUR 5 million by the end of the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We have set ambitious climate targets that will enable us to improve our customers’ sustainability. After the review period, in October, we submitted our climate targets for validation in accordance with the Science Based Targets Initiative and drew up a climate roadmap. At the same time, we conducted practical climate actions; we started in Satakunta on a substation built from recycled steel, and by the end of the year, we will have replaced a third of our service vehicles in Finland with electric ones.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the year, we have built a solid foundation for Enersense’s profitable growth and increased shareholder value. The commitment of our employees and valuable feedback from our customers help us achieve our goal of being a trusted lifecycle partner for our Power, Energy Transition and Connectivity customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Significant events after the review period</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>On 7 October 2025, Enersense announced that Fingrid selected Enersense to construct 100 kilometres of new 400-kilovolt transmission line in Central Finland. The project includes dismantling the old line, constructing a new one and connecting the new line to four different substations. The project is worth approximately EUR 27 million and was recorded in the company’s order backlog for the third quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On 24 October 2025, Enersense announced that it had completed the share buyback programme. Between 19 August and 23 October 2025, Enersense repurchased a total of 187,713 of its own shares at an average price of EUR 3.727. The repurchases of the buy-back programme reduced the company’s unrestricted equity by EUR 699,548. Following the completion of the programme, Enersense held 187,713 of treasury shares, corresponding to approximately 1.1% of the total number of shares.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On 27 October 2025, Anu Henttonen (Master of Education, Licentiate of Science (Technology)) was appointed as EVP, HR, HSEQ, Communications and Sustainability, and a member of Enersense’s Group Leadership Team. She will take up her position by 1 February 2026 at the latest.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On 30 October 2025, Enersense announced that it had won Fingrid’s tender for the delivery of a new substation in Nokia. The contract covers the entire project from design to construction and commissioning. Valued at approximately EUR 27 million, it is the largest individual substation project in Enersense’s history. The project will employ Enersense until 2028.

With its ambitious growth plan, Vichnet will provide a platform for Troax Group to further grow in APAC and overseas.

With a market leading position in China and strong focus to innovation, Vichnet is an important addition to the Group on our mission to creating safer workplaces worldwide. Vichnet is a platform acquisition in line with our strategy and by joining forces we will improve customer service, add flexibility and widen our solutions portfolio. I am looking forward to working with Jessie Wen and the Vichnet team”, says Martin Nyström, President and CEO of Troax. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We join Troax Group to combine our strengths: their global footprint, our Asian market position, and a shared drive for innovation. This is the catalyst for our future growth”, says Jessie Wen, Managing Director and co-founder of Vichnet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Strategic rationale</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Troax Group´s aim is to become the market leader worldwide in selected segments. We have a market leading position in Europe and America, and we have been growing profitably in Asia for years. With the acquisition of Vichnet, Troax Group makes a step change in Asia and becomes the leading player in China and Asia. Together with Vichnet, the Group has secured a platform with the size, skills and capabilities of a market leader for Asia. Roughly 50% of the world´s industrial production is tied to China and Japan, and an increasing share of industrial robotics integration is led by integrators out of this region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With the acquisition of Vichnet, Troax Group strengthens its offering with machine guarding solutions tailored for the Asian markets. In addition, the offering broadens with wire trays specifically designed to improve productivity and safety in various industries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Vichnet at a glance</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vichnet is the market leader in China for machine guarding and wire tray solutions. The company, headquartered in Ningbo, had an annual turnover of 26 MEUR and approximately 300 employees (2024). Since its establishment 2006, Vichnet has grown profitably and today offers a comprehensive range of safety solutions for the Chinese as well as export markets. Through its focus on innovation, quality and reliability, Vichnet has become a trusted partner for businesses across various industries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Just like Troax Group, Vichnet offers the customers ‘peace of mind”. In addition to a strong machine guarding offer, the wire tray offer expands the Group´s capabilities and offers further growth opportunities particularly in the data center segment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Combined financial overview and impact on Troax Group´s financials</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The acquisition agreement was signed today, and the process is expected to close before end of 2025. Vichnet will be reported within the APAC-region and is expected to be neutral to the EBITA-margin to begin with. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Troax Group´s earnings per share post completion (excluding any non-cash amortization impacts from the transaction).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The purchase price is 350 RMB on a cash/debt-free basis and will be paid upon closing. In addition, there will be a potential performance-based incentive paid out in 2028 subject to meet the company´s ambitious profitable growth plan. At full achievement of the targets during 2025-2027, the potential payout will follow in 2028. In total, this corresponds to a total valuation of approximately 5.1x EV/EBITA.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The acquisition will be financed through the Group´s existing cash and credit facilities. Connected to the acquisition, there will be related costs of approximately 1.5 MEUR during the fourth quarter 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After the acquisition, Troax Group´s sales by geographical region are expected to be approximately 70 percent in Europe, 15 percent in the Americas and 15 percent in Asia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Troax Group has a financial target to keep net debt/adjusted EBITDA below 2.5x. As of September 30, 2025, the Group reported a 1.0x net debt/EBITDA ratio.

The TSB Distribution Agreement was, upon its signing, based on a stocking distribution model, whereby TSB first purchases products from Bioretec for further sale and distribution by TSB to hospitals in the target geography. Following the signing of the TSB Distribution Agreement, a product repurchase addendum was added on 5 May 2025 to the TSB Distribution Agreement, whereby Bioretec would repurchase from TSB such unpaid products for which TSB was unable to procure purchasers within the payment terms (\"Repurchase Addendum\"). Following such repurchase under the Repurchase Addendum, Bioretec could then distribute such unpaid products directly to end-users itself, similarly to direct distribution models to which Bioretec is aiming to shift towards in an effort to move away from stocking distribution models in the United States, excluding the Orthopediatrics agreement focused solely on the pediatrics market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the company release dated 27 October 2025, Bioretec estimated that the corrections made in the accounting treatment related to the Repurchase Addendum and the products to be repurchased would result in a decrease of previously reported H1/2025 net sales of EUR 0.52 million, as well as an increase in costs of EUR 0.65 million. However, after further review, it was also determined that a one-time credit invoice related to the conclusion of a previous U.S. pilot distributor agreement with Spartan Medical had been incorrectly booked against net sales in Q2/2025. While the Repurchase Addendum causes a restatement of H1/2025 net sales by EUR 0.52 Million as per the company release dated 27 October 2025, the corrected accounting treatment of the aforementioned credit invoice of Spartan Medical offsets this reduction in net sales. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In this corrected half-year report, the aforementioned one-time credit invoice related to Spartan Medical’s distribution agreement (of EUR 0.5 million), as well as the products to be repurchased worth approximately EUR 0.65 million under the TSB Distribution Agreement, are now reported in other expenses, increasing the previously reported other expenses by a total of approximately EUR 1.1 million. The previously reported total level of net sales remains mostly unchanged and represents the true volume of realized sales during the period of April-June 2025. Other minor changes detected during further review, related to changes in inventory and operating expenses, have also been adjusted</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This company announcement is a summary of restated Bioretec Ltd’s half-year report for January–June 2025.

The objective of the rights issue was to strengthen Bioretec's capital structure and to ensure its ability to implement its RemeOs™ commercialisation strategy.  The rights issue was oversubscribed and Bioretec received gross proceeds of approximately EUR 9.2 million from the rights issue.

This funding round supports the needed investment in leadership resourcing for marketing and sales, global capacity building in operations, and continued R&amp;D investment to support our robust product pipeline. Commercial traction in H1 was highlighted by continued Activa sales development with demand particularly in China and Asia, and the first surgical cases with the RemeOs Trauma Screw being performed in Europe. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our robust product pipeline advanced on multiple fronts, including ongoing work to advance 510(k) submissions for the RemeOs cannulated screw in the U.S., progress in our Breakthrough designated and patented hybrid composite for the RemeOs Spinal Interbody Cage program, ethical approval for first in human DrillPin clinical trials, and the commencement of post-marketing clinical follow-up for the CE-marked RemeOs line. In support of our broadened distribution network in the U.S. and the growing demand for efficiency and infection control in that market, we completed the launch of sterile, single-use instruments for our Activa cannulated screw, with the first instruments delivered and now available for use.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sales margin reflects our commitment to prepare for commercial and operational growth namely in the U.S. market. The margin was impacted by an increase in materials and services costs, such as instrumentation and logistics costs, related to our commercial strategy to shift from using solely stocking distributors to including also direct distribution partners in the U.S.. Furthermore, the first two quarters of the year resulted in high volume demand as a percentage of revenue coming from China, with slightly lower margins.  Sales margin during the market development and scale-up phases is planned to improve as our sales increase and direct distribution channel partners are well established.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The first half of the year also marked a period of transition in the organization from a leadership perspective. It has been an honor for me to step in as interim CEO of Bioretec in mid-May, and I am proud of the oversubscribed funding round we completed in June. I want to thank our shareholders for their strong participation and continued confidence in our journey ahead.  As we continue to focus on scale and strategy refinement, I remain confident that Bioretec is well-positioned to deliver value to shareholders and patients alike.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Financial reporting in 2025</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2025, Bioretec will publish the following financial reports:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Business review for January–September 2025 on Thursday 13 November 2025</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>The financial reports will be available online at Bioretec Ltd’s website at</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>https://investors.bioretec.com/en/reports_and_presentations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tampere, 31 October 2025</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Board of Directors</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bioretec Ltd</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>For additional information about the report:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sarah van Hellenberg Hubar-Fisher   Anne-Mari Matikainen</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CEO        Interim CFO</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>+31 6 1544 8736      +358 50 322 1069 </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Certified Adviser</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nordic Certified Adviser AB, +46 70 551 67 29</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Bioretec</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bioretec is a globally operating Finnish medical device pioneer at the forefront of transforming orthopedic care with fully biodegradable implant technologies. The company has built unique competencies in the biological interface of active implants to enhance bone growth and accelerate fracture healing after orthopedic surgery. The products developed and manufactured by Bioretec are used worldwide in approximately 40 countries.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bioretec’s Activa product line features fully bioabsorbable orthopedic implants made from a proprietary, self-reinforced PLGA polymer. These implants deliver secure fixation through patented innovations and naturally degrade in approximately two years, eliminating the need for costly and invasive removal surgeries while supporting optimal bone regeneration. Activa products are both CE marked and FDA cleared for a wide range of indications in adult and pediatric patients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company’s latest innovation, the RemeOs™ product line, is based on a high-performance magnesium alloy and hybrid composite, introducing a new generation of strong absorbable materials for enhanced surgical outcomes. The RemeOs implants are absorbed and replaced by bone, which eliminates the need for removal surgery while facilitating fracture healing. The first RemeOs product market authorization was received in the U.S. in March 2023, and in Europe, the CE mark approval was received in January 2025. With the development of next-generation implants like RemeOs, Bioretec is shaping the future of orthopedic treatment, paving the way for more effective and patient-friendly solutions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To learn more about Bioretec, visit https://bioretec.com.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>https://news.cision.com/bioretec/r/correction--bioretec-ltd-s-half-year-report-2025%2Cc4259600</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bioretec Half year report 2025_corrected</span></p></span></div></div>",

At the end of the quarter our cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 92.2 million. Our interest-bearing net debt decreased to EUR 203.3 (218.1) million, bringing our net interest-bearing debt / comparable EBITDA ratio down to 3.0 (3.3).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To improve future profitability and efficiency, we unfortunately had to make the difficult but necessary decision in September to adjust our organisational structure and initiate cooperation negotiations. Altogether, approximately 500 employees are within the scope of the negotiations. We estimate that this would result in the closure of 70-80 positions in 2025. As a result, Anora targets a reduction in personnel expenses of approximately EUR 7 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking ahead, our work on an updated strategy for the next strategy period will be divided into the following phases: Fit &amp; Fix and Focus. The Fit &amp; Fix phases deliver short and mid-term performance improvement over 2025-2026, while the Focus drives growth initiatives as of 2026 onwards.

This is a clear testament to the expertise and commitment of our people,\" said Kjetel Digre, Chief Executive Officer at Aker Solutions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Looking ahead, we are preparing for changing market conditions by improving our own efficiency as well as working with partners to mature future prospects into commercially sound energy projects,\" said Digre.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Key Developments</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Third-quarter revenue increased to NOK 17.0 billion from NOK 13.2 billion in the same period last year. This represents a 29 percent increase. EBITDA excluding special items was NOK 1.5 billion, up from NOK 1.2 billion one year ago. The financial results in the quarter were driven by solid operational performance across Aker Solutions' business segments and the contribution from the 20 percent ownership in SLB OneSubsea. The underlying EBITDA margin for the quarter was 8.8 percent, or 7.2 percent excluding net income from SLB OneSubsea.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Activity levels continue to be high across business segments and locations. During the quarter, Aker Solutions met all key milestones in the Aker BP project portfolio and celebrated the official opening of the Ormen Lange Phase 3 project, where SLB OneSubsea has delivered the subsea compression system.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Order intake for the quarter was NOK 10.3 billion, and the secured backlog at the end of the quarter stood at NOK 61.7 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The net cash position increased to NOK 2.5 billion in the quarter. Working capital reversal represented a cash outflow of NOK 548 million in the quarter, while CAPEX was NOK 94 million. During the quarter, Aker Solutions received dividends from its 20 percent ownership in SLB OneSubsea of NOK 142 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the Renewables and Field Development segment, revenues increased 36 percent to NOK 12.5 billion with an underlying EBITDA margin of 8.0 percent. The legacy lump-sum projects continued to be a drag on margins in the period and commercial discussions with clients and sub-contractors are ongoing on these projects. The second-generation renewables projects with balanced risk-reward profiles are progressing well with healthy margins.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Life Cycle segment reported revenues of NOK 3.8 billion with an underlying EBITDA margin of 7.2 percent in the quarter, driven by solid performance on long-term frame agreements and modification projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SLB OneSubsea, where Aker Solutions owns 20 percent, reported revenues of NOK 9.9 billion with an underlying EBITDA margin of 18.4 percent in the quarter. In the first three quarters of 2025, revenue in SLB OneSubsea was NOK 30.3 billion with an underlying EBITDA margin of 19.9 percent. The company has a solid financial position and an attractive dividend policy with ambitions to distribute about USD 280 million to its shareholders in 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Outlook and Guidance</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Based on secured revenues and backlog for the remainder of the year, Aker Solutions expects full-year 2025 revenues to exceed NOK 60 billion. EBITDA margins, excluding net income from SLB OneSubsea, are expected to be between 7.0 and 7.5 percent for the full year 2025. At this early stage, Aker Solutions expects 2026 revenues to be around NOK 45 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CONTACT:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Preben Ørbeck</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>investor relations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>preben.orbeck@akersolutions.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>+47 470 10 611</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hallvard Norum</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>media contact</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>hallvard.norum@akersolutions.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>+47 913 80 820</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.com.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>https://news.cision.com/aker-solutions-asa/r/aker-solutions-asa-third-quarter-results-2025,c4259399</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The following files are available for download:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>https://mb.cision.com/Public/18353/4259399/b048705aaa1ec  3Q-2025-Presentation </span><br/><span>5f2.pdf</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aker-solutions-asa-third-quarter-results-2025-302600773.html</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SOURCE Aker Solutions ASA</span></p></span></div></div>",
