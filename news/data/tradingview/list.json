Out-of-market shoppers accounted for 61.9% of online views for homes in the 100 largest metros, which is a significant shift from the 48.6% seen in the pre-pandemic era of 2019. While this search activity is down modestly from last year's 64.7% peak, the long-term trend highlights a more mobile and interconnected pool of home shoppers. Realtor.com says 87 of the largest 100 metros are driven primarily by out-of-market interest, leaving just 13 markets where local shoppers remain the majority of the audience. The Sun Belt remains the undisputed leader in non-local demand. In 4Q, affordable, lifestyle-driven metros such as Cape Coral, Fla., Lakeland, Fla., and Durham, N.C., led the way.

As the presence of Neanderthal DNA in most present-day people shows, interbreeding occurred, though the circumstances have remained unclear.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>New research focusing on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes, in present-day people and, as revealed by ancient genomes, in Neanderthals is providing insight into who participated in these prehistoric pairings. The genetic analysis backs the conclusion that this phenomenon primarily was driven by sex between Neanderthal men and Homo sapiens women.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The researchers said it is unknown why this occurred, whether by peaceful mating preference, by force or some other scenario.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The preferences of either or both parties could produce these kinds of patterns, with or without the consent of the other,\" said geneticist Alexander Platt of the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, co-lead author of the research published on Thursday in the journal Science.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chromosomes are threadlike structures that carry genetic information from cell to cell. In people, females carry two X chromosomes - one inherited from each parent. Males carry one X chromosome inherited from their mother and one Y chromosome from their father. For the other chromosomes, everyone has two copies - one from each parent, equally distributed across the sexes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most people, with the exception of certain sub-Saharan African populations, carry small amounts - often 1% to 4% - of Neanderthal DNA across much of their genome but have little to none on their X chromosomes. Africans are the exception because their ancestors, having stayed on the continent, never mixed with Neanderthals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The genomes of three Neanderthals showed an excess of Homo sapiens DNA on X chromosomes, a pattern opposite from present-day people and suggestive of male Neanderthal-female Homo sapiens mating. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The researchers also examined genetic data from present-day Africans lacking Neanderthal ancestry to better track gene flow between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals who interbred starting as early as 250,000 years ago. A more recent Homo sapiens migration resulted in additional interbreeding peaking around 47,000 years ago.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Scientists had long assumed the absence of Neanderthal contribution to modern X chromosomes was because some Neanderthal genes were biologically incompatible with Homo sapiens, causing serious health problems, and were purged because offspring failed to reproduce - Darwinian \"survival of the fittest.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the abundance of Homo sapiens DNA in Neanderthal X chromosomes contradicted that notion. Instead, the genetic data, the researchers said, is best explained by Neanderthal men and Homo sapiens women mating, with mathematical modeling confirming this mating bias could reproduce the observed genetic patterns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SIMILARITIES BEYOND THE ANATOMICAL</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Homo sapiens and Neanderthals had a common ancestor until approximately 600,000 years ago. The lineage then split, with Neanderthals evolving in Europe and Homo sapiens in Africa.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Neanderthals, who disappeared roughly 40,000 years ago, and Homo sapiens had similarities beyond the anatomical. Neanderthals, more robustly built and with larger brows, were intelligent, creating art and using complex group-hunting methods, symbolic objects and perhaps spoken language.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The nature of the interaction is difficult to ascertain based on archaeological and genetic evidence, including whether, for example, there were hostilities such as raiding parties by Neanderthal men to abduct Homo sapiens women.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We have no way of knowing if this was a conflict scenario,\" University of Pennsylvania geneticist and study senior author Sarah Tishkoff said, noting the interaction could have been peaceful.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"But we also don't know why this pattern happened of more modern human (Homo sapiens) females mating with Neanderthals - whether it was due to choice or they were forced. This is what makes it so fascinating, and hopefully someday perhaps there will be archaeological and fossil data that will shed further light on the interactions between Neanderthals and modern humans.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At some point after spreading through Eurasia, our species greatly outnumbered the Neanderthals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If you consider that there may have been 10 to 20 times as many Homo sapiens in the area as Neanderthals, the observation that we had as much as 5% Neanderthal ancestry 30,000 to 40,000 years ago suggests it's entirely reasonable to guess that there was simply so much interbreeding that we swamped the gene pool - that Neanderthals didn't actually disappear at all, they just became some of us,\" Platt said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's kind of fun to think that there are currently some six billion people walking around with about 2% Neanderthal genomes,\" Platt said. \"To the extent that that's equivalent to 120 million Neanderthals' worth of genomes, they're doing better than ever.\"</span></p></span></div></div>",

Previous marketing has included outdoor displays mocking the web's \"I'm not a robot\" captcha tests and a campaign lauding humanity's advances like the invention of the airplane. \"In a world of AI,\" the campaign urges, \"be human.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But Tools for Humanity now plans to lean on partnerships with traditional brands like these to handle a large share of the marketing for World ID, said Trevor Traina, chief business officer at the company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I think we're right at the precipice right now of the moment where we don't have to say anything, where our partners are going to do all the talking,\" Traina said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company says its Orbs translate images of a person's face and iris into an anonymized string of numbers to be stored on his or her device, with no data kept by Tools for Humanity. It hopes to generate revenue by charging a fee each time an app uses a person's World ID to confirm that they are human, Traina said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But widespread adoption is the first priority, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition to doling out Worldcoin to new World ID holders, Tools for Humanity awards its cryptocurrency to independent Orb operators in some markets outside the U.S. each time they issue a new ID. Nearly 18 million people have received World IDs, including 1.1 million in North America, according to the company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The reliance on biometrics and cryptocurrency has generated negative publicity and regulatory pushback, however, including headline-making bans in some countries over concerns about data security. Worldcoin arrived in most of the U.S. last year but remains unavailable in New York state because the company hasn't received a license to distribute digital currency from state regulators, according to people familiar with the matter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company is engaged with regulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the world, Traina said. \"It's a constant dance with regulators who, with so many innovations, you know, have to work really hard to stay current on new technologies, and I think it'll always be that way,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tools for Humanity has also moved to address some concerns. It eliminated users' earlier ability to store their biometric data externally, for example, and now only places the data on a user's own device, according to a spokeswoman. Orbs themselves are designed to delete the data immediately, the company says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>World IDs could present tempting targets for theft if they become widely adopted, according to Rory Mir, director of open access and tech community engagement at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights advocacy group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"In the worst-case scenario, potentially fraudulent operators could, you know, full-on take the ID or resell it,\" said Mir. \"You can't change your iris if someone does manage to get ahold of that information.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Tools for Humanity spokeswoman called that scenario speculative.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tools for Humanity hopes that its deals with brands like Tinder will help better explain World ID to skeptics who don't understand the need for a human verification product or suspect that it's really just a crypto play, said Traina.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Marketers see partnering with Tools for Humanity as a way to gain attention, attract new customers and, in the case of Tinder, to help allay consumers' security concerns regarding their products.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gap displayed the Orb to spark interest among the young employees of tech and AI companies who frequent downtown San Francisco, according to a spokesman. Gap will not earn any revenue or WLD Tokens from Tools for Humanity, won't have access to any consumer data gathered by the Orb and does not currently use World ID in its business, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tinder started experimenting with World ID in Japan because dating apps in that market are legally required to verify users' ages, said Yoel Roth, senior vice president of trust and safety at parent organization Match Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"One of the biggest challenges to the internet writ large right now is trust, and for us that really boils down to combating bots and fake accounts,\" said Roth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tinder was attracted to World partly because of how little user data it receives when someone completes the verification, according to Roth. Match Group has not actively marketed the integration but has seen thousands of Japanese users sign up for the ID and is now exploring other markets, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Worldcoin payments card has been delayed from its planned introduction last year, but Visa said it's still in the works. The payment company and Tools for Humanity declined to comment on timing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tinder, Visa and Tools for Humanity declined to comment on any financial arrangements of their contracts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Patrick Coffee at patrick.coffee@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
