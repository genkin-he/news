This ensures smooth and comfortable use whether for gaming, video playback, or enhanced AI functions. With the energy-efficient Pro IGZO OLED display and a large-capacity 5,000 mAh battery, users can enjoy up to two days of usage with 10 hours of daily use from a full charge (*3).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The camera features advanced AI correction functions praised in the high-end \"AQUOS R10\". The AI functionality that automatically removes unwanted shadows in photos has been further enhanced. In addition to \"Cooking\" and \"Text\" modes, a new \"Showcase Mode\" has been added, which reduces reflections when photographing objects through glass. The AI image synthesis processing technology also enhances detail fidelity when zooming or using night mode. Users can enjoy high-quality photography from close-ups to ultra-wide angles. Additionally, the new AI function \"Vocalist\" improves call quality. By registering their own voice, users can enable the AI to identify and cut out any voices or background noise during calls, ensuring only their voice is transmitted clearly to the other party, achieving comfortable and engaging conversations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The color variations feature a lineup of six colors inspired by fashion trends. The main color, Denim Navy, evokes the hue of denim fabric combined with leather patches, reminiscent of jeans. The device's compact size and lightweight design (approximately 166 g) meet MIL-STD-810H standards (impact resistance meets MIL-STD-810G), ensuring reliable use in daily life with water resistance and shock resistance (*4).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Outstanding Features</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1.

Testing has also been performed in accordance with the U.S. Department of Defense procurement standards (MIL-STD-810G) for shock resistance (drop). The performance of this product has been verified under testing conditions. Operation of all functions in every situation during actual use is not guaranteed.

Compared to the SoC of the previous model, it offers approximately 20 % improvement in CPU performance, approximately 40 % in GPU performance, and approximately 30 % in AI performance, ensuring smooth and comfortable operation even in scenarios requiring advanced processing, such as AI functions. The display features Pro IGZO OLED technology, which automatically adjusts the refresh rate between 1-Hz and 120-Hz. It supports a maximum of 240-Hz equivalent motion (*5) and boasts a peak brightness of 1,500 nits for excellent visibility outdoors. Moreover, with the energy-efficient Pro IGZO OLED display and a large-capacity 5,000 mAh battery, users can enjoy up to two days of use with 10 hours of daily usage from a full charge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>*5 In apps with smooth high-speed display and game settings registered in the gaming menu turned on, the display is updated 120 times per second while a black screen is inserted between frames.

The Jays MLB playoff run is likely to provide a lift in October, says BMO Capital Markets' Benjamin Reitzes. That may offer some support after Statistics Canada estimated GDP edged up 0.1% in September, following an unexpected 0.3% contraction in August. Major sports and entertainment events often sway economic indicators, at the edges at least. The rare appearance of five of Canada's National Hockey League teams in the playoffs boosted attendance at arenas and lifted activity for the arts, entertainment and recreation industry in April, while the Toronto leg of Taylor Swift's blockbuster tour drove a temporary acceleration in hotel inflation last November.

One of the biggest questions patients have after surgery is: \"What foods can I eat?\" Your diet plays a big role in how quickly and comfortably you heal after wisdom teeth removal. Eating the right foods can help prevent irritation, reduce discomfort, and support the recovery of your mouth, gums, and jaw to full health. Here's a guide to what you should eat and what foods to avoid after wisdom teeth removal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Best foods to eat after wisdom teeth removal</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>After your wisdom teeth are removed, your mouth may be sensitive and irritated by certain types of food. These options will give you the nutrients and food you need to recover without damaging or causing pain around the extraction sites:1</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Soft dairy products</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yogurt, pudding, or cottage cheese can serve as a source of protein and calcium to support recovery. Colder foods may also feel soothing around the surgical site and against swollen gums.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Mashed potatoes and soft vegetables</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pureed carrots, soft-cooked squash, and mashed potatoes are easy to chew and swallow post-surgery, and they provide essential vitamins your body needs to help heal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Smoothies and shakes</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Blended smoothies and milkshakes aren't just a sweet treat as a reward for making it through surgery. Including leafy greens like spinach or kale or adding protein powder can also make them a great source of nutrition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Scrambled eggs</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking for an easy breakfast after oral surgery? Scrambled eggs are soft, easy to eat, and quick to prepare when you're too exhausted to cook.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Applesauce and pureed fruit</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Applesauce and other fruit cups are gentle on your gums, making them a great sweet treat post-surgery.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Foods to avoid after wisdom teeth removal</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>With how sensitive your mouth is after wisdom teeth surgery, it's important to be aware of what foods you shouldn't eat. Not only may these options cause pain and discomfort, but they might also prolong the recovery process:2</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Crunchy or hard foods</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chips, popcorn, nuts, or raw vegetables can scrape against your healing gums or get stuck in extraction sites, causing irritation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Sticky candies</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Caramel, gum, and sweet candies may taste good, but they can also irritate sensitive areas and leave residue that attracts bacteria.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Spicy foods</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even if you pride yourself on handling all levels of spice, consider sticking to more neutral foods during recovery. Spicy foods can irritate your gums and increase swelling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Acidic foods</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Citrus, like oranges and grapefruits, along with other acidic foods like tomatoes, can sting sensitive areas and cause discomfort.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Alcohol</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alcohol can interfere with the healing process and may interact negatively with pain medication.
