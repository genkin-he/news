            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Hiroyuki Kume, Tomoko Numajiri and Miho Naganuma / Yomiuri Shimbun Staff Writers</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>JERA Co., a major Japanese power generation company, expressed its intention to expand its offshore wind power generation business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Masato Yamada, CEO of the Japan arm of JERA Nex BP Ltd., said that \"takeoff is key\" for the nation's wind power generation business, during an interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>JERA Nex BP is an offshore wind power generation joint venture established by JERA and British energy giant BP PLC.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yamada talked about JERA's outlook in the wind power generation business. The following is excerpted from his interview.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Yomiuri Shimbun: What do you think about the current business environment?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Masato Yamada: The depreciation of the yen is the biggest factor affecting Japan, in addition to inflation. The economic situation is extremely tough right now. Europe is also facing hardships, with projects being canceled or delayed one after another as they became unprofitable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, Japan's problems extend beyond these issues. We have to start from zero regarding offshore wind power generation, as it's a field we don't have any experience in. We are at the stage of initial investment. We need to prepare everything, from ships to ports.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Costs are going up due to uncertainties and inefficiencies, which stem from a lack of proficiency in the field. Those factors should be distinguished from costs that arise from macroeconomic conditions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The burden of initial investment needs to be shared in some way. Without doing so, it will be difficult for Japan's wind power generation business to take off. You know, an airplane consumes the most fuel during takeoff. Investment is needed to help the launch of the business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As I've said, takeoff is key. After that stage, an ecosystem will be formed, so costs can be pushed down. Europe has proven that costs decrease with experience. If we don't start, we will never reach the stage where costs begin to fall. We must overcome this hurdle first.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Competing in global market</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yomiuri: How many years will it take for your vision to be realized?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yamada: It took Europe 25 years.

Net income in the third quarter of 2025 and year to date primarily reflects lower sales to industrial customers and inflationary pressures at Minnesota Power, lower sales of renewable projects at the clean energy businesses and transaction related expenses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ALLETE awaits a written order from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (\"MPUC\") in order to execute on the closing of the partnership with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (\"CPP Investments\") and Global Infrastructure Partners (\"GIP\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I am grateful for the MPUC's unanimous approval of ALLETE's partnership with CPP Investments and GIP on October 3, 2025, and extremely proud of our entire ALLETE team for the thoughtful work with our many stakeholders throughout the regulatory process — all as they continue to work diligently to execute our Sustainability-in-Action strategy,\" said ALLETE Chair, President, and Chief Executive Officer Bethany Owen. \"The MPUC's approval results in historic benefits for our customers, our employees, and the communities we serve. We expect to close the transaction once the written order is received from the MPUC, and we are excited for the next chapter of ALLETE's wonderful history with these Partners that are aligned with our values and support our culture and strategy.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ALLETE's Regulated Operations segment, which includes Minnesota Power, SWLP and the Company's investment in the American Transmission Company, recorded third quarter 2025 net income of $32.5 million, compared to $34.0 million in the third quarter a year ago. Net income at Minnesota Power was lower than 2024 reflecting lower margins from industrial customers, and higher operating and maintenance expense, partially offset by lower income tax expense and increased cost recovery rider revenue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ALLETE Clean Energy recorded a third quarter 2025 net loss of $3.6 million compared to net income of $3.9 million in 2024. Net income in 2025 reflected lower production, along with associated tax credits, due to transmission network outages in the SPP market. Net income in the third quarter of 2024 reflected the sale of the Whitetail wind project.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>New Energy Equity recorded 2025 third quarter net income of $1.3 million, compared to net income of $11.7 million for the same period in 2024. Net income in 2025 includes lower sales of renewable energy projects due to the timing of project closings. These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings from tax equity financed solar energy facilities and higher investment tax credits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Corporate and Other businesses, which include BNI Energy, ALLETE Properties and our investments in renewable energy facilities, recorded a net loss of $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to a net loss of $4.6 million in 2024. Net income in 2025 reflects lower merger-related expenses compared to 2024, and lower income tax expense. Merger-related expenses were $3.1 million after-tax in 2025 compared to $3.8 million in 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Results for 2025 have been negatively impacted by lower industrial margins as a result of lower sales to taconite customers at Minnesota Power which are expected to continue through the remainder of 2025,\" said ALLETE Vice President — Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Treasurer Jeff Scissons. \"As a result of the transaction, historic customer, clean-energy, workforce and governance commitments have been made by our Partners. Approximately $200 million of value including rate credits, an immediate return on equity reduction and rate case stay-out provision will be recognized by Minnesota Power customers, while maintaining existing charitable and economic investments will benefit ALLETE stakeholders and our communities. The rate case stay-out provision will have an impact on 2026 financials, but it is a material benefit to all Minnesota Power customers.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ALLETE is an energy company headquartered in Duluth, Minn.

The video streamer is weighing up making a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studios business, according to a report.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both media stocks were rising ahead of the opening bell. Netflix shares climbed 2.6% to $1,117. Warner Bros. rose 2.5% to $22.15.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Futures tracking the S&amp;P 500 were 0.7% higher, boosted by solid quarterly earnings from Apple and Amazon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix is retaining the investment bank Moelis &amp; Co. as a financial advisor as it actively considers a Warner Bros. bid, and has been granted access to key financial information, Reuters reported, citing three people familiar with the matter. Moelis, Netflix, and Warner Bros. didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Barron's.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deal would give Netflix control over the rival HBO Max streaming service, as well as intellectual property like DC Comics and Harry Potter. That would feed the tech giant's flywheel model, a self-sustaining cycle of growth in which more subscribers means more money to spend on content, which in turn attracts even more users.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The news could kickstart a bidding war. Warner Bros' has already rejected three offers from Paramount Skydance, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month, citing people familiar with the matter. Its last offer was for $23.50 a share, the people said, which is still way below the $40 a share level that Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav is reportedly aiming for.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix announced a 10-for-1 stock split late Thursday, which it said would help reset shares to a range that would make it easier for employees taking part in an options program to buy in. The stock has climbed 22% this year, although third-quarter earnings took some of the shine off a bigger rally, as a continuing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities led to the company missing Wall Street's profit target.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
