The median forecast from a WSJ poll of seven economists is for a 2.2% on year rise in the benchmark consumer-price index, following a 2.1% gain in September. On a monthly basis, the index likely edged up 0.1% in October after September's 0.5% gain, the poll shows. While Citigroup economist Jin-Wook Kim says the inflationary pressure from pricey agricultural products during the early October Chuseok holiday may have eased somewhat, Shinyoung Securities economist Cho Yong-gu says higher prices for industrial goods and utility services still likely added to inflationary pressure. The October data are due Tuesday. (kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

It has 525 member organizations from around the world and 106 associate members.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dr. Preziosi was elected to serve for the 2025-29 term this week at the 28th CoNGO General Assembly, which took place in New York with the virtual participation of organizations from around the world. He succeeds the Rev. Dr. Liberato C. Bautista, the main representative to the UN for the General Board of Church and Society of The United Methodist Church, who has served as CoNGO's President since 2017 and also held the post from 2007 to 2011.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>TruMerit has been a member of CoNGO since 2018 and is active in the organization's affairs, having served as the organization's Secretary to the CoNGO Board and as chair of its Membership Committee.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dr. Preziosi is the first Registered Nurse to serve as CoNGO President. He is a nonprofit executive who since early 2023 has led TruMerit, formerly known as CGFNS International, a health workforce development organization committed to advancing the ethical mobility and professional growth of health workers worldwide. Previously, he was employed by the World Health Organization to help establish its technology-driven global learning center, the WHO Academy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dr. Bautista, the former President of CoNGO, extended his warm congratulations to Dr. Preziosi on his election. \"His experience at TruMerit and at WHO, coupled with his profound dedication to multilateralism and his engagement with civil society, provide a basis for optimism regarding CoNGO's future. In an era where the voice and influence of civil society are of paramount importance in shaping a shared future that upholds human dignity and rights, as well as planetary sustainability, Dr. Preziosi's leadership is expected to enhance CoNGO's role as a pivotal supporter and advocate for democratic and equitable participation within the United Nations and beyond,\" he stated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"CoNGO has long been a vital convener of NGOs, a bridge between civil society and an advocate for their engagement at the United Nations, as well as a steadfast champion of inclusive multilateralism - a concept that, unfortunately, is increasingly under attack,\" said Preziosi.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"In response, let us assert civil society participation at the United Nations not as a plea, but as a principle - one that is essential to legitimate, effective, and ethical multilateralism, and thereby is critical to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals and adherence to the rule of law,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About CoNGO (Conference of Non-Governmental Organizations in Consultative Relationship with the United Nations)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Conference of Non-Governmental Organizations in Consultative Relationship with the United Nations (CoNGO) is an independent, international membership association founded in 1948, the year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Close to 30 CoNGO Substantive Committees (called NGO Committees) related to CoNGO in New York, Geneva, Vienna, and regions worldwide demonstrate our commitment to supporting the mission of the United Nations, systemwide.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jamie McGeever</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell surprised many market-watchers on Wednesday when he declared that another interest rate cut in December was not a slam dunk. Perhaps even more surprising was his apparent suggestion that if boosting the labor market is the goal, rate cuts might not be that useful. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the press conference after the central bank lowered its fed funds policy target range by 25 basis points, Powell cited several reasons why a similar move in December is \"far from\" a done deal. These included \"strongly different\" views among rate-setters, limited data visibility due to the government shutdown, above-target inflation, and doubts about how quickly the labor market is slowing. He also noted that policy may be close to neutral after 150 basis points of easing. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But perhaps the most telling reason was the most simple: cutting rates won't work. At least, doing so won't address the current problem, which is supporting the softening labor market. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alluding to this, Powell admitted that the job market is weakening primarily because of shrinking labor supply rather than cooling demand for workers. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But lower borrowing costs are designed to boost demand for workers. If the job market's problems are \"mostly\" a function of labor supply, as Powell said, then cutting interest rates is akin to pushing on a string.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"So the question then is what does our tool do, which supports demand? Some people argue that this is supply, and we really can't affect it much with our tools. But others argue, as I do, that ... we should use our tools to support the labor market when we see this happening,\" Powell told reporters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's a complicated situation.\" </span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1061.3827993254638px;aspect-ratio:1.7689713322091063\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3WB0XC-aa1c88068fe19d0b2ca56a7ba93ca3b4-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"chart\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3WB0XC-aa1c88068fe19d0b2ca56a7ba93ca3b4-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#d4dbe2\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-S5VA5POt\"><span class=\"copyright-S5VA5POt\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-S5VA5POt\">US payrolls breakeven estimates - Dallas Fed</span></figcaption></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:880.1652892561983px;aspect-ratio:1.4669421487603307\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3WB0XC-289c494539f4f3d1bcc9e74fd7ea5b5a-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"The bar chart shows U.S. non-farm payrolls for one year ending August 2025.\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3WB0XC-289c494539f4f3d1bcc9e74fd7ea5b5a-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#392d24\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-S5VA5POt\"><span class=\"copyright-S5VA5POt\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-S5VA5POt\">No jobs data</span></figcaption></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'K-SHAPED' ECONOMY</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The current U.S. economic picture is indeed complicated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Job growth has slowed in the U.S. over the past year, but this has been offset by a steep decline in the number of people looking for work.
