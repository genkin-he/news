The competitive landscape is intensifying with both traditional and new financial services providers, including fintech companies offering alternative banking products.

Cybersecurity threats and data privacy concerns are critical, as breaches could damage reputation and financial standing.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The company is also exposed to interest rate risks, which could affect profitability due to the mismatch in the repricing of assets and liabilities. Inflationary pressures could further impact costs and customer repayment abilities. The reliance on small to medium-sized businesses, which have fewer resources to withstand economic pressures, adds to credit risk. Additionally, the real estate market's volatility, particularly in commercial real estate, poses a risk due to potential declines in property values and increased loan defaults.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Management acknowledges the heightened competition and regulatory scrutiny as significant challenges. Strategies to address these include enhancing technological capabilities to improve customer service and operational efficiency. The company is also focusing on diversifying its geographic footprint to mitigate regional economic risks. Efforts are being made to strengthen cybersecurity measures and data protection protocols to safeguard against breaches.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The company is exposed to market risks, particularly interest rate fluctuations, which could impact net interest income. The recent bank failures have heightened awareness around liquidity and deposit composition, necessitating careful liquidity management.

Mast cell activation plays a central role in the onset and progression of CSU. While the goal of CSU treatment is the complete absence of symptoms, the vast majority of patients today, even those receiving the most advanced approved and available therapies, continue to suffer from itch, hives, swelling, sleep disruption, and unrelenting anxiety about when the next flare up will occur.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Chronic Inducible Urticaria (CIndU), Cold Urticaria (ColdU), Symptomatic Dermographism (SD)</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>CIndU is characterized by the occurrence of hives or wheals that have an attributable trigger associated with them. ColdU symptoms include itching, burning wheals/hives and angioedema when skin is exposed to cold temperatures. SD symptoms include the development of wheals in response to stroking, scratching or rubbing of the skin. For these diseases, mast cell activation leading to release of soluble mediators is thought to be the driving mechanism leading to the wheals and other symptoms. There are currently no approved therapies for chronic inducible urticarias other than antihistamines and patients attempt to manage symptoms associated with their disease through avoidance of triggers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Barzolvolimab</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Barzolvolimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with a completely novel mechanism of action that targets mast cells by binding with high specificity to a unique part of the KIT receptor and potently inhibiting its activity. The KIT receptor is abundantly expressed by mast cells and critical for their function and survival. Mast cells are drivers of inflammatory responses such as hypersensitivity and allergic reactions and, in certain inflammatory diseases, such as chronic urticarias, mast cell activation plays a central role in the onset and progression of the disease. Based on data from robust, randomized, placebo controlled Phase 2 studies, barzolvolimab has significant potential as a first-in-class and best-in-disease treatment option for patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), cold urticaria (ColdU) and symptomatic dermographism (SD). Barzolvolimab is currently being studied in Phase 3 studies in CSU and ColdU/SD and Phase 2 studies in prurigo nodularis (PN) and atopic dermatitis (AD), with additional indications planned for the future.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Celldex </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Celldex is pioneering new horizons in immunology to deliver life-changing therapies.

(\"RECX\") is the manufacturer of MAX amphibious six-wheel-drive (6x6) all-terrain vehicles (www.maxatvs.com), originally manufactured by Recreatives Industries Inc. of Buffalo, NY, from 1970 to 2013. RECX is continuing MAX's brand legacy of 53 years by relaunching the entire MAX ATV product line from existing, proven designs, which will ensure a rapid re-entry into the global ATV and UTV. Beyond traditional MAX ATV production, RECX plans to diversify its product line by introducing new vehicles and products to market in a compressed timeframe. The company's planned diversification includes larger eight-wheeled vehicles (8x8) as well as electric vehicle (EV) drivetrains to draw on recent advancements in battery and drive motor technology, which make fitment in smaller vehicles possible. RECX management believes that electric vehicles can ultimately offer performance that exceeds that of the traditional mechanical transmissions that most all-terrain vehicles employ.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Safe Harbor</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>This news release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, intended to be covered by the \"safe harbor\" created by those sections.

The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV, an exchange-traded fund that tracks software stocks, was almost 2%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Concerns have been brewing among investors that AI could do away with the need for workers across sectors, from insurance to wealth management to real estate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors not only worry that AI efficiencies will drive companies to cut costs and head counts; they also fear that fewer employees will directly translate to shrinking demand for traditional software licenses. Many business-software companies sell their products based on customer head count, or on a per-seat basis, and investors are looking carefully at whether software companies will be hit by a decline in these subscriptions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So when Block (XYZ) announced on Thursday that it is cutting more than 40% of its employees, some analysts interpreted the news as a prequel to a future where AI will replace the workforce. And those fears hit software stocks that were trying to recover after weeks of negative sentiment driven by AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Block job cuts are the latest blow to investor confidence in the software sector's ability to withstand the ongoing threat that AI will dramatically shift the future of work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Monday, software stocks lost over $200 billion in market capitalization after Citrini Research released a blog post depicting a hypothetical future where AI leads to mass layoffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read more: Did a blog post just cause software stocks to lose more than $200 billion in market cap?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Truist Securities analyst Matthew Coad said in a note that Block may be a   \"case study\" for how companies' investments in AI could \"adversely impact employment rates.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>J.P.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>PRFoods’ second quarter of the financial year continued to take place in a challenging economic environment, characterized by weak consumption, price sensitivity, and increased cost pressure. This has particularly affected the Group’s operations in Estonia and nearby markets. At the same time, management has remained focused on core activities, cost control, and strengthening the financial structure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the second quarter of the financial year, the Group’s revenue amounted to EUR 5.1 million, decreasing by EUR 1.7 million, or 25%, compared to the same period last year. The decline in revenue was mainly due to lower sales volumes in the Estonian and Finnish markets. Quarterly gross profit was EUR 1.0 million, down 43% year-on-year, reflecting lower production volumes and price pressure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>EBITDA in the second quarter was EUR 0.2 million, below the EUR 0.6 million recorded in the previous financial year. Depreciation expenses remained stable, and operating profit was close to zero, compared to an operating profit of EUR 0.4 million in the previous financial year. The net loss for the second quarter amounted to EUR 0.7 million, compared to a net loss of EUR 0.1 million in the previous financial year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the first half of the year, the Group’s revenue reached EUR 8.7 million, decreasing by EUR 2.7 million, or 23%, compared to the same period of the previous financial year. Gross profit for the six-month period totalled EUR 1.7 million, which is 34% lower than in the previous financial year. EBITDA for the six months amounted to EUR -0.1 million, compared to a positive EUR 0.7 million in the previous financial year. The operating loss amounted to EUR 0.3 million and the net loss to EUR 1.5 million, significantly affected by increased financial expenses related to the restructuring of debt obligations in the previous financial year and lower operating volumes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Geographically, the Group’s sales were mainly concentrated in the United Kingdom market, where six-month revenue amounted to EUR 7.7 million, representing 87.7% of the Group’s total revenue. Compared to the previous financial year, sales in the United Kingdom remained essentially stable. Revenue in the Estonian market declined to EUR 1.0 million during the same period, decreasing by EUR 2.5 million, or more than 70%, clearly reflecting weak consumption in Estonia and nearby markets and pressure in the retail sector.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We are entering the third quarter in continued uncertain market conditions, and a recovery in consumption is not yet visible either in Estonia or in nearby markets. In this environment, management’s priorities are further improving efficiency, controlling the cost base, and managing financial obligations. Activities already initiated to strengthen the Group’s capital structure and long-term sustainability will also be continued.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>KEY

Nvidia beat earnings forecasts, is seeing fast growth for its high-margin data-center chips, and even guided for $78 billion in first-quarter sales — $5 billion above expectations. The stock, however, dropped 9% for the last two days of this week, helping to lead the market lower.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.6% for the week, and was on pace for its worst week since late November, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3% and the S&amp;P 500 index declined 0.8%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The [AI] trade has gotten stretched,\" says Kenny Polcari, veteran trader and chief market strategist at SlateStone Wealth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If only the market didn't have other things to worry about. Private-credit fears have hit financial stocks. January's producer price index revealed hotter-than-expected cost inflation. A U.S. attack on Iran could be in the works. And the administration is increasing base tariffs on imports moving into the U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But ultimately it comes back to earnings, especially profit margins. While nothing in Nvidia's earnings call pointed to slowing data-center growth — one of the market's greatest fears — its 75% full-year gross margin guidance beat estimates by only a few tenths of a percentage point.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And it's not just Nvidia whose margins could be peaking — or even coming under pressure. Aggregate reported gross margins for S&amp;P 500 companies — excluding financials and real estate companies — recently dropped to roughly 45% from a multidecade peak of over 47% in 2021, according to Trivariate Research. Gross margins are important because they're a key indicator of a company's future earnings. Lower ones indicate each product or service it offers is inherently less profitable and is often consistent with waning demand and growth, even if net margins, which companies can boost through cost cutting, suggest everything is fine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There's a direct link between margins and valuations. Price/earnings multiples are largely higher for companies with fatter gross margins, Trivariate's data show, so disappointments on margins would reduce multiples — and cause individual stocks to fall.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The result: The S&amp;P 500 has gone nowhere for the past two months. To Frank Cappelleri, market technician and founder of CappThesis, the selling suggests a market that looks \"toppy.\" Unless something changes for the better, selloffs could resurface when the index hits 7000, putting a \"potential bearish pattern\" in play.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>No bell has rung just yet. The S&amp;P 500 is still holding key support between 6750 and 6800, Cappelleri says. But anything below that level opens the door to an even larger drop. Beyond that, the next key level to watch would be 6538, where buyers stepped in after a decline in late November. That's about 5% below the current level. By contrast, the iShares MSCI ACWI ex US exchange-traded fund, which holds non-U.S. stocks, rose 0.4% this past week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stocks have little margin for error now — and the problem might be us.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Jacob Sonenshine at jacob.sonenshine@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

They spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>European Commission antitrust regulators usually take a tough line when market share is 30% or more. Paramount has yet to formally seek EU approval, but is providing information on its businesses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deal would also require approval under the EU's foreign subsidies regulation because Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Abu Dhabi's L'imad Holding Company and the Qatar Investment Authority are also bankrolling the bid. The FSR targets unfair foreign state aid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount declined to comment. The Commission said the deal has not been formally notified to the watchdog and declined further comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>PARAMOUNT OPEN TO DIVESTING MINOR CHANNELS</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While Paramount hopes to secure unconditional EU approval, the company is willing to divest minor channels such as its children's brands if required, the people said. Overlapping businesses include the combination of two studios and several TV channels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount has Nickelodeon while Warner Bros owns the Cartoon Network.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount will likely seek formal EU approval in the coming months, the people said, which will then kick off a 25-working-day preliminary review, which can be extended by 10 working days if remedies are offered at the end of the 25 days.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>California may be the biggest obstacle to the deal. Regulatory approvals from the U.S. and UK are also key deal requirements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount has been on the charm offensive in Europe since January, with CEO David Ellison meeting French President Emmanuel Macron that month while Chief Legal Officer Makan Delrahim met the European Commission's top merger official Guillaume Loriot that same week, the people said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Delrahim is well-acquainted with Loriot from his previous stint as assistant attorney general at the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust division.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>European Parliament lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who has criticised Netflix's bid and led the negotiations in several pieces of tech legislation in recent years and also met Delrahim last month, said a Paramount bid poses fewer issues.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I think Paramount is something we could accept. It is a concentration in the production of films. There is no risk of a digital champion taking over the video streaming market,\" he said.</span></p></span></div></div>",
