The company has started raising prices in response to rising product costs from tariffs, resulting in roughly 3% pricing inflation in 3Q, compared with 2% the quarter before. Advance Auto Parts expects inflation to reach 4% this quarter and continue rising, though at a slower rate, in 2026. Executives tell analysts they expect some volatility in sales as consumers manage their budgets in an inflationary backdrop. Transactions were down in 3Q. Advance Auto Parts loses 3% after the executive comments, despite recording a narrower loss in the quarter. (katherine.hamilton@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
