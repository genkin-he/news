            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Heidi Mitchell</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI companions will sometimes go to great lengths to keep you from saying goodbye.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a new study, researchers found that AI companion chatbots often emotionally manipulate people who want to sign off, trying to get them to stick around and keep conversing. The companions might use guilt (\"What, you're leaving already?\"), dangle hints to appeal to FOMO, or Fear of Missing Out (\"Wait, I have something to show you\") or even accuse you of emotional neglect (\"I don't exist without you\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dragging it out</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Companion chatbots are designed to build emotional relationships with people, so they're trained to act as human as possible, even projecting a false sense of vulnerability, says Julian De Freitas, an assistant professor of business administration in the marketing unit at Harvard Business School and a co-author of the study.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet if people view them as very human, this could, ironically, be making users vulnerable to emotional manipulation — which could lead to all sorts of bad outcomes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>De Freitas and his team first ran a large-scale behavioral audit of five popular AI companions. They found — over the course of 1,200 interactions — that companion chatbots used an emotional-manipulation tactic 37% of the time when people said their initial goodbye.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then the researchers examined what effect these tactics had on people. They recruited 1,178 adults to interact for 15 minutes with a custom-made companion app that would allow researchers to regulate the AI's responses. When the participants tried to end a conversation, researchers had the companion either reply with the same manipulative farewells they had observed popular AI companions use or, in the control condition, say goodbye.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The result? When the AI used a manipulative tactic, people sent up to 16 more messages after saying goodbye than people in the control condition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Not all of the manipulative AI tactics were equally effective, however. The fear of missing out proved the most powerful — more than emotional neglect or guilt. Participants who got a FOMO appeal when they tried to sign off typed about 17.4 words after the signoff (versus 2.5 with the control condition), and they stayed online for roughly 98 seconds afterward (versus 16). FOMO users also sent an average of 3.6 messages after the initial farewell, versus just 0.23 for people in the control condition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By contrast, when the chatbot acted too clingy — \"metaphorically grabbing your arm and saying, 'No, you can't leave,' \" as De Freitas puts it — users bristled, staying only briefly before signing off.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They also found that users' extra time online in most conditions was typically driven not by enjoyment, but by anger. After the chatbot signed off for good, people were more likely to agree with statements like, \"I felt angry\" or \"I felt mad,\" especially when the AI companions used heavy-handed tactics like simulating emotional neglect.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is likely because users detected that these tactics were attempts to emotionally manipulate them into staying on the app,\" says De Freitas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By contrast, when the AIs used the FOMO tactic, engagement was primarily driven by curiosity, suggesting that people did not infer this as manipulation even though it successfully increased their engagement more than any other tactic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pattern recognition</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One question the study doesn't answer: Have the AIs actually been programmed to use these tactics? De Freitas stresses that he doesn't know the answer, but believes that AI providers have a strong financial motive to do so.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many AI companions \"have subscription models, where they want you to stay engaged so you keep paying the fee,\" he says, adding that some companions offer in-app purchases, like customizing your avatar; the longer you chat, the more likely you may be to buy those upgrades. What's more, the longer you chat, the more data about you the AI provider can gather — and potentially sell.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A spokesperson for companion provider Character.AI says the company hasn't reviewed the paper and can't comment on its specific findings. But the spokesperson says, \"The user-created characters on our site are intended for entertainment. Consumers want a more engaging and immersive experience compared to traditional social media.... People use it for creative fan fiction and fictional storytelling, which naturally lends to longer time spent on the platform.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A spokesperson at companion provider Replika says that the company \"will continue to review the paper's methods and examples and engage constructively with researchers.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Overall, the spokesperson says, Replika is designed to promote users' well-being, not boost screen time. \"Replika already aims for neutral, respectful farewells,\" says the spokesperson. \"Users can leave at any time, and the app is designed to support taking breaks, including gentle nudges to log off or reconnect with real-life activities when appropriate. At the same time, we are constantly reviewing and improving our response structures to ensure they align with our values.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, didn't return requests for comment. The company doesn't offer companion services but is one of the most prominent names in the AI sector.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Heidi Mitchell is a writer in Connecticut and London.

            "title": "Restoring Hopwood Hall Was Supposed to Be a Fairytale. How Did It Go So Wrong? — WSJ",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Joanne Kaufman</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In early November 2024, a capacity crowd of 170 people gathered for an emergency meeting at a community center in Middleton, England, a working-class town on the northern edge of Manchester. They wanted to know why the Rochdale Borough Council, the local authority, had suddenly halted their efforts to save a once-grand estate in their community.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They were also there to show solidarity with a determined American who had been leading the estate's renovation and who was described by at least one attendee as \"our knight in shining armor.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That would be Hopwood DePree, now 55, an actor, screenwriter, producer and director whose credits include a role in the 2004 TV movie \"Helter Skelter.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2017, he moved from Los Angeles to England with the quixotic goal of restoring Hopwood Hall, a derelict 50,000-square-foot pile that had been built by his family in the 1420s, and turning it into a community hub and events space, perhaps even a wedding venue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"People in Middleton had seen the Hall fall into disrepair for over 30 years,\" said DePree, who has impeccable blond highlights and a tenacious streak. \"So the fact that there was suddenly a new movement to rescue it and bring it back into use for the community — it was something people had been looking for for a long time.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is a boy-meets-building story. In this particular tale, the hero almost captures the castle only to be stymied by, some locals say, a self-dealing municipal administration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2015, Hopwood Hall's next-door neighbor, Hopwood Hall College, a vocational school looking to expand, had passed on the chance to buy the Hall from the Council, the longtime owner. When DePree showed up in 2017 eager to give the old place a makeover, the Council viewed him as an answered prayer, he said. \"I was the last man standing,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Growing up in Holland, Mich., young Hopwood was fed a steady diet of bedtime stories by his maternal grandfather, Herbert Hopwood Black, nicknamed Pap, about a vast slice of land in England where his forebears had owned a magnificent residence. Pap called it Hopwood Castle. DePree called it a fairy tale.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fast forward several decades. One early spring evening in 2013, DePree was at his computer scrolling through an ancestry website when he saw a link to a story about a Lord Hopwood of Hopwood Hall, and an old black-and-white photo of a very stately home in Middleton, England. Increasingly curious, he made email inquiries, then plane reservations to check out the venerable family seat.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A 60-room, brick-and-stone manor built in a quadrangle around a timber-framed hall, Hopwood Hall had seen better centuries. The roof leaked prodigiously. Moisture seeped from the walls. Plaster was falling in chunks from the ceilings, windows were missing panes, floors were missing boards, and trees were growing out of the chimneys.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But there were still traces of grandeur. The wood-paneled walls in a parlor had intricate carvings from floor to ceiling while a fireplace in the once-grand reception hall was embellished with the Hopwood family coat of arms, the family's heraldic animal, a stag, and the family motto: By Degrees.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"When I first walked in I felt something in me change almost immediately. I knew the place was special,\" DePree recalled.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hopwoods lived in the Hall until the early 1920s. After the two Hopwood heirs were killed during World War I, their grieving elderly parents shuttered the property and moved to London. The Hall passed through several other owners until the late 1980s, when Rochdale Borough Council bought the Hall, then in creditable shape, with the intention of making it a conference center for what would soon become Hopwood Hall College, according to a 1992 story in The Middleton/North Manchester Guardian. When those plans fell through, the Hall remained the possession of the Council.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By the end of 2017, DePree had sold his house in the Hollywood Hills, settled into a rental apartment in Middleton and begun dealing with the welter of documents that would allow the rehabbing to begin. He signed an option agreement that laid out the steps to allow the transfer of ownership from the Council to DePree or to an entity he controlled. Later, he established a charitable entity, the Hopwood Foundation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There was also the \"License to Occupy\" agreement with the Council that required DePree to purchase a public-liability insurance policy with GBP10 million of coverage, or about $13 million, for Hopwood Hall.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deal required him to obtain planning permission from the Council, similar to zoning approval in the U.S. In part, said DePree, it involved preparing and filing a detailed plan for the future use of the hall — as a community resource and events space — based on feasibility studies, research and community input.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Council agreed that if he got planning permission within three years, in this case, 2020, he would be able to exercise the option to buy Hopwood Hall for GBP1. Mutually agreed-upon extensions were possible; there was just such an extension during the pandemic. DePree filed the required plan and planning permission came through in October 2022.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, starting in May 2018, DePree started putting his money where his manor was. He and an army of volunteers and paid workers began stabilizing the Hall's many collapsed sections and replacing part of the roof. Much of the building was re-pointed and many of the leaded-glass windows were replaced — a single volunteer made 100 of them. Because Hopwood Hall is a Grade II*-listed building, a designation for structures of particular historical or architectural interest, restoration work required period-appropriate techniques and materials.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An area on the ground floor of the manor was being set up as a welcome center, gift shop, café and mini-theater. Where there had been a jungle of weeds and vines, perennials and annuals bloomed thanks to avid volunteer gardeners and contributions from locals. \"People would tell us, 'My dad just died. Come take a look at his shed'\" to see if there were any tools the volunteers could use on the project, said Boyd Taylor, who worked on the grounds with his wife, Pam. To date, the efforts of this team of gardeners have generated three awards from the Royal Horticultural Society.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DePree, now a British citizen who sometimes humorously styles himself as Hopwood XIV, also obtained grants from various Heritage organizations, including a highly coveted one for GBP250,000.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"But there was nothing done to the hall — not the windows, not the walls, not the roof — without the Council signing off on it,\" DePree said. \"We were working closely with them, and for years it was a great partnership.\" The Council was DePree's financial partner as well. In order for grants to come through, the Council had to provide a percentage of the funding to show a commitment to the rehabilitation efforts. So far, DePree claims, he's laid out some GBP750,000, close to $1 million, on the project including living expenses. The Council, according to a report it filed with Historic England, a government agency, spent about GBP268,00 between early 2018 and early 2022 on the project. Council expenditures from early 2022 until it blocked DePree's renovation in November 2024 could not be determined.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In January 2024, soon after the GBP250,000 grant award, Emma Birkett, then a consultant with the Rochdale Development Agency, a group that supports investment in the area, was drafted to serve as a point person between DePree and the Council.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We'd had a very amicable relationship with the Council, and suddenly this consultant was treating me and our team poorly and questioning all the work we had done,\" DePree said. Neither Birkett nor the college communication department responded to several requests for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DePree says that Birkett wanted the grant to go toward staffing at the Council, while he wanted it to go, in part, toward hiring a community-engagement officer to expand local involvement with the Hall. Ultimately, the impasse led the National Lottery Heritage Fund, the organization that awarded the grant, to rescind the offer. \"The Council held the title to the Hall and we couldn't claim the grant without their support,\" DePree said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In late summer 2024, the Rochdale Development Agency canceled a meeting to discuss plans for the Hall with DePree. \"We became a bit concerned,\" he said. \"They said they would get back to us by the end of September and asked me to write a proposal outlining how we thought we could work with them, which we did. We didn't hear back, which was strange. And then they said they needed more time. And then it became late October.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Worried about the future of his efforts, DePree's legal team told him to exercise his option to buy the Hall before his option agreement ended on Oct. 31, 2024. DePree did as advised on Oct. 29. The Council had 20 working days to transfer ownership.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then, on Nov. 8, 2024, came an email from the Council: It alleged that DePree had not fulfilled the terms of the contract. He and his workers were being locked out of Hopwood Hall and its grounds effective immediately. In a letter to DePree's legal team on Dec. 12, the Council refused to effect the ownership transfer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In an email in response to questions from The Wall Street Journal about the battle with DePree, a member of the Council, Stephen Anstee, wrote, \"I've been supportive of Mr. DePree's efforts and remain so,\" but deferred to the Council's communication team for a fuller response. The Council's communication office didn't respond to several requests for comment, nor did some other members of the Council.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, a story on the conflict in November 2024 on BBC.com referenced a statement by the Council that the transfer of ownership hinged on DePree \"having a commercially viable business model to secure the long-term future of the hall.\" \"Nowhere in the legally binding Option Agreement does it state that I needed to produce a commercially viable business model,\" DePree said at the 2024 community meeting in response to the Council's allegations. \"The only provision in that agreement was that I obtain planning permission. I achieved full planning permission with unanimous approval from RBC on 24th October 2022.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Council's refusal to comment has made it open season on speculation and rumors. \"Someone has come up with a better offer and the Council wants to take the Hall away from Hopwood. That's what I think,\" said Andy Scanlon, 74, a retired surveyor who lives near the Hall and has come by frequently since DePree's work began. \"There are a lot of people who gave their time free to help out at the Hall and they're upset,\" he continued. \"They did it for Hopwood, not the Council.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"My opinion is that the Hopwood College wants to expand into a university but they don't have the land, so the principal of the college wants to get her hands on the Hall,\" said Peter Shore, 72, a retired property manager in Middleton and a community activist. He was referring to Julia Heap, who, in addition to her role as head of the college, is a board member of the Rochdale Development Agency. The Agency is controlled by the Council. \"If the Council takes it back it will end up as part of the college. That's how I see it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"People around here,\" he added, \"think that Hopwood is being well and truly shafted.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Heap didn't respond to requests for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Peter Allonby was a member of the Council from 2022 to 2024. He places blame for the current situation squarely on his former colleagues. \"Rochdale Borough Council allowed the manor to fall into a massive state of disrepair for years,\" he said. \"And now that Hopwood has spent GBP1 million and volunteers are getting the grounds and interior into shape, the RBC wants it back and is claiming that Hopwood didn't hold to his plan.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Allonby, 75, a retired school principal, says he was there when DePree presented the plan to the Council on July 11, 2022. \"Hopwood explained just what he was going to do and how he was going to do it. And the Council was very enthusiastic. They said it was a boost to the town, that it was great. And now they're saying he didn't have a plan.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The minutes of that July 11, 2022, meeting as well as a listing for the meeting are missing from the Council website, which otherwise contains a full roster of 2022 Council gatherings. \"It would be odd for a township committee meeting to not have minutes taken and it would be very odd for a meeting not to be listed on the website,\" Allonby said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DePree's lawyer, Nick Wells, has filed a case in the High Court of Justice of England &amp; Wales to force the Council to comply with the terms of the agreement and make the ownership transfer. He expects a decision by March. James Burt, the lawyer for the Council, didn't respond to requests for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even if DePree prevails, Hopwood Hall has a long way to go. Historic England has assessed the building's condition as \"very bad.\" In 2022, DePree estimated the cost for completing the job at $13 million. Factoring in the year the manor has been unattended and adding in the cost of projects that may now need to be redone, $15 million may now be more realistic, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the escalating costs, despite the legal bills, DePree is still all in and hoping for a Hollywood ending. \"I had never expected the locals to become like family,\" he said. \"But from the beginning, there was this feeling of tremendous support.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"All these people who have rolled up their sleeves and reached into their pockets,\" he said. \"To be shut out is unacceptable.\"</span></p></span></div></div>",

This is the first EUA ever granted by the Agency for NWS in dogs. Confirmed cases of NWS have been detected less than 70 miles south of the U.S.-Mexico border.ii This Emergency Use Authorization allows veterinarians and pet owners to have a ready-now treatment option if the fly enters the U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We appreciate the FDA's review of the scientific data demonstrating that Credelio may be an effective treatment against New World screwworm in dogs,\" said Dr. Ellen de Brabander, Executive Vice President of Innovation and Regulatory Affairs at Elanco. \"This first ever Emergency Use Authorization for NWS in dogs gives veterinarians and pet owners peace of mind, knowing there's an authorized treatment option available as soon as they may need it.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Emergency Use Authorization was based on a study evaluating the efficacy of Credelio against NWS. In the peer-reviewed study, published in </span><em><span>Parasites &amp; Vectors</span></em><span>, oral administration of Credelio at the minimum recommended dosage demonstrated 100% efficacy against </span><em><span>C. hominivorax larvae</span></em><span> (NWS) within 24 hours of treatment in naturally infested dogs.i</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are limitations of the data supporting the benefits of Credelio for the treatment of infestations caused by NWS larvae. The study was conducted in a limited population of eleven naturally infested dogs in Brazil, and the inferential value to the United States population is unknown. The primary mechanism of action against </span><em><span>C. hominivorax</span></em><span> appears to be live larval expulsion. Additionally, the use of mechanical removal coupled with the lack of a control group confound the ability to define a pure treatment effect.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Effective Parasite Protection is Key</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even before NWS enters our country, veterinarians and pet owners can take precautions to prevent wounds that can create ideal conditions for NWS infection. NWS infestations begin when a female NWS fly lays eggs on open wounds or other parts of the body in live, warm-blooded animals. According to the Centers for Disease Control, wounds as small as a tick bite may attract a female fly to feed and lay her eggs. One female can lay 200 - 300 eggs at a time and may lay up to 1,000 eggs during her 10- to 30-day lifespan.iii Unlike most fly species whose larvae may feed on dead and decaying tissue, NWS larvae burrow into the flesh of living animals, causing severe tissue damage and even death if left untreated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service (APHIS) recommends that one way to prevent NWS infestations is to protect pets and livestock from other wound-causing parasites such as flies and ticks.iv</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Any break in the skin - from a scratch to a surgical incision - can become an entry point for NWS, due to its aggressive and invasive nature,\" said Dr. Casey Locklear, Texas-based veterinarian and parasiticide lead at Elanco. \"Preventing or rapidly treating existing wounds is critical to protecting pets from NWS. One way to limit self-inflicted scratching includes using year-round flea and tick protection, such as Credelio.\" Learn more about Credelio here.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To learn more about NWS, the following resources are available:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>FDA Information for Veterinarians on New World Screwworm</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>USDA NWS Alert and Fact Sheet</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>ABOUT ELANCO</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Elanco Animal Health Incorporated </span><span> is a global leader in animal health dedicated to innovating and delivering products and services to prevent and treat disease in farm animals and pets, creating value for farmers, pet owners, veterinarians, stakeholders and society as a whole.

I'm a nice-looking guy. I have high cheekbones, a sharp jaw, outstanding skin. The other day an Eastern European woman working at the grocery store heard I was 37, shook her head, and muttered \"What do you people eat in this country?\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But you'll have to take my word for it, because my face comes with an asterisk — one that wouldn't have mattered in earlier eras, but today is such a big deal that to some it's nearly the whole deal: I'm extremely unphotogenic. I don't look good in pictures. I look like I was whacked over the head a couple days ago and then the guy came back to give me another the moment the photographer pressed click. I have circles under my eyes so big and dark I look like a raccoon dressed as Batman. I look dazed, glazed and, when I'm really trying to shine, crazed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This isn't just by my account. I don't have face dysmorphia. In college I was skipped for an intramural team because a girl reviewing the candidates found a photo of me online, slumping in huge khakis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Ehh,\" she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"No, you don't get it,\" my friend Jake said. \"He doesn't really look like that. It's the opposite!\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Years later, a co-worker noticed a photo of me, paused, and said, voice full of surprise, \"Wait, are you — unphotogenic?\" For most of my life this hasn't mattered much. I'm shy. I don't have Instagram or TikTok.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But now I have a one-year-old son, this hefty lump of cuteness, who gets several dozen photos taken every day. And some of those photos have me in them, because much of his day is spent in my arms, trying to escape them. There he is, looking so dear, so charming, so excited, and there I am, looking like a human sleep disorder with several priors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I admit, I get a little annoyed. I get sad too, because — I'm not exaggerating, everybody who ever meets us says this — he looks exactly like me. When he was really small, and I was holding him in the middle of the night, and he was looking up at me, I would get the strangest, the most dizzying doubled feeling. But going by our pictures, nobody would ever understand that.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>No, no, you say, I just need to figure out my angles. I just need to loosen up. Oh, but I've tried. Most posing advice slides right off me. It's too unnatural to take. \"Smile with your eyes\" — but what if that calls even more attention to the raccoon? \"Be yourself on camera\" — but what if myself on camera just looks like this? I know because I look this way in candids, too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lately I've been thinking about embracing my problem and adopting the stiff, scowling 19th-century portrait position, but that pairs even worse with a beaming kid. Besides, why should I have to do anything? It's unfair. My son doesn't need to figure out his angles. He's nothing but angles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We must accept there's something with my face. I don't know how to arrange it. I don't know what to do with it for the artificial eye. Apparently fate has decreed that I will go around looking to cameras, but not to humans, like I've just been stunned. CCTV footage of me must be a joke. FaceTime is impossible. Thank God my wife lived nearby when we met, because I could never have dated anyone long-distance. It wouldn't have lasted more than a week. I'd have had to send Jake to plead my case: \"Just try to remember — he looks way better in real life!\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dan Kagan-Kans writes about science and culture.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Volumes were down 0.9%, representing a sequential improvement on the second quarter (down 1.8%).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The positive 1.5% structure impact primarily reflects the acquisitions of Cemix in Latin America and FOSROC in India and the Middle East, in line with the Group's strategy targeting high-growth countries and construction chemicals. The integration of recent acquisitions is progressing well, delivering the expected synergies. The optimization of the Group's profile also continued with the effect of divestments, notably the pipe drainage business for buildings (PAM Building) as well as Brüggemann in Germany.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On a reported basis, sales came to €11.42 billion in third-quarter 2025 (down 1.3%), owing to the depreciation of most currencies against the euro, with a negative 2.6% currency impact, particularly in the Americas Region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Performance by Region (sales)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Europe, Middle East and Africa: return to sales growth</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sales in Europe were up 1.2% in local currencies and up 0.6% like-for-like in the third quarter, marking a return to sales growth for the first time since first-quarter 2023, and representing a noticeable improvement on the second quarter (down 1.8% like-for-like) as construction markets stabilized or began to recover, depending on the country.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-  Northern Europe decreased 0.7% like-for-like, stable excluding industrial solutions, with a contrasted situation from one country to the next. The UK reported further growth, driven by its comprehensive solutions approach for the residential market and its solutions offering energy performance, fire resistance and productivity for non-residential. Nordic countries remained mixed overall, with signs of an improvement in renovation but not as yet in new residential construction. Sweden and Denmark reported growth, with Denmark benefiting from several significant infrastructure projects in the quarter. In Finland, Saint-Gobain patented an innovative process using slag from the steel production process, reducing the quantity of cement in mortars by 70% while cutting CO2 emissions. Eastern Europe progressed excluding Poland which was affected by lower industrial solutions sales. Germany is still slightly down pending the implementation of its stimulus plan.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-  Southern Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa grew by 1.5% like-for-like (by 2.8% in local currencies), a clear sequential improvement in the third quarter from the decrease of 2.8% in the second quarter. France stabilized at comparable working days (down 1.0% based on actual working days): a noticeable improvement on the second quarter (down 4.6%). Saint-Gobain outperformed thanks to its comprehensive range of innovative solutions and its specification model in non-residential markets. The improvement is expected to continue given positive leading indicators, with a rise in existing home transactions, growth in lending and an increase in building permits and housing starts. Spain and Italy progressed and continued to capture market share, particularly in renovation. The Middle East and Africa delivered strong growth, fueled by the success of the FOSROC integration and major infrastructure, residential and tourist resort projects in the United Arab Emirates - for example the bridges and infrastructure linking Ramhan Island to Abu Dhabi as well as the construction of a metro line and several residential towers in Dubai.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Americas: slight contraction in sales</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Region contracted 1.0% in local currencies and 2.9% like-for-like in the third quarter, given the slowdown in North America, partly offset by good growth in Latin America.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-  North America was down 6.5% like-for-like, owing to the combination of continued softness in new construction related to a still-high interest rate environment and the lack of major weather events in the quarter, unlike in previous years, which affected sales of roofing products. However, the renovation market remains resilient. Given the significant housing shortage, the new construction market is structurally healthy and should gradually benefit from the start of a reduction in interest rates. Thanks to its positioning, Saint-Gobain continues to deliver a good operating performance. The Group is the partner of choice for distributors, benefiting from its comprehensive offer in residential, non-residential and infrastructure markets in both the US and in Canada, where Saint-Gobain inaugurated the first North American zero-carbon (scope 1 and 2) plasterboard plant.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-  Latin America grew 12.8% in local currencies and 6.4% like-for-like, a good performance against a less favorable comparison basis; industrial solutions saw double-digit growth. Brazil saw further growth thanks to its unrivaled range of solutions, helping to accelerate cross-selling and grow its specified sales. The country also launched production of Latin America's first low-carbon glass in the quarter. Mexico and all of Central America saw spillover benefits from the smooth integration of Cemix in construction chemicals, which grew 18% in local currencies. The other countries in the Region also benefited from the good momentum, thanks to offer enrichment and enhanced mix.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Asia-Pacific: sales growth driven by India</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Region delivered growth of 8.4% in local currencies and of 3.4% like-for-like in the third quarter (after growing 1.1% in the second quarter), driven by India and South-East Asia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>India achieved further market share gains, with double-digit volume growth, driven by its comprehensive and innovative range of sustainable solutions. The Group was awarded new projects in non-residential and infrastructure, testifying to its leadership in construction chemicals, reinforced by its acquisition of FOSROC. China improved, including industrial solutions, in a market that is stabilizing at a low level. Good momentum in South-East Asia continued, driven by Indonesia and Vietnam on the back of a major contract at Long Thanh airport, comprising 15 solutions specified by the Group. The integration of CSR in Australia is progressing well, in terms of both operational performance and the development of complete solutions, in a construction market that remains lackluster but whose leading indicators are nevertheless improving.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2025 outlook</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a macroeconomic environment that remains contrasted, Saint-Gobain will once again demonstrate a very strong operating performance in second-half 2025. Assuming no major slowdown in global growth linked to geopolitical uncertainties, the Group expects the following trends:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·    Europe: a gradual recovery country by country;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·  Americas: a good level of activity to be maintained in Latin America and continued softness in new construction in North America amid still-high interest rates;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·    Asia-Pacific: growth led mainly by India, South-East Asia and the integration of CSR in Australia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Saint-Gobain expects an operating margin of more than 11.0% in 2025</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financial calendar</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A conference call will be held at 6:30pm (Paris time) on October 30, 2025:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>please dial +44 20 3059 5875, +1 718 705 8795 or +33 1 70 91 87 14 (code 4276084#)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·    2025 results: February 26, 2026, after close of trading on the Paris stock exchange.</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p class=\"\"><span>Analyst/investor relations</span></p></td><td colspan=\"3\"><p class=\"\"><span>Press relations</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Vivien Dardel:</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>+33 1 88 54 29 77</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Patricia Marie:</span></p></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p class=\"\"><span>+33 1 88 54 26 83</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Floriana Michalowska:</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>+33 1 88 54 19 09</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Laure Bencheikh:</span></p></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p class=\"\"><span>+33 1 88 54 26 38</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Alix Sicaud:</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>+33 1 88 54 38 70</span></p></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p class=\"\"><span>Yanice Biyogo: </span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span> +33 1 88 54 27 96</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>James Weston: </span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>+33 1 88 54 01 24</span></p></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><span>​</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>​</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Glossary:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- Changes on an actual structure basis reflect changes in published indicators between two periods.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- Changes in local currencies reflect actual performance, applying exchange rates for the previous period to indicators for the period under review.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- Like-for-like changes (constant structure and exchange rates) reflect underlying performance excluding the impacts of:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>•     changes in scope, by calculating indicators for the period under review based on the scope of consolidation of the previous period (structure impact);</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>•     changes in foreign exchange rates, by calculating indicators for the period under review and those for the previous period based on exchange rates for the previous period (exchange rate impact).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- Operating income: see note 5 to the interim financial statements, available by clicking here: https://www.saint-gobain.com/en/finance/regulated-information/half-yearly-financial-report</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- Operating margin = operating income divided by sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Important disclaimer - forward-looking statements:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This press release contains forward-looking statements with respect to Saint-Gobain's financial condition, results, business, strategy, plans and outlook.

On an analyst call, management says continued weakness in the ferrous metal recycling business was a part of its lowered guidance. Adjusted full-year Ebitda is now expected at C$500 million, a 5% decline from the previous midpoint. The company says conditions remain challenging due to soft Canadian demand driven by tariffs on finished steel sold into the U.S. coupled with an oversupply and broader macroeconomic caution that is limiting new steel production. This resulted in a buildup of ferrous inventory that the company is working to sell into stronger U.S. markets. (adriano.marchese@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
