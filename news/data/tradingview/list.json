Pfizer now has four days to negotiate changes to its original proposal, it said. And if Metsera determines the new offer remains better, it has the right under the terms of its agreement with Pfizer to terminate the Pfizer deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shares in Nasdaq-listed Metsera surged nearly 20% in premarket trading. Novo Nordisk shares fell around 2% in Copenhagen. Pfizer was down less than 1%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pfizer said in a statement that the attempt by Novo Nordisk to unwind its deal is \"reckless and unprecedented.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The proposal is illusory and cannot qualify as a superior proposal under Pfizer's agreement with Metsera, and Pfizer is prepared to pursue all legal avenues to enforce its rights under its agreement,\" Pfizer said. It added that its deal creates \"real, certain and immediate value\" for Metsera shareholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The back and forth and rare unsolicited offer for a biotech exemplifies the heat of the weight-loss drug market today. The prescription injectable drugs are ringing up billions of dollars in sales. Metsera promises a pill version, which industry officials view as the next big opportunity in the fast-growing space.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Novo Nordisk had already attempted privately to acquire Metsera. According to a securities filing detailing the background of the deal, Metsera's advisers had been holding meetings with another party in addition to Pfizer and weighing their competing offers. That other party was Novo Nordisk, according to people familiar with the matter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, Metsera ultimately went with Pfizer because it decided that Novo Nordisk's offer carried too much risk, including regulatory concerns, the people and the filing said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last month, Pfizer agreed on a deal for Metsera, as it maneuvers to get back into the obesity space and take a slice of the burgeoning market. It scrapped its experimental weight-loss pill earlier this year over concerns about potential liver damage.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If Pfizer were to lose the Metsera deal, it would be detrimental to its efforts to rebuild in the weight-loss category.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For Novo Nordisk, a deal would bring Metsera's pipeline of developmental injectable and oral obesity treatments to its portfolio, including a once-monthly jab that is in Phase 2 development.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Novo Nordisk has been on a shopping spree in recent months as part of a major shake-up at the company that began with the appointment of a new chief executive earlier this year. Mike Doustdar has moved to reshuffle the leadership team and boost the pipeline of drugs after the company started to lose market share in the obesity market to rivals and alternative products.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last week, Novo Nordisk said it would replace its chairman and other board members after the Danish pharma giant's controlling shareholder pushed for more changes to revive the company's success in the weight-loss market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is vying with Eli Lily, which is seeing surging demand for its GLP-1 weight-loss drugs and is preparing to launch a new weight-loss pill.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Novo Nordisk said Thursday: \"We would not have made this bid if we did not believe that a deal could gain approval, but a potential deal will of course be subject to the usual regulatory approvals.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Lauren Thomas at lauren.thomas@wsj.com and Dominic Chopping at dominic.chopping@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>0944 ET - Eurozone government bond yields are little moved, staying higher on the day after the European Central Bank left policy rates unchanged, as expected. The 10-year Bund yield last trades at 2.657%, up 3.8 basis points after the decision. Eurozone bond yields have been driven higher by rising U.S. Treasury yields after the Federal Reserve cooled market expectations of another rate cut in December. Meanwhile, the ECB pointed to a resilient economy. \"Despite the U.S. tariffs, despite all the various sources of uncertainty, the European economy continues to eke out some growth,\" says Mark Wall, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. \"Economic 'resilience' is keeping the ECB doves in check, and the policy pause on the rails,\" he says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0936 ET - The euro recovers slightly against the dollar after the European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged as expected. The ECB said the economy has continued to grow despite a challenging global environment. It also pointed to a robust labor market, solid private sector balance sheets and past rate cuts as \"important sources of resilience\" but noted that the outlook remains uncertain given global trade disputes and geopolitical tensions. The ECB reiterated a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach to future decisions. The euro falls 0.3% to $1.1564. It hit a two-week low of $1.1546 just before the decision as the dollar strengthened in the wake of the Federal Reserve signalling a December rate cut wasn't a done deal alongside a highly-anticipated 25 basis-point cut on Wednesday. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0933 ET - Rising Treasury yields support the dollar, Bannockburn's Marc Chandler says. Bonds are selling off since Fed Chair Powell said that an interest rate cut in December can't be taken for granted. It is unclear whether overnight news of improving U.S.-China trade relations, after the Trump-Xi meeting, is having any impact on FX markets. \"I think it is hard to separate the trade story and Fed hawkish cut in driving [the] dollar,\" Chandler says, adding that markets had already been optimistic about a deal. The Bank of Japan stays put, as expected. The WSJ Dollar Index rises 0.5% as the greenback strengthens 1% versus the yen and 0.5% against the euro. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0925 ET - Signs of weakness in Canada's labor market continue to roll in, with data showing little change in payroll numbers in August and a drop in job vacancies to the lowest level since the same month in 2017. The number of Canadians receiving pay and benefits from an employer ticked up 3,300 for the month, marking no change on a percentage basis, after edging up 0.1% in July. Compared with a year earlier, payroll employment was up 31,500, or 0.2%. Gains were noted by Statistics Canada in public administration and construction, but declines in retail, wholesale and scientific and technical services. Job vacancies in August fell 2.4% to 457,400, and were 15.2% lower than a year earlier. That meant 3.5 unemployed persons for every job vacancy in August.

The exchange rate remains attractive in carry trades where investors borrow in low-yielding currencies to invest in higher-yielding ones, they say. Moreover, markets are pricing in too much risk premium ahead of next month's U.K. budget and the rise in Bank of England interest rate cut expectations looks overdone, they say. Finally, the franc has strengthened too much against the euro. Morgan Stanley has a target for sterling to rise to 1.15 francs, with a stop loss of 1.0159 francs. Sterling falls 0.1% to 1.0544 francs, having reached a low of 1.0493 Wednesday, according to LSEG. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0851 ET - Economist David Rosenberg believes the Bank of Canada may eventually have to cut rates again, despite their signal that the easing cycle might be done. The head of Rosenberg Research points to a line from Gov. Tiff Macklem's press conference, in which Macklem suggests tepid growth means \"excess supply is only taken up gradually.\" This indicates a disinflationary environment, he adds, \"and a telltale sign that the BOC is not yet done... Yes, the BOC thinks it has done enough but they are clearly unsure.\" Rosenberg adds the overall tone of the BOC's suite of communications was more dovish than in September \"and rather negative on the economic outlook.\" (Paul.Vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0847 ET - Bond and currency markets heed Fed Chair Powell's blunt message that an interest rate cut in December is far from certain. On the CME's FedWatch tool, odds of a third consecutive trim fall to 69% from more than 80% yesterday, when the Fed cut by 25-basis-point and Powell warned that policymakers were split about the path forward. The Government shutdown delays GDP and claims data due today. Treasurys sell off, sending yields higher. The 10-year yield is at 4.103% and the two-year at 3.614%. The WSJ Dollar Index rises 0.4%. The greenback strengthens 1% against the yen and 0.2% to the euro. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0840 ET - A majority of the Bank of England committee members could prefer to wait for clearer evidence of a slowdown in the U.K. economy before voting for further interest-rate cuts, Oxford Economics' Edward Allenby says in a note. \"We don't think recent data has been weak enough to swing the Governor in favor of a November cut,\" Allenby says. The BOE rate decision on November 6 is likely to be a tight vote in favor of keeping rates unchanged at 4.0%, he says. Markets price a 28% possibility of a rate cut next week, LSEG data show. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0727 ET - The U.K. government bonds, or gilts, appear more sensitive to changes in risk sentiment, than the German government bonds, ING strategists say in a note. Gilt yields could rise sharply if the U.K. government underdelivers on fiscal sustainability at the Nov. 26 budget, the strategists say. Some measures, such as spending increases, more gilt issuance, and inflationary tax rises, could lead to loss of confidence in the U.K. fiscal position, they say. The 10-year gilt yields are up 4 basis points to 4.436%, Tradeweb data show.(miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0710 ET - Eurozone government bond yields and the euro show barely any reaction to flash estimate eurozone gross domestic data for the third quarter. GDP rose 1.3% on the year in the third quarter, slightly beating analysts' forecasts of 1.2% in a poll by The Wall Street Journal. The 10-year Bund yield is up 3 basis points at 2.651% following the data, little changed from before the release, Tradeweb data show. Eurzone bond yields have been trading higher, tracking U.S. Treasury yields after Wednesday's Federal Reserve announcement. The euro is last up 0.1% at $1.1610, little changed from around $1.1615 before the data. (emese.bartha@wjs.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0657 ET - U.S. Treasury yields rise, led particularly by long-dated yields, following Wednesday's Federal Reserve message that a further rate cut in December isn't a foregone conclusion. The Fed also announced the end of its balance sheet runoff starting December. The 10-year Treasury yield rises 2 basis points to 4.078%; the 30-year yield is up 3 basis points at 4.629%; while the two-year yield is up 1.4 basis points at 3.600%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0630 ET - The dollar's recovery after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell dampened expectations for further interest-rate cuts is unlikely to be sustained, MUFG Bank's Lee Hardman says in a note. The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points Wednesday, as expected, but Powell said another cut in December isn't a foregone conclusion. MUFG still expects the Fed to cut rates again in December. This is \"data dependent based on the assumption that the labor market remains weak heading into year-end, and that the government shutdown comes to an end allowing the Fed to better assess the health of the U.S. economy,\" Hardman says. The DXY dollar index trades steady at 99.181 after hitting a two-week high of 99.356 Wednesday.(renae.dyer@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
