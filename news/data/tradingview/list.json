If the units are purchased or sold on the TSX, investors may pay more than the current net asset value when buying units of the investment fund and may receive less than the current net asset value when selling them. There are ongoing fees and expenses associated with owning units of an investment fund. Investment funds are not guaranteed, their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated. Distributions are paid to you in cash unless you request, pursuant to your participation in a distribution reinvestment plan, that they be reinvested into Class A units of the Fund. If the Fund earns less than the amounts distributed, the difference is a return of capital. An investment fund must prepare disclosure documents that contain key information about the investment fund.

Meanwhile, capital discipline, which is a key driver of the FTSE 100's surge last year is becoming more visible in the mid-cap space, with roughly 100 FTSE 250 companies running share buybacks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Small caps still trade at a near 25% discount to large caps, wide by historical standards.
