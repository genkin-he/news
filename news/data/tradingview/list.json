This initiative marks one of the largest deployments of a tablet POS system in a department store in Japan, with approximately 5,000 tablet units introduced in non-food sales areas and about 400 dedicated POS units in food sales areas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The system enables sales associates to provide seamless, one-stop[1] service from customer engagement to payment without leaving their sales floor. This allows sales associates to dedicate more time to customers, to enhance service quality and deliver a high-value shopping experience unique to department stores.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Going forward, H2O plans to integrate other business applications into these tablet units at Hankyu Hanshin Department Stores including customer relationship management tools and customer service support tools to create a higher quality one-stop customer experience.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fujitsu, under its Uvance business model to address societal challenges, is committed to solving customer and societal issues through data and AI, focusing on both the purchasing experience and supply chains. By linking the experience cycle, which supports comfortable purchasing experiences for customers and improved operational efficiency for employees involved in purchasing, with the supply chain cycle, which aims to realize sustainable and resilient purchasing supply chains, Fujitsu will integrate complex customer touchpoints and achieve centralized information management across all channels. This will enhance customer and consumer experiences and contribute to the realization of a sustainable society.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Overview of the System</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The system implemented in this initiative incorporates a POS solution from Unified Commerce, an offering within Fujitsu's Uvance business model that aims to centralize customer touchpoint information. By establishing this system as a common platform, the screen displays and operability of both stationary and mobile POS systems have been unified.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This achieves the following three points, leading to improved operational efficiency and enhanced customer experience:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reduced burden of learning multiple operating methods and decreased training labor hours for sales associates due to a unified operating system.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Establishment of a one-stop operation within the same sales area, from customer engagement to payment, through the introduction of wireless tablets. Provides customers with a smoother and more comfortable shopping experience.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Utilization of SIM-equipped tablet units to increase flexibility by expanding POS systems outside stores for special events, external sales activities, and mobile sales, while maintaining the same service quality as in-store systems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The system is built in a cloud environment and adopts a pay-per-use licensing model based on the annual number of transactions. This allows for flexible adjustment of POS system resources according to sales floor fluctuations and demand, balancing appropriate cost management with stable operation. It ensures a stable payment environment even during peak seasons, offering customers a comfortable and smooth shopping experience.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>[1] Not including tax-free procedures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About Fujitsu</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fujitsu's purpose is to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation.

The report represents the latest iteration in a bi-annual series of comprehensive market analyses, positioning Abu Dhabi as a regional leader in data-driven decision making in real estate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ADREC’s flagship report serves as the definitive source for transparent real estate insights, featuring market values reaching historic highs driven by sustained economic growth, robust population expansion of 7.5% in 2024, and foreign investor confidence.

These dynamics reflect the strength of Abu Dhabi’s economic foundation and the effectiveness of a regulatory framework designed to safeguard investors while enabling responsible development.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"As we look towards 2030, continued planning discipline, advanced digital infrastructure, and strengthened governance will remain central to shaping a resilient real estate ecosystem that supports Abu Dhabi’s position as a leading global destination to live, invest, and thrive.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Transaction Values Reach Historic Peaks Across All Sectors</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The 2025 transaction performance establishes new benchmarks for market activity, with total real estate values hitting AED 142 billion, representing a remarkable 44% acceleration from 2024 levels. Real estate sales dominated market activity, accounting for a record-high AED 93 billion and representing 66% of total transacted value, signalling exceptional market health and transaction robustness.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Residential unit sales emerged as the primary growth driver, expanding from approximately AED 19 billion in 2022 to AED 76 billion in 2025, representing a fourfold increase driven by off-plan sales growth and master-planned community development. The market's international appeal is demonstrated through foreign investment patterns, with resident expatriates and non-resident foreign investors driving 62% of total 2025 residential sales value. Top 10 developers capture 91% of residential off-plan primary sales value totalling AED 50 billion, while the top 10 projects contributed 32% of total sales at AED 24 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Supply and Demand Dynamics Drive Exceptional Price Performance</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Abu Dhabi's real estate market establishes fundamental strength through sustained demand-supply imbalances across all sectors. The emirate's residential inventory reached 401,000 units in 2025, with occupied units growing at 6.6% annually compared to supply growth of 2.8% since 2022, creating conditions for accelerated price appreciation. Apartment prices recorded their sharpest annual increase in recent years, with sale prices rising 19% and new lease prices climbing 16% between 2024 and 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Villa performance mirrored this strength, with sales prices increasing 13% and rental yields demonstrating robust 14% growth in investment zones. The market's structural health is evidenced by rental units comprising 71% of total occupied units, driving strong rental yields across the emirate. Future supply projections indicate continued momentum, with residential stock expected to grow 2.9% annually through 2030, supported by 43,000 new units anticipated from investment zones where 98% of new apartments will be delivered.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Commercial Real Estate Achieves Peak Occupancy and Pricing Power</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Abu Dhabi's commercial sectors demonstrate exceptional performance, with retail and office markets reaching multi-year occupancy highs driven by economic expansion and constrained supply growth. The retail sector achieved total supply of 3.8 million square meters by 2025, with street retail and community malls forming the market backbone at 44% of total gross leasable area. Overall retail occupancy surged to 94% in 2025, reaching a five-year peak supported by demand growth outpacing 2.3% annual supply increases, resulting in new lease prices accelerating 8% year-over-year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Office market performance proved equally robust, with total supply reaching 3.4 million square meters and occupancy maintaining structural strength above 96%. Supply growth of less than 2% compared to 2024, combined with 9% job growth and 6.4% expansion in professional roles, drove new office lease prices up 11% in 2025. Yas Island emerged as the leading office destination, driving 20% of new supply between 2022 and 2025, highlighting geographic diversification within the emirate's commercial landscape.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ADREC's technological advancement of digital real estate services, including virtual transaction capabilities, enhanced analytical tools, and expanded market transparency aligned with the Abu Dhabi Government Digital Strategy 2025–2027.

While the stock may be volatile until the investigation is clarified or settled, the decline of around 30% since the probe's announcement seems to have priced in its potential drag to earnings, they say. The analysts view the pullback as an opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate on Trip.com's shares, as the online travel agency remains well-positioned to benefit from Chinese travel-demand growth. DBS maintains its buy rating and HK$563.00 target price on Trip.com's Hong Kong-listed shares. It also retains its US$72.00 target price on the ADRs. The Hong Kong shares rise 2.4% to HK$410.00 while the ADRs last closed at US$52.27. (megan.cheah@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
