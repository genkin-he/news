            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>In July, I laid out the case for why Interactive Brokers </span><span> stood apart by focusing on fewer, richer clients. Since then, the thesis has held up operationally. Interactive Brokers has continued to add accounts, grow assets and widen its margins. It was added to the S&amp;P 500 in August, and Q3 results showed another solid quarter of high-quality growth. But the stock's performance has lagged more speculative names. Robinhood </span><span> has more than tripled year to date, while Interactive Brokers is up closer to 50%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In this article, I'll update my thesis in light of the company's Q3 2025 performance. I'll break down its business model and competitive edge, assess the health of client growth, review the latest product and client trends, and assess its valuation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Business Model</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interactive Brokers is a global leader in electronic trading, known for its technology-driven, ultra-low-cost platform spanning stocks, options, futures, forex, bonds, and more. Unlike flashy apps that gamify trading, Interactive Brokers has historically targeted a more professional investor base: active traders, hedge funds, financial advisors, and institutions. This focus on sophisticated, specialized clientele shows in its numbers. With just over 4 million accounts, Interactive Brokers oversees a massive $757.5 billion in customer equity. The firm's international reach (customers in 200+ countries) and breadth of offerings (everything from US stocks to European options to Asian futures) attract serious investors and institutions that want a one-stop platform.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In my view, Interactive Brokers is one of the top platforms for professionals. In recent years, management has also shifted focus toward the retail segment. Over the past few years, Interactive Brokers has offered IBKR Lite, which offers zero-commission trading but generally retains a larger spread on client cash. The goal is to blend the high-value professional cohort with a growing retail crowd.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company launched ForecastEx, a CFTC-regulated prediction-market venue that lets clients trade yes-or-no contracts on macro data, central bank decisions, and climate outcomes. All for a transparent one-cent fee. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By Q3, Interactive Brokers offered over 8,200 forecast contracts (up 27% from last quarter) on its platform, and volumes traded in these grew 165% in Q3 (versus Q2). They also extended trading hours for forecast contracts to nearly 24/7. These contracts let clients bet on things like where an index will be at week's end, or the outcome of an event, in a regulated way. It's a niche but growing segment, appealing to the same folks who might trade futures or options for speculation. Even Robinhood has partnered with Interactive Brokers' ForecastEx to offer these event contracts to its users.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other retail-focused product innovations include Investment Themes, an AI-driven discovery tool that helps investors turn market trends into actionable ideas, and the 24-hour U.S. stock session, which allows trading outside regular hours. However, one area where the company continues to face difficulty is crypto adoption.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interactive Brokers allows clients to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a handful of major coins through regulated partners, with commissions well below those of typical crypto exchanges. It even added Solana to the crypto lineup and introduced recurring crypto buy orders (dollar-cost averaging feature). Some Interactive Brokers' clients are embracing digital assets now that they can do so on the same platform as stocks and futures. Still, crypto remains a negligible portion of Interactive Brokers' revenue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company was late to the party, and because of that, many investors have their crypto portfolio elsewhere. One challenge is persuading new customers to bring their crypto holdings onto the platform. The U.S. still doesn't allow in-kind crypto transfers between brokers. As a result, investors looking to move their crypto holdings to Interactive Brokers typically must liquidate their positions elsewhere, triggering taxable events. This friction discourages switching and limits inflows from seasoned crypto investors. New legislation, such as the GENIUS Act, aims to create a framework for direct crypto access within brokerage accounts. Interactive Brokers has expressed interest in expanding its crypto functionality if/when regulations permit, which could further boost account inflows from crypto holders looking for better security or rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All these factors give Interactive Brokers a durable edge in my opinion. The company consistently wins top rankings for best online broker and prime broker. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Q3 2025 Financials</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interactive Brokers' third-quarter results underscore just how powerful its model has become in the current environment. Net revenues were up 21% to $1.655 billion (GAAP), but the core client and engagement metrics climbed more than 30%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1077.8656126482213px;aspect-ratio:1.7964426877470356\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/gurufocus:efe218068094b-0db7e79a25d23d2cf25e575e4e8bccf8-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"1979956294634872832.png\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/gurufocus:efe218068094b-0db7e79a25d23d2cf25e575e4e8bccf8-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#e1e7f1\"/></picture></div></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Source: Author</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company isn't just adding accounts, it's growing active, revenue-generating relationships. Evidence for this is seen in the discrepancy between client account growth and trading activity. Client accounts grew substantially, surpassing the 4 million mark to reach 4.127 million, this represented a 32% increase YoY. Daily Average Revenue Trades (DARTs) surged even faster, hitting 3.616 million, up 34% YoY. Even more notably, customer equity grew 40% to over $750 billion. This was driven by a combination of net inflows and asset appreciation, as clients added new capital and benefited from rising markets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the impressive growth rates for the quarter, in my opinion, the market wasn't impressed. While DART growth remains strong, it peaked in Q4 2024 and has trended lower since. However, this acceleration in DARTs relative to account growth confirms the focus on the highest quality clientele.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:888.1889763779528px;aspect-ratio:1.4803149606299213\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/gurufocus:efe218068094b-1c23629c147b0b7df90dc37cdf518d3f-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"1979956296547475456.png\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/gurufocus:efe218068094b-1c23629c147b0b7df90dc37cdf518d3f-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f4f5f7\"/></picture></div></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Source: Author</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These metrics fed directly into the two main pillars of revenue: commissions and net interest income (NII).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Commission reached $537 million, up 23% YoY, driven mainly by customer trading volume in stocks and options. The spike in equities volume partly reflects higher trading in low-priced stocks (possibly with more retail increasing interest and risk). To further boost client engagement, the average commission per trade fell to $2.70, helped by rebate capture and the removal of SEC fees. But volume strength more than offset the lower take per trade. Despite the challenges in attracting crypto assets that I mentioned above, Interactive Brokers' crypto trade volume rose 87% from last quarter and is up more than 5x YoY. While this is compared to a very small base, it is a sign of the growing strength of its offering.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>NII reached a quarterly record of $967 million, representing a 21% increase YoY. This growth occurred despite lower benchmark rates in most major currencies, driven by higher balances and savvy positioning. Customer margin loan balances jumped 39% YoY to $77.3 billion as clients leveraged up into the rising market. Customer cash balances rose 33% to $154.8 billion. In other words, even at slightly lower rates, Interactive Brokers earned interest on a much bigger pool of cash and loans. Additionally, securities lending revenue boomed. Interactive Brokers lends out client-owned stocks to short sellers and shares half the profit with clients. The CFO highlighted a significant rise in the notional value of securities loaned, with strong short demand and more specials (hard-to-borrow stocks) this quarter. This is a quiet engine of profit for Interactive Brokers though. Finally, Interactive Brokers kept its own investment portfolio at less than 30 days duration to benefit from the yield curve inversion. This flexibility added to NII.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>NII will likely be pressured by Fed policy. The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points in September and is expected to cut another 50 basis points by year-end. Management has been very transparent about this potential cyclical risk. A 25 basis point decrease in the Fed funds rate is estimated to result in a $77 million reduction in annual net interest for Interactive Brokers. With trailing twelve-month NII around $3.4 billion, the projected $150 million impact would reduce annual income by about 5%. While rate cuts are a headwind and will impact the NII growth rate, the impact is systematically diluted by the continuous growth in interest-earning assets. Moreover, Rate cuts could also be perceived as positive for equities, potentially lifting client activity and boosting commission revenue.</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><span>Metric</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>Q3 2025 Value</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>YoY Growth (%)</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><span>Total Client Accounts</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>4.127 Million</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>+32%</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><span>Daily Average Revenue Trades (DARTs)</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>3.616 Million</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>+34%</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><span>Ending Client Equity</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>$757.5 Billion</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>+40%</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><span>Ending Client Margin Loans</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>$77.3 Billion</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>+39%</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><span>Net Interest Income (NII)</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>$967 Million</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>+21%</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><span>Commission Revenue</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>$537 Million</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>+23%</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><span>Source: Author</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the bottom line, GAAP diluted EPS was $0.59, up $0.14 from a year ago. Net income (including noncontrolling interests) totaled $1.2 billion for the quarter, but due to Interactive Brokers' unique ownership structure, only $263 million of that net income was attributable to the publicly traded common stock. This still represented solid growth, achieving a 16% net margin.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company split its shares in a 4-for-1 stock split in June. Whether related or not, the stock is up over 25% since then. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Valuation</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The market is valuing Interactive Brokers as a category leader, but not, in my view, irrationally.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Source: Author</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At a $112.6 billion market cap, Interactive Brokers trades at 32x trailing earnings (P/E), 29x forward P/E, and carries a PEG ratio of 1.8x, based on consensus revenue growth of 16% next year and 11% over two. I would argue that revenue growth will exceed those forecasts. Its 5.8x price-to-book is rich by industry standards, but far from alone. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, it's not alone in wearing a premium. Robinhood, which generated just a fraction of Interactive Brokers' revenue last year, trades at an even loftier $115.5 billion valuation. It carries a forward price-to-sales ratio of 23.6x, a forward P/E above 56x, and a price-to-book over 14, a tech-stock valuation built on 44% revenue growth expectations next year. Charles Schwab </span><span>, by contrast, looks conservative on earnings at 17x forward but elevated on sales at 6.7x forward revenue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the more telling comparison is through unit economics (what the market is paying per client or per dollar of assets).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Source: Author</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is where the distinction between a wealth manager and a brokerage utility becomes clear. With $11.59 trillion in assets, Schwab leads on scale, averaging over $253,000 per account. Its strategy as a financial services giant focuses on capturing and retaining large wealth pools, including retirement and advisory assets above all, segments that typically generate lower trading volume per account.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interactive Brokers' clients average over $183,000 per account, validating its focus on high-net-worth professionals and institutions trading globally. Robinhood, with just over $11,000 in average assets, sits firmly at the retail, entry-level end of the spectrum.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The gap in customer quality is reflected in how the market values each account. Interactive Brokers commands an implied market value per client that is six to seven times higher than Schwab or Robinhood. At $27,280 per customer, the market is signaling that Interactive Brokers' clients are far more valuable, and the market recognises that. It confirms that the market views Interactive Brokers as attracting sophisticated clientele, highly active traders who generate superior, high-margin revenue through complex products, high trading velocity, and significant margin utilization. Even in a down market, these clients are more likely to stay engaged, given their expertise and investment range.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In contrast, Schwab's low $3,740 value per account reflects its scale and mature model, while Robinhood's slightly higher figure of $4,320 is tied to a growth premium. The market is betting on long-term monetization from a younger, low-asset customer base.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the second quarter, Interactive Brokers once again drew attention from top-tier investors. Paul Tudor Jones (Trades, Portfolio) and Ray Dalio (Trades, Portfolio) both exited their positions. In Dalio's case, it was surprising. He closed out his stake just one quarter after initiating it, a stake that had made him one of Interactive Brokers' largest guru shareholders. Meanwhile, other prominent investors, including Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio), Ron Baron (Trades, Portfolio), and George Soros (Trades, Portfolio), increased their holdings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Key Risks and Challenges</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>While Interactive Brokers continues to fire on all cylinders, it isn't immune to external pressures that could test the durability of its growth story. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of the more tangible headwinds is China's tightening regulatory stance. Mainland authorities have imposed new restrictions on foreign brokers onboarding domestic clients, forcing Interactive Brokers to require offshore residency verification and to remove its app from major Chinese platforms. Management says this hasn't materially affected account growth, but China has historically been a rich source of new, high-value clients. If restrictions intensify or formal bans emerge, Interactive Brokers could see its Asian growth trajectory slow, particularly in light of the company's heavy emphasis on international expansion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A second, more cyclical risk stems from market activity and investor sentiment. A large portion of Interactive Brokers' top-line growth still depends on trading volume and margin lending. The model is structurally strong, but it doesn't escape market corrections. In the third quarter, margin loan balances hit $77 billion, not just because markets were rising, but because clients actively increased their risk exposure to chase upside. That works well in a bull market. But leverage amplifies everything. If markets turn, those same accounts could unwind rapidly, cutting into interest income and increasing risk management costs if clients liquidate at a loss. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>My Final Take</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interactive Brokers' Q3 2025 results reinforce why I've remained bullish on its fewer, richer clients model. The firm is executing across the board, driven by a strategy focused on serious investors, global reach, and technology that actually compounds margin. In the span of a few years, Interactive Brokers has transformed from a niche electronic broker into a financial powerhouse, now even a member of the S&amp;P 500. And that transformation looks far from over.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I continue to see Interactive Brokers as a long-term compounder. Its edge, from technology, cost efficiency, global reach, to high-value clients, remains intact. The valuation isn't cheap, but it isn't stretched either, especially if the market is underestimating the growth runway ahead.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The market is pricing in 16% and 11% revenue growth for the next two years, but I think those projections underestimate the company's momentum. Analyst estimates have already been revised upward over the past 90 days, and I expect that trend to continue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:804.5649072753209px;aspect-ratio:1.340941512125535\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/gurufocus:efe218068094b-fde7c71899349a40d9cc292c45d0a96e-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"1979956302172037120.png\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/gurufocus:efe218068094b-fde7c71899349a40d9cc292c45d0a96e-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f7f7f7\"/></picture></div></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Source: Gurufocus</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a result, I'm slightly more bullish here and would consider adding on dips or periods of volatility, which this sector never fails to deliver.</span></p></span></div></div>",

The desert’s extreme heat, dust, and soiling challenges make design here uniquely complex — but they also inspire innovation. This is the region where gigawatt-scale hybrid projects integrating solar, wind, and BESS are redefining what’s possible.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At SgurrEnergy, we apply advanced analytics, thermal simulations, and materials science to mitigate soiling and temperature effects. We see the region pioneering next-generation innovations — such as dust-resistant PV modules, smart cleaning systems, and BESS-backed hybrid dispatch models — that will set new global benchmarks for renewable energy performance in harsh climates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>Arif Aga, Director, SgurrEnergy</span></em></p><p class=\"\"><span>SgurrEnergy has supported major developers like ACWA Power across Saudi Arabia and beyond. Could you share details of your ongoing or upcoming projects in the region?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our journey in the Middle East has been deeply rewarding. We’ve had the privilege of supporting leading developers like ACWA Power, Elsewedy, Alfanar, Tarshid, Al Jomaih, and many more on landmark projects in the region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Currently, our team is engaged in several of Saudi Arabia’s major renewable projects — including advisory roles in Saad 1 and Saad 2 projects - both are now commissioned - which form part of the Kingdom’s 130 GW clean energy roadmap.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We’re also expanding our presence in the UAE and other GCC nations, focusing on solar + BESS projects designed to deliver RTC renewable power and manage peak load shaving for utilities and industries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>How is SgurrEnergy leveraging its global expertise — including work on large-scale solar plants in India — to support the region’s utility-scale and hybrid renewable projects?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our approach combines advanced technical advisory with smart design optimisation to lower project costs, enhance energy yield, and improve overall project performance. Our expertise extends beyond solar into solar + BESS, wind + storage, and hybrid grid solutions, where we combine advanced technical advisory with precision engineering to maximise yield and reliability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We’ve introduced several innovations — such as optimised DC system design, aluminium cabling, and high-voltage 1500 V architecture — which now underpin efficient hybrid design. Through our data-driven yield assessments and energy dispatch optimisation, we help clients achieve 1–2 percent higher energy yield and 10–15 percent lower LCOE.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our hybrid project experience ensures that solar + BESS systems can sustain HVAC and commercial loads year-round, providing reliable, clean energy even during non-solar hours - a critical step toward RTC renewable generation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What are some of the key technical and performance risks developers face in mega renewable energy projects, and how are these being mitigated?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The challenges are multiple - from dust-induced yield losses and grid integration issues to dispatch unpredictability in hybrid systems. In MENA’s extreme climates, the risks are magnified.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At SgurrEnergy, we mitigate these risks through precision engineering and predictive performance modelling. Our approach integrates soiling loss analysis, cleaning optimisation, grid stability simulation, and thermal stress management - ensuring system resilience and consistent energy delivery.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For hybrid projects, we model BESS dispatch profiles for peak shaving and energy shifting, ensuring dependable power for HVAC and industrial applications even during night or low irradiance periods. Our asset management and predictive maintenance strategies further enhance uptime, safety, and long-term returns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In short, we de-risk renewable portfolios by designing climate-resilient, storage-integrated systems that perform safely and sustainably throughout their lifecycle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With plans to establish offices in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, what opportunities and challenges do you see in expanding your footprint across the Gulf?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The region’s strong pipeline of solar, wind, and hybrid + storage projects presents an enormous opportunity for sustainable growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our goal is to bring our global expertise in RTC and hybrid engineering closer to regional developers — supporting them in designing solar + BESS systems capable of peak load shaving, grid balancing, and round-the-clock clean power.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We also plan to invest in local talent development and collaborative innovation hubs that strengthen the region’s technical capabilities in hybrid and battery storage integration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While regulatory and supply chain challenges exist, the momentum toward energy storage-backed renewables far outweighs the obstacles. We’re committed to playing an active role in this transformation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Finally, how do you envision SgurrEnergy’s role in enabling the region’s net-zero transition over the next decade?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our focus will be on seamlessly integrating solar, wind, and battery systems to deliver dispatchable green power, ensuring grid stability and round-the-clock clean energy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These hybrid systems not only help shave peak demand but also sustain critical HVAC and industrial loads throughout the year. With advanced AI, digital twins, and data-driven asset management, we aim to make renewable infrastructure smarter, more efficient, and more resilient.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ultimately, our mission extends beyond technology — we’re building local capacity, enabling job creation, and helping nations across the region move decisively toward a low-carbon, energy-secure future powered by renewables that never sleep.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(Reporting by SA Kader; Editing by Anoop Menon)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(anoop.menon@lseg.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Subscribe to our Projects' PULSE</span></strong><span> newsletter that brings you trustworthy news, updates and insights on project activities, developments, and partnerships across sectors in the Middle East and Africa.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Retail groups recently told Reuters that they are frustrated by the lack of guidance from the Trump administration and lawmakers, forcing them to round down to avoid angering customers and violating laws in some states — potentially costing high-volume businesses significant money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The National Retail Federation said the dearth of pennies has hit retailers in urban and rural areas, with no clear geographic pattern. Members of some state restaurant associations have voiced concerns about penny shortages. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“Any merchant that accepts cash is grappling with this,” said Dylan Jeon, senior director of government relations with the National Retail Federation, whose members include Walmart </span><span>, Target </span><span>, Macy’s </span><span>, and Old Navy. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some major convenience chains have already begun warning customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sheetz, a family-owned convenience store, posted signs at one of its Pennsylvania stores that read: “The U.S. Mint will no longer produce pennies, so we are short on change!” The signs encourage customers to use cashless payment options, round up purchases to support charity, or exchange $1 in spare pennies for a free self-serve drink.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kwik Trip, the convenience store chain based in La Crosse, Wisconsin, announced that its 850 stores across the Midwest would round cash transactions down to the nearest nickel. At a Dallas location, a sign warns customers: \"The US Treasury has stopped making pennies and we may experience shortages.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kroger </span><span>, one of the largest U.S. grocery chains, told Reuters it is still assessing the impact of the penny shortage. Many of its 2,700 locations have displayed signs asking customers for exact change.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Individual stores with other large chains have done the same, such as a CVS in Alexandria, Virginia, that posted a notice asking for exact change because of a \"penny shortage.\"  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Treasury did not respond to multiple requests for comment. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Several countries, including Canada, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand, have phased out their lowest-value coins, rounding cash transactions up or down to the nearest five cents while keeping electronic payments exact. The moves cut minting costs and simplified cash handling for retailers. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the U.S., phasing out pennies would require similar rounding practices at stores, adjustments to registers, and clear communication to consumers, but could deliver comparable savings and efficiency gains. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Several states, including California, New York and Illinois, however, have consumer protection laws that require retailers to provide exact change on cash transactions, creating legal uncertainty as pennies disappear from circulation. Retail groups say those rules make it difficult to adjust prices or round totals without risking fines or customer complaints.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LOOKING FOR CONSISTENT RULES</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While Trump’s directive initiated the end to production, Congress retains authority over coinage, meaning legislation may still be required for a permanent discontinuation. The NRF has been lobbying the Trump administration and Congress to provide consistent guidance, particularly around rounding transactions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“What’s most helpful in the near term is clarity on rounding practices — whether retailers can round up or down on transaction totals or change,” Jeon said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A group of trade organizations that include gas stations, convenience stores, travel centers and grocery stores warned in a September 30 letter to congressional leaders that \"if these remedies are not addressed in short order, it will be challenging to legally engage in cash transactions with customers in growing swaths of the country.\" </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Love’s Travel Stops, which operates more than 640 locations in 42 states, said the phaseout of penny production is affecting its retail operations. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“If one of our stores runs out of pennies, all change on cash transactions will be adjusted in the favor of the customer and Love’s will cover the difference,” a company spokesperson said. “This is a temporary measure while we work toward a long-term solution.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Months after Trump ordered a halt to production of pennies, the Treasury Department in May placed its final order for blank penny planchets. Several Federal Reserve Bank sites, which distribute coins to banks and credit unions, have already stopped fulfilling orders for pennies. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Producing a penny currently costs more than its face value — about 3.69 cents per coin in recent years. The government now projects savings of roughly $56 million annually by ending penny minting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are about 114 billion pennies currently in circulation in the United States, but they are greatly underutilized, the Treasury says. The penny was one of the first coins made by the U.S. Mint after its establishment in 1792.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Supporters of the penny argue it helps keep consumer prices down and is a source of income to charities. For its critics, the coin is a nuisance that ends up being discarded in drawers, ashtrays and piggy banks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I can't even tell you the last time I carried pennies — even loose change — when I left the house,\" said Pennsylvania resident Sandy Berger, 45. \"I really don't think people will care to see them gone.\"</span></p></span></div></div>",

The rest have said they will not pay for the benefits due to technical or cost barriers, or provided no explanation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The USDA said in an October 24 memo that it will not reimburse states if they cover the cost of benefits. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most states balance their budgets annually or biennially, and the increased uncertainty of federal funding for healthcare, education and other key resources has added layers of risk to state finances, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Every year we have significant budget shortfalls and are working to balance the budget,\" said Christine Woody, food security policy manager at Empower Missouri, a social justice organization. \"We don’t have $130 million to put towards this without any assurance.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A USDA spokesperson called the shutdown an \"inflection point for Senate Democrats.\" The agency has repeatedly blamed the aid lapse on Democrats, most of whom have withheld their votes on a spending bill in an effort to keep healthcare costs from spiking for many Americans. Democrats have criticized the USDA for not using agency contingency funds to partially fund the November benefits.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MULTI-MILLION-DOLLAR GAPS</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>States receive huge monthly sums from the federal government for SNAP benefits, ranging from $4.9 million for Wyoming to more than $1 billion for California, according to USDA data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To distribute those benefits, states contract with third-party processors who add the money to recipients' Electronic Benefit Transfer cards. Some states have said they cannot make the technical changes needed to get money to recipients themselves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Tennessee is unable to utilize state dollars to provide the benefit, as states do not have a mechanism to load benefits onto customer cards,\" said Governor Bill Lee in an October 24 statement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Others said the sums are simply too large to accommodate. \"SNAP brings in more than $210 million monthly in federal funding. The state budget cannot absorb even one month of federal failure,\" said a notice on the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance website. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:637.7245508982036px;aspect-ratio:1.062874251497006\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3W80Z9-99881b303f8d61d86c9e01ca141984d7-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"A map displaying U.S. state participation rates in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, with Oregon, New Mexico and Louisiana showing the highest rates.\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3W80Z9-99881b303f8d61d86c9e01ca141984d7-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f7d5ba\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-S5VA5POt\"><span class=\"copyright-S5VA5POt\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-S5VA5POt\">New Mexico, Oregon among the states with highest SNAP participation</span></figcaption></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Virginia is drawing on a budget surplus for its stop-gap program that will issue weekly benefits through at least November, Governor Glenn Youngkin said this week.

The nine justices will be hearing arguments in the case called Learning Resources v. Trump, along with two related cases in which plaintiffs also argue that the Republican president's tariffs are unlawful. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of the related cases was filed by Oregon and other Democratic-led states. The other was brought by the Liberty Justice Center, a libertarian nonprofit, on behalf of five small businesses, including a wine distributor called V.O.S. Selections and another educational toy company called MicroKits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the court typically takes months to issue rulings after hearing arguments, the Trump administration has asked it to act swiftly in this case.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LARGE COMPANIES ON THE SIDELINES</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Large U.S. companies have stayed on the sidelines of the tariffs litigation. They did not bring lawsuits and have not filed amicus - or friend-of-the-court - briefs offering their views. Such briefs are commonly used by companies to highlight the importance of cases brought by other litigants.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By contrast, about a dozen small businesses have agreed to serve as plaintiffs in a batch of separate lawsuits brought by nonprofits challenging the tariffs that are still playing out in lower courts, in addition to the businesses involved in the Supreme Court litigation. And another 700 signed onto an amicus brief filed by We Pay The Tariffs, an advocacy group, against Trump's action.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump's tariffs have hit small- and medium-sized businesses particularly hard because they \"don't have the same flexibility as large companies to manage the impact,\" said John Horn, a professor at the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Large companies have more cash on hand, Horn said, so they were better able to stock up on inventory before the tariffs took effect. They can also better manage prices and supply chains, Horn added. One reason large companies are not suing to challenge Trump's tariffs is that they are more focused on lobbying efforts, Horn said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Large businesses have the flexibility of lobbying the government for exemptions,\" Horn said. \"Small businesses don't have that.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Woldenberg said his legal bills have been in the millions of dollars, but he felt suing was a necessary cost.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is certainly not for everyone,\" Woldenberg said of his legal advocacy. \"Hundreds of thousands of businesses in the United States are similarly situated to ours, but to my knowledge I'm the only person in the United States - a country of 300 million people - who has chosen to sue on their own resources.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'CAN'T PLAN AHEAD'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At issue before the Supreme Court on Wednesday are tariffs Trump imposed using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA. These tariffs thus far have netted about $100 billion for U.S. coffers. This law was meant for use during national emergencies. Trump deemed the U.S. trade deficit a national emergency even though the United States has run trade deficits every year since 1975.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On April 2, as part of his \"Liberation Day\" announcement, Trump imposed a baseline tariff of 10% on virtually all countries, with higher tariffs - anywhere from 11% to 50% - on dozens of countries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The lawsuits before the Supreme Court argue that Congress did not intend for IEEPA to authorize presidents to impose tariffs. Three lower courts have ruled against Trump's tariffs, saying they exceeded his lawful authority under IEEPA. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The IEEPA tariffs are paid by U.S. importers like Learning Resources, which manufactures most of its educational toys in Asia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In his inauguration speech in January, Trump said tariffs will allow the United States to become a \"manufacturing nation once again.\" Importers have said they want to move manufacturing to the United States, but the parts and services they need are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CUTTING BACK</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In response to Trump's tariffs, Learning Resources cut back expansion plans to keep more cash on hand, Woldenberg said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Woldenberg canceled a building project that would have added 600,000 square feet (55,700 square meters) of warehouse and office space for the 500 employees of Learning Resources and a related toy company, hand2mind, that he runs. Woldenberg also abandoned plans to hire about 30 more employees in 2025, and cut back on other expenditures like marketing and training for workers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When Trump's tariffs hit, \"I predicted we'd be smaller and make less money,\" Woldenberg said. \"And both of those things are true.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Woldenberg's frustrations are shared by David Levi, founder of MicroKits, a smaller toy company in Charlottesville, Virginia, that serves as a plaintiff in the parallel case at the Supreme Court.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MicroKits sells electronic instruments, including a synthesizer called the Synth-a-Sette that teaches children about conductivity. Levi imports small electronic parts, mostly from China, then assembles his products in Virginia along with the help of a part-time employee. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Levi said that, when Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports spiked above 100% this spring, he temporarily stopped importing and slowed down production so he would still have work for his part-time employee. Levi reduced the employee's weekly schedule from 25 hours to 15 hours, and assembled thousands of fewer toys than anticipated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MicroKits, which Levi founded in 2020 after working at large toy companies Hasbro and Mattel, was growing 30% a year and was aiming to hit $1 million in revenue in 2025. Instead, because of the tariffs, revenue will be around $400,000 this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Levi said consumer-grade electrical clips he needs for his products are not being manufactured in the United States in any meaningful way. Domestically made clips are designed for aerospace and medical uses and would cost at least 10 times more than consumer-grade ones from Asia, Levi said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Levi expected to pay tariffs and other taxes when he founded MicroKits, but was not prepared for the constant uncertainty caused by the Trump administration adjusting tariff rates with little public notice.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"In a world where tariffs can go above 100% and then back down again, you're just trying to guess what happens next and can't plan ahead,\" Levi said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'OVERWHELMING RESPONSE'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Levi said he came across a webpage where Liberty Justice Center was encouraging businesses to join its lawsuit. The public interest law firm is representing him and four other businesses at no cost.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"After we issued a public call for plaintiffs, we received an overwhelming response from small businesses nationwide,\" said Jeffrey Schwab, a lawyer at Liberty Justice Center. \"Our team spoke with dozens of owners and selected five whose experiences best illustrate the broad harms caused by the tariffs and who were prepared to accept the responsibilities and public attention of litigation.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Victor Schwartz is the founder and president of Manhattan-based wine distributor V.O.S. Selections, one of those five.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Schwartz said he felt a \"moral imperative\" to challenge Trump's tariffs, which he said have cost his company about $200,000. The tariffs have hit wine importers particularly hard as they contend with inflation, a weakening dollar and declining U.S. alcohol consumption.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I was shocked that those with much more power and money did not step up,\" Schwartz said.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Soaring accommodation costs had already led the U.N. to hold emergency meetings in response to African countries and small island nations' warnings that they could not afford to attend - even after Brazil and the U.N. subsidised hotel costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A leaked email seen by Reuters showed that Brazil last week offered three free cabins aboard cruise ships moored in Belem to delegations from low-income nations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The email, sent by the U.N. climate secretariat (UNFCCC), said the cabins would be financed through \"private donors\" and the Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean, and coordinated by Brazil's government in partnership with the U.N. Development Programme (UNDP).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"These cabins will be offered free of cost to your delegation,\" the email said, adding that they were supplementary to existing bookings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Neither the UNFCCC nor the UNDP responded to requests for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last week, COP30 president Andre Correa do Lago said the free cabins would go to African countries, small island states and Least Developed Countries — around 96 nations in total, according to Reuters' calculations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"With this, we will have significant support so that all developing countries can be present at the COP,\" Correa do Lago said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some wealthier European countries have also indicated they may skip this year's global climate talks after being quoted prices for accommodation exceeding $500 per person per night.</span></p></span></div></div>",

The major point of interest lies at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, where the last rejection occurred. Given this, it is likely that the Ethereum price could see more declines in the coming days, although there is still the possibility of the bulls taking over and invalidating the entire bearish setup.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Ethereum Price Is Showing A Lot Of Weakness</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The rejection from the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level marked the start of the decline from the $4,200 level during the last recovery. This rejection resulted in the formation of a lower high on the 4-hour timeframe, and historically, such lower high formations mean that there is more selling pressure piling up for the digital asset.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As the bullish momentum looks to be fading, it puts the Ethereum price in a precarious position. Crypto analyst The Alchemist Trader </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHUSDT/ycscLxZ5-Ethereum-Faces-Bearish-Pressure-After-0-618-Fibonacci-Rejection/\" target=\"_blank\">explains</a><span> that the rejection had come with increased bearish volume as investors offloaded their holdings on the market, putting bears in charge once again.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Following this development, the Ethereum price has continued to struggle around $3,900, where the next local support lies. The cryptocurrency has maintained a tentative hold at best on this local support, suggesting that the bulls could indeed be losing ground at this level.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If this corrective phase continues, then the Ethereum price decline is far from over. The current local weakness has put a strain on the support, and if $3,900 fails completely, the next major support lies below $3,400, more specifically at $3,385. This will serve as the next stronghold for the bulls to make their move.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“From a structural perspective, Ethereum’s inability to sustain momentum signals growing bearish pressure across lower timeframes,” the crypto analyst explained.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Case For ETH Bulls</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the mounting bearish pressure, there is still the possibility that the Ethereum price could break out of this downtrend. Just like with the bearish case, the key lies at the $3,900 support and how well it holds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the case that bulls are able to reclaim and hold this support with momentum, then it could invalidate the bearish setup that has emerged. In this case, the crypto analyst believes that the Ethereum price could resume its uptrend above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level.</span></p></span></div></div>",
