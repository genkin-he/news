Volumes were down 0.9%, representing a sequential improvement on the second quarter (down 1.8%).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The positive 1.5% structure impact primarily reflects the acquisitions of Cemix in Latin America and FOSROC in India and the Middle East, in line with the Group's strategy targeting high-growth countries and construction chemicals. The integration of recent acquisitions is progressing well, delivering the expected synergies. The optimization of the Group's profile also continued with the effect of divestments, notably the pipe drainage business for buildings (PAM Building) as well as Brüggemann in Germany.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On a reported basis, sales came to €11.42 billion in third-quarter 2025 (down 1.3%), owing to the depreciation of most currencies against the euro, with a negative 2.6% currency impact, particularly in the Americas Region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Performance by Region (sales)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Europe, Middle East and Africa: return to sales growth</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sales in Europe were up 1.2% in local currencies and up 0.6% like-for-like in the third quarter, marking a return to sales growth for the first time since first-quarter 2023, and representing a noticeable improvement on the second quarter (down 1.8% like-for-like) as construction markets stabilized or began to recover, depending on the country.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-  Northern Europe decreased 0.7% like-for-like, stable excluding industrial solutions, with a contrasted situation from one country to the next. The UK reported further growth, driven by its comprehensive solutions approach for the residential market and its solutions offering energy performance, fire resistance and productivity for non-residential. Nordic countries remained mixed overall, with signs of an improvement in renovation but not as yet in new residential construction. Sweden and Denmark reported growth, with Denmark benefiting from several significant infrastructure projects in the quarter. In Finland, Saint-Gobain patented an innovative process using slag from the steel production process, reducing the quantity of cement in mortars by 70% while cutting CO2 emissions. Eastern Europe progressed excluding Poland which was affected by lower industrial solutions sales. Germany is still slightly down pending the implementation of its stimulus plan.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-  Southern Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa grew by 1.5% like-for-like (by 2.8% in local currencies), a clear sequential improvement in the third quarter from the decrease of 2.8% in the second quarter. France stabilized at comparable working days (down 1.0% based on actual working days): a noticeable improvement on the second quarter (down 4.6%). Saint-Gobain outperformed thanks to its comprehensive range of innovative solutions and its specification model in non-residential markets. The improvement is expected to continue given positive leading indicators, with a rise in existing home transactions, growth in lending and an increase in building permits and housing starts. Spain and Italy progressed and continued to capture market share, particularly in renovation. The Middle East and Africa delivered strong growth, fueled by the success of the FOSROC integration and major infrastructure, residential and tourist resort projects in the United Arab Emirates - for example the bridges and infrastructure linking Ramhan Island to Abu Dhabi as well as the construction of a metro line and several residential towers in Dubai.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Americas: slight contraction in sales</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Region contracted 1.0% in local currencies and 2.9% like-for-like in the third quarter, given the slowdown in North America, partly offset by good growth in Latin America.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-  North America was down 6.5% like-for-like, owing to the combination of continued softness in new construction related to a still-high interest rate environment and the lack of major weather events in the quarter, unlike in previous years, which affected sales of roofing products. However, the renovation market remains resilient. Given the significant housing shortage, the new construction market is structurally healthy and should gradually benefit from the start of a reduction in interest rates. Thanks to its positioning, Saint-Gobain continues to deliver a good operating performance. The Group is the partner of choice for distributors, benefiting from its comprehensive offer in residential, non-residential and infrastructure markets in both the US and in Canada, where Saint-Gobain inaugurated the first North American zero-carbon (scope 1 and 2) plasterboard plant.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-  Latin America grew 12.8% in local currencies and 6.4% like-for-like, a good performance against a less favorable comparison basis; industrial solutions saw double-digit growth. Brazil saw further growth thanks to its unrivaled range of solutions, helping to accelerate cross-selling and grow its specified sales. The country also launched production of Latin America's first low-carbon glass in the quarter. Mexico and all of Central America saw spillover benefits from the smooth integration of Cemix in construction chemicals, which grew 18% in local currencies. The other countries in the Region also benefited from the good momentum, thanks to offer enrichment and enhanced mix.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Asia-Pacific: sales growth driven by India</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Region delivered growth of 8.4% in local currencies and of 3.4% like-for-like in the third quarter (after growing 1.1% in the second quarter), driven by India and South-East Asia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>India achieved further market share gains, with double-digit volume growth, driven by its comprehensive and innovative range of sustainable solutions. The Group was awarded new projects in non-residential and infrastructure, testifying to its leadership in construction chemicals, reinforced by its acquisition of FOSROC. China improved, including industrial solutions, in a market that is stabilizing at a low level. Good momentum in South-East Asia continued, driven by Indonesia and Vietnam on the back of a major contract at Long Thanh airport, comprising 15 solutions specified by the Group. The integration of CSR in Australia is progressing well, in terms of both operational performance and the development of complete solutions, in a construction market that remains lackluster but whose leading indicators are nevertheless improving.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2025 outlook</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a macroeconomic environment that remains contrasted, Saint-Gobain will once again demonstrate a very strong operating performance in second-half 2025. Assuming no major slowdown in global growth linked to geopolitical uncertainties, the Group expects the following trends:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·    Europe: a gradual recovery country by country;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·  Americas: a good level of activity to be maintained in Latin America and continued softness in new construction in North America amid still-high interest rates;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·    Asia-Pacific: growth led mainly by India, South-East Asia and the integration of CSR in Australia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Saint-Gobain expects an operating margin of more than 11.0% in 2025</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financial calendar</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A conference call will be held at 6:30pm (Paris time) on October 30, 2025:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>please dial +44 20 3059 5875, +1 718 705 8795 or +33 1 70 91 87 14 (code 4276084#)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·    2025 results: February 26, 2026, after close of trading on the Paris stock exchange.</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p class=\"\"><span>Analyst/investor relations</span></p></td><td colspan=\"3\"><p class=\"\"><span>Press relations</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Vivien Dardel:</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>+33 1 88 54 29 77</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Patricia Marie:</span></p></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p class=\"\"><span>+33 1 88 54 26 83</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Floriana Michalowska:</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>+33 1 88 54 19 09</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Laure Bencheikh:</span></p></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p class=\"\"><span>+33 1 88 54 26 38</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Alix Sicaud:</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>+33 1 88 54 38 70</span></p></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p class=\"\"><span>Yanice Biyogo: </span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span> +33 1 88 54 27 96</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>James Weston: </span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>+33 1 88 54 01 24</span></p></td><td colspan=\"2\"></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><span>​</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>​</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Glossary:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- Changes on an actual structure basis reflect changes in published indicators between two periods.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- Changes in local currencies reflect actual performance, applying exchange rates for the previous period to indicators for the period under review.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- Like-for-like changes (constant structure and exchange rates) reflect underlying performance excluding the impacts of:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>•     changes in scope, by calculating indicators for the period under review based on the scope of consolidation of the previous period (structure impact);</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>•     changes in foreign exchange rates, by calculating indicators for the period under review and those for the previous period based on exchange rates for the previous period (exchange rate impact).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- Operating income: see note 5 to the interim financial statements, available by clicking here: https://www.saint-gobain.com/en/finance/regulated-information/half-yearly-financial-report</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- Operating margin = operating income divided by sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Important disclaimer - forward-looking statements:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This press release contains forward-looking statements with respect to Saint-Gobain's financial condition, results, business, strategy, plans and outlook.

On an analyst call, management says continued weakness in the ferrous metal recycling business was a part of its lowered guidance. Adjusted full-year Ebitda is now expected at C$500 million, a 5% decline from the previous midpoint. The company says conditions remain challenging due to soft Canadian demand driven by tariffs on finished steel sold into the U.S. coupled with an oversupply and broader macroeconomic caution that is limiting new steel production. This resulted in a buildup of ferrous inventory that the company is working to sell into stronger U.S. markets. (adriano.marchese@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

There are many factors that affect the Company's business and the results of its operations and that may cause the actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or anticipated. These factors include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic effects, the impact of higher raw material and component costs and cost inflation, supply chain disruptions and shortages, particularly with respect to steel, plastics, scrap iron, zinc, copper and electronic components, rising interest rates, delays in delivery of our products to our customers, the impact of global economic conditions on demand for our products, including the impact, length and degree of economic downturns on the customers and markets we serve, reductions in production levels, the availability, terms and cost of financing, including borrowings under credit arrangements or agreements, the potential impact of bank failures on our ability to access financing or capital markets, and the impact of market conditions on pension plan funded status. Other factors include, but are not limited to: restrictions on operating flexibility imposed by the agreement governing our credit facility; risks associated with doing business overseas, including fluctuations in exchange rates and the inability to repatriate foreign cash, the impact on cost structure and on economic conditions as a result of actual and threatened increases in trade tariffs and the impact of political, economic and social instability; the inability to achieve the savings expected from global sourcing of materials; lower-cost competition; our ability to design, introduce and sell new or updated products and related components; market acceptance of our products; the inability to attain expected benefits from acquisitions or the inability to effectively integrate such acquisitions and achieve expected synergies; domestic and international economic conditions, and more specifically conditions in the automotive, construction, aerospace, energy, oil and gas, transportation, electronic, and general industrial markets; costs and liabilities associated with environmental compliance; the impact of climate change; military conflict (including the Russia/Ukraine conflict, the conflict in Israel and surrounding areas, the possible expansion of such conflicts and geopolitical consequences) or terrorist threats and the possible responses by the U.S. and foreign governments; failure to protect our intellectual property; cyberattacks; materially adverse or unanticipated legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements; and other risks identified and discussed in Item 1A, </span><em><span>Risk Factors</span></em><span>, and Item 7, </span><span>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on March 11, 2025, and that may be identified from time to time in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other filings we make with the SEC. Although the Company believes it has an appropriate business strategy and the resources necessary for its operations, future revenue and margin trends cannot be reliably predicted and the Company may alter its business strategies to address changing conditions. Also, the Company makes estimates and assumptions that may materially affect reported amounts and disclosures. These relate to valuation allowances for accounts receivable and excess and obsolete inventories, accruals for pensions and other postretirement benefits (including forecasted future cost increases and returns on plan assets), provisions for depreciation (estimating useful lives), uncertain tax positions, and, on occasion, accruals for contingent losses. The Company undertakes no obligation to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Eastern Company</span></strong></em></p><p class=\"\"><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Ryan Schroeder or Nicholas Vlahos, 203-729-2255</span></strong></em></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>SOURCE:</span></strong><span> The Eastern Company</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire</span></p></span></div></div>",
