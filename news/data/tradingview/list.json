Fool me twice, shame on me.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At this point, China has tried to use its position in rare earth materials to manipulate U.S. policy more than a few times. The U.S. won't play that game anymore.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MP Materials and other rare-earth stocks bobbed up and down, but were mostly higher midday, after the U.S. and China reached an agreement over export controls of the critical materials.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>President Donald Trump and China's leader Xi Jinping met for talks in South Korea and managed to resolve a number of issues between the two countries. China agreed to defer its plan to tighten export controls on rare-earth materials for a year. A Commerce Ministry spokesperson said Beijing will \"study and refine specific plans\" in the meantime, the state-owned news agency Xinhua reported.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A year isn't all that long. \"A one-year pause on rare earth and critical minerals restrictions from China may create some breathing room for US companies, but it doesn't change our near-total dependence on China for these vital industrial inputs,\" said SAFE, a political action group dedicated to improving U.S. self-sufficiency in critical products such as oil and rare-earth metals, in an emailed statement. \"China still holds all the cards.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China has an estimated 85% of global rare-earth processing capacity, giving it a near-monopoly in products that have become increasingly important in modern manufacturing. Rare-earth elements end up in everything from electronics to electric cars to wind turbines to jet fighters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China built its position over many decades and has threatened export control many times in the past, including earlier this year after President Trump announced tariffs in April.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Threatened restrictions are one reason the U.S. has moved to accelerate America's ability to produce its own rare-earth materials. In July, the Defense Department announced a blockbuster deal with MP Materials that included an equity stake, price floor, and guaranteed customer for MP's rare-earth-magnet capacity. Since then, the government has moved to develop rare-earth materials with allies such as Japan and Australia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The MP deal was a boon for the sector. Coming into Thursday trading, shares of MP were up 312% year to date. Shares of USA Rare Earth and Ramaco Resources were up 75% and 182%, respectively.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cooling trade tensions between the U.S. and China, however, were essentially bad news for the stocks — or at least for traders. Coming into Wednesday trading, shares of the three were actually down 21% on average since China threatened export restrictions again in early October.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shares were up again on Thursday. MP stock was up 1.3% in midday trading. Shares of USA Rare Earth were down 1.5%, but Ramaco stock was up 6%. Shares of processor NEO Performance Materials were up 1.5%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The stocks are mostly up for mainly two reasons. For starters, the stock market is forward-looking. The declines of the past couple of weeks reflect the deal that was announced on Thursday, but a one-year pause won't derail America's plans to develop more domestic rare-earth capacity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That ship has sailed. America wants rare-earth independence. Over time, it will get it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Callum Keown at callum.keown@dowjones.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
