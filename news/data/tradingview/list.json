Shareholders should note that the dilution refers to the NAV per share dilution, not to the dilution of Shareholders' holdings in the Company. All Shareholders have the right to take up their subscription rights on 1 December in each year (the \"Record Date\") and those who do take them up in full don't have their percentage holding in the Company diluted. For those investors who don't take up their subscription rights, the Company endeavours to place in the market the shares that they were entitled to subscribe for, and then return the net sale proceeds to those investors as a way to deliver to them as much as possible of the value of their subscription rights, therefore reducing the dilution effect of not subscribing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Board is currently anticipating that the majority of the Company's Shareholders will exercise their Subscription Rights in full, given the Company's share price is trading significantly higher than the Subscription Exercise Price. As a full exercise will generate proceeds in excess of EUR 8 million at the current 1.15 GBP:EUR exchange rate, the Board is expecting to scale back all Shareholders pro rata to their Subscription Rights pursuant to the Proposals in the circular dated 4 November 2022. The scale back would be effected in order to limit the issuance to EUR 8 million, being the maximum level the Company would not be required to issue a prospectus, which the Board believes would be unduly expensive compared to the total new money raised.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To account for the probable scale back, the calculation for the fully diluted NAV per share has been amended to reduce the maximum number of shares the Company can issue by 22.29%, to 14,492,753. This amendment has reduced the dilutive effect of the issuance of new Ordinary Shares. Please note the scale back factor, the maximum shares that can be issued and the NAV dilution are only current estimates. Any further amendments to the dilution calculation will be communicated in subsequent NAV announcements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About the annual Subscription Right</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shareholders have the right to subscribe for one new Ordinary Share for every five Ordinary Shares held in the Company on the Record Date, as outlined in the circular published on 4 November 2022. The exercise price is equal to the undiluted NAV per share on 30 November one year prior. The aim of the programme is to enable to Company to grow through share issuance and it is subject to shareholder review at the annual general meeting (\"AGM\") in 2027 and at every fifth subsequent AGM thereafter.</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Enquiries</span></p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Manulife | CQS Investment Management      </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Craig Cleland</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>+44 (0) 20 7201 5368</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Cavendish Capital Markets Limited</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Robert Peel (Corporate Finance)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Daniel Balabanoff / Pauline Tribe (Sales)</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>+44 (0) 20 7908 6000</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>+44 (0) 20 7720 0500</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Apex Fund and Corporate Services (Guernsey) Limited</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>James Taylor</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>+44 (0) 203 5303 600</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Tavistock</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jos Simson / Gareth Tredway / Ruairi Millar</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>+44 (0) 20 7920 3150</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><span>About Golden Prospect Precious Metals</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Golden Prospect Precious Metals Limited is a closed-ended investment company incorporated with limited liability in Guernsey on 16 October 2006.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Beth Pinsker</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I grew up in a world where the cheaper option was always the better option. I have spent much of my career as a personal finance expert preaching how to save more, spend less and minimize taxes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then in November 2022 my mom got sick. She was 76 and had complications following back surgery, so I had to step in and manage her affairs. The various infections, electrolyte imbalances and medication intolerances weakened her to the point of collapse. It made me realize that I had book knowledge in a situation that demanded street smarts. I had to make endless decisions, with only bad, expensive options to choose from.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Would we spend $20,000 on a medical flight to move my mom from Florida to New York, so I could better keep an eye on her? No — she didn't want to move, and her wishes mattered above anyone else's. Would we give a burned-out caregiver a week's paid vacation? Yes — because we wanted to keep her. We paid her salary for the week as well as her replacement's, plus we offered her a raise to make sure she came back.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Could we afford to pay $12,000 a month to keep my mom in a rehab center after Medicare stopped paying? It depended on how long she would need to stay, and that was difficult to know in advance. At the start of my mom's illness, we had no idea she had only eight months left. She was suffering from complications from surgery, not from cancer or renal failure; she could have lived another 10 years, for all we knew.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What I could do with my financial knowledge was plug her savings balance into a simple  spend-down calculator, to see how long her money would last at her current burn rate. The principal was earning a reasonable rate of growth at the same time. When she ran out completely, there would be Medicaid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We did our best to stretch out her Medicare coverage at the rehab center. There's a 100-day maximum for that level of care, but you rarely get that long in practice because you need doctor approval. We filed and won two appeals to extend her time, then we prevailed on the CEO of the center to stop the discharge orders until her days ran out.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I calculated that we could have afforded to keep her there and pay out of pocket for at least a year before having to think about selling my mom's apartment. But she was still calling the shots at that point, and she decided she wanted to go home on hospice care, whose cost was covered by Medicare.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even the smaller decisions were hard. When my mom came home from the hospital, I was at her apartment to receive the equipment she needed. I was faced with a choice: Take the Medicare-covered standard mattress, or pay $700 extra for a deluxe model that would better prevent bedsores. Years of frugality tugged at my brain, but I plunked down her credit card for the better mattress.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When it comes to the endgame, time horizons shrink. You can be a lot freer with the financial reins when you're thinking in terms of months versus decades. As the one holding my mother's power of attorney, I had pledged to be a careful steward. Once her situation started to look dire, I made peace with spending her money, whether that meant managing caregivers or splurging on hot fudge sundaes from Dairy Queen for dinner.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Not much discussion of financial planning is geared toward how to take care of other people and how to make it possible for them to care for you. The people who reach out to me for advice want to talk about optimizing rates of return and navigating market risks, about Roth conversions and when to claim Social Security.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I had always been right there for these discussions, but now this sort of strictly financial maneuvering seems to miss the most important question: What's it all for?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The first thing I do now when faced with a financial decision is ask about the purpose of the money. So many people like my mom save just to save, because that's what we're told to do. They collect piles of money in various accounts out of some generalized fear that they will run out before they die, and then they gnash their teeth about how to make it grow faster and pay less tax on it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>My parents were teachers, and they were often steered into conservative financial products in their retirement plans, even if more diversity would have been better. My mom was so afraid of losing any money in the stock market that she put her whole life savings into guaranteed annuity contracts. She got a lower return than she might have otherwise, but she could sleep at night.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This worked fine until she got sick and we ran out of rainy days to save for. When I needed to pay for her care, her money was locked up, so I couldn't just withdraw it. The bulk of her savings was my father's death benefit, and since it had been just under five years since he died, there would be surrender fees and other losses if we broke into it early. The only other option was for me to advance the money, which would have meant digging into my own retirement funds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The experience has changed the way I handle my own finances, as well as the advice I give other people. My main goal now is to prevent my kids from being left with only bad, expensive choices when it comes to caring for me. So I put my money where my mouth is and live more in the present, even as I plan for the future. I have long-term-care insurance; I've made plans so I can age at home in a place with no stairs; and when I die, I've arranged to be cremated and have my ashes turned into a planter in a biodegradable urn.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most of all, I'm keeping my financial accounts as simple as possible and leaving behind detailed instructions for my children. Right now, they are barely adults; they still call me to ask for their Social Security numbers every time they have to fill out a form. Asking them to do for me what I just did for my mom would be almost cruel. Hopefully I'll live a long time, and by the time they have to think about managing my affairs, they'll know a lot more about adulting. But even if they end up as financial professionals, they're still going to need some help — just like I did.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beth Pinsker is a columnist at MarketWatch and the author of \"My Mother's Money: A Guide to Financial Caregiving,\" which will be published Nov. 4 by Crown Curency.</span></p></span></div></div>",

The school continues to make a huge impact and has received national recognition. Unfortunately, my sister died in May 2019 after a short, but fierce, battle with cancer. When she was diagnosed, someone recommended the book \"Chasing Daylight,\" written by a past CEO of KPMG who was given 90 days to live after his diagnosis. My sister said she had been chasing daylight ever since she found her passion for education and thankfully had fulfilled her dreams with Solar Prep. It's a great lesson for all of us to step back and say, \"I don't know how much time I've got, so I must make the best of each and every day.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What is a piece of advice that you've found insightful?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Let people be great at what they're great at.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>What makes you happy?</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>At home, it's seeing my family happy, healthy and fulfilled.

In a report this week, analysts with Rabobank say that the government payments coming from the Trump Administration may be creating this delay. If land values alone were to backtrack from current levels, then the price competitiveness of U.S. soybeans would be closer to par with that of soybeans out of Brazil's Mato Grosso region. But with money flowing into farmer's coffers comes a continued inflation of costs for things like farmland, the firm adds. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>A new wind-energy partnership is helping DP World in Argentina power its Buenos Aires terminal with 81% renewable electricity-reducing emissions and setting a model for sustainable ports across Latin America.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>BUENOS AIRES, AR / ACCESS Newswire / October 30, 2025 / DP World has achieved a major milestone in its sustainability journey in Argentina. Through a strategic partnership with local energy provider Pampa Energía, the company's Buenos Aires terminal (Terminales Río de la Plata, or TRP) increased its renewable electricity use from 30% to 81%, marking a significant step toward DP World's global decarbonization goals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Powering Port Operations with Wind Energy</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The partnership, which began in September 2024, enables TRP to source the majority of its electricity from Pampa Energía's wind energy park, replacing traditional grid supply with clean, renewable power. After a successful three-month trial during Q4 2024, the terminal reported consistent performance improvements and substantial emissions reductions in the first half of 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In September 2024 alone, 97.2% of TRP's total electricity consumption - more than 746,000 kWh - came from renewable sources, avoiding the emission of 373 tons of CO₂ into the atmosphere.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Tangible Reductions in Carbon Emissions</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>From January to May 2025, TRP's absolute carbon emissions fell by 75%, dropping from 8 KtCO₂e to 2 KtCO₂e, compared with the same period in 2024. This reduction contributes directly to DP World's global target of achieving a 42% decrease in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Efficiency gains have also been striking. carbon intensity - the amount of CO₂ emitted per container handled - has been cut nearly in half, improving from 17.8 to 9.5 KgCO₂e per modified TEU, reflecting significant progress in energy efficiency.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Leading Argentina's Energy Transition</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>As one of Argentina's most important private terminals, TRP's transition underscores DP World's role in advancing the country's energy transition while supporting economic resilience.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Claudio Pautazzo</span></strong><span>, </span><span>Manager, Safety &amp; Environment, DP World in Argentina, said: \"Our agreement with Pampa Energía represents far more than a new energy contract - it's a strategic commitment to transforming how we operate. By sourcing the majority of our electricity from wind power, we're demonstrating how renewable energy can drive efficiency, reduce emissions, and strengthen Argentina's position in the global transition toward a low-carbon economy.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beyond emissions reduction, this initiative supports DP World's \"Our World, Our Future\" sustainability strategy, which focuses on decarbonizing operations, promoting circular economy practices, and supporting clean energy transitions across the Americas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>A Blueprint for Sustainable Ports</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>With this milestone, DP World in Argentina joins other terminals across the Americas - such as Callao in Peru and Caucedo in the Dominican Republic - that are now running on renewable energy. Together, these efforts are advancing DP World's mission to make trade flow sustainably, transforming how global logistics contributes to a cleaner, more resilient future.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-END-</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>DP World Americas Media Contact:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Melina Vissat, Head of Communications</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>M:</span></strong><span> (+1) 704-605-6159</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>E:</span></strong><span> melina.vissat@dpworld.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About DP World</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>DP World is reshaping the future of global trade to improve lives everywhere.
