(\"Nine\" or the \"Company\") </span><span> reported third quarter 2025 revenues of $132.0 million, net loss of $(14.6) million, or $(0.35) per diluted share and $(0.35) per basic share, and adjusted EBITDA of $9.6 million. The Company provided original third quarter 2025 revenue guidance between $135.0 and $145.0 million, with actual results coming in below the provided range.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Q3 was a challenging quarter following significant rig declines and subsequent pricing pressure beginning in Q2,\" said Ann Fox, President and Chief Executive Officer, Nine Energy Service. \"At the end of Q1, the US rig count was 592 and by the end of Q3 had declined to 549 rigs, a decline of 43 rigs, or 7% over two quarters. With these activity declines, we have seen significant pricing pressure starting in Q2 and continuing into Q3, most evident in the Permian Basin where the majority of rigs have come out of the market, and the competitive landscape is saturated.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Activity declines and pricing pressure negatively impacted revenue and earnings across all of our service lines. In addition to market impacts, our Completion Tools Division had market share losses during Q3 due mostly to customer consolidation and a change in certain of our domestic customers' completion designs. Our R&amp;D team is working real-time to design, test and commercialize new technology to address the market need. Our international tools business remains an important part of our growth strategy, and we still anticipate growing international tools revenue year over year.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Natural gas prices remained mostly supportive during the quarter, averaging $3.03 for Q3, versus $3.19 for Q2. While the long-term natural gas outlook remains positive, we faced temporary headwinds in the Northeast during Q3 due to droughts in the area, causing completion delays and inefficiencies impacting our Wireline and Completion Tools divisions in that region.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Despite a challenging macro backdrop, our cementing team remains at the forefront of technology. We recently completed a landmark cementing job for a large operator in the Haynesville, a basin characterized as an extremely challenging operating environment. Our lab technicians formulated a proprietary, latex-based slurry and operations successfully executed at the wellsite.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The US land market continues to be challenging. It is too early to provide an outlook for 2026 activity, but we do expect typical seasonality in Q4 related to budget exhaustion, holidays and weather, as well as continued low pricing of services. Because of this, we anticipate Q4 revenue and earnings will be down compared to Q3.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We will continue to navigate market dynamics. This team is extremely capable and resilient, and we remain focused on growing market share both domestically and internationally, while simultaneously lowering our costs without impeding the quality of our service execution, safety and technology.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Operating Results</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the third quarter of 2025, the Company reported revenues of $132.0 million, gross profit of $11.9 million and adjusted gross profit(B) of $20.3 million. During the third quarter of 2025, the Company generated ROIC of (-23.1)% and adjusted ROIC(C) of (-1.6)%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the third quarter of 2025, the Company reported general and administrative (\"G&amp;A\") expense of $12.8 million. Depreciation and amortization expense (\"D&amp;A\") in the third quarter of 2025 was $8.6 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company's tax benefit was approximately $0.3 million year to date. The benefit for 2025 is the result of a $0.5 million discrete tax benefit recorded during the second quarter of 2025, offset by tax positions in state and non-U.S. jurisdictions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Liquidity and Capital Expenditures</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the third quarter of 2025, the Company reported net cash used in operating activities of $9.9 million. Capital expenditures totaled $3.5 million during the third quarter of 2025 and totaled $13.9 million for the first nine months of 2025. The Company's full-year 2025 capital expenditures guidance is unchanged at $15 to $25 million, but the Company anticipates that full-year 2025 capital expenditures will be at the lower end of the range.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As of September 30, 2025, Nine's cash and cash equivalents were $14.4 million, and the Company had $25.9 million of availability under its revolving credit facility, resulting in a total liquidity position of $40.3 million as of September 30, 2025. On September 30, 2025, the Company had $63.3 million of borrowings under its revolving credit facility. As a result of the current commodity price environment and its impact on the Company's inventory's appraised value, the Company currently expects the borrowing base under the 2025 ABL Credit Facility will be reduced by approximately $2.2 million as of October 31, 2025 and will be further reduced by approximately $2.2 million on each of November 30, 2025, December 31, 2025 and January 31, 2026, which would reduce availability thereunder and the Company's total liquidity position by such amounts. Future increases or decreases in the Company's inventory's appraised value would increase or decrease, respectively, the Company's borrowing base. The Company's next inventory appraisal is currently expected to be conducted by mid-December 2025 and could increase or decrease the Company's borrowing base as of December 31, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As per the terms of the indenture governing Nine's senior secured notes, the Company is required to periodically offer to repurchase such notes with a portion of any Excess Cash Flow, as defined in the indenture. Nine did not generate any Excess Cash Flow in the most recently ended two fiscal quarters (the six-month period ended September 30, 2025). As a result, no Excess Cash Flow offer will be made to noteholders this month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the third quarter of 2025, the Company did not sell any shares of common stock under its at-the-market equity offering program.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(ABC) See end of press release for definitions of these non-GAAP measures. </span><br/><span>These measures are intended to provide additional information only and should </span><br/><span>not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income </span><br/><span>(loss), gross profit or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. </span><br/><span>Certain items excluded from these measures are significant components in </span><br/><span>understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a </span><br/><span>company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of </span><br/><span>depreciable assets.

</span><br/><span>of the ongoing performance of our business. </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>(B) Adjusted gross profit (loss) is defined as revenues less cost of revenues </span><br/><span>excluding depreciation and amortization. This measure differs from the GAAP </span><br/><span>definition of gross profit (loss) because we do not include the impact of </span><br/><span>depreciation and amortization, which represent non-cash expenses. Our </span><br/><span>management believes adjusted gross profit (loss) provides useful information </span><br/><span>to us and our investors regarding our financial condition and results of </span><br/><span>operation and helps management evaluate our operating performance by </span><br/><span>eliminating the impact of depreciation and amortization, which we do not </span><br/><span>consider indicative of our core operating performance. </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>(C) Adjusted return on invested capital (\"adjusted ROIC\") is defined as </span><br/><span>adjusted after-tax net operating profit (loss), divided by average total </span><br/><span>capital. We define adjusted after-tax net operating profit (loss), which is a </span><br/><span>non-GAAP measure, as net income (loss) plus (i) goodwill, intangible asset, </span><br/><span>and/or property and equipment impairment charges, (ii) transaction and </span><br/><span>integration costs related to acquisitions, (iii) interest expense (income), </span><br/><span>(iv) restructuring charges, (v) loss (gain) on the sale of subsidiaries, (vi) </span><br/><span>loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, and (vii) the provision (benefit) for </span><br/><span>deferred income taxes. We define total capital as book value of equity </span><br/><span>(deficit) plus the book value of debt less balance sheet cash and cash </span><br/><span>equivalents. We compute and use the average of the current and prior </span><br/><span>period-end total capital in determining adjusted ROIC. Management believes </span><br/><span>adjusted ROIC provides useful information to us and our investors regarding </span><br/><span>our financial condition and results of operations because it quantifies how </span><br/><span>well we generate operating income relative to the capital we have invested in </span><br/><span>our business and illustrates the profitability of a business or project taking </span><br/><span>into account the capital invested, and management uses adjusted ROIC to assist </span><br/><span>them in capital resource allocation decisions and in evaluating business </span><br/><span>performance. </span><br/><span> </span></pre><p class=\"\"><span>View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251030502144/en/</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CONTACT:    Nine Energy Service Investor Contact:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Heather Schmidt</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Senior Vice President, Strategic Development and Investor Relations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(281) 730-5113</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>investors@nineenergyservice.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

A recent press release discussing the 1982 U.S. Department of Energy assessment of Copper Mountain's uranium endowment can be viewed here. Copper Mountain hosts several known uranium deposits and historic uranium mines, including the Arrowhead Mine which produced 500,000 lbs of U3O8. Copper Mountain saw extensive drilling and development by Union Pacific during the late 1970s including the development of a mine plan to fuel a planned fleet of California Edison reactors. Operations ceased in 1980 before mining could commence due to falling uranium prices. Approximately 2,000 boreholes have been drilled at Copper Mountain and the project area has significant exploration upside. Union Pacific is estimated to have spent C$117 million (2024 dollars) exploring and developing Copper Mountain, generating significant historical resource estimates which are detailed here. The Company also recently acquired, subject to completing a geophysical survey this year, a 100% interest in the Red Basin Uranium Project in New Mexico, which has extensive near-surface uranium mineralisation and significant upside potential. Our Crux Investor overview page including recent interviews can be viewed here. The Company's presentation can be viewed here. News releases regarding historical drilling can be viewed here and here. The final news release regarding chemical assays of 2024 Copper Mountain drilling can be viewed here.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For further information, please refer to Myriad's disclosure record on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca), contact Myriad by telephone at +1.604.418.2877, or refer to Myriad's website at www.myriaduranium.com.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Myriad Contacts:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thomas Lamb</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>President and CEO</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>tlamb@myriaduranium.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Forward-Looking Statements</span></strong></em></p><p class=\"\"><span>This news release contains \"forward-looking information\" that is based on the Company's current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections.
