In order to back its obligations under the ETC Securities, the Issuer will seek to hold enough Metal to meet its obligations under the ETC Securities. The precise amount it holds at any time may be more or less than the aggregate amount of the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security to reflect the periodic payment of product fees. The proceeds from the disposal of the underlying Metal, plus any interest received on the proceeds of such disposal less any negative interest, net of any deductions, will equal the amount due under the ETC Securities (subject to certain minimum amounts owed).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Metal will be held for the Issuer by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (or any successor or replacement) (the \"Secured Account Custodian\") and will be generally held on an \"allocated\" basis. This means that specifically identifiable physical items of the Metal are allocated to the Issuer and are segregated from metal held for other clients of the custodian. However, for operational purposes, small amounts of Metal may be held on an \"unallocated\" basis. This means that the Secured Account Custodian maintains an account in the name of the Issuer which shows them as being entitled to delivery of a particular amount of the Metal but without specific physical metal having been identified. Where Metal is held on an \"unallocated\" basis the right to delivery is a purely contractual right and, as such, the Issuer is an unsecured creditor of the custodian and is exposed to the credit risk of the custodian.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Security</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The obligations of the Issuer under the ETC Securities will be secured pursuant to a security deed governed by the laws of Ireland and a security deed governed by English law by security interests over the rights of the Issuer under the agreements entered into by it in respect of the ETC Securities and any underlying Metal. The assets and property that are the subject of such security interests are known as \"Secured Property\" for this Series. Securityholders will not, by reason of holding such Series, have any claim against the Secured Property with respect to any other series of ETC Securities.

The \"Final Metal Redemption Amount\" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Final Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the volume-weighted average prices per metal unit at which the Metal Agent (defined below) is able to sell the underlying Metal (\"Average Metal Sale Price\") during the Final Redemption Disposal Period (defined below).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The \"Final Redemption Disposal Period\" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Final Redemption Valuation Date.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Final Redemption Valuation Date\" is the date specified in the Final Terms  or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Specified Interest Amount\" is the amount of interest per ETC Security equal to that ETC Security's pro rata share of the amount of interest which has accrued (if any) on the proceeds of realisation of the underlying Metal deposited into the Series Cash Account (defined below) during or relating to the relevant redemption disposal period. Whilst interest may accrue at a positive, zero or negative rate on the Series Cash Account, the Specified Interest Amount is subject to a minimum of zero and any negative interest shall instead be deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the underlying Metal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Early Redemption Amount</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If any of the early redemption events occur, each ETC Security will become due and payable at an amount (the \"Early Redemption Amount\") equal to the greater of (i) the Early Metal Redemption Amount (defined below) plus the Specified Interest Amount and (ii) the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The \"Early Metal Redemption Amount\" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Early Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the Average Metal Sale Price during the Early Redemption Disposal Period (defined below).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The \"Early Redemption Disposal Period\" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Early Redemption Valuation Date.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The \"Scheduled Early Redemption Date\" is the 8th business day following the Early Redemption Disposal Period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The \"Early Redemption Valuation Date\" is the date of the occurrence of an early redemption event or the date on which the Trustee gives notice that, due to the occurrence of an event of default, the ETC Securities shall become due and payable at their Early Redemption Amount on the Scheduled Early Redemption Date, or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There can be no assurance that the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, will be greater than or equal to the amount invested by any securityholder.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the Final Metal Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, plus the Specified Interest Amount falls below the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount, then due to the limited recourse nature of the ETC Securities, securityholders are unlikely to receive payment of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, in full and may receive zero.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount per ETC Security, as applicable, will be determined by reference to the Average Metal Sale Price of the underlying Metal held in respect of the ETC Securities sold during the Final Redemption Disposal Period or Early Redemption Disposal Period, as applicable, by JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.

The Issuer will, on or prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date or Scheduled Early Redemption Date, publish the determination of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, (which shall include publication of the price, volume and date of each sale of underlying Metal during the relevant redemption disposal period, including information on any fees, deductions and/or taxes imposed on such sale, and the determination of the Average Metal Sale Price) on the website maintained on behalf of the Issuer at www.etf.dws.com (or such other website notified by the Issuer for the ETC Securities from time to time).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Metal Agent will pay the aggregate proceeds of such disposals (converted, if necessary, into the currency of the ETC Securities) to the cash account for the Series (the \"Series Cash Account\") maintained by J.P.

Accrued product fee is paid by a daily reduction in the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security which, as a result of such reduction, operates as a charge on securityholders. The Issuer will, using the Metal Agent, periodically realise Metal equal to such charge and the proceeds will be credited to the Series Cash Account maintained by the Account Bank in relation to the ETC Securities and used by the Issuer to pay the product fee to the Programme Administrator in accordance with the Programme Administrator Agreement, as novated, amended and restated (the \"Programme Administrator Agreement\"). Such realisation will happen on a periodic (typically weekly) basis. The Programme Administrator Agreement provides that the Programme Administrator will use the product fee in relation to each Series of ETC Securities to pay on behalf of the Issuer the costs of the Programme (as set out in the schedule to the Programme Administrator Agreement) relating to such Series of ETC Securities and the Issuer more generally.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Events of Default and Early Redemption Events</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The ETC Securities may become due and payable prior to their Scheduled Maturity Date in connection with the occurrence of any of the following events:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(i)            certain legal or regulatory changes occur in relation to the Issuer and the Issuer gives a notice of redemption;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(ii)           any agent in relation to the ETC Securities resigns or their appointment is terminated and the Issuer gives notice that no successor or replacement has been appointed within a 60 calendar day period;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(iii)          the Value per ETC Security is less than or equal to 20 per cent. of the issue price as at the series issue date for two consecutive valuation days and the determination agent gives the relevant notice;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(iv)          the Issuer will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, be required to make a payment in respect of VAT or be required to account for VAT in respect of a delivery of Metal from or to an authorised participant (whether or not such VAT is recoverable);</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(v)           an Issuer Call Redemption Event occurs (as discussed further below under \"Issuer Call Redemption Event\");</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(vi)          the Issuer becomes entitled to serve a VAT redemption event notice and the Trustee gives the relevant notice as directed by the requisite number of securityholders; or</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(vii)         an event of default occurs under the ETC Securities.

As such, once the Secured Property has been realised and the net proceeds distributed, none of the parties or anyone acting on their behalves may take further steps against the Issuer or its directors, officers, members or administrator to recover any further sum and no debt will be owed by the Issuer in respect of such sum. Any proceeds of the Secured Property will be applied in accordance with the priorities of payments set out in the terms and conditions and, therefore, the rights of securityholders will rank in accordance therewith.
