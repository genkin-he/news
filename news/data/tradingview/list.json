Discovery said Thursday it determined that Paramount's revised offer to buy it is superior to the deal it has with Netflix, the latest twist in the monthslong battle over the storied entertainment company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix now has four business days to make a revised offer for the Warner board to determine whether it matches Paramount's latest bid. While Paramount is seeking to buy all of Warner Discovery, Netflix's deal is for the Warner movie and TV studios and HBO Max streaming service.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Warner said if the board still favors Paramount after Netflix revises its offer, Warner would be entitled to terminate the Netflix agreement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Until then, the Netflix merger agreement remains in effect, and the Warner board continues to recommend in favor of the Netflix transaction, the company said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Netflix spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Warner's latest move marks an about-face after months of rejecting Paramount's overtures. The battle for Warner is significant for the futures of both Paramount and Netflix, coming as the entertainment industry struggles to adapt to seismic shifts in technology and viewing habits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both Netflix and Paramount see Warner's library — which includes Harry Potter, Batman and hit TV shows such as \"Friends\" and \"The Sopranos\" — as a valuable asset that could boost their respective streaming services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount on Tuesday submitted a revised bid of $31 a share for all of Warner Discovery, including cable networks such as CNN and Food Network, for an $81 billion deal . Netflix in December reached a deal to buy Warner's studios and HBO Max for $27.75 a share, or $72 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As part of its revised bid, Paramount agreed to exclude the Warner cable networks from the proposed agreement's \"material adverse effect\" clause, meaning the deal's price tag won't shrink if the linear TV networks business declines in value before the close.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Additionally, Paramount accelerated the timing of its proposed \"ticking fee\" of 25 cents, which it would pay to Warner shareholders for each quarter its deal hasn't closed, to start after Sept. 30 instead of in January.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The offer also includes an increased $7 billion termination fee that Paramount would pay if the transaction failed to close due to regulatory concerns. Paramount would additionally be on the hook for the $2.8 billion breakup fee Warner would owe Netflix should that deal fall apart.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount's latest bid came after Warner's board of directors set a seven-day window for the companies to negotiate, which Netflix permitted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount has long said its all-cash bid was superior because it wanted the entire company, unlike Netflix, and it believed it had a cleaner path to regulatory approval.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos is in Washington, D.C., Thursday meeting with Justice Department and White House officials to make the case for the deal, a person familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount, led by David Ellison, went directly to shareholders with a tender offer in December, after being rebuffed by Warner multiple times. The suitor gradually sweetened its offer — backed by Ellison's billionaire father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison; private-equity firm RedBird Capital; and a group of sovereign-wealth funds — until Warner agreed to reopen negotiations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Joe Flint at Joe.Flint@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
