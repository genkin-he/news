            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Bitcoin spot trading activity has fallen to its weakest level of the year even as a fresh CryptoQuant signal suggests one important pocket of selling pressure may be starting to fade.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Darkfost, a contributor at CryptoQuant, said February is on pace to finish as the month with the lowest Bitcoin spot volumes since the start of 2024. He tied that slowdown to a broader retreat in risk appetite as traders pull back from directional exposure and wait for firmer macro or technical confirmation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“February is on track to close as the month with the lowest Bitcoin spot trading volumes since the beginning of 2024. This comes alongside BTC’s price revisiting levels last seen in 2024 as well,” Darkfost wrote on X. “The current climate of uncertainty surrounding BTC has pushed investors toward a more defensive stance, resulting in a marked reduction in risk-taking.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Bitcoin Liquidity Keeps Thinning Out</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The scale of the slowdown is visible across the major venues. Darkfost said Binance still leads by a wide margin with nearly $75 billion in February spot volume, ahead of Gate.io at $25 billion and Bybit at $20 billion. Even so, that dominance has not insulated Binance from the broader contraction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since Bitcoin’s last all-time high in October, monthly spot volumes have been roughly cut in half across the largest exchanges, according to the post. Binance fell from $198 billion to $75 billion, Gate.io from $53 billion to $25 billion, and Bybit from $41 billion to $20 billion. Rather than an exchange-specific issue, Darkfost framed the move as a market-wide pullback in participation.</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1066.6666666666667px;aspect-ratio:1.7777777777777777\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:3e2c851df094b-4bbbba140be19ef8eec682a9f377f495-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"Bitcoin spot volume\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:3e2c851df094b-4bbbba140be19ef8eec682a9f377f495-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#f1ede3\"/></picture></div></button></figure><p class=\"\"><span>He also linked the deterioration in liquidity to the aftermath of the Oct. 10 shock, when open interest dropped by more than 70,000 BTC, or roughly $8 billion, in a sharp reset of leveraged exposure. In his telling, that event did not just hit derivatives positioning. It appears to have accelerated a broader disengagement from crypto trading activity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“This phase of disengagement is directly reflected in the steady decline in spot trading volumes observed across major exchanges,” Darkfost wrote. “This dynamic points to a generalized trend affecting all major exchanges.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That matters because spot flows tend to carry more weight when traders are looking for evidence of durable demand rather than fast-moving leverage. A recovery built on stronger spot participation generally looks sturdier than one driven mainly by derivatives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Coinbase Pressure Shows Signs Of Easing</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Against that weak backdrop, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju pointed to a more constructive short-term signal: “Selling pressure on Coinbase is easing.”</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1066.6666666666667px;aspect-ratio:1.7777777777777777\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:3e2c851df094b-d6a29c5ed085cb25c92529a412fbfc89-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:3e2c851df094b-d6a29c5ed085cb25c92529a412fbfc89-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#f4eeed\"/></picture></div></button></figure><p class=\"\"><span>The chart shows the Coinbase Premium Index moving back into positive territory after spending most of the time in February below zero (with a few exceptions). By the latest reading on the chart, the premium had recovered to roughly 0.006 while Bitcoin traded near $68,300. This suggests the discount on Coinbase relative to offshore venues has narrowed, easing one sign of US-led sell pressure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That does not contradict Darkfost’s broader caution. If anything, the two signals fit together. Spot liquidity remains thin and the market is still operating in a low-conviction environment, but one of the more closely watched measures of immediate selling intensity is no longer deteriorating.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Darkfost was explicit about what would need to change for the picture to improve in a more meaningful way. “As it stands, this simultaneous contraction in spot volumes reflects a structurally cautious market phase, where participants prioritize capital preservation over directional exposure while awaiting clearer macroeconomic or technical signals. For a bullish recovery to materialize, or for a durable bottom to form, stronger spot volume support will be essential.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For now, that leaves Bitcoin in a familiar late-cycle holding pattern: sellers may be backing off on Coinbase, but without a broader return of spot demand, the market still lacks the depth that usually underpins a stronger move.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At press time, Bitcoin traded at $68,153.</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:588.28125px;max-width:1200px;aspect-ratio:2.039840637450199\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:3e2c851df094b-9d49d729554f71a234a60b2d33545946-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"Bitcoin price chart\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:3e2c851df094b-9d49d729554f71a234a60b2d33545946-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#f4f4f4\"/></picture></div></button></figure></span></div></div>",

Discovery was the loser.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a mild surprise, Netflix dropped out of the bidding late Thursday after Warner Bros. deemed superior the recent offer from Paramount Skydance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wall Street is thrilled and relieved about Netflix's financial discipline, with Netflix stock up 10% in after-hours trading to $93.39, after rising 2% in regular trading Thursday. The stock now has gained about 20% so far this week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Barron's argued in an articl e late last week that Wall Street would reward the losing bidder. \"Netflix stock could get a nice bump if it's topped by Paramount since Wall Street wishes it would give up its pursuit and focus on its dominant global streaming platform,\" Barron's wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The view among most Netflix investors was that company was overpaying with its original $82 billion offer for most of Warner Bros. Wall Street punished Netflix stock, which was above $100 when the deal was originally announced on Dec. 5. Netflix will now receive a $2.8 billion breakup fee.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We believe this is the best move for $NFLX shareholders and with the $2.8B termination fee for new content we believe NFLX stock can return to the $100/share level at which it was trading before its Dec. 5 bid for $WBD,' tweeted Gary Black, the managing partner of the Future Fund.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The original Netflix deal was dubious on several fronts. It would have paid a high price — 25 times projected 2026 ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) before synergies — for the Warner streaming and studio business when media valuations have collapsed with Disney valued at 10 times. It would have taken on $50 billion-plus of debt which could have crimped or eliminated stock repurchases for a few years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount now will prevail w ith its all-cash $31 a share offer for all of Warner Bros, a deal worth close to $80 billion plus the assumption of around $30 billion of Warner Bros. debt.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount stock is up 5% to $11.77 in after-hours trading while Warner Bros. stock is down 1.5% to $28.37.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount fans may view the deal as a win because the company didn't have to pay $33 a share or more to win Warner Bros as some expected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Warner Bros stock now trades at an 8% discount to the current deal value with Paramount hoping to close on the transaction in 2026. Look for takeover arbitrageurs to evaluate Warner Bros stock Friday given the fairly ample deal spread.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The betting markets lately have had Paramount as the slight favorite after it submitted its new offer, which topped its original offer of $30 a share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With its greater financial resources. Netflix could easily have won. It probably could have won the day by boosting its bid by just $1 to $2 a share. But the company chose to walk away.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here' s what Netflix said late Thursday: \"The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval. However, we've always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's stunning that Paramount was able to win the battle since its market value is just $12 billion against almost $400 billion for Netflix. It's almost unprecedented for such a small company to outbid a so much larger one for such a large asset.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Paramount victory is due to the willingness of Oracle chairman and billionaire Larry Ellison to backstop a big chunk of the deal and give his son David, the Paramount CEO, the prize he seeks. But Paramount will take on a lot of debt to get the deal done and that will put pressure on it to potentially slash costs at the combined company. Some have estimated that Paramount's debt after the deal will be about seven times its annual earnings before interest, taxes, deprecation and amortization (Ebitda) — double what most companies view as prudent.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is viewed as the most powerful man in Hollywood, and it's notable that he was willing to put the interests of Netflix investors over ego in letting the Ellisons win Warner.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
