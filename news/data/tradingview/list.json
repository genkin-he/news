The debt then reappears on the balance sheet a few days after quarter end, it added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Our key takeaway from this behavior is that distribution cuts are so worrisome that some bad actors are playing Enron-like accounting games,\" the letter said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The firms are using repo-like loans from one particular investment bank to mask debt, the letter says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rubric Capital did not name the bank nor the BDCs involved and Reuters was unable to independently verify whether this practice is being deployed and at what scale.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rubric Capital declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The private credit market has been gripped by anxiety in recent months since the bankruptcies of auto-parts maker First Brands and subprime lender Tricolor last year. The fallout has sharpened scrutiny of a market that has grown quickly, drawing large institutional investment and rising corporate lending in recent years. A renewed bout of uncertainty has flared up in recent weeks. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The BDC industry oversees over $300 billion in assets under management and accounts for roughly one quarter of direct lending in the U.S., according to a Bank for International Settlements note in July. The closed-end investment vehicles can be private or listed on stock exchanges.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Enron went bankrupt in 2001 after using off-balance-sheet vehicles and other accounting tricks to hide tens of billions of dollars of debt.    </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before starting Rubric, founder David Rosen worked for 10 years at Point72, formerly called SAC Capital, and began his career at the Blackstone Group in restructuring, according to a Morgan Stanley note from June. The firm as of May 2025, oversaw around $3 billion in assets, said Morgan Stanley.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>REDEMPTION FEAR</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Private credit defaults are reportedly between 3% and 5%, and signs of strain—such as interest paid-in-kind financing used to help troubled lenders meet their debt obligations—are nearing post-pandemic highs, according to UBS.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Privately traded BDCs require quarterly liquidity for investors but these funds limit the amount investors can redeem at 5%, the Rubric Capital letter added. If redemption requests reach 10% of net assets, investors can eventually become locked out of their money as the funds halt any further flows.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rising costs and an ever-present investor demand for distributions have put BDC managers under pressure, said Rubric Capital.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is leading to dodgy industry behavior with funds increasing leverage instead of taking their medicine and reducing distributions,\" said the hedge fund's letter.</span></p></span></div></div>",
