Originally mined by Hecla Mining Company from 1943-1945, the mine produced 55,656 tons grading 12.3% zinc, 0.36% copper, 0.48% lead, 3.75 oz/ton silver and 0.062 oz/ton gold. The property was later actively explored and advanced during 1980s and 1990s by Imperial Metals, Boliden and Lac Minerals (now Barrick).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since the new management team and board started in November 2024, Blue Moon has completed a modern review, verification, and analysis of the historical data, and in March 2025 published a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate and a preliminary economic assessment to support a mine restart, demonstrating potential for annual average production of 22,566 oz gold, 62.3M lbs of zinc, 681,784 oz silver and 7.2 Mlbs copper over a +10 year mine life (see press release dated March 3, 2025).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company received permits in April 2025 and began construction of an exploration decline on October 6, 2025.  The decline is progressing well with over 140 meters advanced to date and underground diamond drilling is underway in an effort to upgrade resources to reserves.  Production is forecasted to begin in 2028 and technical work is ongoing to support processing the material at Blue Moon's Springer complex in Nevada to produce copper and zinc concentrates with appreciable gold and silver by-product credits, as well as potentially a lead concentrate and clean pyrite and barite products.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By combining the Blue Moon Mine in California, with processing at the Springer Complex in Nevada and smelting of the zinc concentrate at Teck's Trail Operations in Canada, Blue Moon and Teck are building a fully integrated North American value chain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apex Mine, Utah (Germanium, Gallium, Copper)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apex is a historic underground mine in southwest Utah, which was previously mined for copper oxide, and later for Ge and Ga. This underground mine became the primary producer of gallium and germanium in the United States when Musto Explorations Ltd. brought it into production in the mid 1980's and again with Hecla Mining Company in the 1990's. During its peak year of operations, Apex produced 10,270 tons yielding 1,645 lb Ga, 5,634 lbs of Ge, and 224,800 lbs of Cu.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hecla completed a feasibility study in 1989, reporting a reserve of 230,200 tons of 0.100% Ge, 0.046% Ga and 1.6% Cu.  A historical reserve estimate(1) by Ken Krahulec in 2018 estimated 1 MT @ 0.087% Ge, 0.033% Ga, 1.8% Cu and 41 g/t Ag. The Ge and Ga are 10-100x higher grade than most Ge and Ga deposits, with in-situ value per ton similar to 0.5 oz/T gold ores. Beyond the historical reserves, Hecla also identified several additional breccia bodies as prospective exploration targets, including the Paymaster, Cavern, and 500 North pipes, along with further oxide zones in the immediate mine area.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(1) As at the date of this news release, a qualified person has not completed sufficient work to classify the historical estimates above as current mineral resources or mineral reserves in accordance with NI 43-101 and Blue Moon is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. In order to verify the historical estimates, the Company needs to engage a qualified person to review the historical data, review any work completed on the property since and complete a new technical report. Blue Moon views this historical data as an indicator of the potential size and grade of the mineralized deposits, and this data is relevant to Company's future plans with respect to the property.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Subject to renewed permits and with the intent to reopen the mine, the Company plans to fast track efforts to advance the technical studies, metallurgical testing, process flowsheets, permitting and community engagement to support a final investment decision. In parallel, Blue Moon is evaluating options for a new processing line at the Company's Springer complex to process the Apex material and provide an integrated United States Ge and Ga value chain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Springer Complex, Nevada (Multi-commodity Processing Hub)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Springer property is located on the east flank of the Eugene Mountains, approximately 25 miles southwest of the city of Winnemucca, and 125 miles northeast of the city of Reno, in Pershing County, Nevada. The mine site is approximately 8 miles from Interstate 80, serviced by paved/gravel road, over owned land. The Springer tungsten milling facility is located entirely on private fee lands.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Springer is a former tungsten production facility consisting of a 1,360-ft vertical shaft and underground workings, a 1,200 ton per day mill with automated rod/ball mill grinding and flotation circuits, plus all water rights, and most permits necessary for operation of the facility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Springer tungsten property was the site of continuous underground tungsten mining between 1918 and 1958, much of that time controlled first by the Segerstrom family, and later by the Nevada-Massachusetts Mining Company (\"NMC\"). The General Electric Company (\"GE\") acquired the property in the 1970's, interested in securing long term tungsten supply assets to support its lighting and industrial tools businesses. The current mine and mill were constructed by Utah International Inc. (\"UII\", later became BHP Minerals Group) for GE in the mid 1970's, and was subsequently commissioned and operated by GE for 8 months in 1982. The property has not been actively mined since October 1982, and the underground workings are currently flooded to a depth of approximately 375 feet. EMC Metals Corp. acquired the Springer mine and associated properties from GE in 2006. Between that purchase date and today, considerable refurbishment and renewal has been undertaken to the mill, control systems, hoist house, and an up-rating of the mill throughput from a nominal 950 tpd to a current 1,350 tpd capacity, and an estimated 1,200 tpd throughput after availabilities (89%).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Centrally located with access to diverse mineral sources and existing road and rail infrastructure, the Springer Mine and Mill is well situated to become a regional metallurgical complex. With established tailings and water management systems, the brownfield site provides significant opportunities to reduce capital and permitting timelines compared to a greenfield development.</span></p></span></div></div>",
