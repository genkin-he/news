            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>    Argentina’s Senate on Friday approved a labor reform backed by President Javier Milei, giving it final clearance to become law and landing the libertarian leader one of his most significant legislative wins. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Milei's administration argues the reform, which passed with 42 votes in favor, 28 against, and two abstentions, will spur investment and create formal jobs, while labor unions contend it weakens worker protections, including the right to strike.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The reform is expected to bolster investor confidence in Milei’s market-driven reforms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Passage of the bill is seen by analysts as a signal that Milei has the political backing to advance his broader free‑market agenda.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since taking office, Milei has stabilized the exchange rate and sharply cooled inflation, bringing monthly price increases down from double digits to 2.9% in January, gaining accolades from the International Monetary Fund.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of the bill's most contentious provisions establishes an employer-financed severance fund consisting of contributions currently earmarked for the national pension system. The change could make it easier for companies to lay off workers and opposition lawmakers say the fund would impact the pension system's resources.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The reform also relaxes hiring rules, changes the vacation system, allows the standard workday to be extended from eight to 12 hours, and permits salaries to be paid in foreign currency.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unions, which have mounted protests including a nationwide strike, object to new limits on the right to strike that require essential services to maintain minimum operations during work stoppages.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The labor reform is one of several legislative priorities for Milei’s administration. Lawmakers are also advancing changes to the law protecting Andean glaciers, a move the government says will unlock mining investment and which environmental groups strongly oppose.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jessica Toonkel, Joe Flint, Dave Michaels and Lauren Thomas</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For six months, the son of one of the world's richest men kept hearing the same unfamiliar word: No.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even before he closed a deal to combine his company with a much bigger one, David Ellison was already plotting to do it again. Once his Skydance Media took control of Paramount, he turned his attention to a Hollywood icon, launching an audacious takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery that would give the Ellison family control of a sprawling media empire.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>His first offer was swatted away. So were his second and third. By the time Ellison made his sixth offer, Warner Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav stopped responding to his texts. Even when Warner officially accepted a rival offer from Netflix, Ellison refused to take no for an answer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As the battle dragged on, Ellison sweetened his offers, ratcheted up the pressure, took the hostile bid directly to shareholders, threatened a bruising proxy fight, brought in President Trump allies to lobby, and treated the existing term sheet like paper waiting to be shredded.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the ninth offer, the wealth and influence of the Ellisons finally won.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The dramatic bidding war ended on Thursday night, after Paramount made its latest attempt to buy Warner for $81 billion — and Netflix walked away from the deal. Shortly after photographers snapped Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos leaving the White House, the company announced that it wouldn't match Ellison's latest offer, which was 63% higher than his first.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And once Netflix dropped its own $72 billion deal for Warner's studios and HBO Max streaming business, the scion of software billionaire Larry Ellison was poised to become one of the most powerful people in a town that once derided him as a nepo-baby.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ellison, 43 years old, as Paramount chief executive will now control much of our attention: the shows we watch, the news we consume and the screens we stare at all day long, with a family portfolio that will include HBO, CNN, CBS News, the historic Warner Bros. studio lot and crown jewels such as DC Comics and Harry Potter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As much as Ellison and his team had been telling anyone who would listen that his business would ultimately prevail in buying a company five times its size, the reaction on Friday from Hollywood to Washington to Wall Street was astonishment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount's stock price shot up over 20% on Friday. Netflix's surged nearly 14%. Politicians howled at the prospect of so much media power being consolidated in the hands of a single family. Thousands of employees across three companies were left wondering what comes next at a time when the future of the entertainment business has rarely been so uncertain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even the CEO at the center of the action said he was surprised by the ending.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We all thought it was going to be Netflix,\" Zaslav told staffers in a companywide town hall, adding that the speed of the drama \"feels a little whiplashy.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deal could take anywhere from six to 18 months to close. Ellison will need to cut a lot of costs to find $6 billion in savings to make the deal work. But that didn't stop Paramount's leadership from popping Champagne, which they drank out of paper cups, Thursday afternoon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Only days earlier Paramount was preparing its next move if it didn't win. It had a slate of director nominees lined up for a proxy fight and planned to submit them as soon as this past week if Warner refused to accept Paramount's latest, sweetened offer, according to people familiar with the matter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Late last Saturday night, Ellison called Zaslav with the structure of the deal that met Warner's demands. The duo talked again on Sunday and Monday as they scrambled to get as much settled as possible for a Monday midnight deadline to stop talking, people familiar with the matter said. Ellison promised his father would contribute additional funding to satisfy lenders, if needed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, Netflix executives were discussing standing down. Sarandos and fellow co-CEO Greg Peters had said they would be disciplined on price, and if Paramount was going to increase its offer to $31 a share plus add-ons, the company would likely bow out, said people familiar with the discussions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ellison began his quest in earnest with a September visit to Zaslav's Beverly Hills home, once owned by legendary Paramount studio chief Robert Evans. Ellison proposed a $19-per-share cash-and-stock bid for the company and followed up with a formal letter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Warner rejected the Ellison overture as inadequate, favoring Zaslav's existing plan to split the media and entertainment empire in two — one company for the movie and TV studios and HBO Max, the other containing TV networks including CNN and Food Network.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount made two more offers, at one point even offering Zaslav the opportunity to be co-chairman and co-CEO of the combined company with Ellison if a deal happened.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unpersuaded, Warner in October announced a strategic review, effectively setting up an auction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix's Sarandos had told associates that if Warner did go through with spinning off its cable networks, he wanted to make a play for the streaming and studio businesses, according to people familiar with the discussions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix executives internally have over the years discussed how M&amp;A might help the company grow, which would be a departure from its long-held preference for building rather than buying, said people close to the discussions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before Ellison bought Paramount, Netflix had approached former Paramount controlling shareholder Shari Redstone about buying the company's studio a number of times. But she didn't want to sell, according to people familiar with the situation. The company had also discussed bidding for MGM, said people familiar with the discussions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In November, Netflix offered to buy Warner's studios and HBO Max streaming business. So did Comcast.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In December, Ellison lobbed in his sixth bid, saying Paramount had offered a package that covered all the issues Warner had raised, including the need for \"strong cash value\" and \"speed to close.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Soon after, Warner declared Netflix victorious. It agreed to sell the key assets for $27.75 a share, or $72 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Three days later, Paramount announced it was taking a tender offer directly to shareholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As Ellison doubled down, Warner and Netflix signaled to the market that their deal was moving forward. Warner distributed photos of Zaslav walking the Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank with Sarandos and Peters, smiling in front of the studio's famed water tower. Paramount executives shared the photos among themselves, and some rolled their eyes over them, according to people close to the company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, Ellison was making inroads in Washington. He offered assurance to Trump administration officials that if he bought Warner, he'd make sweeping changes to CNN, a common target of President Trump's ire, The Wall Street Journal first reported.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Just days after going hostile, Ellison sat in President Trump's box at the Kennedy Center honors. Paramount chief legal officer Makan Delrahim, the former Trump Justice Department antitrust head, oversaw a lobbying campaign that encouraged Republican lawmakers and administration officials to question Netflix's bid. Delrahim himself ramped up the pressure, touting Paramount's messaging online and engaging in the deal talks, including by holding meetings with investors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For his part, Sarandos had been laying the groundwork for the Netflix deal for some time — going back and forth to D.C., said people familiar with the situation. Netflix had hired its own veteran of the first Trump administration, Clete Willems, who had a team of GOP advisers, including Kellyanne Conway and Brian Ballard.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix was working with a deficit of political support from the start, because they could not rely on Democrats, Hollywood's natural allies. Top Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) opposed the merger from the start.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In January, Ellison ramped up the pressure. Paramount threatened to run a proxy fight to secure seats on Warner's board and filed a lawsuit seeking to force Warner to release more information about its deal with Netflix.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix shareholders were steadily losing patience. The company had over $170 billion wiped off its market value since last September, when reports started to surface that it could be a potential bidder for Warner.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Senators from both major political parties grilled Sarandos at a February Judiciary Committee hearing, expressing concern about the market power of a Netflix-Warner tie-up. Sarandos said repeatedly that Netflix was committed to maintaining the Warner Bros. studio theatrical-movie business and planned to continue to operate itself and HBO Max as separate entities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The tide began to shift in Paramount's favor in mid-February. Paramount indicated to Warner that it would up its price to $31.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a key move that helped get Warner's attention, Paramount amended its proposal to add an unusual takeover provision, what it called a \"ticking fee\" of 25 cents a share, which it would pay to Warner shareholders for each quarter its deal hasn't closed, starting January 2027. Paramount said it would pay the $2.8 billion termination fee Warner would owe Netflix if that deal collapsed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix agreed to allow Warner to discuss Paramount's latest proposal during a seven-day negotiating period ending on Feb. 23, saying it would clear up the situation once and for all.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After the negotiating window ended, Warner's board said it determined that Paramount's newest offer could reasonably be expected to lead in a deal superior to its existing one with Netflix. In addition to raising the price to $31 a share, Paramount increased its regulatory termination fee to $7 billion and accelerated the ticking fee to start after Sept. 30 rather than next year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the days before Paramount's revised bid was submitted, Netflix executives discussed walking away instead of continuing the bidding war, according to people close to the discussions.</span></p></span></div></div>",

So they might run an asset like MSFT or BTC 2% in a weak market to trigger stops, then a few seconds or minutes later, the price is mostly back to where it was before.” In his telling, that is still manipulation, but it is not the same as structurally pinning Bitcoin below some imagined fair value for months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That argument lands against a more conspiratorial narrative now circulating online, why Bitcoin is not already at $150,000. Paul’s pushback does not deny that large Wall Street firms can shape short-term trading conditions. It rejects the stronger claim that such activity is the central explanation for Bitcoin’s broader price path.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paul’s core point was much less dramatic. “Why is BTC down? Because OGs sold tens of thousands of coins, and not enough people wanted to buy them.” That line closely matched the view from renowned on-chain analyst James Check, who argued that “Jane Street didn’t suppress the Bitcoin price” and that “HODLers all did,” by selling large amounts of spot into the market.</span></p><div class=\"container-n2KCMK3i\" data-qa-id=\"tweet-widget-container\"><blockquote class=\"blockquote-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"header-n2KCMK3i\"><span class=\"profile-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"avatar-n2KCMK3i\"></div><div class=\"name-n2KCMK3i\">_Checkmate 🟠🔑⚡☢️🛢️</div><div class=\"username-n2KCMK3i\">@_Checkmatey_</div></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"logo-n2KCMK3i\" role=\"img\"><svg height=\"28\" viewbox=\"0 0 28 28\" width=\"28\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M19.75 5h3.07l-6.7 7.62L24 23h-6.17l-4.84-6.3L7.46 23H4.4l7.17-8.16L4 5h6.33l4.37 5.75L19.75 5Zm-1.24 16h1.7L9.54 7H7.7l10.8 14Z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path></svg></span></div><div class=\"description-n2KCMK3i\"><p class=\"\"><span>Jane Street didn't suppress the Bitcoin price folks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>HODLers all did.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's just not that hard, stop summoning your inner salty goldbug but blaming manipulators.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>People.

However, you do not need that as the central argument to explain why the price didn’t go higher, nor why it went lower. That can be well and truly explained by looking at spot sell-side.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paul did leave room for exceptions. He wrote that there are rare cases where Wall Street manipulates an asset in major ways over a longer period, but said those cases are uncommon because they are risky and harder to profit from than people assume.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“There are rare exceptions where Wall Street manipulates an asset in major ways longer term, but this is quite rare because it’s very risky and not as easy as it looks to profit. 99% of the time that an asset isn’t moving like you want and people are crying “manipulation”, it’s best to embrace the cognitive dissonance, avoid the “easy way out” of blaming manipulation,” Paul wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That leaves the current Jane Street argument in a narrower frame. Yes, large firms can influence intraday flows, liquidity, and execution quality. But based on Paul’s account, that is a long way from proving that one market maker is the reason Bitcoin is not trading materially higher.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notably, the Jane Street theory picked up fresh attention after Terraform Labs’ wind-down administrator sued the firm in Manhattan federal court, alleging insider trading tied to Terra’s 2022 collapse. The complaint says Jane Street used a private chat called “Bryce’s Secret” to obtain non-public information and alleges an 85 million UST trade on Curve that helped trigger a selloff; Jane Street has denied wrongdoing and called the case opportunistic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At press time, BTC traded at $66,090.</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:588.28125px;max-width:1200px;aspect-ratio:2.039840637450199\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:2f5df22bf094b-64b3eaa3d5891e699b4d6afc44491007-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"Bitcoin price chart\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:2f5df22bf094b-64b3eaa3d5891e699b4d6afc44491007-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#f5f4f4\"/></picture></div></button></figure></span></div></div>",

PAUL, Minn., Feb. 27, 2026 /PRNewswire/ — Today, St. Paul-based AgriBank announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2025, with strong profitability, credit quality, and liquidity and capital.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Highlights:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Profitability: Net income remained strong at $1.0 billion for the year   ended December 31, 2025. AgriBank's year-to-date return on assets (ROA)   ratio of 52 basis points was slightly above the target of 50 basis   points.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Credit quality: Total loan portfolio credit quality remained strong, with   99.2 percent of loans classified as acceptable at December 31, 2025.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Liquidity and capital: End-of-the-quarter liquidity was 147 days, well   above the regulatory requirement. Capital also remained well above the   regulatory minimums and company targets. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>\"AgriBank delivered another year of strong financial results in 2025, reflecting disciplined growth, prudent balance--sheet management, and the underlying strength of our District,\" said AgriBank CEO Jeffrey Swanhorst. \"Higher net interest income was driven by favorable retail loan spreads and increased wholesale loan volume, while credit quality, capital, and liquidity remained strong. Together, these factors position AgriBank to continue providing reliable funding and financial solutions to our Farm Credit Association--owners as they support farmers, ranchers, and rural communities through challenging economic and market conditions.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2025 Results of Operations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net interest income was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2025, an increase of $143.8 million, or 13.5 percent, compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher spread income on retail loans in AgriBank's asset pool portfolio and on AgriBank's wholesale loan portfolio due to an increase in volume. These factors were somewhat offset by decreased spread income on investment securities due to the mix of investment securities. The benefit of equity financing in net interest income increased compared to the prior year, due to higher levels of equity partially offset by a decline in interest rates. Equity financing represents the benefit of non-interest bearing funding. With interest rates moving lower during the second half of 2025, opportunities were taken to call and refinance debt at lower levels. While some loans have followed this pattern, the repricing or conversion of loans has been slower, resulting in wider retail interest rate spreads.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-interest income was $113.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2025, an increase of $5.0 million, or 4.6 percent, compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily related to an increase in loan fees due to marginally higher conversion and commitment fees generating additional income during the year. The increase in non-interest income was partially offset by the reduction in mineral income related to lower oil prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-interest expense was $235.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2025, an increase of $19.1 million, or 8.8 percent, compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase was mainly due to dealer incentive expenses related to AgriBank's crop input financing portfolio. Loan servicing expense increased due to asset pool activity during 2025 and the second half of 2024. Additionally, contractor fees added to increased purchased services expense related to additional resources for technology projects during the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Loan Portfolio</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total loans were $177.9 billion at December 31, 2025, an increase of $13.2 billion, or 8.0 percent, compared to December 31, 2024. This increase was primarily attributable to wholesale loan growth and increases in retail loans from expanded participation in asset pool programs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AgriBank's credit quality reflects the overall financial strength of District Associations and their underlying portfolios of retail loans. AgriBank's portfolio was composed of 99.2 percent acceptable loans at December 31, 2025, compared to 99.4 percent at December 31, 2024. Loans classified as acceptable represent the highest-quality assets. The credit quality of AgriBank's retail loan portfolio decreased slightly to 94.9 percent classified as acceptable at December 31, 2025, compared to 95.7 percent acceptable at December 31, 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Agricultural Conditions</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On February 5, 2026, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS) released its initial forecast of the U.S. aggregate farm income and financial conditions for 2026 and updated its 2025 forecast. The revised 2025 net farm income forecast of $154.5 billion represents a $27.0 billion increase from the 2024 level, up 21.2 percent, driven by increasing direct government payments and animal and animal product cash receipts, which more than offset rising expenses. When adjusting for inflation, the 2025 net farm income forecast is $28.4 billion, or 22.0 percent, above the 10-year average (2015-2024) net farm income in 2026 dollars. The initial 2026 net farm income projection of $153.4 billion represents a decrease of $1.2 billion, or 0.7 percent, from the revised 2025 net farm income forecast, and if realized, would be $24.3 billion, or 18.8 percent, above the 10-year average net farm income in 2026 dollars.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many factors, including weather, trade, government and monetary policy, global agricultural production levels, and pathogenic outbreaks in livestock and poultry, may keep agriculture market volatility elevated. Implementation of cost-saving technologies, marketing methods, and risk management strategies will continue to cause a wide range of results among the respective agricultural producers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Capital Resources and Liquidity</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total capital remained strong at $10.5 billion as of December 31, 2025, an increase of $1.0 billion compared to December 31, 2024. The increase was driven by AgriBank's strong net income and the issuance of capital stock, which were partially offset by cash patronage declared, consistent with AgriBank's capital plan. AgriBank exceeded all regulatory capital minimum requirements, including additional regulatory buffers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $25.4 billion and $25.1 billion at December 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. AgriBank's end-of-the-period liquidity position represented 147 days coverage of maturing debt obligations, which supports operational demands, and was well above the 90-day minimum established by AgriBank's regulator.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About AgriBank</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AgriBank is part of the customer-owned, nationwide Farm Credit System.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Ethereum is attempting to stabilize around the $2,000 level as the broader crypto market shows tentative signs of relief. After weeks of persistent pressure, price action has paused its decline, but sentiment remains fragile. The recent rebound has helped ease immediate downside momentum, yet the technical structure still reflects a market recovering from significant damage rather than entering a confirmed uptrend.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to a CryptoQuant analyst, Ethereum endured a severe liquidation-driven sell-off in recent weeks, falling sharply from local highs near $3,300 to lows around the $1,850 region. The intensity of this move becomes particularly evident when analyzing the Net Taker Volume (30-day moving average), a metric that measures aggressive market order activity. In February, this indicator plunged to its most negative level since last November, highlighting the dominance of aggressive sellers during the decline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Such extreme negative readings typically reflect panic-driven execution rather than orderly repositioning. When taker volume skews heavily to the sell side, it often signals forced exits, stop-outs, and cascading liquidations across derivatives markets. While Ethereum’s attempt to hold $2,000 suggests that immediate selling pressure may be easing, the underlying data confirms that the market recently absorbed one of its most intense bouts of downside aggression in months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Net Taker Volume Signals Capitulation — But Not Confirmation</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The dominance of towering red bars in Ethereum’s Net Taker Volume underscores how aggressively sellers controlled the order books during the recent decline. When taker sell orders consistently exceed taker buy orders by such a magnitude, it reflects urgency. This is not passive distribution; it is market participants hitting bids aggressively, often under stress. The combination of panic-driven exits, systematic short positioning, and forced long liquidations likely amplified the move from $3,300 to sub-$1,900 levels.</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1066.6666666666667px;aspect-ratio:1.7777777777777777\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:79f6a2c4f094b-bca6a7701b37dfb33c5bfa7c53921e16-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"Ethereum NetTakerVolume | Source: CryptoQuant\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:79f6a2c4f094b-bca6a7701b37dfb33c5bfa7c53921e16-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#f6eae7\"/></picture></div></button></figure><p class=\"\"><span>Notably, the only meaningful cluster of green bars — representing aggressive buying — emerged in mid-January, coinciding with Ethereum’s local peak near $3,400. That brief resurgence in demand failed to sustain itself, after which sell-side momentum reasserted control. Structurally, this pattern suggests that upside liquidity was exhausted before a broader deleveraging cycle unfolded.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Extreme negative Net Taker Volume readings are often associated with capitulation phases. Historically, such flushes can mark exhaustion points, as aggressive sellers eventually deplete themselves. However, capitulation alone does not confirm reversal. For a structural shift to materialize, the imbalance must normalize. A contraction in red bars followed by sustained green dominance would signal renewed conviction from aggressive buyers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Ethereum Struggles To Reclaim $2,000 As Downtrend Persists</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ethereum remains structurally weak despite brief stabilization attempts near the $2,000 level. The chart shows a clear breakdown from the $3,400–$3,600 region earlier this year, followed by a sequence of lower highs and lower lows — a textbook downtrend formation. The recent bounce has not altered this structure.</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:886.5979381443299px;aspect-ratio:1.4776632302405497\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:79f6a2c4f094b-46913d8cb5e6211c1027734b57be8218-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"ETH consolidates in a critical price level | Source: ETHUSDT chart on TradingView\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:79f6a2c4f094b-46913d8cb5e6211c1027734b57be8218-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#1a1e29\"/></picture></div></button></figure><p class=\"\"><span>Price is currently trading below the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages, all of which are sloping downward.

Since then, volume has moderated during consolidation, indicating that while panic may have eased, conviction among buyers remains limited.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Technically, $2,000 functions as a psychological pivot rather than confirmed support.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Richard Florida</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Google co-founder Larry Page recently made headlines by spending $188 million on three Miami mansions. He's not the only billionaire looking at a big move: His Google co-founder Sergey Brin is reportedly shopping for Miami property. So is WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The shopping spree comes as California considers a wealth tax to impose a one-time retroactive levy on billionaires that has fueled speculation that they have had it with the Golden State. In New York City, where Mayor Zohran Mamdani earlier this month proposed an increase in taxes on high-income people — and short of that, a property tax increase — there is talk of a parallel exodus.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The wealthy have long threatened to leave when battling local governments over taxes. In the past, they rarely did. But their threats have teeth this time — not because they are abandoning great cities, but because they have figured out they don't have to. Now that digital technology allows them to separate where they live and pay taxes from where their businesses operate, they aren't relocating their companies. They are relocating themselves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This upends the basic arrangement that underwrote great cities — what they are, how they work and who pays for them. Amid this seismic shift looms an existential question: Can those cities survive without them?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For most of history, people lived where they worked — on the farm, above the shop, close to the factory. Suburbanization expanded the radius, but workers, managers and executives still had to be close to where jobs concentrated. Because people had to be there, cities could charge a premium. Residents paid it in housing costs, in taxes and in the costs of commuting or other frictions of day-to-day life. The alternative — living elsewhere — meant being cut off from their livelihoods and economic opportunity. Taxes were part of that price, and people paid because they had no choice.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When Covid hit, this social compact appeared to quake. A chorus of commentators predicted the imminent collapse of New York, London, San Francisco and other great global cities. They predicted the wealthy and their companies would be driven out by lockdowns, governance failures, crime and the sudden possibility of remote work. The cities, as a result, would hollow out.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There seemed to be something to it — at first. Ken Griffin relocated himself and the headquarters of his Citadel hedge fund from Chicago to Miami. The venture capitalists Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois bought homes in Miami Beach and opened an office for their venture capital fund in Miami, too. Jeff Bezos moved from Seattle to Miami, assembling a $200 million plus compound.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the predicted total exodus never fully materialized.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many of those who moved to Miami quickly came face to face with its limits. Public and private schools couldn't match what they had left behind. Housing costs rose astronomically — making Miami now one of the most unaffordable markets in the country.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most critically, they found it hard to recruit top talent. New York and London remained the centers of global finance. San Francisco remained the center for high technology, with the lion's share of venture capital investment to AI startups still flowing into the Bay Area.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2023, Thiel admitted as much, conceding that the tech industry remained densely concentrated in California and that Miami's housing costs had put the city out of reach for much of the talent he needed — making it far harder to move companies and their people than he initially thought. Griffin himself ended up building a massive new building in New York even as Citadel expanded in Miami.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But eventually they realized they didn't have to move their companies at all. Digital technology enabled them to live in one place and keep their business in another. They could establish residency in Miami, which requires no particular time spent there to claim residency status, and spend much of the year wherever else they wanted — flying into New York or San Francisco for what mattered. The city where their businesses are headquartered became just that — not somewhere they needed to reside and pay taxes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That has transformed the underlying economic logic of cities. They are no longer self-contained economic units. Digital technology is remaking them into networks — physical places connected by virtual ties and dynamic talent flows.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Economic participation now happens across places, not within them. My own research has documented the rise of what I call lifestyle tax havens — cities such as Miami, Dubai and Singapore that combine low or no income taxes with warm weather, luxury amenities and easy access to global networks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These lifestyle tax havens do not replace the great hubs. They are satellites in their orbit, part of the networks that form around them. Miami is a critical node in New York's financial network. Austin operates as a satellite of San Francisco's tech network. Dubai plays a similar role for London and the financial centers of Europe and Asia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Billionaires make headlines, but the same math applies down the economic ladder. For a high earner, a move from San Francisco, Los Angeles or New York to Miami could save 10 to 14 percentage points on income tax, based on current rates. For a professional couple earning $1 million a year, that is roughly $100,000 to $140,000 annually — adding up to more than $1 million over a decade. This is a simplification, of course — certainly, taxes can be complicated by write offs and different income types. But the income-tax rates paint a clear picture.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But what becomes of cities that are lifestyle tax havens?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They were never built to scale in the way older cities have. In the old urban system, people were anchored to place. That anchoring did more than generate tax revenue. It created loyalty, civic investment and philanthropy — the long-term commitment that built private schools, museums, hospitals, universities and cultural institutions. When people stayed, they fixed what was broken because they had no alternative.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The lifestyle tax havens often lack the civic commitment that allowed places like New York, London, Paris or Chicago to grow into fuller-spectrum cities. Places like Miami lack the integrated infrastructure and public systems, and as population and activity increase, everyday urban functions become harder to manage. Moving around becomes increasingly difficult. Housing costs rise rapidly. Schools and public services struggle to keep pace. These are not temporary growing pains. They are structural limits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The model works well enough for wealthy residents who can buy private solutions — housing, education, transportation, security. For empty-nesters and young professionals without children, the trade-offs may be manageable. For families, they are far more consequential. And for service workers — the people who staff hospitals, schools, restaurants and local government — the barriers are often insurmountable. When the people who make a city run cannot afford to live there, the city itself begins to fray.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is the dynamic the economist Albert Hirschman warned about: That loyalty is what turns frustration into voice — the impulse to fix what is broken rather than flee. Today, exit is cheap and reversible. When taxes rise or services disappoint, the response is no longer to press for reform but to move.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cities, then, are pushed toward a race to the bottom — not one driven by ideology, but by mobility. As high earners leave the tax base without leaving the economy, cities face pressure to lower taxes without lowering obligations. The burden of funding schools, transit, parks and public safety shifts to those who remain. Established cities and rising stars alike are caught in this trap.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cities cannot simply chase mobile residents by cutting taxes. That is a losing game. National governments are unlikely to solve this problem, and in any case it plays out at a global scale. Cities will have to respond on their own by rethinking what they tax. If income and wealth can move, cities must focus on what cannot: land and property, consumption and entertainment, visitors and tourism, commuters and employment, companies that operate locally and anchor institutions that are rooted in place.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For decades, great cities benefited from a relatively captive tax base. That constraint has now weakened — and in many cases, it has been broken. Cities can respond to this new competition, or they can choose not to. But they cannot opt out.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>--</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Richard Florida is a Distinguished Visiting Professor at Vanderbilt University, a University Professor at the University of Toronto, and a Distinguished Fellow at The Kresge Foundation.

Guidance incorporates assumptions of stable or improving operator performance and no major disruptions, consistent with disclosure standards under NI 51-102 and, where applicable, National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") for technical information.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Attributable Gold Equivalent Ounces (GEOs)</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a royalty and streaming company focused on precious metals, the Company's performance is inherently tied to production volumes and metal prices, which are volatile; accordingly, emphasis is placed on attributable gold equivalent ounces (\"GEOs\") sales as a primary metric to reflect production exposure. For streams, guidance reflects GEOs that have been delivered from the operators of our assets. Our GEO deliveries may differ from operators' production based on timing of deliveries and due to recovery and payability factors. GEO sales may differ from GEO deliveries based on the timing of the sales. For royalties, GEO guidance reflects the timing of royalty payments or accruals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Empress expects attributable GEOs of 7,045 to 7,430 for fiscal 2026. This range represents the Company's diversified exposure across gold and silver calculated using conservative conversion ratios based on assumed commodity prices of $4,000/oz gold and $70/oz silver. GEOs are emphasized as the core metric, as they directly reflect the underlying production from operators and reduce dependency on volatile spot prices for performance evaluation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Assumptions and Basis for Guidance</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The 2026 Guidance is based on public and non-public forecasts, other disclosure by the owners and operators of our assets, internal analysis of historical performance, and management's understanding of the underlying producing assets. Additionally, the Company may receive information from the owners and operators of the properties, which the Company is not permitted to disclose to the public pursuant to the underlying agreement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Key assumptions include:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Annual increases in revenue if metals prices continue to be in the range of $4,000oz gold and $70/oz silver, and/or operating improvements are made at the underlying assets, and/or additional assets are added to the stream and royalty portfolio;</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Production estimates reliant on operator guidance under NI 43-101-compliant reports and other non-public technical information and no material production interruptions;</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>No major new acquisitions or divestitures beyond those already announced, though the Company continues to actively evaluate opportunities; and</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Currency exchange rates and tax considerations consistent with current levels.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Sensitivity</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The success of the Company in 2025 was based on a small number of investments and a significant increasing trend in gold and silver prices. There is no guarantee that this trend will continue in 2026. Given the volatile nature of gold and silver markets, an increase or decrease in gold or silver prices could impact attributable GEO values and related revenue considerably.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Risks and Uncertainties</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Achievement of this guidance is subject to various risks, including but not limited to commodity price volatility (a primary concern given the small number of investments), operator-specific challenges (e.g., production delays), geopolitical factors, and environmental considerations. These could result in actual GEOs and revenues varying from the provided guidance, potentially materially. Investors should refer to the cautionary statements contained at the end of this news release, and the full discussion of risks in the Company's 2025 Annual Information Form filed on www.sedarplus.ca.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Conclusion and Updates</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Empress continues to implement its stated strategy of building a diversified, cash-flowing portfolio to deliver sustainable value to shareholders. The Company will review and update this outlook quarterly or as material events occur, such as new acquisitions, significant operator announcements, or commodity price shifts.

There can be no assurance that forward-looking information and statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or intended. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information and statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or reissue forward-looking information as a result of new information or events except as required by applicable securities laws. Disclosure relating to properties in which Empress holds royalty or stream interests is based on information publicly disclosed by the owners or operators of such properties. The Company generally has limited or no access to the properties underlying its interests and is largely dependent on the disclosure of the operators of its interests and other publicly available information. The Company generally has limited or no ability to verify such information. Although the Company does not have any knowledge that such information may not be accurate, there can be no assurance that such third-party information is complete or accurate. In addition, certain information publicly reported by operators may relate to a larger property than the area covered by the Company's interest, which often may only apply to a portion of the overall project area or applicable mineral resources or reserves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>SOURCE:</span></strong><span> Empress Royalty Corp.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire</span></p></span></div></div>",

Victoria is the largest gold producing state in Australia, has produced 33% of all gold mined in Australia in history, and currently has 13 goldfields that have each produced over 1 million ounces of gold.(2) </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Steiglitz Project covers Exploration Licence (\"EL\") 6164, encompassing 53 km² across 51 graticular sections. The Steiglitz Project lies in the Bendigo Zone of the Lachlan Fold Belt, host to world-class Fosterville gold deposits. Gold mineralization at Steiglitz occurs as earlier mesozonal quartz veins overprinted by later epizonal quartz veins in tightly folded Ordovician turbidites and is expressed in two principal styles: </span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Numerous high-grade, gold-antimony-arsenic mineralized narrow quartz veins striking north-south parallel to regional folding; and </span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Stockwork zones associated with the northeast striking Hanover Fault, a mineralized shear zone bearing gold-antimony-arsenic assemblages. </span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Both styles of deposits have evidence of epizonal orogenic mineralization due to their gold and antimony association, quartz vein textures and also due to the regional structural geology setting being due south of Agnico-Eagle's epizonal orogenic high grade Fosterville gold mine hosting 1.7 million ounces gold (Proven &amp; Probable Reserves), 1.5 million ounces gold (Measured &amp; Indicated Resources), and 1.8 million ounces (Inferred Resources) in resources.(3)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Steiglitz was a top-ten producer in the historic Bendigo belt, yielding approximately 250,800 oz of gold at a recovered grade of 38 g/t Au between 1855 and 1911.(4) The Steiglitz Project area includes numerous past-producing mines - Alliance, Hanover, and North Birmingham, which operated to relatively shallow depths. The deepest mine was North Birmingham with a shaft to 233m depth, while other mines were generally less than 100m depth, which makes for a set of attractive exploration drilling targets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Modern exploration has included soil and rock-chip geochemistry, IP geophysics, LiDAR, limited RC and diamond drilling (5 holes), and geological mapping. Work to date highlights multiple untested targets along both the Hanover Shear Zone and the north-south vein corridor, with strong gold-arsenic-antimony signatures typical of the region's premier gold systems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About the Pheasant Creek Project</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition to the Steiglitz Project, as part of the Transaction, the Company has an application for an exploration license on the Pheasant Creek Project, which is not a material property for the Company. The Pheasant Creek Project is located approximately 75 km northeast of Melbourne in Victoria State, Australia. The large 232 km2 project is comprised of Exploration Licence 008776. The Pheasant Creek Project occurs within the Melbourne Zone of the Lachlan Fold Belt, which is composed of Siluro-Devonian sediments and Mid-Devonian granitic intrusions. The Pheasant Creek Project lies immediately south of, and in similar geology to, the Sunday Creek discovery of Southern Cross Gold (market capitalization: C$2.8 billion(1)), which is an outcropping orogenic or epizonal dyke-hosted deposit. Southern Cross has drilled 220 holes over 97,553m (as at August 31, 2025) and is allocating A$60 million over a 200,000m drill program to the Sunday Creek Project. At Sunday Creek, there are 75 intersections &gt;50-100 g/t AuEq x width in metres and 70 individual intersections exceeding 100 g/t AuEq x metres, which are globally leading hit rates (as at August 31, 2025).(5) </span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:663.0857142857143px;aspect-ratio:1.1051428571428572\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tmx_newsfile:ef9a87ff4094b-1c293bc4ee70846b49369b79cf336bf1-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tmx_newsfile:ef9a87ff4094b-1c293bc4ee70846b49369b79cf336bf1-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#faf0e2\"/></picture></div></button></figure><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Figure 1 -
