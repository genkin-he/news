            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>OTTAWA, ON, Feb. 27, 2026 /CNW/ - Northern Shield Resources Inc. (\"Northern Shield\" or the \"Company\") </span><span> is pleased to announce that through map staking, option agreements and property purchase, the Company has increased its land position from 32 km(2) to 420 km(2) pursuant to definitive agreements entered into with arm's length parties on February 18, 2026 (collectively, the \"Definitive Agreements\"). The Company's flagship Root &amp; Cellar Gold-Silver-Tellurium-Copper Property (\"Root &amp; Cellar\" or the \"Property\"), on the Burin Peninsula in southeastern Newfoundland, forms the core of the land position. Recent work at Root &amp; Cellar, suggests a large, diatreme/porphyry-hosted, polymetallic Cu-Au-Ag-Te-Mo zone, which was the impetus for the land acquisitions in the Avalon Zone of eastern Newfoundland.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The most significant of these new properties is the 212 km(2) Fortune Property (Figure 1) composed of two property options totalling 65 km(2) , with the remainder having been map staked directly by Northern Shield. The Fortune Property covers a 40 km trend that is highly prospective for porphyry copper and epithermal gold systems, and includes multiple indications of such systems including 4 known occurrences:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stewart: The Stewart prospect represents the most aerially extensive and continuous zone of exposed alteration on the Burin Peninsula, reaching widths of up to 850 m and extending along strike for upwards of 4 km (Figure 2a). It represents an extensive zone of advanced argillic alteration including pyrophyllite, alunite and vuggy quartz, interpreted to be a lithocap to a porphyry Cu-Mo-Au system. The lithocap is anomalous in gold, copper and molybdenum over significant intervals including historical surface trenching results of 0.09 g/t Au over 219 m, (Dyke, B., 2008,) and a drill intercept of 0.13 g/t Au over 111 m (Setterfield, T., 2016,) along with anomalous Cu and Mo.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Forty Creek: The Forty Creek intermediate sulphidation quartz vein is along strike from Stewart and hosts gold and silver tellurides with values up to 59 g/t Au and 2,290 g/t Ag (Setterfield, T. 2011). (Figure 2b) and grab samples with values to 0.16% Cu and 0.1 g/t Au in a nearby silicified pyrophyllite alteration zone.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Point Rosie: Hosts multiple quartz-sericite-pyrite (phyllic) alteration zones consistent with epithermal and porphyry copper systems over a 4 km strike length. Copper-gold-silver anomalous quartz veins (Figure 2c) with values up to 0.67 g/t Au and 0.65% Cu (Noel, N., 2020) have recently been discovered within a 2.5 km gold-in-soil anomaly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Feeder Brook: Hosts multiple quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration zones with grab samples values to 0.9 g/t Au (Dimmell, P., 2003). Nearby till samples collected by the Geological Survey of Newfoundland and Labrador are anomalous in porphyry copper pathfinder elements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some of the assay certificates for the results mentioned have been reviewed by Northern Shield while others have not, and Northern Shield is relying on third party assessment reports filed with the Newfoundland and Labrador government for the values quoted. None of the samples were collected or assayed by Northern Shield and hence cannot be fully and independently verified by the Company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company has also acquired 3 claim groups totalling 136 km(2) on the Cape St Mary's Peninsula across Placentia Bay from Root &amp; Cellar. The primary target is a porphyry copper system similar to Root &amp; Cellar based on Cu and Mo anomalous till samples reported by the Geological Survey of Newfoundland and Labrador and description of \"malachite-stained quartz stockwork veining\" in the government's mineral occurrence database. Some of the tills are also highly anomalous in nickel and cobalt and since gabbroic rocks are reported from the area, the claims will also be targeted for magmatic Ni-Cu-Co sulphides.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We are very excited about these new land positions. We see growing interest in the porphyry copper potential of the Burin Peninsula as we uncover more mineralization at the Creston Copper Target. As such these new properties cement our \"first mover status\" and allow us to use the knowledge we have gained from Root &amp; Cellar to our advantage. We haven't just amalgamated a prospective land position but amalgamated, incentivized, and mobilised some of the most experienced and tenacious prospectors in the region. They are our first asset and, collectively, have seen more rocks on the Burin than anybody. I have little doubt that they will have success in finding new mineralization in the spring.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- Ian Bliss, President and CEO, Northern Shield</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Definitive Agreements</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Point Rosie/Feeder Brook</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the Point Rosie/Feeder Brook Option Agreement (the \"Point Rosie Agreement\"), the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Seabourne Resources Inc.

By its terms, the Company will pay $13,835 in cash and issue 650,000 common shares (\"Common Shares\") on signing pursuant to the Point Rosie Agreement, and issue up to an aggregate of up to 2,650,000 Common Shares and pay, in aggregate, $153, 835 over a four-year period thereafter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stewart/Forty Creek</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the Stewart Option Agreement (the \"Stewart Agreement\"), the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Seabourne, acquired the right to earn up to an undivided 100% interest in Stewart Property located in Newfoundland. By its terms, the Company will pay $6,755 in cash and issue 400,000 Common Shares on signing pursuant to the Stewart Agreement, and issue up to an aggregate of up to 2,900,000 Common Shares and pay, in aggregate, $146,775 over a four-year period thereafter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kelstone</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the Kelstone Purchase Agreement (the \"APA\"), the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Seabourne, acquired two Mining Claims located near Marystown, Newfoundland in exchange for $1,500 in aggregate cash consideration and the issuance of 400,000 Common Shares on signing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are no yearly expenditure requirements other than those required for assessment purposes to keep the Mining Claims in good standing. The properties underlying the Definitive Agreements are subject to a royalty in the amount of 2.0% Net Smelter Returns; provided that the Company shall have, under each respective Definitive Agreement, the pre-emptive right at any time and from time to time prior to commencement of commercial production to buy-down the royalty from 2.0% to 1.0% for $1,500,000.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Closing of transactions underlying the Definitive Agreements are subject to certain customary conditions, including, without limitation, approval of the TSX Venture Exchange (the \"TSXV\"), and all of the securities issued under the Definitive Agreements will be subject to a four-month and one-day statutory hold period in accordance with applicable securities laws.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The scientific and technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Christine Vaillancourt, P.

We implement a model driven exploration approach to reduce the risk associated with early-stage projects for ourselves, our shareholders, and the environment. This approach led us to option the Root &amp; Cellar Property from a Newfoundland prospector, who discovered the copper mineralization, and then to its advancement to the large gold-silver-tellurium and porphyry copper system that it has become.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>References </span><br/><span>Dimmell, P., 2003, First Year Assessment Report, Western </span><br/><span> Feeder Property. </span><br/><span>Dyke, B., 2008.

Specifically, we make use of the non-GAAP financial measures \"Adjusted EBITDA,\" \"non-GAAP coal revenues,\" \"non-GAAP cost of coal sales,\" and \"non-GAAP coal margin.\" In addition to net income (loss), we use Adjusted EBITDA to measure the operating performance of our reportable segment. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or any other measure of operating results, financial performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, this measure is not calculated identically by all companies and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it is a useful indicator of the financial performance of our coal operations. We use non-GAAP coal revenues to present coal revenues generated, excluding freight and handling fulfillment revenues. Non-GAAP coal sales realization per ton for our operations is calculated as non-GAAP coal revenues divided by tons sold. We use non-GAAP cost of coal sales to adjust cost of coal sales to remove freight and handling costs, depreciation, depletion and amortization - production (excluding the depreciation, depletion and amortization related to selling, general and administrative functions), accretion on asset retirement obligations, amortization of acquired intangibles, and idled and closed mine costs. Non-GAAP cost of coal sales per ton for our operations is calculated as non-GAAP cost of coal sales divided by tons sold. Non-GAAP coal margin per ton for our coal operations is calculated as non-GAAP coal sales realization per ton for our coal operations less non-GAAP cost of coal sales per ton for our coal operations. The presentation of these measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. The definition of these non-GAAP measures may be changed periodically by management to adjust for significant items important to an understanding of operating trends and to adjust for items that may not reflect the trend of future results by excluding transactions that are not indicative of our core operating performance. Furthermore, analogous measures are used by industry analysts to evaluate the Company's operating performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate, capital investments and other factors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Included below are reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.</span></p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><span> </span><br/><span>                                 ALPHA METALLURGICAL RESOURCES, INC.
