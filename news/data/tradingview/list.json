Building on the strategic partnership announced last year, Nokia and NVIDIA are working with leading operators, including BT, Elisa, NTT DOCOMO and Vodafone Group to adopt AI-RAN technologies that enhance network performance and support the explosive growth in mobile AI traffic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“AI is the new workload reshaping networks. That shift requires architectural change across every layer — including the radio. AI-RAN transforms RAN into a software-driven platform optimized for AI, and with NVIDIA and a growing ecosystem of partners we are progressing from validation to commercial deployment. This is a foundational step toward AI-native networks and 6G,” said Justin Hotard, President and CEO, Nokia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“The telecommunications industry is at a turning point. Instead of upgrading networks in big, hardware-heavy cycles, we now have the opportunity to build them as fully software-driven systems,” said Ronnie Vasishta, Senior Vice President of Telecommunications at NVIDIA. “By running AI and radio access networks on the same accelerated computing platform, we make sure the network supports business needs — not the other way around. Physical AI requires an intelligent network underpinned by AI‑RAN so operators can fully harness distributed intelligence across every layer of the network. Our AI‑RAN partnership with Nokia helps operators move faster, operate more like cloud companies, quickly launch new AI services, and smoothly evolve toward next-generation, AI‑native networks.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“The addition of leading American, Asian, and European operators, alongside a growing ecosystem of partners, signals that AI-RAN is gaining traction and has become a strategic direction for the industry. In the meantime, the completion of GPU-accelerated RAN tests in various configurations and scenarios marks a step up in maturity. We look forward to seeing the demonstrations of AI-RAN’s operational readiness during MWC26,” commented Rémy Pascal, Practice Leader for Mobile Infrastructure at Omdia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>AI-RAN technology readiness </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In collaboration with key customers, Nokia has completed functional tests of its AI and RAN workloads on NVIDIA’s GPU-accelerated AI-RAN platform, showcasing the scalability and efficiency of AI-powered RAN solutions.

OCR 1.0 only enabled basic text recognition, while OCR 2.0 added preliminary layout understanding capabilities. U1-OCR takes a quantum leap to OCR 3.0, moving far beyond layout recognition to deliver deep semantic insight, automatic document classification and business-level information extraction-marking a transformative shift from \"character perception\" to \"document cognition\".</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a SOTA-level document intelligence model, U1-OCR resolves the longstanding bottleneck of traditional models that \"recognize text but fail to grasp layout\", enabling it to interpret complex documents like human experts. It pioneers a \"semantic-driven + dynamic focus\" strategy, first mapping a document's hierarchical structure of headings and structural metadata before extracting content on demand, and builds a semantic map to identify the relationship between titles, charts and text-even in disorganized layouts. Its enhanced spatial alignment module leverages positional data to accurately restore document structure for dense tables and mixed text-image content, effectively mitigating spatial recognition errors. Equipped with Multi-Token Prediction technology and full-task reinforcement learning, it boosts reasoning efficiency by over 80%, ensuring logical coherence for long documents.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trained with multi-task collaborative reinforcement learning and optimized for both semantics and coordinates, U1-OCR suppresses spatial hallucinations for reliable outputs, and achieves SOTA results across major authoritative benchmarks: scoring 95.1 in OmniDocBench V1.5, outperforming leading models like GLM-OCR and Gemini-3-Pro; hitting an F1 score of 90.8 in D4LA and 95.9 in DocLayNet, excelling in table recognition and cross-page association; and outperforming models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash and Qwen-2.5-VL in internal business tests, with standout performance in medical document processing such as admission and discharge records.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Figure: Comparison of Unisound U1-OCR Evaluation Scores on OmniDocBench V1.5</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Built for real-world industrial applications, U1-OCR features four key capabilities that bridge the gap between document understanding and business action. Its proprietary \"coordinate-text-semantics\" architecture enables pixel-level positioning and full evidence traceability, making audit processes transparent and efficient.

The markets are rather dispassionate when it comes to military conflicts; the only thing investors are ultimately focused on is whether the oil flows will be interrupted so once the initial spike is over, the initial rally tends to fade.”  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>HUGO PASCAL, A PRECIOUS METALS TRADER AT INPROVED</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"With traditional exchanges closed, tokenised gold is currently trading at a premium, signalling a bullish 'flight to safety' ahead of the week's open.
