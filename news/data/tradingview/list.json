            "title": "Tech Trader: Nvidia Is Stuck in a Rut, but There's Hope For Software Stocks — Barron's",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Adam Levine</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Thursday morning, I woke up to an inbox full of analyst notes praising another great quarter from the artificial-intelligence chip leader, Nvidia, which had reported its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings the previous afternoon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Acceleration at a Scale Never Seen\" was the title of Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes' note.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Generational growth at inspirational valuation,\" said Vivek Arya of Bank of America.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The laudatory missives multiplied.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, the stock fell by 5.5% on Thursday. Despite strong results and the accelerating 2026 AI data-center buildout — of which Nvidia remains the primary beneficiary — the stock has been stuck in the mud for months. Since October, it has moved sideways, down about 1%, while the S&amp;P 500 index rose by 3.3%. And despite beating earnings expectations 13 quarters in a row, the stock declined the next day by an average of 3% after the last three of them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Negative narratives have crept in:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Growth deceleration. This once seemed like a real concern. Year-over-year sales growth peaked at 265% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, and it declined through the second quarter of 2026. But the growth rate turned back up in the second half of the fiscal year, and Nvidia's guidance was for more acceleration in the current quarter. This narrative is on life support.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Competition. Nvidia's largest customers, the \"hyperscalers,\" are looking to diversify their supply chains and not be so dependent on Nvidia. Meta Platforms just signed a deal with Advanced Micro Devices for its AI chips. The three big cloud providers -- Amazon.com, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- all make their own custom chips they would like customers to use, and there are many chip start-ups. Alphabet is getting the most traction so far. Nvidia has a deal with start-up Groq for its AI chips.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Risky commitments. To deal with supply-chain shortages, Nvidia has committed to $95 billion of inventory purchases, almost all of which will be spent this year. In all of fiscal 2026, Nvidia had $62 billion in cost-of-goods-sold, so this is a major supply commitment, and some of these orders may not be cancelable. A year from now, this will either look like a genius move that kept Nvidia's industry-leading gross profit margin high or a disastrous example of hubris that destroyed its gross margin.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Limitations of the data-center boom. Nvidia's main vendors are seeing tight supply. Land, skilled construction crews, and power are becoming harder to come by. The hyperscaler customers have given sky-high guidance for 2026 capital expenditures, but how long can that last? They have substantial cash flow of their own, but they are reaching the limits of it with their even larger capital budgets. They are already dipping into debt. How much will investors stomach?</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Circular financing. Nvidia had over $100 billion in operational cash flow last year, and it has been spreading that wealth around throughout the AI start-up ecosystem. In fiscal 2026 it made $17.5 billion in start-up equity investments, and another $13 billion to Groq -- and it has commitments for another $11.4 billion this year. On Friday, Nvidia invested $30 billion in OpenAI. Many of these companies are Nvidia customers, or customers of customers, and a good portion of those investments will wind up in Nvidia's pockets. These are big numbers, but they pale in comparison to Nvidia's sales: $216 billion in fiscal 2026 and a projected $350 billion this year. Nvidia is supporting the ecosystem, not the other way around, and in the process it is taking a stake in a range of AI start-ups.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Nothing seemed to change this week for Nvidia, but there was some light at the end of the tunnel for enterprise software makers, and they're hoping it's not a train headed their way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These stocks hit the bricks at the end of last year, and this year they have been getting demolished. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector exchange-traded fund was down 27% through this past Monday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But then one of their tormentors became a patron saint.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Much of the stocks' woes were attributable to AI start-up Anthropic's agent software. Agents use language models like Anthropic's Claude to accomplish a complex series of tasks from simple conversational prompts, which led to fears that business software is replaceable by AI. On Feb. 5, Anthropic released tools for specific agent tasks in several areas like legal and finance. The software ETF capped eight straight trading days of declines with a 5% drop in what felt like capitulation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But on Tuesday, Anthropic gave a presentation aimed at increasing AI adoption among business customers, something that's been slow going. The demonstration was all about how Anthropic's agents work...with software. Only four minutes into the hourlong show, Anthropic presenters began bragging about how much enterprise software from Microsoft, Salesforce, Google, Docusign, and others works with Claude agents. The company also announced a new integration with Intuit's financial software the same day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Anthropic wants to partner with Intuit, not kill Intuit. They want to partner with Salesforce. They don't want to replace Salesforce,\" said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill in a Barron's Q&amp;A this week. \"They're not going to replace some of these systems that we use. They will make them better. There's no doubt they will create new applications that potentially can compete. But we think it's more of a partnership than a full eviction of everyone in the software city.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And software stocks did turn on the Anthropic demonstration. The software ETF rose three days running, up 7.4% in all. But I'm not ready to call the bottom yet. Sentiment around the sector remains on a hair trigger, and it won't take much to knock it back down, like a fictional Substack post on Monday that sent the software ETF down 4.8%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Friday, the mood turned again, and the software ETF was down 2% in midday trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Steven M. Sears</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>How do you price chaos?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That is the essence of this moment in market time — and almost no one has an answer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This means the stock and options markets should be stuck in a volatile reactionary state for a prolonged period. Many investors will no doubt make rash decisions in reaction to a steady flow of dramatic news.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The leading cause of chaos emanates from President Donald Trump's retaliation against the Supreme Court ruling that curtailed his tariff diplomacy. Analysts are opining about the impact on global trade, which influences corporate earnings, but it's too early to draw significant conclusions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, the president is amassing attack forces around Iran, a founding member of OPEC. An attack would disrupt oil markets and infect the stock and options markets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some relief could come when the Federal Reserve's interest-rate committee concludes a two-day meeting on March 18, but that isn't looking likely. Recent reports indicate that Fed governors disagree about lowering rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To further cloud matters, November's midterm elections could see Trump lose control of Congress. If Democrats take the House of Representatives, Trump's often pro-market agenda would stall.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These unusual risks should keep most investors in an event-driven trading mode. Expect them to view risk and opportunity in snapshots of time, making short-term wagers on events, rather than investing in thematic trends that evolve over longer periods.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Every Trump social-media post, unexpected news headline, and economic report — not to mention the odd apocalyptic report on artificial intelligence — thus has even more power than usual to roil investor sentiment and increase options volatility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For true long-term investors with the stamina to let time and dividends compound returns of blue-chip stocks, chaos is immaterial. But few such people exist.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last week, we focused on how to hedge with put-option spreads. This week, we focus on a strategy for making decisions amid uncertainty. Our \"time arbitrage\" strategy, which monetizes short-term volatility for long-term gain, provides a simple framework.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pick any stock you can own for three to five years, but ideally longer. What that stock declines, the sharper the better, sell a put option that expires in one month or less with a strike just below the stock price. (Puts give the holder the right to sell an asset at a set price and time.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During selloffs, the put's implied volatility increases as investors buy puts to hedge stocks. That's why seasoned investors like selling puts during downturns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You get paid more for the risk of selling options during volatility events,\" says Michael Schwartz, Oppenheimer's chief options strategist.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consider JPMorgan Chase. The stock is down about 11% since its early January peak, and it looks weak. Still, the bank is among the most important in the world, and that isn't in doubt.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With the stock at $297.30, a long-term investor could sell the March $292.50 put for about $7. If the stock is below $292.50 at expiration, investors must buy the stock. If the stock exceeds $292.50 at expiration, investors can keep the put premium, making a nice return just for agreeing to buy the stock. During the past 52 weeks, JPMorgan has ranged from $202.16 to $337.25.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These trades always seem enticing when discussed. Everyone likes getting paid to buy stock in great companies. In reality, though, it's the options premium they really like, and they tend to get cranky if the stock declines and they must buy it. So be realistic, and use this strategy only on stocks you want to own. If you can do that, chaos becomes a useful ally to building long-term wealth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Email: editors@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Andrew Bary</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The big winner from the battle for Warner Bros. Discovery was the loser, Netflix, which bowed out after Paramount Skydance submitted a higher bid for the media company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other competitors, like Comcast, could be winners, too, amid further media consolidation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount is paying a stiff price, and its winning bid may turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory. It offered $31 a share in cash for Warner Bros., a deal that values the company's equity at $81 billion plus about $29 billion of assumed net debt.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix shares rose 22%, to $96, this past week as investors expressed relief that the company wouldn't go forward with its richly priced offer for Warner Bros.' movie studio and streaming assets, including HBO. The acquisition would have saddled Netflix with over $50 billion of new debt and changed what had been a winning, organic, growth-focused narrative around the stock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There could be more upside in Netflix stock, given that it traded at $103 before it reached a surprise deal for Warner Bros. on Dec. 5. One of the positives for Netflix is that it will pocket a $2.8 billion breakup fee.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Back to Simply Dominating\" was the title of Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino's note on Thursday after Netflix decided not to match the Paramount offer. Supino lifted his price target to $110 from $95.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix, trading for about 30 times projected 2026 earnings, isn't a bargain, but profits per share are expected to rise at a 20% clip in the coming years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking at other affected stocks, investors may want to steer clear of what will be a heavily leveraged Paramount and take a hard look at Comcast, the cable industry leader that owns NBCUniversal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Comcast wasn't involved in the Warner Bros. battle, but it could take part in the next round of media consolidation or an alternative transaction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There has been pressure on Comcast CEO and controlling shareholder Brian Roberts to dismantle NBCUniversal after its spinoff of some cable properties, including CNBC and MSNOW (formerly MSNBC), into Versant Media in early January. Now that Netflix has passed on Warner Bros., it could consider buying NBCU assets such as the Universal movie studio or the Peacock streaming service.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield told CNBC on Friday morning that investors were barraging him with emails about the Comcast scenario after Netflix declined to match the Paramount offer late on Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Comcast shares, at about $31, trade cheaply at just eight times projected 2026 earnings on concerns about broadband competition. Supino thinks a separation of NBCU could add $10 a share or more to Comcast's stock price, given the lofty price that the business could garner.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount stock surged 21%, to $13.51, on Friday as investors reacted favorably to the Warner deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The immediate investor reaction appeared to be this: While Paramount is paying a high price for Warner Bros., the $31-a-share deal value was less than the $33-a-share figure or higher that some thought Paramount needed to pay to win.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Paramount run-up could also be fueled in part by short covering with short interest of 51 million shares, about 15% of the public float.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There was bullish news late on Friday when Paramount said that it would issue $47 billion of equity at $16.02 a share to help finance the Warner transaction. The equity deal is fully backed by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital Partners, the current controlling shareholders of Paramount, with a roughly 70% economic state.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That sale is at a 19% premium to Paramount's closing price on Friday and represents a big vote of confidence by key holders in the value of Paramount stock. Large equity sales often come at a discount to the market price.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount's share count is set to increase by about 2.9 billion, bringing the total to about four billion, Barron's estimates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount stock amounts to a leveraged play on the success of the Warner deal, which Wall Street is betting will pass regulatory scrutiny because President Donald Trump likes Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison and is probably happy that Warner's CNN cable business will be controlled by the Ellison family, including Larry's son, Paramount CEO David Ellison. Trump has criticized CNN for what he views as its left-leaning news coverage.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Assuming the deal closes, Paramount will carry an estimated $90 billion of debt, seven times projected 2026 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, before cost savings and various corporate streamlining initiatives. That's double the debt/Ebitda ratio that most companies seek to maintain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount is banking on quickly getting those cost savings of $6 billion annually — a high level relative to about $12 billion of projected 2026 Ebitda — and rapidly deleveraging its balance sheet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are better opportunities in media than Paramount. Walt Disney trades for $106, down 5% in the past year. Its shares sell for just 15 times projected 2026 earnings and 10 times projected 2026 Ebitda, with a better franchise in most respects than Paramount, led by Disney's powerhouse theme-parks business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount has a tough road to navigate. It needs to get regulatory approval for the Warner deal, which isn't a sure thing due to likely U.S., state, and international inquiries, wrote Seaport analyst David Joyce on Friday. Assuming the deal closes in 12 months, Paramount will need to integrate a much larger company, cut significant costs, and wrestle with ongoing erosion in the core media and cable parts of both Paramount and Warner.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's a tall order for David Ellison. The 43-year-old was running Skydance, a media and entertainment business with just $1 billion of annual sales, a year ago. The Skydance deal for Paramount closed last August. Backed by his father's wealth, David Ellison has parlayed his tiny Skydance into the No. 3 media and entertainment company behind Netflix and Disney.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bigger may not be better.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Paul R. La Monica</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jim Paulsen isn't your typical \"retired Grampa,\" even though that's how he describes himself in Paulsen Perspectives, the Substack newsletter that he started writing in February 2024. And even though he has technically been retired since the end of 2022, he is still analyzing the economy and markets, much as he did for 40 years as a chief investment strategist. His career included two decades in the institutional investment unit of Wells Fargo, and another five at the Leuthold Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now that Paulsen has no boss but himself, he has the freedom and flexibility to write about what he chooses. \"I love the interplay between emotions in trading and the math of the economy and markets,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paulsen, who will turn 68 in early March, typically writes two times a week for nearly 7,500 subscribers, with recent posts focusing on bond yields, consumer confidence, and sector rotation. Barron's spoke with him in mid-February about what he's seeing in the markets and the economy, and why he remains largely bullish despite the recent artificial-intelligence and tech-stock pullback.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An edited version of the conversation follows.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Barron's : After three strong years for the stock market, do you worry that 2026 will be a down year?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jim Paulsen: I'm always worried to some degree. But I'm still more in the bullish camp. The biggest thing that keeps me bullish at this point is that Main Street confidence is in the tank, and major players in the private sector are pessimistic and cautious. They're worried about the future. I find that's always a great time to be invested.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is a bearish bull. Gold and stocks usually move in opposite directions. This is the only bull market where gold and stocks have both gone up. Also, the stock market is going up while confidence is deteriorating. This bull market has been led by a small cadre of new-era stocks, and everything else hasn't participated yet. That means there are many stocks that could still participate before the bull run is over.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>How concerned should investors be about the divide in the economy and markets between the haves and have-nots?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most of the economy entered a recession in 2022 and never emerged. But the new-era stocks put up scorching gains through that period. They have become so big [in market capitalization] that they have been wagging the dog in this market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is a reason that people on Main Street have said for years that they aren't feeling good. Weird things are going on. We have a recessionary expansion. People talk about the split of the K-shape economy — rich versus poor. I think it is more of a split between the new era [stocks] and the old era [stocks]. These new-era stocks are looking tired.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Why is that? We have had unconventional and contractionary monetary policy since 2022. This bull market started with worries about inflation and the Federal Reserve tightening. It has persisted mostly through a tightening environment. Bond yields went up and never came down much. The dollar went up dramatically until recently. The yield curve inverted for the longest time ever. The broader market should do better from here than the new-era stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now that the Fed is cutting rates again, you have talked about passing the baton in the market. Where are the new leaders?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The new-era economy has divorced itself from traditional forces. It is driven by its own innovation cycle. Yet, two important things are going on. There is dramatic over-ownership of new-era stocks, but they are no longer outperforming. Also, the Fed has eased monetary policy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Given lower interest rates and a decline in the dollar, the rally has broadened, and more stocks are now doing better. Small-caps, cyclical stocks, international stocks, and the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 index are starting to perform better. We are finally getting policy support for parts of the market that need it to do better.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Also, the capital spending cycle is long in the tooth. Part of the appeal of those winning stocks was their absolute performance, and their relative performance compared with the rest of the market. Things are changing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The broadening trend may be welcome, but will it continue?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the rest of the economy is finally getting policy support, new-era stocks won't be worth as much. They are losing some of their appeal, even if their fundamentals haven't changed much.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In some ways, we now have a bull within a bull. Tech stocks won't die, but other sectors are coming back to life, which is like starting a new bull market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>How different is the AI revolution from the revolution at the dawn of the internet in the late 1990s? Will there be an AI bust? Has it already begun?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is only one way to end a stock market bubble. It has to burst, and the market needs to crash. I'm not sure AI is in a bubble. It doesn't seem nearly as big as the dot-com bubble, and the dichotomies don't seem extreme, as in the 1990s.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When tech stocks peaked in March 2000, the broad market rolled over. The performance of the S&amp;P 500 was tied directly to the internet sector. That hasn't happened this time around. Tech stocks have been relatively weak since the end of October, but the S&amp;P 500 has held its highs, and has even gone up since then. That can happen only because the baton is passing to a broader array of stocks. Their strength is compensating for the weakness in tech.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This sounds like a good argument for diversification.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Almost all investors let their exposure to new-era stocks rise in recent years. We did it purposefully or passively, via index funds. Heck, who could sell these stocks when they outperformed consistently and had such dynamic stories?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I don't advise selling all your tech stocks now. But if you trim your weighting in a sector that accounts for about 40% of the value of the S&amp;P 500, and put your money in something else, such as small-caps, that seems sensible. We don't need to have a tech crash that spells the end of the bull market. The market can keep rising as we find new winners.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Let's switch gears, or assets. The dollar has weakened in the past year. Where does that leave investors?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The dollar's performance has been a big driver of international stocks' outperformance, but it is just one factor. People have an odd emotional reaction to the dollar — to the idea that a strong dollar is good and a weak dollar is anti-American. I never understood that. The dollar is just like interest rates. When it goes up, it can be a restrictive force.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Where should people invest overseas?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A weaker dollar means international stocks should keep winning. I am more intrigued by emerging and frontier markets than developed markets. Emerging markets excluding China look attractive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The pandemic was a disaster for China. It highlighted to every company in the world the need to diversify supply chains. You want to have exposure to places like Vietnam, and Central and South America, as well.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>President Donald Trump has nominated Kevin Warsh as the next Fed chair. What would a Warsh Fed mean for monetary policy?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We don't have an inflation problem, so the Fed doesn't need to raise rates. Also, I am not worried about threats to the Fed's independence. Fed governors are appointed by politicians. There is political bias throughout the Fed. But there is political bias everywhere; that is nothing new.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ultimately, the Fed has a bigger boss: the economy. We have a weird economy now: Gross domestic product is still growing, while the unemployment rate has risen. Some parts of the labor market, such as manufacturing, have seen no job growth in the past year. It will be difficult for the Fed to stand pat. Also, GDP is distorted; the economy isn't doing as well as the numbers suggest. They have been impacted by trade flows and the massive budget deficit. The Fed is going to have to bring more juice [in the form of lower rates] regardless of who is on the Board of Governors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What will that mean for fixed-income investors?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Inflation is heading down closer to the Fed's 2% annual target, but the Fed needs to get rid of that target. Everyone treats 2% inflation as the holy grail. Americans don't like inflation of any ilk, but it is back in the 2% to 3% range, and that has been just fine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I wouldn't be shocked to see the 10-year Treasury yield at 3.25% to 3.5% by the end of the year. Bonds should have a pretty good year, although maybe not as good as stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You have discussed on Substack some of the risks that investors face with gold. Yet, the yellow metal has continued to climb. How much further can this rally go?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I didn't think gold would go up as much as it already has. But there are problems. The surge in gold reflects investors' uncertainty about geopolitics, monetary policy, and the economy. For gold to continue climbing, the level of uncertainty would need to increase.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gold is the thing you buy to protect you from whatever keeps you up at night. But the same things that should lead to improvement in the broader market and economy should also improve consumer confidence. If that happens, that is an enemy of gold. Also, since we don't have an inflation problem, I would take money out of gold.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thanks for your time, Jim.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Paul R.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Megan Leonhardt</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Federal Reserve officials and politicians like to trumpet the fact that inflation has cooled dramatically from its peak of nearly 9% in June 2022. But for those of us who buy groceries or pay utility bills, that's small consolation. Have you seen the price of a skirt steak, or even ground beef these days? It's enough to consider becoming a vegetarian.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>President Donald Trump attempted to assuage consumers' concerns last Tuesday night during his State of the Union address, citing the \"roaring\" economy and plummeting prices. \"The cost of chicken, butter, food, hotels, automobiles, rent is lower today than when I took office, by a lot, and even beef, which was very high, is starting to come down significantly,\" Trump said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the president is right that prices for some items, such as eggs and gasoline, have fallen from a year ago, inflation hasn't been tamed. Official measures indicate that it's still well above the Fed's 2% annual target. Friday's release of the producer price index reading for January showed that wholesale inflation rose by a higher-than-expected 0.5% month over month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The president called out the price of eggs, which he noted are down 60% from their high. While he got the direction right, the consumer price index indicates that the average price of a carton of large Grade A eggs has fallen by 48% since Trump took office in January 2025. Prices plummeted last year as a bird flu outbreak eased, but the pace of cooling has slowed in recent months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gasoline prices, which Trump also highlighted, fell significantly over the past year. Prices at the pump were $2.98, on average, this past week, according to AAA. That's down from $3.14 a year ago.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump touted that inflation averaged 1.7% in the final three months of 2025. The administration's measure, which it has used before, is based on the average of the annualized rates of the monthly CPI change during specific periods — for example, from the start of Trump's second term or in the final three months of the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Official calculations, considered standard by economists, tell a less celebratory story. The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the change in the consumer price index compared with one year earlier. By that measure, inflation rose 2.4% year over year in January. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, rose 2.9% in December, the latest data available.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sticky inflation has been driven by rising prices for a range of goods and services. Beef costs, for example, rose substantially in the past year. Ground beef prices were up 22% in January from a year earlier, and steak prices rose about 12% year to year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Electricity costs, which Trump didn't mention, were up 6.3% year over year in January on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to the BLS.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Price trends like this help to explain why surveys show that consumers remain focused on inflation, prices, and affordability. Consumer confidence improved slightly in February, but is still down by almost 9% from a year ago and remains at historically low levels, according to the latest report, released this past week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Regarding the impact of tariffs, Trump said that \"there was no inflation, tremendous growth.\" But there is mounting evidence that tariffs are increasing prices, even if not by the levels that economists initially assumed. Core goods inflation was unchanged in the January CPI report, largely due to a sizable drop in used-car prices. But core goods excluding autos rose 0.36% in the month, and at a 4.4% annualized rate, according to Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Prices for household furnishings, personal-care products, and electronic devices such as computers, tablets, and smart-home assistants all rose sharply in January.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Supreme Court recently struck down the tariffs that the Trump administration issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, but consumers are unlikely to see any relief in prices. If refunds are issued, companies aren't likely to pass those savings along to consumers. And, the White House has already implemented workarounds to keep tariffs in place.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Trump gave no indication he would relent from his tariff agenda,\" said Thierry Wizman, global foreign-exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That alone suggests consumers shouldn't expect price growth to ease soon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Megan Leonhardt at megan.leonhardt@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "title": "Income Investing: How the Tariff Ruling Could Affect Your Bonds — Barron's",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Amey Stone</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors wondering what the Supreme Court decision on tariff policy means for interest rates could easily come to the conclusion that it's a nonevent — at least based on how Treasuries have traded since then.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.06% when the court struck down most of President Donald Trump's tariff agenda on Feb. 20, and it was at the same spot on Wednesday following the State of the Union address. The two-year note, at about 3.48%, was similarly unchanged.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors shouldn't conclude there is no reason to be concerned about falling bond prices. \"The bond market hasn't responded,\" says Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Investment Management. \"We just don't have the information to respond to.\" Bond prices move inversely to interest rates, and depending on how the Trump administration's next moves on tariffs play out, rates could well head higher. That would hurt current bondholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Arone is waiting for clarity on two main points: Will consumers and companies get refunds for the tariffs they've already paid? That could add up to about $175 billion in fiscal stimulus, enough to contribute to higher inflation, putting pressure on rates. Plus, the Treasury would have to issue more debt to cover the tab, which would add to the deficit and put upward pressure on yields.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The second question is what happens to the existing trade deals with other countries. Most strategists think revenue gained in Trump's revamped tariff regime will net out to be about the same as it was before the Supreme Court decision. But for now, the average effective tariff rate is at least a few points lower than the 13% to 14% estimated before the ruling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Current deficit spending as a percent of GDP of 5.2% would be 6.1% without tariff revenue,\" says Bill Merz, head of capital markets research at U.S. Bank Asset Management. Investors may demand higher yields \"if spending doesn't slow or government revenue doesn't increase, \" he adds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are offsetting factors to some of these risks. Lower tariffs could cool inflation, reducing pressure on consumers and giving the Federal Reserve more room to cut rates. Also, for now, new debt would probably be issued at shorter maturities, which the market could easily absorb, says Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The risk to yields is longer term — that the U.S. could have to move to issue more longer-dated debt sooner than expected, Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, told clients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lyngen also argues that the decision may make Fed members reluctant to cut rates at their next meeting. \"The renewed trade policy uncertainty has reinforced the prudence of keeping rates on hold until the economic fog clears,\" Lyngen writes. The Fed is widely expected to cut rates twice more this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LeBas doesn't believe that tariffs will have a big impact on rates; it's the economy that matters. But he agrees that uncertainty is high. \"I generally like to have a longer forward view, but the economic climate is so weird, it's very difficult to do so,\" he says. \"The cone of uncertainty gets very wide.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Arone suggests investors take a cautious stance, sticking with high-quality bonds and short-to-intermediate maturities. The State Street DoubleLine Short Duration Total Return Tactical exchange-traded fund owns mostly short-term bonds and has a 4.3% yield, which he calls a \"good healthy trade-off.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sara Devereux, Vanguard's global head of fixed income, echoes his view. \"We've seen client flows to intermediate-duration bond funds increase as cash rates have dropped,\" she says. \"We expect high-quality bonds to continue to serve as portfolio ballast in risk-off environments.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Amey Stone at amey.stone@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",

How they navigated a tumultuous year. By Debbie Carlson</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last year gave savvy fund managers an ideal chance to prove their worth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Things started off well for the stock market. Then they took an abrupt turn for the worse.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anticipating Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, tax cuts, and deregulation, most asset managers expected 2024's gains to persist. The good vibes proved to be short-lived after China, in January, unleashed a much cheaper artificial-intelligence model called DeepSeek to rival the lavishly hyped OpenAI. Then, in April, President Donald Trump's Liberation Day tariff announcements sent stocks and bonds spiraling downward.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet like an experienced climber who uses precise movements to find strong toeholds before advancing, the top active fund managers in Barron's annual Best Fund Families survey relied on their processes and research to uncover bargains across asset classes, profiting when markets rebounded.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As 2025 progressed, stock leadership changed, and a commitment to diversification and owning underappreciated names proved prescient. It was the first time in a few years that asset managers didn't have to own all Magnificent Seven stocks to just keep up with the indexes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Capital Group ascended to the No. 1 spot by taking advantage of mercurial markets and seeing long-term bets pay off.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Martin Romo, Capital Group's chair and chief investment officer, says that while the Magnificent Seven companies still matter, he sensed markets would broaden in 2025, based on the firm's global research, which had been revealing better opportunities beyond the stretched valuations of the Big Tech names.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If you went outside of tech, outside the U.S., outside the big companies, and looked for a little bit more value instead of just growth, it led us down a path to find these opportunities,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nimbleness and diversification were also hallmarks of the four other fund families that successfully scaled to our top-five summit in 2025. Coming in No. 2 through No. 5, respectively, were Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group, Northern Trust Asset Management, and Lord Abbett.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For bond managers, 2025 was finally a year in which markets normalized and higher yields boosted returns, says Roger Hallam, global head of rates at Vanguard. \"The backdrop for bonds today is just very different from where we've been over much of the post-financial-crisis regime,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Early market turmoil aside, 2025 was a pretty good year for investors. According to LSEG Lipper data, the average U.S. equity fund rose 14.9%, while world equity funds gained 29%. Taxable bond funds rose 6.5%, while municipal bond funds returned 3.7%. Mixed-asset funds rose 15.5%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Barron's has conducted its annual survey of fund families for more than 20 years, focusing on calendar-year relative performance for the primary ranking, which offers a glimpse of how diversified firms perform across a wide range of actively managed funds. It's a snapshot in time. As usual, though, several of the top families' biggest and best-performing funds of 2025 also demonstrate strong longer-term returns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Because the Best Fund Families results are asset-weighted, firms' largest funds have the biggest impact on their rankings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This year's survey welcomed Northern Trust Asset Management to the top five for the first time in recent years, while Capital Group and Vanguard returned for the first time since 2022 and 2020, respectively. Fidelity moved up from No. 3 in 2024, and Lord Abbett moved down to No. 5 from the top spot.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This Year's List</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To be included in the ranking, firms must have offered at least three actively managed mutual funds or active exchange-traded funds in Lipper's general U.S. stock category, plus one in world equity and one mixed-asset, such as a balanced or asset-allocation fund. They also needed to offer at least two taxable bond funds and one national tax-exempt bond fund. All funds on our list must have a track record of at least one year. The ranking also includes \"smart beta\" ETFs, which are run passively but built on active investment strategies. The list reflects each firm's active-management ability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All told, just 46 asset managers out of the 795 in Lipper's database met our criteria for 2025. There were a few changes to this year's list. Simplify debuts at No. 41, and it is the first time an all-ETF asset manager had enough funds across asset classes to qualify. Its inclusion demonstrates how active ETFs are becoming a bigger part of the asset-management industry after they were approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nomura Asset Management is the other newcomer, joining the list after acquiring Macquarie's U.S. asset-management business. We said goodbye to Amundi, as it is now part of Victory Capital Management. Madison Funds and Neuberger Berman were dropped, as they no longer have enough qualifying funds to be included.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many other large fund managers are consistently absent because they don't check all of the boxes in the categories we consider. Notable names in that category include Janus Henderson and Dodge &amp; Cox.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>No. 1: Capital Group</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Capital Group runs the American Funds — some of the biggest funds by assets in the U.S. — and because Barron's results are asset-weighted, strong showings by its top funds catapulted the firm to our top spot.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The firm manages the biggest mixed-asset fund in the survey, the $274.8 billion American Balanced fund. Its 18.8% return bested 91% of its Lipper peers, as it owned some of 2025's big winners in its top 10, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and memory-chip maker Micron Technology, the second-biggest S&amp;P 500 gainer with a 240% return. Its No. 11 holding was South Korean semiconductor SK Hynix, which returned 286%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The asset manager's largest general-equity fund, the $336.4 billion Growth Fund of America, also contributed to its 2025 win. The fund beat 88% of its Lipper peers with a 20.2% return. In addition to owning Broadcom and Alphabet in its top 10 holdings, it also held Micron.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Capital Group has $2.8 trillion across its 102 U.S.-listed active mutual funds and ETFs. The firm splits investment duties across multiple managers in each fund, carving out a slice for each manager to invest in their highest-conviction ideas. A principal investment officer oversees the fund's makeup to ensure balance and commitment to mandate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Names like Taiwan Semi and SK Hynix exemplify how Capital Group broadened its holdings beyond U.S. megacap technology names and still found strong returns, Romo says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The universal theme behind 2025's performance came from managers relying on Capital Group's deep global research to stay confident during uncertainty, whether it was having a long-term outlook on an unloved stock or buying when the market swooned, he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Romo is also the principal investment officer of the $178.4 billion Investment Company of America fund, which gained 20.8% in 2025, beating 91% of its Lipper peers. He says his long-term picks of GE Aerospace and Royal Caribbean Group paid off in 2025, and he used the April selloff to increase positions in Nvidia and Eli Lilly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Among the winning moves Capital Group made in fixed income in 2025 was playing the differences between U.S. and German bond yields and using the tariff announcement to increase their credit exposure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>No. 2: Fidelity Investments</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The April tariff-ignited market rout reverberated across equites and fixed-income markets. In the heat of the moment, the selloff felt different than other corrections, says Robin Foley, head of Fidelity's fixed-income division.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It was kind of a strange time,\" she says. \"When the market goes volatile, it becomes more important than ever to get together and understand what's happening.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The uncertainty of how tariffs would shake out led Fidelity equity managers to revisit the deep research the asset manager is known for and think long term. Brian Enyeart, co-head of equity, says portfolio managers focused on pair trades, swapping out good names for better ones, as well as looking for potential secular winners and repositioning portfolios.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Early volatility aside, Enyeart says shifts in market leadership helped many growth, core, and value managers to outperform their indexes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Once again, Fidelity's biggest general-equity fund, the $176.3 billion Contrafund, outperformed, beating 93% of its Lipper peers with a 21.8% gain. In a fourth-quarter commentary, manager Will Danoff attributed the quarter's gains to holdings in Elon Musk's private Space Exploration Technologies; electronic and fiberoptic connectors manufacturer Amphenol, one of the S&amp;P 500's biggest gainers with a 96% return; and to selling its small position in Oracle. The legendary manager will retire at the end of 2026, with Asher Anolic and Jason Weiner, his co-managers since April 2025, taking over.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Foley says fixed-income managers found opportunities during April's volatility but didn't jump to execute trades as bond markets were fragmented. Agency mortgage-backed securities and investment-grade bonds were standouts for the team. Strong earnings translated to strength in corporate bonds, and across sectors Fidelity saw good bond yields relative to Treasuries, without sacrificing credit quality.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fidelity has $6.8 trillion in assets and more than 525 ETFs and mutual funds. For many asset managers, ETFs are becoming a bigger part of the business, and that's true for Fidelity. The firm has 77 ETFs, with more than $150 billion in assets, says Greg Friedman, head of ETF management and strategy. The $24.5 billion Fidelity Total Bond ETF is one of the biggest, similar to the $42 billion Fidelity Total Bond fund.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Friedman says ETFs are attracting a younger, different investor than a traditional mutual fund buyer, rather than seeing mutual fund investors swap for cheaper ETFs. \"They have different demands and different needs, \" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>No. 3: Vanguard Group Vanguard returns to Barron's top five for the first time since 2020, led by a strong performance from the $75.7 billion Vanguard Primecap fund and its fixed-income offerings. With a 30% return, Vanguard's biggest active equity mutual fund beat 100% of its Lipper peers. A 17.2% return for the $62 billion hybrid Vanguard Equity Income fund also boosted Vanguard's standing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notable Primecap winners included Micron and semiconductor wafer fabricator KLA, while Equity Income owned Johnson &amp; Johnson and Gilead Sciences.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vanguard's equity funds are managed externally, and big funds like Primecap saw a string of underperformance from 2019 through 2021 and again in 2024, in part from stylistic headwinds. Barron's asset-weighted survey means a middling-to-poor showing by an asset manager's biggest equity funds can push down the firm's overall ranking.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The firm manages its mixed-asset and fixed-income funds internally, and altogether has $1.9 trillion in 95 active funds. Vanguard's core philosophy of balanced and diversified portfolios played to its 2025 outperformance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The mixed-asset category, as well as strength in domestic bonds and international holdings, lifted Vanguard's target-date funds, with many returning 18% to 20%, rivaling large-cap performance with less risk. In a 60% equities/40% bond target-date fund, 40% of its equities' allocation is in international stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This was the year international finally paid off,\" says Roger Aliaga-Diaz, global head of portfolio construction and chief economist, Americas, citing both dollar weakness and security selection for the gains.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vanguard placed second in our taxable-bond category. Hallam, the firm's global head of rates, says the fixed-income teams took advantage of both credit and differences in global interest rates to boost returns. Managers overweighted both investment-grade corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities in credit and underweighted Japanese government bonds, expecting that the Bank of Japan would raise rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A bumpy municipal-bond market offered Vanguard a chance to lock in yields rarely seen in decades, says Paul Malloy, head of municipals. Muni prices fell as tax policy debates under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act hinted at ending munis' tax-exempt status early in the year. Although that didn't happen, weakness lingered. By August, tax-adjusted muni yields for high-quality bonds reached 7% to 8%, he says. Vanguard bought structured products and housing bonds, and favored buying bonds below par.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The $84.6 billion Vanguard Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt fund, the largest tax-exempt fund in our survey, had a total return of 5%, beating 79% of its peers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is as good as fixed income has looked, in general, in a long time, \" Malloy says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>No. 4: Northern Trust Asset Management</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Northern Trust Asset Management looks at active management three ways across its 40 active mutual funds and ETFs, says Anwiti Bahuguna, global co-chief investment officer and CIO of multi-asset investments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The firm employs quantitative strategies across the platform to build stock portfolios that use companies' fundamental information in a systematic and risk-controlled way. The multi-asset funds are top-down tactical asset-allocation funds that actively pursue ideas across regions and asset classes. They also use external specialist multimanagers to actively manage some funds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The fixed-income funds also employ factors, with quantitative portfolios using value and quality for security selection, while fundamental portfolio managers incorporate quantitative signals with credit research, says Christian Roth, global co-chief investment officer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For both the equities and fixed-income funds, the managers are \"index aware,\" mindful of the defined index universe for the particular fund to avoid style drift, sector bets, or hidden concentration risks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bahuguna says in the first few months of 2025, it was difficult for active managers to outperform, since Mag Seven tech names still dominated. But by midyear, their quantitative models began to show market breadth improving and value factors starting to pay off.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That benefited their two biggest equity funds, the $680 million Northern Small Cap Value and the $346 million Northern Large Cap Core, which have value and quality tilts. Small Cap picked up Hecla Mining and Coeur Mining, and each rose more than 200% in 2025. Large Cap Core added Newmont, Broadcom, and luxury-goods holding company Tapestry, aiding its 21.8% return and helping it beat 90% of its Lipper peers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Those names represent value, quality, and momentum — the factors that Northern Trust targets, Bahuguna says, adding that \"this combination was absolutely unbeatable last year.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Northern Trust's active fund assets total $544 billion, and last year the asset manager expanded its global quantitative investment team by 13 people who were part of Dutch pension APG Asset Management, known for its quantitative research.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bahuguna says the additional personnel brought insightful ways of reviewing companies, such as evaluating a company's network effect. \"This type of innovation is showing up in our equity portfolios,\" she says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>No. 5: Lord Abbett</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the second straight year, Lord Abbett, with $252 billion in assets, secured a place in our top five. Manager collaboration across asset classes is key for the asset manager, which was founded in 1929 after that year's stock market crash. Lord Abbett's portfolio managers combine a top-down macro approach to construct portfolios with bottom-up fundamental research on individual names for its 34 active strategies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The asset manager entered 2025 with a bullish outlook, although that was tested during April's selloff. Steve Rocco, co-head of taxable fixed income, says working together was critical to staying the course. \"We made sure to communicate well and not derisk the portfolio,\" he says, adding, \"These were emotional times.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Once the market regained its footing, the firm's growth and value strategies benefited from earnings growth and broadening out from technology, Rocco says. Investments in AI and AI-adjacent companies was also a unifying theme across equities. \"It's not just semiconductors. It's industrials, where you have exposure to data centers. It could be traditional HVAC and other companies that offer cooling equipment,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In its biggest fund, the $7.2 billion Lord Abbett Growth Leaders, Nvidia and Alphabet contributed to gains, as did holdings in HVAC company Comfort Systems USA, which gained 226.8%</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In fixed income, with spreads between U.S. Treasury bonds and other bonds tight, Rocco says the team limited duration rather than go out further on the yield curve, taking small opportunities when available. (Duration is a measure of interest-rate risk tied to a bond's or bond fund's maturity, yield, and other factors.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>High-yield bonds benefited from a strong corporate backdrop, but the firm benefited by staying higher in quality across the spectrum. Rocco says the team found opportunities in debt issued by metals miners and energy companies, and new issues from hyperscalers looking to start funding data centers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rocco is betting that 2026 will be another good year for active managers, with growth accelerating because of fiscal stimulus, strong corporate earnings, and the Federal Reserve likely to cut interest rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>How We Ranked the Fund Families</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All mutual and exchange-traded funds are required to report their returns after fees are deducted, to better reflect what investors would actually experience. But our aim is to measure manager skill, independent of expenses beyond annual management fees. That is why we calculate returns before any 12b-1 marketing fees are deducted. Similarly, fund loads, or sales charges, aren't included in our calculation of returns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Each fund's performance is measured against all of the other funds in its LSEG Lipper category, with a percentile ranking of 100 being the highest and one the lowest. This result is then weighted by asset size, relative to the fund family's other assets in its general classification. If a family's biggest funds do well, that boosts its overall ranking and vice versa.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To be included in the ranking, a firm must have at least three funds in the general equity category, one world equity, one mixed equity such as a balanced or target-date fund, two taxable bond funds, and one national tax-exempt bond fund.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Single-sector and country equity funds are factored into the rankings as general equity. We exclude all index funds but include actively managed ETFs and so-called smart-beta ETFs, which are passively managed but created from active strategies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Finally, the score is multiplied by the weighting of its general classification, as determined by the Lipper universe of funds. The category weightings for 2025 were general equity, 38.2%; mixed asset, 21.5%; world equity, 16.5%; taxable bond, 20%; and tax-exempt bond, 3.8%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The category weightings for the five-year results were general equity, 37.7%; mixed asset, 21.8%; world equity, 16.7%; taxable bond, 20%; and tax-exempt bond, 3.8%. For the 10-year list, they were general equity, 38.1%; mixed asset, 23%; world equity, 15.9%; taxable bond, 19.2%; and tax-exempt bond, 3.7%. (The totals may not add up to 100% because of rounding.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The scoring: Say a fund in the general U.S. equity category has $500 million in assets, accounting for half of the firm's assets in that category, and its performance lands it in the 75th percentile for the category. The first calculation would be 75 times 0.5, which comes to 37.5. That score is then multiplied by 38.2%, general equity's overall weighting in Lipper's universe. So, it would be 37.5 times 0.382, which equals 14.33. Similar calculations are done for each fund in our study. Then the numbers are added for each category and overall. The shop with the highest total score wins. The same process is repeated to determine the five- and 10-year rankings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to editors@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>It has underperformed other airlines for too long. Robust premium sales, healthy corporate travel, and improved bookings add up to a bargain. By Teresa Rivas</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Long lines, delays, shrinking legroom, and the dreaded three-ounce liquids rule: Perhaps the only thing more frustrating than modern air travel is trying to invest in airline stocks. An industry known for frequent bankruptcies, underwhelming service, and befuddling even Warren Buffett is no easy sell.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet even airlines can have their day in the sun, and that time is approaching for American Airlines Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"American is very attractively priced — around 0.2 times price to sales — is cash-flow positive, and it has good momentum,\" says Ryan Kelley, chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds, which counts the stock among the 10 largest holdings in its mid-cap portfolios. \"These movements in airline stocks often do go together, so the fact that American has been lagging means there's some catch-up it can do.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>American has long been the laggard among the Big Three legacy airlines, a group that includes Delta Air Lines and United Airlines Holdings. Delta is up 221% from the pandemic low of March 2020, while United has soared more than 400%. American is up only 28%, held back by leverage and operational concerns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet American is making improvements, meaning that its catch-up rally could soon start playing out. The average analyst price target of nearly $18 implies the shares will climb more than a third from a recent $13.32. Citi analyst John Godyn says the stock should rise even more, to $21, about 60% higher than where it trades today.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In January, American reported a disappointing fourth quarter, but that was largely due to a large drop in government revenue amid the shutdown — and the fact that the company didn't provide any updated mid-quarter financial targets accounting for the event. American delivered strong full-year guidance, as it expects earnings per share of $1.70 to $2.70 in 2026, the midpoint of which is easily above the then-average analyst estimate of $1.97, even with the big expense of canceled flights related to winter storm Fern.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After two years of earnings declines, 2026 could be the year EPS expands: Consensus has moved up to $2.09 a share, nearly six times the 36 cents American earned in 2025. On average, analysts are modeling for nearly 30% EPS growth in 2027, to $2.72, as the company makes progress on its debt burden and leans into its premium offerings, which have proved lucrative for its peers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both United and American performed poorly during earnings season. Godyn chalks that up to overblown worries that the companies are fighting over market share in Chicago. \"Without another shoe to drop, we believe that the negative Chicago narrative has largely peaked for now,\" he says. \"United and American are most likely to bounce in the short term.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>American is also benefiting from trends that are supporting other big carriers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Problems at ultralow-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines are legacy carriers' gain. Travel demand has remained robust, especially among higher-income Americans. Delta said that revenue from its premium offerings surpassed that of its main cabin for the first time in history in the fourth quarter, and American likewise was upbeat in its commentary about growth from well-heeled fliers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Robust premium sales, healthy corporate travel, and signs of improved bookings are all positives that lead Bernstein analyst David Vernon to believe that \"consensus EPS estimates for 2026 could go up double digits.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Likewise, American is making progress on its balance sheet. The company reduced its debt by more than $2 billion last year, and said that it expects to lower total debt below $35 billion in 2026, a year ahead of schedule.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The last earnings call \"sounded more like a 'normal' mainline carrier, as well, rather than a carrier that has been relatively apologetic about strategic and execution missteps over the last 18 months,\" says Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then there's the benefit American will see from its new exclusive credit-card agreement with Citigroup, which officially began on Jan. 1. The program is expected to generate an incremental $1.5 billion in annual earnings before interest and taxes by the end of the decade and be immediately beneficial to 2026 EPS.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are certainly risks to the American thesis. Many longtime airline skeptics might argue that fixing the business is more difficult than it appears. American has trailed its closest competitors for years. Its debt burden is still substantial. An economic downturn could quickly dampen consumers' vacation dreams, and another government shutdown might be a matter of when, not if, in the current polarized political climate. Weather-related issues, which reared their head again this week, will also weigh on the outlook, if only for the short term.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet investors don't have to believe that American deserves a permanent part of their portfolio to see the near-term opportunity. If travel demand — particularly from wealthy and corporate fliers — remains strong, bookings keep climbing, and the company keeps improving its balance sheet, it's reasonable to think that the stock won't remain so far behind its legacy rivals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>American and its peers may never be \"set it and forget it\" holdings, but the stock can give investors at least a temporary lift.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Stay tuned for the next live Q&amp;A!

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jack Hough</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This isn't bear porn,\" insists an online memo that is said to have recently sent the U.S. stock market lower. What follows, of course, is Larry Flynt--level stuff, financially speaking: the porniest bear porn that a bear could ever porn. Artificial intelligence will apparently render much of white-collar work obsolete, leading to mass layoffs, falling spending, widespread defaults, a stock crash, a mortgage crisis, and plunging house values.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is a theoretical look back from 2028 — a \"scenario, not a prediction,\" according to the publisher, a subscription newsletter service called Citrini Research. Any investor panic the writing caused was short-lived, although if fiction can now tank stocks, I'm a little worried about what Moby-Dick means for SeaWorld's parent company, or Don Quixote for the wind energy sector.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stock buyers should look past the doomsaying. \"If you invest only for the worst-case scenario, you will never be invested,\" writes Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Wealth, of the Citrini upheaval. The challenge, however, is finding buys in what can look like a nothing-to-buy market. AI stocks are sliding from lofty levels, and as I discussed here last week, just about everything else has recently run up — value, small-caps, cyclicals, staples, and more. Is it better to suddenly get a 30% discount on a high-margin software maker that looks vulnerable to Claude Code do-it-yourselfers, or pay a 30% markup for something that's struggling to grow, like an off-patent drug marketer best known for hanky-panky pills that launched when Seinfeld was still airing new episodes? Nothing personal, Viatris.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To dig up some ideas for further research, I screened the S&amp;P 500 for stocks with recent Wall Street upgrades to Buy or some such, and in cases where shares have jumped year to date, I looked for earnings estimate revisions that help justify the gains, or a valuation that remains approachable. I viewed a lack of an AI story line as a plus, but not a requirement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Let's start with pizza and jelly. J.P. Morgan says it's time to nibble on Domino's Pizza, citing market share gains and what it calls remarkable stability — only 23 units out of 7,186 have closed over the past three years. The stock, at 20 times this year's earnings, is down this year despite a broader restaurant run-up. Investors might be nervous over comparisons with February through May last year, when Domino's rolled out stuffed crust, a DoorDash partnership, and a $9.99 deal for any pizza. JPM says no problem, and that expanded chicken offerings should help.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>BofA Research's bullish turn on J.M. Smucker stems from the company saying recently that takeovers aren't a strategic focus. That's good, because it's $5.6 billion deal for Hostess in 2023 has already been written down by about $2 billion. BofA views the damage there as done; Hostess has shrunk from 15% of company revenue to 11%. Meanwhile, around three-quarters of Smucker's revenue comes from stuff that's fairly safe from being hit by obesity meds, like coffee, pet food, peanut butter, and overseas products. Shares are up 20% this year but still trade at around 12 times projected earnings for the next four quarters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Southwest Airlines shares are up 23% this year, but the earnings consensus is up twice as much. Both TD Cowen and UBS recently turned sweet on the shares. TD likes that rising industrywide demand is meeting restrained supply. UBS predicts more upside to come from Southwest's new fees for bags, assigned seats, and extra legroom. Shares fetch 12 times earnings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Landman fans know the Permian basin as the dusty surrounds of Midland, Texas, where Billy Bob Thornton's character smokes and swears his way through corporate skulduggery, drug cartel run-ins, and family fireworks, against the backdrop of a shale drilling boom. The reality, oilwise, is that output there is huge but flattening, and big operators are focused on cash flow, not growth. Attention has turned to the relatively untapped Stabroek Block, 120 miles off the coast of Guyana.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chevron is acting prudently in the Permian, according to recent upgrader Melius Research, and its deal last year for Hess makes it a big Guyana player. It's also first in line to profit from rebuilding output in Guyana's neighbor, Venezuela. The shares are up too much for comfort, 22% this year, and at a glance, they cost too much, at 27 times earnings. But they're a more reasonable 16 times free cash flow, and earnings after this year could double in as little as three years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rayonier needs a new name, in case you have any ideas. Maybe DoubleWood — a merger on Jan. 30 combined its two million acres of timberland with PotlatchDeltic's just over two million acres. The combined real estate investment trust has a half dozen sawmills and a big plywood facility, and intends to keep the dividend in line with Rayonier's recent payout, suggesting a yield of 5% or so. Raymond James, which went to Strong Buy from Outperform on the stock, sees share buyback potential. DoubleWood, or whatever name the company will announce later this quarter, also stands to make money from real estate development and deals for solar, carbon storage, and minerals. Shares trade at 14 times projected funds from operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One more from Raymond James: Genuine Parts. It was up 21% for the year at one point, but now it's down 5%. Earnings came in well short of estimates, and management announced a plan to separate its automotive business from its industrial one. The shake-up might have cheered investors, except that the stock's plump dividend yield and 70-year history of payout increases will get a rethink at the time of the split. The analyst who upgraded shares to Strong Buy calls the setup \"constructively asymmetric,\" which is Wall Street for more to gain than lose, and he points to sum-of-the-parts math: Valuing the peppy industrial part at 15 times earnings, North American auto at 10 times, and overseas auto at eight times yields a $145 stock price, versus a recent $117.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Jack Hough at jack.hough@barrons.com.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jessica Toonkel, Joe Flint, Dave Michaels and Lauren Thomas</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For six months, the son of one of the world's richest men kept hearing the same unfamiliar word: No.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even before he closed a deal to combine his company with a much bigger one, David Ellison was already plotting to do it again. Once his Skydance Media took control of Paramount, he turned his attention to a Hollywood icon, launching an audacious takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery that would give the Ellison family control of a sprawling media empire.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>His first offer was swatted away. So were his second and third. By the time Ellison made his sixth offer, Warner Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav stopped responding to his texts. Even when Warner officially accepted a rival offer from Netflix, Ellison refused to take no for an answer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As the battle dragged on, Ellison sweetened his offers, ratcheted up the pressure, took the hostile bid directly to shareholders, threatened a bruising proxy fight, brought in President Trump allies to lobby, and treated the existing term sheet like paper waiting to be shredded.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the ninth offer, the wealth and influence of the Ellisons finally won.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The dramatic bidding war ended on Thursday night, after Paramount made its latest attempt to buy Warner for $81 billion — and Netflix walked away from the deal. Shortly after photographers snapped Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos leaving the White House, the company announced that it wouldn't match Ellison's latest offer, which was 63% higher than his first.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And once Netflix dropped its own $72 billion deal for Warner's studios and HBO Max streaming business, the scion of software billionaire Larry Ellison was poised to become one of the most powerful people in a town that once derided him as a nepo-baby.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ellison, 43 years old, as Paramount chief executive will now control much of our attention: the shows we watch, the news we consume and the screens we stare at all day long, with a family portfolio that will include HBO, CNN, CBS News, the historic Warner Bros. studio lot and crown jewels such as DC Comics and Harry Potter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As much as Ellison and his team had been telling anyone who would listen that his business would ultimately prevail in buying a company five times its size, the reaction on Friday from Hollywood to Washington to Wall Street was astonishment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount's stock price shot up over 20% on Friday. Netflix's surged nearly 14%. Politicians howled at the prospect of so much media power being consolidated in the hands of a single family. Thousands of employees across three companies were left wondering what comes next at a time when the future of the entertainment business has rarely been so uncertain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even the CEO at the center of the action said he was surprised by the ending.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We all thought it was going to be Netflix,\" Zaslav told staffers in a companywide town hall, adding that the speed of the drama \"feels a little whiplashy.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deal could take anywhere from six to 18 months to close. Ellison will need to cut a lot of costs to find $6 billion in savings to make the deal work. But that didn't stop Paramount's leadership from popping Champagne, which they drank out of paper cups, Thursday afternoon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Only days earlier Paramount was preparing its next move if it didn't win. It had a slate of director nominees lined up for a proxy fight and planned to submit them as soon as this past week if Warner refused to accept Paramount's latest, sweetened offer, according to people familiar with the matter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Late last Saturday night, Ellison called Zaslav with the structure of the deal that met Warner's demands. The duo talked again on Sunday and Monday as they scrambled to get as much settled as possible for a Monday midnight deadline to stop talking, people familiar with the matter said. Ellison promised his father would contribute additional funding to satisfy lenders, if needed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, Netflix executives were discussing standing down. Sarandos and fellow co-CEO Greg Peters had said they would be disciplined on price, and if Paramount was going to increase its offer to $31 a share plus add-ons, the company would likely bow out, said people familiar with the discussions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ellison began his quest in earnest with a September visit to Zaslav's Beverly Hills home, once owned by legendary Paramount studio chief Robert Evans. Ellison proposed a $19-per-share cash-and-stock bid for the company and followed up with a formal letter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Warner rejected the Ellison overture as inadequate, favoring Zaslav's existing plan to split the media and entertainment empire in two — one company for the movie and TV studios and HBO Max, the other containing TV networks including CNN and Food Network.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount made two more offers, at one point even offering Zaslav the opportunity to be co-chairman and co-CEO of the combined company with Ellison if a deal happened.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unpersuaded, Warner in October announced a strategic review, effectively setting up an auction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix's Sarandos had told associates that if Warner did go through with spinning off its cable networks, he wanted to make a play for the streaming and studio businesses, according to people familiar with the discussions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix executives internally have over the years discussed how M&amp;A might help the company grow, which would be a departure from its long-held preference for building rather than buying, said people close to the discussions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before Ellison bought Paramount, Netflix had approached former Paramount controlling shareholder Shari Redstone about buying the company's studio a number of times. But she didn't want to sell, according to people familiar with the situation. The company had also discussed bidding for MGM, said people familiar with the discussions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In November, Netflix offered to buy Warner's studios and HBO Max streaming business. So did Comcast.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In December, Ellison lobbed in his sixth bid, saying Paramount had offered a package that covered all the issues Warner had raised, including the need for \"strong cash value\" and \"speed to close.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Soon after, Warner declared Netflix victorious. It agreed to sell the key assets for $27.75 a share, or $72 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Three days later, Paramount announced it was taking a tender offer directly to shareholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As Ellison doubled down, Warner and Netflix signaled to the market that their deal was moving forward. Warner distributed photos of Zaslav walking the Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank with Sarandos and Peters, smiling in front of the studio's famed water tower. Paramount executives shared the photos among themselves, and some rolled their eyes over them, according to people close to the company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, Ellison was making inroads in Washington. He offered assurance to Trump administration officials that if he bought Warner, he'd make sweeping changes to CNN, a common target of President Trump's ire, The Wall Street Journal first reported.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Just days after going hostile, Ellison sat in President Trump's box at the Kennedy Center honors. Paramount chief legal officer Makan Delrahim, the former Trump Justice Department antitrust head, oversaw a lobbying campaign that encouraged Republican lawmakers and administration officials to question Netflix's bid. Delrahim himself ramped up the pressure, touting Paramount's messaging online and engaging in the deal talks, including by holding meetings with investors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For his part, Sarandos had been laying the groundwork for the Netflix deal for some time — going back and forth to D.C., said people familiar with the situation. Netflix had hired its own veteran of the first Trump administration, Clete Willems, who had a team of GOP advisers, including Kellyanne Conway and Brian Ballard.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix was working with a deficit of political support from the start, because they could not rely on Democrats, Hollywood's natural allies. Top Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) opposed the merger from the start.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In January, Ellison ramped up the pressure. Paramount threatened to run a proxy fight to secure seats on Warner's board and filed a lawsuit seeking to force Warner to release more information about its deal with Netflix.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix shareholders were steadily losing patience. The company had over $170 billion wiped off its market value since last September, when reports started to surface that it could be a potential bidder for Warner.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Senators from both major political parties grilled Sarandos at a February Judiciary Committee hearing, expressing concern about the market power of a Netflix-Warner tie-up. Sarandos said repeatedly that Netflix was committed to maintaining the Warner Bros. studio theatrical-movie business and planned to continue to operate itself and HBO Max as separate entities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The tide began to shift in Paramount's favor in mid-February. Paramount indicated to Warner that it would up its price to $31.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a key move that helped get Warner's attention, Paramount amended its proposal to add an unusual takeover provision, what it called a \"ticking fee\" of 25 cents a share, which it would pay to Warner shareholders for each quarter its deal hasn't closed, starting January 2027. Paramount said it would pay the $2.8 billion termination fee Warner would owe Netflix if that deal collapsed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix agreed to allow Warner to discuss Paramount's latest proposal during a seven-day negotiating period ending on Feb. 23, saying it would clear up the situation once and for all.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After the negotiating window ended, Warner's board said it determined that Paramount's newest offer could reasonably be expected to lead in a deal superior to its existing one with Netflix. In addition to raising the price to $31 a share, Paramount increased its regulatory termination fee to $7 billion and accelerated the ticking fee to start after Sept. 30 rather than next year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the days before Paramount's revised bid was submitted, Netflix executives discussed walking away instead of continuing the bidding war, according to people close to the discussions.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>The latest Jane Street debate on X is meeting a blunt rebuttal from Ari Paul. The BlockTower founder, who says he used to work as a Wall Street market maker 15 years ago, argues that Bitcoin’s failure to push higher is better explained by spot sell-side than by a long-running suppression campaign.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paul’s answer was direct. “In short: no,” he wrote, before adding that market makers do “game the system” in many ways, but that in liquid products such as BTC ETFs, the effect is usually limited to “meaningful but small costs to consumers,” not a lasting distortion of the underlying asset price. He framed the distinction as one between short-term microstructure games and a broader claim that one firm kept Bitcoin from reaching far higher levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Bitcoin Manipulation? Small Moves, Fast Reversions</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>To make that case, Paul pointed to the kind of behavior traders on desks know well. “For example, market makers may manipulate the price to run stop limit orders,” he wrote. “But that’s typically on an intraday timeframe. So they might run an asset like MSFT or BTC 2% in a weak market to trigger stops, then a few seconds or minutes later, the price is mostly back to where it was before.” In his telling, that is still manipulation, but it is not the same as structurally pinning Bitcoin below some imagined fair value for months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That argument lands against a more conspiratorial narrative now circulating online, why Bitcoin is not already at $150,000. Paul’s pushback does not deny that large Wall Street firms can shape short-term trading conditions. It rejects the stronger claim that such activity is the central explanation for Bitcoin’s broader price path.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paul’s core point was much less dramatic. “Why is BTC down? Because OGs sold tens of thousands of coins, and not enough people wanted to buy them.” That line closely matched the view from renowned on-chain analyst James Check, who argued that “Jane Street didn’t suppress the Bitcoin price” and that “HODLers all did,” by selling large amounts of spot into the market.</span></p><div class=\"container-n2KCMK3i\" data-qa-id=\"tweet-widget-container\"><blockquote class=\"blockquote-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"header-n2KCMK3i\"><span class=\"profile-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"avatar-n2KCMK3i\"></div><div class=\"name-n2KCMK3i\">_Checkmate 🟠🔑⚡☢️🛢️</div><div class=\"username-n2KCMK3i\">@_Checkmatey_</div></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"logo-n2KCMK3i\" role=\"img\"><svg height=\"28\" viewbox=\"0 0 28 28\" width=\"28\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M19.75 5h3.07l-6.7 7.62L24 23h-6.17l-4.84-6.3L7.46 23H4.4l7.17-8.16L4 5h6.33l4.37 5.75L19.75 5Zm-1.24 16h1.7L9.54 7H7.7l10.8 14Z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path></svg></span></div><div class=\"description-n2KCMK3i\"><p class=\"\"><span>Jane Street didn't suppress the Bitcoin price folks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>HODLers all did.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's just not that hard, stop summoning your inner salty goldbug but blaming manipulators.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>People.

However, you do not need that as the central argument to explain why the price didn’t go higher, nor why it went lower. That can be well and truly explained by looking at spot sell-side.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paul did leave room for exceptions. He wrote that there are rare cases where Wall Street manipulates an asset in major ways over a longer period, but said those cases are uncommon because they are risky and harder to profit from than people assume.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“There are rare exceptions where Wall Street manipulates an asset in major ways longer term, but this is quite rare because it’s very risky and not as easy as it looks to profit. 99% of the time that an asset isn’t moving like you want and people are crying “manipulation”, it’s best to embrace the cognitive dissonance, avoid the “easy way out” of blaming manipulation,” Paul wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That leaves the current Jane Street argument in a narrower frame. Yes, large firms can influence intraday flows, liquidity, and execution quality. But based on Paul’s account, that is a long way from proving that one market maker is the reason Bitcoin is not trading materially higher.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notably, the Jane Street theory picked up fresh attention after Terraform Labs’ wind-down administrator sued the firm in Manhattan federal court, alleging insider trading tied to Terra’s 2022 collapse. The complaint says Jane Street used a private chat called “Bryce’s Secret” to obtain non-public information and alleges an 85 million UST trade on Curve that helped trigger a selloff; Jane Street has denied wrongdoing and called the case opportunistic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At press time, BTC traded at $66,090.</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:588.28125px;max-width:1200px;aspect-ratio:2.039840637450199\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:2f5df22bf094b-64b3eaa3d5891e699b4d6afc44491007-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"Bitcoin price chart\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:2f5df22bf094b-64b3eaa3d5891e699b4d6afc44491007-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#f5f4f4\"/></picture></div></button></figure></span></div></div>",

PAUL, Minn., Feb. 27, 2026 /PRNewswire/ — Today, St. Paul-based AgriBank announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2025, with strong profitability, credit quality, and liquidity and capital.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Highlights:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Profitability: Net income remained strong at $1.0 billion for the year   ended December 31, 2025. AgriBank's year-to-date return on assets (ROA)   ratio of 52 basis points was slightly above the target of 50 basis   points.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Credit quality: Total loan portfolio credit quality remained strong, with   99.2 percent of loans classified as acceptable at December 31, 2025.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Liquidity and capital: End-of-the-quarter liquidity was 147 days, well   above the regulatory requirement. Capital also remained well above the   regulatory minimums and company targets. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>\"AgriBank delivered another year of strong financial results in 2025, reflecting disciplined growth, prudent balance--sheet management, and the underlying strength of our District,\" said AgriBank CEO Jeffrey Swanhorst. \"Higher net interest income was driven by favorable retail loan spreads and increased wholesale loan volume, while credit quality, capital, and liquidity remained strong. Together, these factors position AgriBank to continue providing reliable funding and financial solutions to our Farm Credit Association--owners as they support farmers, ranchers, and rural communities through challenging economic and market conditions.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2025 Results of Operations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net interest income was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2025, an increase of $143.8 million, or 13.5 percent, compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher spread income on retail loans in AgriBank's asset pool portfolio and on AgriBank's wholesale loan portfolio due to an increase in volume. These factors were somewhat offset by decreased spread income on investment securities due to the mix of investment securities. The benefit of equity financing in net interest income increased compared to the prior year, due to higher levels of equity partially offset by a decline in interest rates. Equity financing represents the benefit of non-interest bearing funding. With interest rates moving lower during the second half of 2025, opportunities were taken to call and refinance debt at lower levels. While some loans have followed this pattern, the repricing or conversion of loans has been slower, resulting in wider retail interest rate spreads.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-interest income was $113.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2025, an increase of $5.0 million, or 4.6 percent, compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily related to an increase in loan fees due to marginally higher conversion and commitment fees generating additional income during the year. The increase in non-interest income was partially offset by the reduction in mineral income related to lower oil prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-interest expense was $235.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2025, an increase of $19.1 million, or 8.8 percent, compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase was mainly due to dealer incentive expenses related to AgriBank's crop input financing portfolio. Loan servicing expense increased due to asset pool activity during 2025 and the second half of 2024. Additionally, contractor fees added to increased purchased services expense related to additional resources for technology projects during the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Loan Portfolio</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total loans were $177.9 billion at December 31, 2025, an increase of $13.2 billion, or 8.0 percent, compared to December 31, 2024. This increase was primarily attributable to wholesale loan growth and increases in retail loans from expanded participation in asset pool programs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AgriBank's credit quality reflects the overall financial strength of District Associations and their underlying portfolios of retail loans. AgriBank's portfolio was composed of 99.2 percent acceptable loans at December 31, 2025, compared to 99.4 percent at December 31, 2024. Loans classified as acceptable represent the highest-quality assets. The credit quality of AgriBank's retail loan portfolio decreased slightly to 94.9 percent classified as acceptable at December 31, 2025, compared to 95.7 percent acceptable at December 31, 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Agricultural Conditions</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On February 5, 2026, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS) released its initial forecast of the U.S. aggregate farm income and financial conditions for 2026 and updated its 2025 forecast. The revised 2025 net farm income forecast of $154.5 billion represents a $27.0 billion increase from the 2024 level, up 21.2 percent, driven by increasing direct government payments and animal and animal product cash receipts, which more than offset rising expenses. When adjusting for inflation, the 2025 net farm income forecast is $28.4 billion, or 22.0 percent, above the 10-year average (2015-2024) net farm income in 2026 dollars. The initial 2026 net farm income projection of $153.4 billion represents a decrease of $1.2 billion, or 0.7 percent, from the revised 2025 net farm income forecast, and if realized, would be $24.3 billion, or 18.8 percent, above the 10-year average net farm income in 2026 dollars.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many factors, including weather, trade, government and monetary policy, global agricultural production levels, and pathogenic outbreaks in livestock and poultry, may keep agriculture market volatility elevated. Implementation of cost-saving technologies, marketing methods, and risk management strategies will continue to cause a wide range of results among the respective agricultural producers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Capital Resources and Liquidity</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total capital remained strong at $10.5 billion as of December 31, 2025, an increase of $1.0 billion compared to December 31, 2024. The increase was driven by AgriBank's strong net income and the issuance of capital stock, which were partially offset by cash patronage declared, consistent with AgriBank's capital plan. AgriBank exceeded all regulatory capital minimum requirements, including additional regulatory buffers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $25.4 billion and $25.1 billion at December 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. AgriBank's end-of-the-period liquidity position represented 147 days coverage of maturing debt obligations, which supports operational demands, and was well above the 90-day minimum established by AgriBank's regulator.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About AgriBank</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AgriBank is part of the customer-owned, nationwide Farm Credit System.
