At the SEC, DOGE staff mostly focused on slashing contracts before turning to pushing for deregulation, Reuters has previously reported.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Trump in February appointed     Musk to run DOGE     outside the normal confines of government in a bid to \"dismantle government bureaucracy,\" which the pair said was wasteful and bloated.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Eliezer Mishory, who has led DOGE's SEC work and was the group's only representative at the agency in recent months, has concluded his work, said the sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity as the information in not yet public.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    An SEC spokesperson said the agency was unable to comment due to     the government shutdown    .  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    DOGE's     arrival at the SEC     in the early days of the Trump administration coincided with a broad-based effort to slash the federal workforce and     eliminate whole     agencies, causing many SEC rank-and-file to     fear for their jobs    .   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     Critics said DOGE's work at the SEC marked a new level of White House involvement at an agency conceived by Congress to operate independently of the executive.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    It was unclear how much of DOGE's efforts would have a lasting imprint on the SEC.
