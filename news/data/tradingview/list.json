Democrats must flip only three Republican-held seats to wrest back control of the House.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Democratic-controlled Virginia Senate on Friday approved a proposed constitutional amendment — passed earlier by the House of Delegates — that would let lawmakers redraw congressional districts next year if voters sign off. The 21-16 vote fell along party lines.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Virginia Democrats hold six of the state's 11 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and hope to gain at least two more by reconfiguring their districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Friday's action was the first step toward bypassing the state’s independent redistricting commission — created by voters in 2020 — and taking control of the map-drawing process.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The amendment must pass again in the next legislative session and then be approved by voters. Democrats plan to hold the second vote early next year after Tuesday’s statewide election and to put the measure on a special election ballot.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>        AN UNPRECEDENTED REDISTRICTING WAR</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This year's widening coast-to-coast redistricting scramble is unprecedented in modern U.S. politics.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Virginia Republicans, including Governor Glenn Youngkin, whose constitutionally limited four-year term ends in January, accused Democrats of attempting a power grab. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This amendment is being proposed not to protect our citizens or to make our government better,\" Republican state Senator J.D. \"Danny\" Diggs said on the chamber floor on Friday. \"This amendment is about increasing the political power of the Democrat Party.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Republicans also criticized the Democrats for pursuing their redistricting agenda after early voting was already under way for Virginia's gubernatorial race, in which Youngkin's Republican lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, trails Democratic former U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger in opinion polls.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Democrats say they are fighting fire with fire after Trump unleashed a rare mid-decade redistricting push starting in Texas, where the legislature enacted new maps designed to flip five seats to the Republican column. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The system is being rigged by a wannabe dictator out of Washington,\" Democratic state Senator Aaron Rouse said on Friday during debate over the bill.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At Trump's behest, Missouri and North Carolina followed Texas with their own redistricting measures aimed at picking up one additional Republican seat each. Indiana's Republican governor has called a special session next week to consider redistricting, and Republicans in Florida and Kansas have also said they are weighing redrawing their maps.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the deeply Democratic-led state of California, the party launched a redistricting counter-offensive seeking to flip five Republican-held seats, a plan that requires voter approval in a special election on Tuesday. As in Virginia, California's lawmakers and voters must alter their state's constitution to clear the way for a new partisan map.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The process of redistricting - the periodic redrawing of the boundaries that define each state's congressional and legislative districts - has traditionally been conducted just once a decade to account for demographic changes following the decennial U.S. Census.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have used redistricting to draw congressional maps to favor their own party, a practice known as partisan gerrymandering.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OHIO REACHES BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In Ohio, state law required a new map this year because the previous map - under which Republicans won 10 of the state's 15 U.S. House seats last year - was passed with no Democratic support.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Ohio Redistricting Commission, which includes five Republicans and two Democrats, unanimously approved a new map on Friday that makes two Democratic incumbents more vulnerable to Republican challenges next year, while shifting another competitive Democratic-held district further to the left.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While favorable to Republicans, the map represents a compromise struck between Republicans and Democrats reflecting the uncertainty each party could have faced if the commission had failed to reach an agreement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In that scenario, the task of redistricting would have reverted to the Republican-controlled legislature, giving lawmakers a chance to pursue a far more aggressive map. But any bill passed by the legislature would have potentially been subject to a Democratic-backed voter referendum that could have kept the old map in place.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under Friday's map, Republicans have 10 \"safe\" seats in 2026 while Democrats have two, according to Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, which handicaps congressional races. The remaining three seats are rated \"Leans Republican,\" \"Leans Democratic\" and \"Toss-up\" - all considered competitive.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Global regulators are quietly rethinking the toughest capital rules ever drafted for crypto holdingsafter a surge in stablecoin adoption forced a policy U-turn led by the United States. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's framework, originally designed in 2022 to keep banks away from high-risk digital assets, was interpreted by many lenders as a warning shot. But with the White House now actively backing regulated stablecoins through the newly enacted Genius Act, that old Wild West narrative no longer fits. The debate now centers on whether Basel's heavy-handed standards still make sense in a market that looks increasingly mainstream.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At issue is the 1,250% risk charge Basel applies to so-called permissionless tokens like Circle's USDC and Tether's USDTassets pegged to real-world reserves but operating on public blockchains. US regulators argue that treating these the same as Bitcoin could be outdated, particularly as stablecoins gain traction in payments and settlement systems. Some global peers, including the Bank of England, are seeking alignment rather than confrontation, while the European Central Bank prefers to push ahead and review later. Officials at the Fed, ECB, and Basel Committee have declined to comment, underscoring the delicacy of the talks now underway.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Europe, meanwhile, has already charted a different course. Under its latest banking package, stablecoins can be capitalized in line with the quality of their backing assetstypically cash and short-term US government debt. The Bank of England plans to unveil its own regulatory blueprint this month, signaling support for a coordinated global approach. Elsewhere, Singapore has delayed implementation by a year to maintain alignment, and Hong Kong may relax requirements for licensed issuers ahead of its 2026 rollout. With Basel having already postponed its crypto rules once in 2024, another delayor even a full recalibrationcould be in play as regulators race to catch up with an industry that no longer fits its old definitions.</span></p></span></div></div>",

The de-escalation appeared to be more a win for China than for the U.S., but also took a worst-case scenario off the table for markets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, the trade truce is fragile, temporary, and partial.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Among the highlights: Beijing delayed implementation for a year of expanded restrictions on rare earth exports that would have roiled global supply chains. The U.S. suspended changes to its \"affiliates rule\" that sharply expanded the number of Chinese companies on a commercial blacklist. China agreed to resume buying U.S. soybeans, and the U.S. halved its 20% fentanyl-related tariffs in return for Beijing doing more to curb flows of precursors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. held off on raising tariffs by 100% — a step previewed before the meeting — and delayed any further increases to reciprocal tariffs. Both sides suspended port fees that they imposed on each other. Overall, U.S. China tariffs fell from 57% to 47%, equivalent to a roughly $40 billion reduction in tariff revenue, BofA analysts estimate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Supreme Court will hear a case challenging many tariffs on Nov 5.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The takeaway among analysts: This was largely a commercial detente that put the relationship back to about where it was before the April tariff blitz sparked a wave of escalation, with no progress in dealing with the core issues behind the U.S.-China rivalry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For markets, the lesson may be to pay even less attention to the expected flare-ups and tit-for-tat. Both leaders look happy to find ways to reduce tensions. Markets may treat each bout of turbulence with less fear, especially if, as Xi suggested, the two \"stay the right course, navigate through the complex landscape, and ensure the steady sailing forward of the giant ship of China-U.S. relations.\" Trump plans to visit China in April, and Xi will later come to the U.S, giving the leaders opportunities to resolve future issues.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But many details are yet to be worked out on problems that have led tensions to flare. Although Trump said the two didn't talk about letting China buy Nvidia's more-advanced Blackwell chips, he said that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang would talk to Chinese officials. That leaves an open question about whether the U.S. will loosen restrictions on other chips and advanced technology.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It will be substantially more difficult for the U.S. to take meaningful counter-China or derisking actions, since the main lesson coming out of the summit is that the Trump administration will negotiate these actions and is sensitive to Chinese pressure,\" says Emily Kilcrease, director of the energy, economics, and security program at the Center for a New American Security and a former U.S. trade official. \"The idea of building leverage to force concessions from China has just been proven faulty, and future U.S. threats will be seen as empty.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beijing's leverage may be at its peak, though, analysts note. The U.S. has rushed to sign agreements with Malaysia, Australia, and other allies. A deal with Vietnam is meant to make it tougher for China to reroute its exports through other countries. Reducing U.S. dependence on China could take years, but China's need for the world to buy its exports makes it vulnerable, too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"That leads to this ironic negotiating stance in which it seems they need to be more cooperative to reinforce the existing order,\" says Logan Wright, a partner at Rhodium Group. While the air of cooperation lasts, investors can turn their minds to other matters. B</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
