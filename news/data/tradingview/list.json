This bears watching, says CIBC Capital Markets, as the Bank of Canada predicts a pickup in growth in 4Q. All told, Canada GDP in August fell 0.3%, versus an estimate for a flat reading. Statistics Canada's early estimate for September is that GDPedged upward by 0.1%. That would translate into a 0.4% annualized 3Q gain, or slightly below the Bank of Canada's forecast for 0.5% jump. \"The lack of momentum towards the end of the quarter may spook policymakers somewhat,\" says CIBC economist Andrew Grantham. The BOC cut its policy rate this week, to 2.25%, and signaled it would stay there so long as the economy unfolds as forecast. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)</span></p></span></div></div>",

The company is seeking to block the enforcement of the laws.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In North Dakota, State District Judge James Gion reduced the $667 million in damages awarded against Greenpeace for its role in Dakota Access Pipeline protests. The amount owed to Energy Transfer is now capped at $345 million, with the judge ruling some damages were excessive or duplicative.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, the European Court of Human Rights sided with Norway’s government in a climate case brought by young activists who argued Arctic oil exploration endangered their future.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What to Watch​</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Click here for a brief video explainer on how climate change is impacting hurricanes and typhoons, as scientists say that oceans have absorbed about 90% of the warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions over the last 40 years.

The biggest surprise came from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who pushed back against the market's sanguine view about a rate cut in December. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both Treasuries and European government bonds were steady on Friday, but were set for weekly losses. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Two-year Treasury yields (US2YT=RR) - which move inversely to prices - ticked up to 3.61%, having risen 12 basis points this week already, while the 10-year yield </span><span> was above 4.10% again and up more than 10 bps for the week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Germany's 10-year Bund yields (DE10YT=RR), the euro area's benchmark, were broadly flat on the day at just under 2.65% and set for a weekly rise of 2.5 bps.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The rise in U.S. yields offered support to the U.S. dollar </span><span>, </span><span>, which was retesting this week's three-month highs at 99.58 against its major peers.      </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It left the euro </span><span> stuck at $1.1556 despite the ECB's  moderately more positive signals on Thursday. The central bank also published a survey on Friday showing euro zone firms are seeing a slight improvement in business conditions and that investment into sectors like artificial intelligence is booming.     </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"What the data this week suggests is that maybe we have got something fundamentally wrong about the impact of trade tariffs,\" Morgan Stanley's Chief Europe Economist Jens Eisenschmidt said, also highlighting the growth boost from AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It doesn't make me revise anything dramatically, but it makes me think,\" Eisenschmidt added, having also pushed back his forecast for the next ECB rate cut to March from December.      </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In commodities markets, oil prices were headed for a third straight monthly fall as a stronger dollar and the weak Chinese data cast a shadow, and as rising supply from major producers offset new Western sanctions on Russian exports. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Brent crude futures </span><span> slipped 0.2% to $64.88 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude </span><span> was at $60.38, down 0.8%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Spot gold prices </span><span> retraced some overnight gains as well to sit at $4,023 per ounce.
