Ahuja says margins are expected to increase over the course of this fiscal year, but won't show up in the first quarter, as costs related to the job cuts will still be trickling through.

The forecast includes a projection for $50 billion in artificial-intelligence revenue, double what Dell (DELL) posted for fiscal 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"AI server demand remains exceptional,\" CFO David Kennedy said on the company's earnings call.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dell shares were up 10% in Thursday's extended session.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At a time when the market is jittery about the impact of component shortages and rising memory prices on consumer-electronics businesses, Dell posted a 20.5% gross-margin rate for the fiscal fourth quarter, slightly above its forecast. The company is also comfortable with the supply it has to fulfill its revenue guidance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From an operating-margin standpoint, the company has been benefiting from a greater mix of storage products as well as more sales of its own intellectual property. Both of those things have favorable profit profiles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Don't miss: Memory-chip stocks are still quite cheap - especially if you look overseas</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the fiscal fourth quarter, Dell posted a 14.8% operating margin for its infrastructure-solutions business, which includes servers and storage offerings. The company posted a 240-basis-point improvement there relative to its performance in the fiscal third quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dell COO Jeff Clarke also expressed confidence in the company's ability to meet its mid-single-digit operating-margin target for AI servers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We clearly have a lot of backlog to clear, with $43 billion in backlog,\" he said on the earnings call. \"That backlog will ship at mid-single digits.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Management discussed how \"input costs are rapidly changing,\" forcing strategic decisions for the company. Dell raised prices on traditional servers in December, a move that helped stabilize margins. With its client-solutions group, which includes personal computers, Dell was more deliberate as it has also been focused on winning market share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Our business grew 18% in a market that grew 10%,\" management said, indicating that the focus on market-share gains has yielded results. The company did raise prices in January and saw stabilization of margins as a result.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See also: Arista succeeds where Cisco came up short - to the benefit of its stock</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the fiscal fourth quarter, Dell posted adjusted earnings per share of $3.89 on revenue of $33.4 billion. Both of those figures were records. Analysts tracked by FactSet were modeling $3.53 and $31.7 billion, respectively.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dell also boosted its quarterly dividend by 20% and increased its buyback authorization by $10 billion. The company previously announced a commitment to double-digit dividend increases, on a percentage basis, through fiscal 2030.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read: Block plans to lay off nearly half its staff in 'deliberate and bold' embrace of AI</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Emily Bary</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
