The central bank on Friday said it would cut the risk reserve requirement ratio for financial institutions conducting foreign-exchange forward trading to zero from 20%. The move makes \"it less punitive for market participants to bet against the yuan,\" Maybank analysts say in a forex research and strategy report. The PBOC also set the USD/CNY fixing at 6.9228 today, much higher than median estimate of 6.8435, the analysts note. \"Along with the fix, it is clear that [the] PBOC wants the yuan appreciation pace to slow,\" they add. USD/CNY rises 0.2% to 6.8548, USD/CNH is 0.1% higher at 6.8492, LSEG data show. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

While the recovery remains tentative, holding above this psychological threshold may help stabilize short-term sentiment, particularly if broader crypto market conditions continue to improve. However, the sustainability of this rebound will depend largely on liquidity conditions and follow-through demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Recent CryptoQuant data adds an important structural dimension to this move. Ethereum’s 30-day Realized Volatility indicator on Binance has surged sharply, now approaching 0.97 — its highest reading since March 2025.

Increased price dispersion indicates that capital is reallocating, derivatives positioning is adjusting, and liquidity is being tested across spot and futures venues. If this process continues alongside sustained demand, it can precede a decisive directional move as uncertainty resolves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, volatility alone does not guarantee trend continuation. In some instances, prolonged high volatility without a breakout simply reflects indecision, producing extended sideways ranges while participants wait for stronger macro or liquidity signals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At present, Ethereum appears to be near such an inflection zone. Historical patterns suggest that similar volatility regimes have occasionally preceded upward expansions, yet confirmation would require sustained price acceptance above key resistance and evidence of renewed capital inflows rather than purely speculative repositioning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Ethereum Tests Critical Support After Prolonged Downtrend</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ethereum remains under pressure despite a recent bounce toward the $2,000 area, with the chart showing a clear medium-term downtrend following the rejection near the $4,800 peak. Successive lower highs since late 2025 confirm a persistent bearish structure, while the price continues trading below the 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages.

Repeated tests of this area indicate buyers are defending it, yet each rebound has weakened in amplitude.

If Anthropic declines, Hegseth has threatened to invoke the Defense Production Act to make the company do what the military wants, or to designate the company a supply-chain risk, impairing its ability to work with other government contractors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic has refused to accept the military's proposal and doesn't let users deploy its Claude models in scenarios involving mass domestic surveillance or autonomous weapons.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amodei reiterated the company's red lines in a public statement Thursday. \"We cannot in good conscience accede to their request,\" he said. The company said the military's latest proposal would effectively undo those guardrails.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Contract language the company received overnight from the Pentagon, \"made virtually no progress on preventing Claude's use for mass surveillance of Americans or in fully autonomous weapons,\" an Anthropic spokesman said. \"New language framed as compromise was paired with legalese that would allow those safeguards to be disregarded at will.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Emil Michael, the undersecretary of war for research and engineering, said in a post on X that mass surveillance is already illegal under the Fourth Amendment. Michael said the department \"won't have any big tech company decide Americans' civil liberties.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thursday evening, he posted that Amodei, \"wants nothing more than to try to personally control the U.S. Military and is ok putting our nation's safety at risk.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Pentagon's fight with the company escalated after an Anthropic employee asked a counterpart at data-mining company Palantir Technologies, its partner, whether Claude was used in the raid to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Pentagon officials found out and viewed the question as a challenge to the military's ability to use AI as it sees fit. Anthropic has said the discussion was a routine technical conversation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In preparing to label Anthropic a supply-chain risk, Pentagon officials have reached out to defense contractors including Lockheed Martin and Boeing in recent days to gauge how much they use Claude, people familiar with the outreach said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Designating the company a supply-chain risk and invoking the Defense Production Act would be a nearly unprecedented escalation against a U.S. company, AI and security experts said. The threats \"are inherently contradictory: one labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security,\" Amodei said in his statement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The threats have highlighted the Pentagon's dependence on Anthropic. It was the only company with approval for use in classified settings before the Defense Department agreed to approve Elon Musk's xAI, which agreed to the Pentagon's use of its AI in all lawful scenarios.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Google and ChatGPT maker OpenAI are also used by the Pentagon in unclassified settings and talking to the Defense Department about potential approval for classified work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An online petition began circulating late Thursday signed by employees of both companies asking them to take the same approach as Anthropic in negotiations with the Pentagon regarding autonomous weapons and mass surveillance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The dairy producer's earnings are expected to be partly supported by stable demand for its core liquid milk products, regional contributions and new product launches. Operating margins might also widen in the near term, due to lower average selling prices for whole milk powder and a stronger ringgit. Maybank maintains its buy rating on the stock and target price of MYR2.95. Shares are 2.6% lower at MYR2.60. (amanda.lee@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
