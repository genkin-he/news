Pfizer now has four days to negotiate changes to its original proposal, it said. And if Metsera determines the new offer remains better, it has the right under the terms of its agreement with Pfizer to terminate the Pfizer deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shares in Nasdaq-listed Metsera surged nearly 20% in premarket trading. Novo Nordisk shares fell around 2% in Copenhagen. Pfizer was down less than 1%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pfizer said in a statement that the attempt by Novo Nordisk to unwind its deal is \"reckless and unprecedented.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The proposal is illusory and cannot qualify as a superior proposal under Pfizer's agreement with Metsera, and Pfizer is prepared to pursue all legal avenues to enforce its rights under its agreement,\" Pfizer said. It added that its deal creates \"real, certain and immediate value\" for Metsera shareholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The back and forth and rare unsolicited offer for a biotech exemplifies the heat of the weight-loss drug market today. The prescription injectable drugs are ringing up billions of dollars in sales. Metsera promises a pill version, which industry officials view as the next big opportunity in the fast-growing space.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Novo Nordisk had already attempted privately to acquire Metsera. According to a securities filing detailing the background of the deal, Metsera's advisers had been holding meetings with another party in addition to Pfizer and weighing their competing offers. That other party was Novo Nordisk, according to people familiar with the matter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, Metsera ultimately went with Pfizer because it decided that Novo Nordisk's offer carried too much risk, including regulatory concerns, the people and the filing said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last month, Pfizer agreed on a deal for Metsera, as it maneuvers to get back into the obesity space and take a slice of the burgeoning market. It scrapped its experimental weight-loss pill earlier this year over concerns about potential liver damage.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If Pfizer were to lose the Metsera deal, it would be detrimental to its efforts to rebuild in the weight-loss category.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For Novo Nordisk, a deal would bring Metsera's pipeline of developmental injectable and oral obesity treatments to its portfolio, including a once-monthly jab that is in Phase 2 development.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Novo Nordisk has been on a shopping spree in recent months as part of a major shake-up at the company that began with the appointment of a new chief executive earlier this year. Mike Doustdar has moved to reshuffle the leadership team and boost the pipeline of drugs after the company started to lose market share in the obesity market to rivals and alternative products.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last week, Novo Nordisk said it would replace its chairman and other board members after the Danish pharma giant's controlling shareholder pushed for more changes to revive the company's success in the weight-loss market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is vying with Eli Lily, which is seeing surging demand for its GLP-1 weight-loss drugs and is preparing to launch a new weight-loss pill.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Novo Nordisk said Thursday: \"We would not have made this bid if we did not believe that a deal could gain approval, but a potential deal will of course be subject to the usual regulatory approvals.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Lauren Thomas at lauren.thomas@wsj.com and Dominic Chopping at dominic.chopping@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
