            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Steven M. Sears</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financially savvy people with substantial wealth ultimately discover that managing tax liabilities is as important — and maybe even more so — than making money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By proactively managing taxes, it is possible to reduce the amount of money paid to the U.S. government, which, of course, increases the amount of money that one keeps. This is why sophisticated investors rely on financial advisors, accountants, and tax lawyers, who often work in concert.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aside from generation-skipping trusts and other estate-planning tools that shield a family's hard-earned assets, there is a simple strategy that anyone can and should use each year: doubling down on high-conviction stocks that have stumbled.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The strategy entails reviewing your stock positions and identifying shares that are trading for less than their original purchase price. Once you complete that portfolio review, buy a corresponding number of shares at the current market price and then wait 31 days.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After that period, you can sell the original batch of stock and register a realized loss on your taxes — the difference between the initial purchase price and the sales price. At the same time, the cost basis of the stock is reset to the price of the second batch of stock, which raises the odds of paying lower taxes when you ultimately liquidate the position.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is critical that an investor holds both positions for 31 days. If the stock is sold before 31 days have passed, the transaction violates the Internal Revenue Service's so-called wash-sale rule. When that happens, the tax loss isn't allowed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deadline for doubling down without violating the wash-sale rule is Nov. 28, according to Michael Schwartz, Oppenheimer &amp; Co.'s chief options strategist.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anyone who is interested in this strategy should consult their accountant and tax advisor. It is important that tax professionals are aware of what is happening in a client's investment portfolio.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The double-down strategy isn't suitable for all stocks. It is best used when a favored, high-conviction equity has run into trouble and tumbled lower.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Because there is risk in doubling down on a fallen stock, Schwartz favors using call options in case the stock never recovers. Call options, which represent 100 shares of the associated stock, increase when stock prices rise. Calls are often used as stock proxies whenever investors want to establish investment exposure to an idea or stock without using a lot of money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Options always cost less money than buying the associated stock. One drawback, however, is that stock dividends, if applicable, aren't enjoyed by options investors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consider Chipotle Mexican Grill, a popular choice for those who crave healthy foods prepared quickly. The stock has ranged from $38.30 to $66.74 over the past 52 weeks. After getting slammed in Thursday trading, it was hovering at $32.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company recently approved a $500 million stock buyback, but investors remain concerned about weak earnings and high valuations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bullish investors who bought the stock higher and want to reset the stock price could buy a December $36 call that expires in 2026. After 31 days, the original stock position with a higher cost basis could be sold to record a tax loss.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Any gains on the option would be treated as long-term capital gains, assuming you hold it for more than a year and sell it before it expires, Schwartz says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the stock fails to rally and remains below the call strike price, the trade fails. The money spent on the call would be lost.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The only solace is that calls cost less than buying the equivalent number of shares, so not as much money is at risk — which is why this tax strategy lends itself to options.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Email: editors@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",

The data fog is due to the government shutdown, now in its fifth week and on track to beat longevity records.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While shutdowns typically exert a temporary drag of 0.1% to 0.2% on GDP growth for every week that they are on, activity mostly recovers after the shutdown ends. Any stock market disruption has also been short lived. This partly explains why the current government shutdown has turned mostly into a background noise for markets. More than that, alternative data show that economic momentum has remained positive in the second half of 2025, supporting our view of no recession in the near term...</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Dallas Fed Weekly Economic Index, which tracks weekly changes in consumer behavior, the labor market, and production, and is scaled to the year over year change in real GDP, implies growth of 2% to 2.5% in Q3 and so far in Q4.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Veneta Dimitrova</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sunny Season for Stocks</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paulsen Perspectives Oct. 30: The S&amp;P 500 is at an all-time high. Nonetheless, historical stock market seasonals are suggesting the S&amp;P 500 may continue rising at least until next summer. Positive seasonals are comforting but are far from infallible. While not definitive, they do provide a nice foundation for stock investors headed into the winter months — particularly when economic policies are becoming more accommodative, S&amp;P 500 earnings momentum remains strong, stock market participation seems to be broadening, and valuations outside of new-era names still remain relatively attractive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Confidence on Main Street remains near record lows, suggesting there is still considerable room for pessimism and fear to abate and be replaced by rising confidence, fueling both economic and stock market successes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jim Paulsen</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Housing Trends Are Troubling</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Early Morning With Dave Rosenberg Research rosenbergresearch.com@substack.com Oct. 30: As the equity market gets propelled by the relentless AI trade, not every sector is joining in on the party. The Homebuilding stocks have rolled over by more than 16% from September highs, even with lower mortgage rates. The Residential REITs sector has slumped to an 18-month low and is back into an official bear market (down by almost -22% from the nearby peak). Rates are lower, but it is the reason they are lower that matters: cracks emerging in the labor market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Significant incentives weren't enough to prevent the likes of D.R. Horton from reporting a decline in its quarterly profits, with the builder's gross margin on home sales slipping to 20% from 21.8% in the past quarter, with average prices deflating by -3% from year-ago levels. This is an industry-wide phenomenon. [There are] stagnant home sales, economic uncertainty, aggressive incentive campaigns (add on mortgage buydowns), and price discounts. Tech doesn't need job creation — but housing does.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adding insult to injury was the news that pending home sales in September, a bellwether leading indicator, came in flat versus a consensus forecast of 1.2%. At a depressed 74.8 reading, it lines up in the bottom 7% of all time and it really says something that it is lower today than at the depths of the housing-induced recession in November 2008.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>David Rosenberg</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Improving Outlook for Oil</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investment Commentary Wells Fargo Investment Institute Oct. 27: Last week, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil traded near the 2025 low in the mid-$50s before U.S. sanctions on Russian oil producers caused a late-week spike...</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What now? We believe a modest softening of the economy in the near term, combined with OPEC+'s seemingly aggressive intention of adding oil supply, will keep oil prices under pressure in the coming months. However, we believe this supply deluge will eventually ease. WTI oil prices are below the $65 average breakeven cost for new oil wells in the U.S. This suggests that U.S. oil production growth will likely stall, as it becomes unprofitable for an increasing number of domestic oil producers to drill new wells as oil prices decline further. Additionally, the OPEC+ campaign to increase production is on track to conclude in 2026, notably tightening the global oil-supply spigot.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking through to year-end 2026, we forecast the improving supply outlook, coupled with a reaccelerating economy, will push WTI oil prices into our target range of $65 to $75 per barrel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Austin Pickle</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>10 Dividend \"Cushions\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sector Watch CFRA Oct. 27: The S&amp;P 500 is trading at a price/earnings ratio of 24 times next-12-month earnings projections, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ. This is a 42% premium to its 20-year average and more than two standard deviations above the long-term mean. The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology sector trades at a 66% premium to its 20-year average, while Communication Services (43%), Consumer Discretionary (41%), and Industrials (47%) also trade at extremes to their long-term averages...</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors concerned about a possible pullback in prices might want to look to dividends as correction cushions. Granted, not all high-yielding stocks are worth buying. Like blades of grass that stick up too far and end up being trimmed back, stocks may sport elevated yields due to unsustainable payout ratios (dividends as a percent of earnings) that may get reduced, possibly trimming the stock price along the way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here are 10 of the highest yielding stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with [Buy or Strong Buy] rankings by CFRA analysts, with dividend payout ratios of 75% or lower: Comcast, EOG Resources, Exxon Mobil, Hasbro, Invesco, Merck, Omnicom Group, Target, J.

            "title": "Income Investing: Want High Yields? Have a Look at Mortgage REITs. — Barron's",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Amey Stone</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you need current income and are concerned that interest rates are headed lower, take a look at mortgage real estate investment trusts, or mREITs. Don't back up the truck, but with yields of 14% or more, a little can go a long way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MREITs are publicly traded companies that manage pools of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. They can focus on residential or commercial mortgages, or a specific region. They live in the esoteric world of high-yielding, often highly leveraged income plays like business development companies, or BDCs, and closed-end funds. That leverage allows them to pay out far more in dividends, typically monthly, than the mortgage income they collect.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The biggest mREITs are Annaly Capital Management (NLY) and AGNC Investment (AGNC), which both yield 14%. They trade at a premium to their book value per share, which suggests it isn't a great time to jump in, but that's just one of many factors to weigh. Perhaps more salient: MREITs tend to get a tailwind when the Federal Reserve lowers rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But make no mistake, these income plays are very complex and can be volatile. They generally trade based on the spread mortgages earn over Treasury yields (the wider the better). Like banks, they usually benefit from a steep yield curve so they can borrow at lower rates and lend at higher rates, improving their net interest margin. The yield curve steepened this year, but predicting what the Fed will do next is no easy task.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MREITs stumbled about 1% on Wednesday when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said investors shouldn't count on a December rate cut. In March through early April, mREITs fell about 20% due to worries that the Fed would be reducing MBS held on its balance sheet and that the federal government might not maintain its implicit guarantee of agency MBS, and because of economic pain set off by tariffs. The yield spread on MBS got very wide and then came back in as the mortgage market recovered, but is still wider than historically, says Peter Federico, CEO of AGNC.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fact is, it's truly hard to predict how mREITs will perform based on interest rates or the real estate market because they are highly complex and can deploy a variety of hedges. That's the main argument for buying a passive vehicle, says Coulter Regal, a product manager at VanEck Funds. \"If you're not willing to do a deep dive into individual mREITs, we think a broad basket is a great way to get access to the whole industry,\" Regal adds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are two main index exchange-traded funds. The iShares Mortgage Real Estate (REM) yields 8.4% and has returned 9.5% year to date. VanEck Mortgage REIT Income (MORT) has returned 7.7% year to date and yields 13%. Annaly, AGNC, and Starwood Property Trust (STWD) make up more than a third of each fund.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mark Grant, chief global strategist at Colliers Securities, argues that mREITs' monthly income stream matters more than fluctuations in stock prices. He highlights three that focus on residential mortgages: AGNC; Armour Residential REIT (ARR), which yields 18%; and Orchid Island Capital (ORC), which yields 19%. My colleague Paul R. La Monica recently covered 9% yielder Rithm Capital (RITM), which focuses on the recovering office market and is the fourth largest holding in Van Eck's mREIT ETF.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Federico says lower mortgage rates could boost the value of AGNC's long-duration holdings (since fixed-income prices move inversely to interest rates). But if mortgage rates fall too fast, prepayments could crimp the value of existing MBS. He's encouraged that the federal government reaffirmed its implicit guarantee of agency mortgages earlier this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is a fascinating time in our market,\" he says. \"There are so many crosscurrents.\" For him that's fun. Investors who like to stay atop trends and earn double-digit yields might find it gratifying, too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Amey Stone at amey.stone@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "title": "Funds: In Search of Warren Buffett's Fund Heirs — Barron's",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Lewis Braham</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's hard to imagine anyone taking Warren Buffett's place. But at 95, the investing legend is retiring as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at year end. And with the once-sleepy textile company he acquired in 1965 now a trillion-dollar conglomerate, it will be difficult for even the savviest successor to maneuver such a behemoth to trounce the market like Buffett once did.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While Barron's has identified conglomerates such as Fairfax Financial Holdings that mimic the company's business structure as \" Berkshire Hathaway wannabes,\" there are also fund managers who have successfully emulated Buffett's investment style. Their funds have key features — concentrated portfolios, both value and quality factors, and good corporate governance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As Buffett once described his strategy: \"Keep all your eggs in one basket, but watch that basket closely.\" With a plethora of index funds holding hundreds of stocks, Buffett's concentrated active style is becoming increasingly rare. \"If you want to get a result that's different than the index, you can't look like the index, which means you're going to have different weightings,\" says Chris Davis, manager of the Davis Select U.S. Equity exchange-traded fund, which recently held just 26 stocks. \"But you can get a lot of diversification with 25 or 30 stocks.\" Davis isn't just a Buffett fan; he's on Berkshire's board of directors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One risk of such concentration is \"lumpy\" returns that differ widely from the index, both for better and worse. That's something fund investors interested in Buffett's style must accept. But they shouldn't tolerate another risk — individual company blowups, which fail the \"watch that basket\" concentration test. Infamously, the Sequoia Fund, which Buffett himself once championed, imploded when its portfolio stake in Valeant Pharmaceuticals grew to over 30% in 2015 and the stock subsequently collapsed during a regulatory investigation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Davis rarely lets a position in his portfolio grow above 10%. But he points out that owning a large stake in a conglomerate like Berkshire, which Sequoia did successfully for many years, is different than owning Valeant, as Berkshire is more diversified within its business lines and thus more resilient to downturns. That resilience is further strengthened by Buffett's focus on high-quality businesses with consistent cash flows, strong balance sheets, and what Buffett calls \"economic moats.\" Having a moat requires a durable business model with features that thwart competitors, such as patents, a strong brand name, and monopolistic control.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The so-called quality factor captures some of this strategy quantitatively. Morningstar defines it as a combination of a company's 12-month return on equity and its debt-to-capital ratios, favoring high cash flow and low debt. (The lower the quality rating's number, from 1 to 100, the better.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One top-performing concentrated fund with 24 stocks and a strong Morningstar quality rating is FullerThaler Behavioral Unconstrained Equity. Manager Raymond Lin seeks overlooked stocks suffering from investors' cognitive biases, meaning that the market underreacts to good news or overreacts to bad. But the companies should also be Buffett's kind of durable businesses to survive a bad economy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If we really want to see a clear example of underreaction or overreaction, and we are very strict about these downside [protection] criteria — where we want oligopolies and monopolies that have positive free cash flow and low levels of debt — we're not talking about a large group of companies that can meet all of those criteria,\" Lin says. \"So, what we found is 20 to 30 holdings is really the optimal number.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Of course, Buffett is also a famous value investor, but it's increasingly hard to buy high-quality companies cheaply today. Most concentrated funds tend to tilt in one direction — toward value or quality. Yet the savviest value managers see durable businesses that don't score as well quality-wise as current tech darlings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One such Buffett heir is manager Bill Nygren of the Oakmark and Oakmark Select mutual funds and the recently launched Oakmark U.S. Large Cap ETF. He often finds high-quality businesses in sectors that overall are considered more cyclical and lower-quality than tech. For this reason, an oil company like Phillips 66, with a price/earnings ratio of 13, sits beside search-engine giant Alphabet, with a 25 P/E, in his funds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Phillips 66 is a very high-quality midstream and [oil] refining business, but the businesses themselves are never going to be viewed as being as great as Alphabet's, and we're fine with that,\" Nygren says. He likes owning resilient companies like Phillips when the entire oil sector is cyclically out of favor and waiting for a recovery.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interestingly, Nygren's less-concentrated Oakmark fund, which holds 54 stocks, has been the better performer over the past 15 years than Oakmark Select, which has 26 — indicating, perhaps, some of the risk of concentrating too much on more cyclical names. The new ETF could be the happy medium, holding 36 names. Another fund, Hotchkis &amp; Wiley Value Opportunities, has also succeeded by combining high-quality tech with more cyclical but resilient value stocks. It holds 60 stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tilting more toward quality than value is GMO U.S. Quality. It holds 36 stocks but has a hefty 41% tech weighting and a 22 portfolio P/E, versus the Oakmark ETF's 13. But like Buffett did with his Coca-Cola position in the 1980s, GMO manager Tom Hancock recognizes the \"intangible value\" of companies with intellectual property and strong brands like Microsoft and Meta Platforms that traditional valuation metrics can't capture. \"These great companies tend to do better over time than you might think, \" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>True, but it seems doubtful anyone will ever match Buffett's record in a market where the best companies aren't cheap.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to editors@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "title": "Diversify Out of AI With Boston Scientific Stock — Barron's",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>The AI rally has many investors wondering where to turn in anticipation of its end. The medical-device maker is one solid option. By Jacob Sonenshine</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors seeking a stock unrelated to artificial intelligence should take a look at Boston Scientific.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The historic rally in everything AI has inevitably led to thoughts about how the whole thing will end. Maybe some companies' earnings will disappoint the market? Or maybe something more widespread will occur, like Big Tech significantly reducing its spending expectations? The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has seen several days when it was deeply in the red recently, which could foreshadow a true drawdown if any of these — or other — risks emerge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With all this in mind, we look to medical-device makers. These companies are constantly enhancing their products to help improve patients' health. For example, Intuitive Surgical's new versions of its robotic surgery machines have helped the stock rise 23% in the past month, and Abbott Laboratories' newest glucose-monitoring device has brought its stock close to new highs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In cardiac health, innovative products are giving surgeons more confidence in their decisions to operate. Spending on cardiac procedures in the U.S. is expected to grow at just over 7% annually through 2030, to about $92 billion, driven mostly by an aging population, according to Grand View Research.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Boston Scientific is at the heart of it. Of its $20 billion in 2025 sales forecast by analysts, $13 billion is expected to come from its cardiovascular segment, up 23% year over year, according to FactSet. Some of that is because of small acquisitions and currency fluctuations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, not all the growth is priced into the stock, which is trading at $100, even after its recent rally. Analysts are forecasting a 13% increase in sales of cardiovascular products next year, to $14.9 billion. The company said at its September investor day that it expects low-double digit growth over the long term as it takes market share. Analysts aren't doubting that right now, especially after the company continued its record of beating quarterly earnings estimates on Oct. 22, with greater-than-expected cardio revenue in the third quarter amid larger-than-anticipated sales across every segment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Part of the cardio growth story is the Watchman product, a small implant that closes the left atrial appendage of patients with atrial fibrillation, or AF. This product is intended for patients who can't take blood thinners to stop blood clots. Watchman lowers the likelihood of blood clots, in turn reducing the risk of stroke.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Watchman sales grew 35% in the third quarter, reaching over 600,000 patients, or 12% of the five million total addressable market estimated by the company. The implant is preferred right now versus Abbott Laboratories' competing product, Amplatzer, judging by hospital purchases. Roughly 90% of their purchases of AF products are for Watchman implants, according to a physician survey from BTIG analyst Marie Thibault.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That isn't a surprise. The American College of Cardiology, a group of professionals that publishes medical journals, concluded Watchman has caused fewer postprocedural medical complications and is currently the safer product.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That story could continue in the first half of 2026, when Boston Scientific releases results of its Champion-AF trial. This clinical trial, reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration, will publish results for Watchman FLX, the latest version of its heart implant. FLX aims to improve the healing process and close larger appendages. Positive results on its effectiveness and safety would underscore Boston Scientific's ability to continue to grow its presence with heart surgeons — and potentially spark stock gains.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Watchman isn't the only avenue through which Boston Scientific can protect its competitiveness. With large profit margins and hefty free cash flow — an expected $3.4 billion this year, and growing — the company has acquired dozens of small companies over the years. An example: It bought Elutia's BioEnvelope business for $88 million in September. Elutia sells small materials that protect cardiac patients from postoperative complications, such as infection. It's the type of deal that allows Boston Scientific to package multiple products in its offerings to surgeons, providing a competitive advantage.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Acquisitions are also instrumental in the other areas of Boston Scientific's business, including medical surgical, or MedSurg, which analysts expect to grow close to 10% annually over the long term. A subsegment of that business is urology, for which the company bought Axonics for $3.7 billion in 2024. Axonics makes an implantable device that treats bowel and bladder conditions, such as overactive bladder.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Urology sales could reaccelerate next year, CEO Mike Mahoney said on the third-quarter earnings call. Sales were interrupted after Medtronic asked the International Trade Commission to block the sale of the products over alleged patent infringements. Late last year, a jury found that Axonics didn't infringe on Medtronic's patents for competitive products. The companies reached a settlement, and Axonics products are selling without restrictions again. Management expects improving growth over the course of 2026, another potential catalyst that could unlock more confidence from the market — and stock gains.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Overall, Boston Scientific could grow total sales by 11% in 2026 to $23.4 billion, according to FactSet. Sustaining such growth can bring profit margins a touch higher over time, as it can outpace the increase in operating expenses such as employee compensation and depreciation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This would spur midteen earnings per share growth annually over the long term, especially as Boston Scientific continues to repurchase shares and onboard acquisitions. The company says it will prioritize deals over buybacks, but the deals will increase EPS if they are accretive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Given management's tendency to do deals and deliver higher-than-expected growth, EPS growth could approach 20% annually, says Andrew Choi, a portfolio manager at Parnassus Investments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That would pump the stock higher, partly because it isn't as expensive as it could be. Shares trade at 30 times expected EPS for the coming 12 months, below its peak of 36 times this year and just a 20% premium versus the iShares U.S. Medical Devices exchange-traded fund's 24.9 times. When Boston Scientific shares hit peaks this year, the premium was 28%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So, the stock could trade at a larger earnings multiple — and benefit from higher earnings, particularly as the market sees continued evidence that Boston Scientific can continue to take market share. \"If they do 11% [sales growth], there's a path toward value creation\" for shareholders, says Choi.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This doesn't mean there aren't risks: The Champion-AF trial results for Watchman could disappoint, pressuring expectations for Watchman demand, or Abbott could significantly improve Amplatzer's safety.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We doubt those risks will materialize, a key reason being that Boston Scientific can spend a lot of money on research and development to keep its offerings competitive. Analysts expect almost $2 billion of such spend this year, close to Abbott's $2.8 billion. But Abbott has to spread that spending across far more businesses, including diabetes care, while Boston can use most of that money to focus on heart-related care.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the whole, Boston Scientific demonstrates an excellent risk/reward scenario for patients — and for those who want to buy the stock.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Share your questions and thoughts in the \"Conversation\" section below to   engage directly with the author and our community   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Receive alerts about more content from this author by clicking \"Follow\"   next to the author byline at top   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Stay tuned for the next live Q&amp;A!

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Megan Leonhardt</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of the best views of waves breaking off Maine's rugged coast can be seen from Ogunquit's Marginal Way, a coastal cliff walk in the southern part of the state. But storms and erosion have taken a toll, threatening the structural integrity of the roughly 1.5-mile trail. Erosion, by its nature, can weaken foundations over time, leading them to crumble under pressure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. labor market looks to be undergoing a similar sort of erosion, with hiring stalled as employers weigh months of economic and policy uncertainty. Yet, while conditions may not be as \"stable\" as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated this past week, there are indications the market's foundation is much stronger than that of Marginal Way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For one, the number of people filing for unemployment benefits hasn't shot up, at least not yet. The Labor Department hasn't released official estimates of weekly initial jobless-claim volumes since early October, due to the government shutdown, which began Oct. 1. But Citigroup economists estimate on the basis of available state data that initial jobless claims fell to 220,000 filings for the week of Oct. 25 from 232,000 in the prior week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That alone signals the number of Americans losing their jobs, even in the midst of a government shutdown, hasn't reached alarming levels. Mike Reid, senior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, credits healthy corporate fundamentals, noting that profit growth was strong in the third quarter. Reid says he would be concerned if weekly claims rise above 275,000.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Higher-income households, bolstered by stock market and home-equity gains, have continued to spend, boosting corporate revenue and earnings and driving broader economic growth. Bank of America reports that total credit-card spending per household rose 0.8% in the year ended Oct. 25. That has helped keep employment in the retailing business \"surprisingly stable\" in recent months, says Lisa Simon, chief economist at Revelio Labs, which maintains a workforce database.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Moreover, more small businesses said in the latest National Federation of Independent Businesses survey that they are planning to hire. The hospitality sector posted the strongest rebound in hiring in October, with monthly payroll growth up 13.8%, breaking a two-year pattern of October declines, according to data from Homebase — a provider of employee management software to about 150,000 small businesses, which collectively employ about two million people. The transportation and logistics sector recorded monthly payroll gains of 4.8% in the month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Education and healthcare, which have driven much of the job growth this year, likely will continue to add jobs as well, Revelio's Simon says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Private payrolls, in general, may have ticked higher in recent weeks. ADP reported on Tuesday that total private employment grew by a four-week moving average of 14,250 jobs in the week ended Oct. 11, up from a four-week average gain of 10,750 jobs in the week ended Oct. 4.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The pickup suggests that the hiring freeze that has plagued much of the labor market in recent months may be easing, although the recovery is \"tepid,\" says ADP chief economist Nela Richardson. She cautioned that the weekly pulse data are estimates and that recent hiring patterns have been volatile week to week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To be sure, the job market isn't as robust as it was a year ago, or even back in April — and the risk of more layoffs shouldn't be discounted. Data from Indeed, a leading job-search website, show that job-posting levels are trending down month over month in nearly every industry sector, even though posting levels in the aggregate are still 2% above a prepandemic baseline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Small businesses, which employ nearly half of all U.S. private sector employees, have been especially conservative in their hiring decisions. Only three of 13 industries showed positive momentum in October on a smoothed three-month basis, Homebase noted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We probably have hit the bottom in terms of the deceleration of employment growth,\" says Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But Uruci doesn't expect to see 100,000 monthly payroll additions again soon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon.com, General Motors, Paramount Skydance, and United Parcel Service all announced significant workforce reductions over the past week that collectively totaled more than 65,000 job cuts. So far, layoffs have been driven primarily by company or industry-specific issues.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the past year, town officials in Ogunquit approved plans to reinforce Marginal Way and fortify it against future erosion. So, too, the U.S. labor market can be shored up by continued consumer spending, business investment, and policies that promote economic growth. The latest layoff headlines sowed fears of a jobs recession, but the reality, so far, looks more encouraging.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Megan Leonhardt at megan.leonhardt@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Now plunging stock and token prices are testing their strategy. By Adam Clark</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The boom in companies holding large stocks of cryptos has been a hot play this year, but that trade is now at risk of imploding and dragging down the rest of the sector with it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The public companies, known as crypto-treasury stocks, have been pouring funds into cryptocurrencies, but now that strategy faces its first real test as stock and token prices plunge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hoarding digital currencies was in vogue in the early part of 2025. The success of Strategy, helmed by Michael Saylor, led hundreds of public companies to follow its lead and add crypto tokens as a \"treasury\" asset. The company, formerly called MicroStrategy, currently holds more than 3% of the world's Bitcoin.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Companies' stocks surged immediately after announcing plans to buy up cryptocurrencies, but have since fallen back. 180 Life Sciences more than quintupled when it began buying Ethereum and rebranded as ETHZilla. Eightco soared 3,000% in a single day on plans to amass Worldcoin.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investments by listed corporations topped $100 billion, according to Galaxy Research, helping drive crypto's total market value to a record of more than $4 trillion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the surge is waning. More than a quarter of the public companies that adopted a Bitcoin treasury strategy now have a market capitalization below the total value of their digital-token holdings, according to K33 Research.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's a potential death blow. On the way up, crypto-treasury companies benefit from a virtuous circle — companies sell shares at a premium to their asset value, using that to acquire more tokens that then rise in value, driving higher share prices, and so on. But when share-price premiums disappear, new investors have little reason to buy stock instead of the token itself. Companies may then need to sell assets to cover costs or debt, triggering a downward spiral.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"In a market where rivals can clone the [crypto-treasury] model overnight and exchange-traded funds offer cheaper, cleaner exposure, the idea that a rich premium can endure was always a fantasy,\" wrote analysts at investment manager Kerrisdale Capital in a report this month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kerrisdale disclosed a short position in BitMine Immersion Technologies, which has more than three million Ethereum tokens and is valued at around $14 billion. Short-sellers typically aim to profit from a fall in a stock price. Kerrisdale previously said it was short on Strategy. It didn't respond to a Barron's request asking whether it maintained those positions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even within the crypto sector, skepticism is growing. BitMine CEO Tom Lee said the \"bubble has burst,\" on a Fortune podcast last week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You shouldn't be rewarded for doing something easy,\" Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, told Barron's at the European Blockchain Convention (EBC).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"A company that just followed the MicroStrategy [sic] playbook of buying Bitcoin and putting it in a box shouldn't trade at a premium to their Bitcoin. It should trade at a discount.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Falling valuations of smaller crypto-treasury stocks such as CleanCore Solutions — down more than 80% since starting to buy meme coin Dogecoin — have little wider impact. But drops for bigger holders such as Japan's Metaplanet, a top-five publicly listed Bitcoin holder that is down 65% in three months and now trades below its net asset value, could matter more if they are forced to sell their assets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The biggest player is Strategy, with more than 640,000 Bitcoin — almost all of its $82 billion market cap. Barron's wrote skeptically about the stock last December. Since then, Strategy's stock is down 25% and its premium has shrunk: its enterprise value to Bitcoin ratio is now about 1.4, down from more than 2.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A shrinking share price is one thing, but a falling asset value could compound the problems. Bitcoin surged to more than $124,000 earlier this month but dropped sharply when President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on imports from China. It now trades just over $110,400.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For believers, such crashes are minor setbacks. Standard Chartered's Head of Digital Assets Geoffrey Kendrick predicts the price of the world's largest crypto will reach $500,000 by 2028, pointing to gains in gold.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I see Bitcoin and gold as having a similar rationale,\" Kendrick told Barron's in an interview at EBC. \"The global asset market is probably well and truly underweight Bitcoin.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Strategy's average purchase price is about $74,000 a Bitcoin, giving it a profit cushion. It has issued $14.8 billion in debt and preferred stock, but its holdings cover that. A sustained downturn could force it to suspend dividends or pause buying. Some worry about its reliance on convertible debt that must be repaid in cash if the stock lags at maturity — though that's years away.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Just imagine MicroStrategy [sic] exits Bitcoin. I can't imagine the price the next day but people will cry,\" said Standard Chartered's digital assets product director Emilie Allaert, in a panel discussion at EBC.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Strategy didn't respond to Barron's requests for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The crypto-treasury wave has been a powerful catalyst for the sector in general but we are about to find out what happens when it recedes. At their simplest, such stocks act as a levered bet on the direction of the particular token they have decided to amass. And when prices go into reverse, leverage inevitably magnifies the pain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",

The de-escalation appeared to be more a win for China than for the U.S., but also took a worst-case scenario off the table for markets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, the trade truce is fragile, temporary, and partial.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Among the highlights: Beijing delayed implementation for a year of expanded restrictions on rare earth exports that would have roiled global supply chains. The U.S. suspended changes to its \"affiliates rule\" that sharply expanded the number of Chinese companies on a commercial blacklist. China agreed to resume buying U.S. soybeans, and the U.S. halved its 20% fentanyl-related tariffs in return for Beijing doing more to curb flows of precursors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. held off on raising tariffs by 100% — a step previewed before the meeting — and delayed any further increases to reciprocal tariffs. Both sides suspended port fees that they imposed on each other. Overall, U.S. China tariffs fell from 57% to 47%, equivalent to a roughly $40 billion reduction in tariff revenue, BofA analysts estimate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Supreme Court will hear a case challenging many tariffs on Nov 5.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The takeaway among analysts: This was largely a commercial detente that put the relationship back to about where it was before the April tariff blitz sparked a wave of escalation, with no progress in dealing with the core issues behind the U.S.-China rivalry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For markets, the lesson may be to pay even less attention to the expected flare-ups and tit-for-tat. Both leaders look happy to find ways to reduce tensions. Markets may treat each bout of turbulence with less fear, especially if, as Xi suggested, the two \"stay the right course, navigate through the complex landscape, and ensure the steady sailing forward of the giant ship of China-U.S. relations.\" Trump plans to visit China in April, and Xi will later come to the U.S, giving the leaders opportunities to resolve future issues.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But many details are yet to be worked out on problems that have led tensions to flare. Although Trump said the two didn't talk about letting China buy Nvidia's more-advanced Blackwell chips, he said that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang would talk to Chinese officials. That leaves an open question about whether the U.S. will loosen restrictions on other chips and advanced technology.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It will be substantially more difficult for the U.S. to take meaningful counter-China or derisking actions, since the main lesson coming out of the summit is that the Trump administration will negotiate these actions and is sensitive to Chinese pressure,\" says Emily Kilcrease, director of the energy, economics, and security program at the Center for a New American Security and a former U.S. trade official. \"The idea of building leverage to force concessions from China has just been proven faulty, and future U.S. threats will be seen as empty.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beijing's leverage may be at its peak, though, analysts note. The U.S. has rushed to sign agreements with Malaysia, Australia, and other allies. A deal with Vietnam is meant to make it tougher for China to reroute its exports through other countries. Reducing U.S. dependence on China could take years, but China's need for the world to buy its exports makes it vulnerable, too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"That leads to this ironic negotiating stance in which it seems they need to be more cooperative to reinforce the existing order,\" says Logan Wright, a partner at Rhodium Group.

Why shares could climb more than 25%. By Al Root</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Boeing went from a fairy tale to a tragedy in the blink of an eye. Now the story shifts to redemption — and it could pay off for the stock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Once viewed as the perfect cash-flow machine, Boeing has been through seven years of misery, largely of its own doing. Starting with the crash of two 737 MAX jets in 2018 and 2019, the company struggled to make headway with a corporate culture that had put engineering so far down its list of priorities that even the simple task of making sure the door on a plane was installed correctly seemed out of its reach after a blowout in January 2024. Just making planes had become a slog: At the end of last year, Boeing had delivered 265 737-model jets, less than half its annual target and down from 396 delivered in 2023. At Thursday's close, Boeing stock sat 55% below its March 2019 all-time high of $446.01.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sometimes, though, a leader emerges just when all hope seems to be lost. Kelly Ortberg has been that leader. Since being hired in July 2024 to replace Dave Calhoun, Ortberg, an engineer with decades of experience in the aerospace industry, has done the seemingly impossible: made Boeing stock investible again. He has improved supplier relations, shaken up management ranks, reallocated resources to new program development, and, perhaps most important, is spending more time in Seattle, near where the 737 MAX is produced.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Boeing stock has gained 7% since he was named CEO. Though shares declined after Boeing's third-quarter earnings release on Wednesday, they look set to rise even further as Ortberg demonstrates that the company's resurgence is real.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I love these stories,\" says Hightower Advisors Chief Investment Strategist Stephanie Link. \"Companies with good bones that have been so poorly run then get a good CEO.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Boeing declined to make Ortberg available for this article.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As much as Boeing's decline seems to start with the first MAX crash, the problems actually started nearly 30 years ago. In 1997, Boeing CEO Philip Condit and McDonnell Douglas head Harry Stonecipher orchestrated the merger of the two companies. While the deal was celebrated on Wall Street, it marked the start of Boeing's shift away from a focus on engineering planes toward financial engineering.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Condit moved the company's headquarters from Seattle to Chicago in 2001, a move designed to de-emphasize the core commercial aerospace business by separating management from production. It was a questionable decision and a culture killer. Things took another hit under Jim McNerney, who took over in 2005 and admitted out loud that \"cowering\" employees motivated him. After a painful nine-week strike in 2008, Boeing broke ground on its nonunion plant in South Carolina, where it makes the 787 Dreamliner today.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under McNerney, Boeing's financial path was set. From 2011 to 2019, a period that covered the development of the MAX through its grounding, Boeing spent about $49 billion on research and development and new plants and equipment, amounting to about 6.2% of sales. Airbus spent about $52 billion, or 9.4% of sales, over the same span. Boeing returned some $59 billion to shareholders over that period, including about $40 billion on share repurchases, which decreased shares outstanding from roughly 751 million at the start of 2014 to 568 million at the end of 2018.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It wasn't money well spent: Boeing was forced to sell some $16 billion in common shares at a paltry $143 apiece in October 2024 to help repair its ailing balance sheet. Boeing now has about 760 million shares outstanding, as well as convertible debt sold in October 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nothing, however, was as damaging as the development of the 737 MAX, which was brought to market by CEO Dennis Muilenburg in 2017. Boeing decided to modify the existing 737 platform to respond quickly to Airbus' A320neo family of jets. It turned out disastrously, with two deadly crashes due to malfunctioning sensors and new flight-control software. The crashes grounded the MAX worldwide for almost two years, tanking Boeing's earnings and cash flow. Dave Calhoun took over for Muilenburg and managed to get the MAX recertified for commercial flight. He announced his departure shortly after an emergency-door plug blew out of a 737 MAX 9 jet while in flight on Jan. 5, 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"At this point, everyone knows the story, right?\" says Yale School of Management lecturer Gautam Mukunda. \"[Boeing] has been brutally mismanaged for basically my entire adult life.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Enter Ortberg. The first thing investors need to know about him is that he is an engineer. He joined Rockwell Collins in 1987, and became president and CEO in 2013. Collins was eventually acquired by United Technologies — now RTX — in 2018. Ortberg left the company in 2021, serving on corporate boards until Boeing came calling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ortberg hasn't been afraid to reverse prior management's decisions. He has moved management back to Seattle so it could be near Boeing's workers. He raised cash by issuing stock and convertibles and selling portions of Digital Aviation Solutions to Thoma Bravo for more than $10 billion. He also stopped the development of the X-66 truss-braced-wing demonstrator plane — a futuristic concept designed to improve efficiency with long, thin wings — which might one day have produced technologies usable on a commercial jet, but was too far off to help in the next few years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gone, too, is the imperial management style that projected confidence when everything seemed to be working, but came across as hubris when the company ran into trouble. \"We have seen a far less arrogant tone,\" says Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard, who is also a fan of new Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave, who came over from Lockheed Martin. \"This improvement has also been noted by customers and suppliers, with a number now commenting that they have much more faith in Boeing actually delivering on its projections.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AeroDynamic Advisory aerospace consultant and managing director Richard Aboulafia called out two additional management changes as evidence of positive momentum: naming Stephen Parker to run Boeing's ailing defense business, and putting former Wisk CEO Brian Yutko, an MIT Ph.D. in aerospace, aeronautical, and astronautical engineering, in charge of commercial aircraft development. Ortberg \"isn't afraid of anyone with talent,\" Aboulafia says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He also isn't afraid to make nice when he has to. While 3,200 Boeing defense workers are currently striking in St. Louis, where the company makes the F-15 and F-18 fighter jets, its labor strife likely peaked with the seven-week strike that ended in November 2024. Current Boeing management could have offered more up front, says Yale's Mukunda, but a work stoppage might have been unavoidable, given the built-up animosity. Boeing workers won significant pay increases in their new four-year contract and a guarantee that the next narrow-body jet Boeing designs would be built in Washington state.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Boeing still has many problems to solve. The company isn't expected to make a profit in 2025, marking seven consecutive years of losses. It's the worst current streak for a company in the S&amp;P 500 and one of the worst streaks ever, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, which looked at the current components of the S&amp;P 500. No company in the index has lost more money since 2019 than Boeing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But there are signs of improvement. Demand, for one, hasn't been a problem for Boeing or Airbus for a while. People like to fly, and the industry has survived shocks including 9/11, SARS, and Covid-19. Today, Boeing has more than 6,600 unfilled orders on the books. The issue has been meeting customers' needs for more planes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the six years since the second tragic MAX crash in March 2019, Boeing has delivered about 2,200 jets. In the six years before the tragedy, Boeing delivered twice that many. Deliveries in 2025 should be about 600 jets, according to FactSet, up from fewer than 350 in 2024 but still nowhere near the 806 Boeing delivered in 2018.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Federal Aviation Administration capped 737 MAX production at 38 a month in the aftermath of the 737 MAX door-plug blowout. It recently raised the cap to 42 a month. Boeing will work toward 46 or 47 a month and, eventually, 50 MAX jets a month. Higher production could help it generate over $11 billion in free cash flow in 2028, Wall Street's current call.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's actually a pretty simple story at this point,\" says BofA Securities analyst Ron Epstein, who has a Buy rating on the stock. \"Can it deliver more airplanes? And if they can deliver more airplanes, they generate more cash.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Projecting Boeing's financial performance still isn't easy. Since the second MAX crash, Boeing has missed Wall Street estimates about 70% of the time — often by a wide margin. That is unheard of. Apple, by comparison, has missed earnings about 10% of the time over that span, while GE Aerospace — a Boeing peer that has evolved from its own turnaround story into a must-own, industry-leading stock — missed earnings about 25% of the time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And Boeing just missed estimates once again. The company lost $7.14 a share during the third quarter, hit by a $4.9 billion charge related to the long-delayed 777x program, much worse than Wall Street's expectation of a $5 per share loss. Third-quarter sales, however, rose to $23.3 billion, up from $17.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and the third consecutive quarter of revenue beats. Boeing also delivered 160 commercial jets, up from 116 a year ago, and reported its first quarter of positive free cash flow since 2023.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Valuing a mature company that hasn't made money in roughly seven years is complicated. BofA's Epstein uses \"normalized\" free cash flow of $11 a share to reach his $270 target — up 35% from a recent $200 — while Vertical's Stallard uses a combination of 2027 earnings and cash-flow multiples to reach the same valuation. Another way is to look at where Airbus trades on 2028 free cash flow. It earns a multiple of 22, and a comparative valuation implies a price of up to $300 for Boeing stock — up 50% — with the difference between that and today's value reflecting the need for investors to buy into the turnaround story.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other catalysts can build confidence, too. Boeing is working on certifying the 777X and the 737 MAX 7 and 10 — the 10 is a longer version of the 7 — for commercial service. Timing is uncertain and dependent on regulators, but all three planes should be ready for delivery to customers in 2026 or 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What is clear is that the Boeing story is at the \"end of the beginning,\" to use Stallard's words from when he upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold in September. He had downgraded shares in 2020, but cited supply-chain improvements, stability in the defense business, and Ortberg for his sunnier view of the stock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And as the old problems recede, Boeing will be able to turn to the future. That will mean designing a new plane — a risk but an opportunity, too. A new plane will necessitate using tens of billions of dollars in cash flow spread out over a few years, but it can also help restore the market share it lost to the Airbus A320neo family, which has 70% market share of deliveries since the A320neo and MAX jets entered service. Beyond market share, a new jet would be another step in putting engineering back at the center of the company, something that is long overdue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Boeing is no longer denying the need for its creation, and they are no longer denying that they are looking at options,\" AeroDynamic Advisory's Aboulafia says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This way redemption lies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>\"The forgotten Goliath\" of the big banks is serious about shedding its reputation as an underachiever. CEO Brian Moynihan's future may depend on it. By Andrew Bary</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bank of America needs to up its game — and the banking giant is likely to unveil a blueprint for doing just that at its first investor day in nearly 15 years. It's time to consider making a deposit in BofA stock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bank of America will be holding an all-day investor event in Boston this coming Wednesday, and it will give investors a chance to hear from longtime CEO Brian Moynihan, newly appointed co-presidents Dean Athanasia and Jim DeMare, and other members of the leadership team.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The focus probably will be on growth and returns. While BofA stock has risen 21% this year, it lags behind rival JPMorgan Chase, which has gained 29% — a reflection, in part, of its lower returns, as measured by return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE. Moynihan looks set to outline how he hopes to close the gap on that key metric. The bank is likely to set a ROTCE target in the 16% to 18% range, up from the 14% so far this year and closer to JPMorgan's 21% return.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's a challenging task, but with one of the better earnings stories among top banks, the least-risky loan portfolio, and initiatives to boost returns, the bank has a good shot at hitting that target.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I expect higher growth, returns, and earnings,\" says Mike Mayo, the banking analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, who expects earnings growth of 13% next year to $4.35 a share before it rises as high as $6 a share in coming years. \"The question is not if, but when.\" He recently boosted his price target on Bank of America stock to $62 from $60, up 17% from a recent $53.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bank of America has a lot going for it. The company has one of the best franchises in banking, including the No. 2 consumer bank behind JPMorgan, a top five investment bank, and a leading wealth management arm led by Merrill Lynch. It's also a banking technology leader with the best virtual financial assistant in Erica, which has two million interactions a day with banking customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bank has also left a lot on the table. It's useful to compare it with JPMorgan, since the two companies have a similar business mix involving consumer banking, wealth management, commercial banking, investment banking, and trading. Since 2019, BofA's earnings are up by a third based on 2025 projections, while JPMorgan's have nearly doubled.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What's the problem? Mayo thinks the bank has been too timid, something that is reflected in the Federal Reserve's stress tests, with Bank of America showing the lowest losses relative to Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo in a downturn, thanks to the high credit quality of the bank's $1.2 trillion loan portfolio. But if Moynihan's mantra has been \"responsible growth,\" Mayo thinks it should pivot to \"more growth\" while maintaining appropriate safeguards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>BofA's credit-card loan portfolio, for instance, has been little changed over the past decade while JPMorgan and Capital One Financial have nearly doubled theirs. BofA hasn't chased co-branded credit-card deals as much as rivals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Its wealth management business has also lost some of its luster. Merrill Lynch used to be the dominant retail brokerage platform, but the business that was once known as the \"Thundering Herd\" for its bullish stance on America isn't making as much noise currently. Morgan Stanley now is the industry champ based on revenue, profits, and margins.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Over the past five years, Bank of America's wealth management revenue growth averaged 4% a year, against 8% for Morgan Stanley. Revenue growth did pick up to 8% this year. BofA's margins of 24% so far in 2025 were below Morgan Stanley's 29%. Morgan Stanley also has a better alternative-asset platform.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It hasn't helped investor sentiment that Berkshire Hathaway has steadily reduced its big stake in BofA by 40% since July 2024 to about 605 million shares, which are now worth over $30 billion. Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett hasn't said why he has reduced the stake, but he has soured on banks generally in the past five years, eliminating once-sizable holdings in Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs Group, JPMorgan, and Citigroup.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bank of America has also faced investor scrutiny over its poor decision to invest $500 billion in 2% U.S. agency mortgage securities at a historic low in rates, mostly in 2020 and 2021. That move has led to paper losses that stood at $71 billion on Sept. 30 and dampened the bank's interest margin as rates rose. Mayo calls that \"one of the worst mistakes under Moynihan's tenure,\" but, thankfully for the bank, accounting rules don't require the loss to be recognized in its capital position.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The good news is that the mortgage securities portfolio is slowly maturing, and that allows the bank to reinvest about $10 billion per quarter at yields that are two to three percentage points higher, helping to bolster its interest margin. The bank sees higher net interest income and margins in 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some of the bank's efforts have already started to pay off, with its third-quarter report showing a 31% gain in earnings to $1.06 a share. Bank of America pays a 2% dividend yield, in line with peers, and supplements that with about $20 billion annually in stock buybacks, for a total yield — dividends plus buybacks — of 7%. Mayo sees the possibility of even more share repurchases in the next two years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The investor day is also a chance for Moynihan, 66, to argue for more time as the head of the company. He wants to stay until the end of the decade, emulating JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, 69, who plans to remain at the helm for a few more years. Dimon deserves to stay, given the bank's superior performance and his industry stature; Moynihan's bid is less convincing, in light of the bank's mediocre showing. BofA stock has lagged behind shares of Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo over the past five years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Moynihan's efforts may depend on how well his investor day plan is received — and executed. He needs to turn the bank's performance from good to great to match peers, and there is the near-term risk that investors sell the stock on the investor day news since Wall Street is already anticipating good news. Still, at just 12.5 times 12-month forward earnings — below JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley — there's room for the stock to run if Moynihan gets it right.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mayo calls Bank of America the \"forgotten Goliath\" among the country's top banks. Moynihan has the chance to shed that label, deliver for investors, and keep the top job until 2030.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Slow-and-steady funds with a traditional mix of 60% stocks and 40% bonds are getting renewed attention for their recent outperformance. By Ian Salisbury</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Imagine winning the Indianapolis 500 while driving the family minivan. It sounds crazy, but it isn't far off the numbers put up this year by the American Balanced fund. The $270 billion fund is a classic 60/40 portfolio: Its mandate is to deliver slow and steady returns by keeping 60% of its assets in stocks and 40% in bonds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So far this year, American Balanced is up 17.6%, handily beating the typical large-cap stock fund, which has returned 15.9%, according to Morningstar. That might not sound like a big win, but it is for a fund with only 60% of its assets pegged to the stock market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While American Balanced is a standout, plenty of other 60/40 funds are delivering solid results. The $61 billion Vanguard Balanced Index fund, a bellwether for the group, has returned 14% this year. The average fund in Morningstar's moderate-allocation category has returned 12.4%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Those are impressive gains, considering the funds' big helpings of bonds — the safety-first shock absorbers that make up a big part of their appeal to cautious investors. Over the past century, the 60/40 strategy has returned 7.7% a year on average, according to Vanguard. That's far behind stocks' 10.5%. But the 60/40 strategy has never lost more than 19% in a single calendar year, according to Vanguard's data — while stock investors have seen maximum losses of more than 43%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A strong year may be just what 60/40 funds need to win back investors who feel betrayed by recent underperformance. Many 60/40 investors are still smarting from a terrible experience in 2022, when the funds' slow-and-steady strategy appeared to backfire. That was the year the Federal Reserve sharply hiked interest rates to fight runaway inflation, causing stocks and bonds to sell off in tandem. That year, 60/40 funds lost 14% on average, almost as bad as the S&amp;P 500's 18% decline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The results in 2022 were \"extraordinarily unusual,\" says Paul Benjamin, principal investment officer of the American Balanced fund, which saw a loss of 11.8% that year. Coming off ultralow yields, steep rate hikes by the Fed led to the worst Treasury market losses on record. \"Now we're at a much more normal level of rates,\" he says. \"We're unlikely to face a shock anything like that again.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Studies support the notion that 2022 was an anomaly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For instance, Morningstar found that, setting aside the 2022 debacle, investors in a 60/40 portfolio during 19 other bear markets since 1870 would have seen shallower declines and erased their losses more quickly than stock investors. \"There was only one period that saw more pain for the 60/40 portfolio than for the stock market — the period we're emerging from now,\" the study concluded.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Today, 60/40 funds look well positioned. Stocks are on a tear, delivering annualized returns of nearly 25% over the past three years. The market is pricey, with the S&amp;P 500's price/earnings ratio at 23, well above the 10-year average of 19. That has revived talk of a bubble, earning comparisons to the late 1990s, when stocks were last valued so richly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the S&amp;P 500 looks richly valued, however, it's largely due to tech stocks commanding such a big part of it. The S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight index is up 9.7% over the past year and trades at a more reasonable P/E of 17.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bonds are better positioned than they were three years ago. Today, 10-year Treasuries yield just around 4%, compared with less than 1.5% at the start of 2022. That's positive in two ways: It provides investors with more income to absorb declines in stock prices, and it gives the Fed more breathing room to cut rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The central bank appears set to cut rates four more times by the end of next year. That should give bonds a tailwind, since bond prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For investors looking for a simple, low-cost fund, Vanguard Balanced Index is an obvious starting place. The mutual fund, which comes with a rock-bottom annual fee of 0.07%, offers broad exposure to U.S. stocks and investment-grade bonds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Its 10-year average annual return of 9.4% places it in the top quintile among similar funds in Morningstar's database — yet another point of confirmation that index funds beat most active ones.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The fund does have downsides. Its fixed-income portfolio is heavily tilted toward Treasuries, and it boasts an effective duration of about six years, which is longer than most peers and makes the fund more sensitive to interest-rate changes, according to Morningstar.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The fund's stock portfolio is entirely U.S.-based. That has worked in the funds' favor in recent years, as U.S. stocks handily outperformed international ones. But today, foreign stocks look attractive thanks to lower P/E ratios and a weak dollar, which increases the value of foreign profits to U.S. investors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vanguard investors looking for international exposure can try the Vanguard LifeStrategy Moderate Growth fund, which has about 25% of its portfolio invested abroad, but a slightly higher expense ratio of 0.13%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Taking an active approach, American Balanced isn't just a standout this year. Over the past decade, it has posted an average annual return of 10%, putting it in the top 10% of moderate allocation funds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking at its portfolio, it isn't hard to see why. The top five holdings are artificial-intelligence highfliers Broadcom, Microsoft, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia. That raises the prospect that the fund could get caught up in a tech-related selloff.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Benjamin, who oversees the fund as part of dozen-strong team, says the risks are justified by the revelatory experience of using artificial intelligence, which he likens to the lightning bolt of recognition he felt when he first witnessed the iPhone. \"For the second time in my career, I feel like I am seeing something really obvious,\" he says. \"I've never seen a pace of improvement in the tech industry that's as fast as what we are seeing with these large language models.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tech holdings represent 28% of the fund's stock portfolio, below the S&amp;P 500's 36%. Sectors where the fund is overweight include industrials, materials, and consumer-defensive stocks, with names such as Philip Morris International, GE Aerospace, and Ingersoll Rand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Overall we have a fairly strong value and defensive bias,\" says Benjamin. He adds that, despite this year's outsize returns, the fund aims to keep pace in up markets while outperforming in down markets. \"Our intention is, over a decade, to get a lot of outperformance — but all of it would come in down markets,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another great option for investors willing to take an even bolder bet is the T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation fund. The $71 billion fund's 13.3% year-to-date return puts it in the middle of the pack for balanced funds. But its 11.3% annualized return over the past decade puts it in the top 1% in its Morningstar category.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The fund makes concentrated bets: It owns fewer than 50 stocks, compared with more than 200 for American Balanced and more than 3,000 for Vanguard Balanced Index.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>T. Rowe's fund is also banking heavily on tech, at a 39% weighting led by big names like Microsoft and Amazon.com. Co-manager David Giroux views them as somewhat defensive, allowing the fund to benefit from excitement around AI while providing a measure of safety, given their diversified businesses like cloud computing and Amazon's enormous retail operation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If AI blows up, these aren't going to be great stocks, but they are going to do 1,000 times better than some of the pure plays,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The fund employs a similar mix of caution and opportunism in its bond portfolio. Its effective duration is just under three years, far shorter than the category average of about five. Giroux worries that enormous U.S. budget deficits mean long-term Treasury yields could remain stubbornly high, even if the Fed cuts short-term rates. The upshot could be a more muted bond rally than in past Fed rate-cutting cycles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Capital Appreciation's more short-term bond orientation means that the fund might sacrifice some yield. Giroux makes up for that by taking on extra credit risk. About a third of its fixed-income holdings are in leveraged loans — floating-rate bank loans typically made to risky companies with below-investment-grade credit. It's an unusual move for a staid 60/40 fund, although Giroux notes that the loans' floating rates mean that they bear relatively little interest-rate risk, as does the fund's overall bond portfolio.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We take bigger bets than almost all of our peers,\" says Giroux. \"But we don't take uncontrollable bets, and we've outperformed.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Ian Salisbury at ian.salisbury@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",

This early analysis not only showcase the AI mode's ability to recognize meaningful geological correlations but also highlight its potential to accelerate exploration targeting across Nevada.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The preliminary AI modelling utilized approximately 60 curated datasets drawn from public sources and internally generated datasets, which were processed through TerraDX's proprietary AI models to generate preliminary probability models highlighting geological patterns consistent with known lithium mineralization. The prospectivity analysis utilized publicly available national and state-level datasets from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology (NBMG). These included mineral occurrence and deposit databases, geochemical compilations, geophysical survey data, and geologic mapping products. The AI model correlated these datasets with regions of known lithium mineralization to identify areas exhibiting comparable data patterns within the analyzed inputs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This analysis represents an important milestone in the development of the initiative, as they confirm the AI system's capacity to identify subtle correlations and complex geological relationships that may be overlooked by traditional exploration methods.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The project will now advance into the second phase of the modelling, which will include additional training runs to sharpen predictive accuracy, exclusion mapping to systematically filter out unviable exploration zones such as population centers, national parks, and restricted-use lands, refining the phase I prospectivity zones into high-confidence, AI-derived exploration targets.

The state is estimated to hold approximately 85% of the nation's known lithium deposits, largely due to the state's arid environment and closed basin hydrologic systems which have combined over millions of years to deposit vast amounts of the mineral deemed critical to the clean energy movement.2</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), commercial-scale lithium production in the United States in 2023 came solely from a continental brine operation in Nevada3 - the Silver Peak facility operated by Albemarle Corporation. This made Nevada the sole domestic producer of lithium that year. Nevada is also home to Thacker Pass, located within the McDermitt Caldera in Humboldt County. It is recognized as the largest measured lithium reserve and resource in the world. 4</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These developments align with federal policy initiatives to secure critical mineral supply chains.
