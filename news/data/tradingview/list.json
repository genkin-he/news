This transition involves operational, technical, and market risks, including the need to develop semiconductor solutions that meet demanding power and efficiency requirements, compete against established incumbents, and secure design wins in new market segments. The shift may also require additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Supply Chain Risks</span></strong><span>: The company is exposed to supply chain risks, particularly due to its reliance on single sources for certain manufacturing services and materials. The announcement by TSMC to cease GaN production by 2027 poses a significant risk, despite mitigation efforts such as partnerships with Powerchip and GlobalFoundries. Any delays or disruptions in transitioning to new suppliers could negatively impact the company's ability to fulfill customer orders.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Geopolitical and Regulatory Risks</span></strong><span>: Geopolitical and regulatory risks are heightened due to the company's international operations, particularly in Asia. New U.S. government regulations restricting outbound investments in China could impact the company's strategic investments and partnerships, potentially affecting growth and competitive positioning.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Financial Risks</span></strong><span>: Financial risks include the unpredictability of working capital needs and the potential requirement for additional capital to support business growth. The company also faces challenges in maintaining effective internal controls, which could impact investor confidence and stock price.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Cybersecurity Risks</span></strong><span>: Cybersecurity risks are significant, with the company subject to sophisticated cyber attacks that could result in the theft or unauthorized disclosure of intellectual property and customer data. The company has experienced attempted cyber attacks, highlighting the need for ongoing enhancements to cybersecurity measures.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Tax Risks</span></strong><span>: Tax risks are present due to potential changes in domestic and international tax laws, which could adversely affect the company's financial condition. The company's status as an inverted domestic corporation under the Homeland Security Act may limit its ability to enter into U.S. government contracts, potentially decreasing the value of its business.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Market Risks</span></strong><span>: The company is exposed to market risks, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may adversely affect financial results.

Cybersecurity threats and data privacy concerns are critical, as breaches could damage reputation and financial standing.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The company is also exposed to interest rate risks, which could affect profitability due to the mismatch in the repricing of assets and liabilities.

Additionally, the real estate market's volatility, particularly in commercial real estate, poses a risk due to potential declines in property values and increased loan defaults.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Management acknowledges the heightened competition and regulatory scrutiny as significant challenges. Strategies to address these include enhancing technological capabilities to improve customer service and operational efficiency. The company is also focusing on diversifying its geographic footprint to mitigate regional economic risks. Efforts are being made to strengthen cybersecurity measures and data protection protocols to safeguard against breaches.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The company is exposed to market risks, particularly interest rate fluctuations, which could impact net interest income.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Investor fears that private-credit fund managers may suffer losses on loans to software companies--many of which were the subject of buyouts several years ago--reflect not only potential disruption of those businesses by artificial intelligence advances but also a decline in their valuations as well as the debt loads they carry, Carlyle CEO Harvey Schwartz says during a presentation to shareholders and security analysts. \"This is not about direct lending. This is about businesses being bought at really, really high multiples\" in 2021 and 2022, before interest rates rose sharply, he says. \"Those multiples have systematically come down a bit before this new concern around AI,\" he adds. \"It's the collision of those multiples with leverage-it's actually an equity problem-which is then transferring up the capital structure potentially to a direct lending problem.\" (luis.garcia@wsj.com; @lhvgarcia)</span></p></span></div></div>",
