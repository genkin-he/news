The forecast includes a projection for $50 billion in artificial-intelligence revenue, double what Dell (DELL) posted for fiscal 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"AI server demand remains exceptional,\" CFO David Kennedy said on the company's earnings call.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dell shares were up 10% in Thursday's extended session.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At a time when the market is jittery about the impact of component shortages and rising memory prices on consumer-electronics businesses, Dell posted a 20.5% gross-margin rate for the fiscal fourth quarter, slightly above its forecast. The company is also comfortable with the supply it has to fulfill its revenue guidance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From an operating-margin standpoint, the company has been benefiting from a greater mix of storage products as well as more sales of its own intellectual property. Both of those things have favorable profit profiles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Don't miss: Memory-chip stocks are still quite cheap - especially if you look overseas</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the fiscal fourth quarter, Dell posted a 14.8% operating margin for its infrastructure-solutions business, which includes servers and storage offerings. The company posted a 240-basis-point improvement there relative to its performance in the fiscal third quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dell COO Jeff Clarke also expressed confidence in the company's ability to meet its mid-single-digit operating-margin target for AI servers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We clearly have a lot of backlog to clear, with $43 billion in backlog,\" he said on the earnings call. \"That backlog will ship at mid-single digits.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Management discussed how \"input costs are rapidly changing,\" forcing strategic decisions for the company. Dell raised prices on traditional servers in December, a move that helped stabilize margins. With its client-solutions group, which includes personal computers, Dell was more deliberate as it has also been focused on winning market share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Our business grew 18% in a market that grew 10%,\" management said, indicating that the focus on market-share gains has yielded results. The company did raise prices in January and saw stabilization of margins as a result.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See also: Arista succeeds where Cisco came up short - to the benefit of its stock</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the fiscal fourth quarter, Dell posted adjusted earnings per share of $3.89 on revenue of $33.4 billion.

Analysts tracked by FactSet were modeling $3.53 and $31.7 billion, respectively.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dell also boosted its quarterly dividend by 20% and increased its buyback authorization by $10 billion.

Those results arrived just two days after Sweetgreen launched new wrap sandwiches, priced a bit lower than some of its bowls and salads, after more expensive fare kept some customers away last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shares of Sweetgreen (SG) were down 4.9% after hours on Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The drop in Sweetgreen's stock price came after shares of rival Cava (CAVA) rocketed higher on Wednesday, following a forecast for a same-store sales gain this year. The Mediterranean fast-casual chain's CEO said customers could be getting tired of chasing discounts. However, other chains, like McDonald's (MCD) and Chipotle (CMG), have been more tempered in their expectations for the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shares of Cava were down 0.6% after hours Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sweetgreen's management on Thursday said it would move ahead with more urgency to strengthen service standards, introduce new menu items and speed up checkout times. It also plans to improve marketing around things like high-quality ingredients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CEO Jonathan Neman said that the company was currently testing new wrap sandwiches, which it introduced on Tuesday in parts of New York, the Midwest and California. If those items do well, he said Sweetgreen plans to expand the offerings beyond that trial run in the middle of the year. The prices for those wraps start at $10.95.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sweetgreen said fourth-quarter sales fell 3.5% to $155.2 million, with a per-share loss of 42 cents. Both figures were worse than analysts expected. Same-stores sales were down 11.5%, which weren't as bad as anticipated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The chain said it expects same-store sales to fall 2% to 4% this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Over the past year, fast-casual restaurants - which try to offer the quality of a sit-down chain at the speed of fast food - have been squeezed by value offerings from rivals like Chili's and McDonald's. Against that backdrop, Sweetgreen's stock is down 73.5% over the past 12 months. Over recent months, consumers have showed signs of waning interest in often-pricey salad and bowl offerings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ahead of the results, UBS analysts said Sweetgreen faced concerns over spending among younger consumers, who make up about a third of the people who visit the chain. They also noted that the chain has struggled in cities like Los Angeles and areas in the Northeast. During an earnings call in November, Sweetgreen said New York was its \"most challenged market.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many restaurants, after raising prices to cover for the past several years of supply shocks, are now trying to find ways to cut them after scaring customers away. But the discount war has weighed on margins and, in some cases, stock prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Bill Peters</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
