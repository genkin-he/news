Shortly after, the Chinese government ordered Wingtech to suspend Nexperia's exports from China.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia, which generated about $2 billion in revenue last year with about 60% coming from applications in the auto industry, had a substantial share of the market for basic chips found in hundreds of car components.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By David Benoit, Joe Palazzolo and Khadeeja Safdar</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In April 2002, JPMorgan Chase raised a red flag about Jeffrey Epstein.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bank had noticed his accounts were cashing an unusual number of checks, many for $9,500 or $9,800 — just under the $10,000 limit that draws increased attention.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>JPMorgan filed what's known as a suspicious activity report, or SAR, to federal law enforcement because of a clear pattern of transactions typically meant to evade authorities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bank would file another report in December 2002 and another in April 2003. The flags were raised well before any public knowledge of Epstein's crimes and associations with girls and young women, but had little impact on his activities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Epstein would be arrested in Florida three years later, plead guilty in 2008, and then continue his extravagant lifestyle until 2019. He would remain a JPMorgan client until 2013, meeting with top executives from the bank and connecting them with his wealthy associates, including Leon Black and Bill Gates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The newly revealed documents show the knots JPMorgan and all banks can tie themselves in, especially with lucrative clients. On the one hand, they are filing reports warning law enforcement that their client looks suspiciously criminal. But unless their regulators or law enforcement reply otherwise, the banks can continue to serve the client, having fulfilled their obligation with the SAR.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A JPMorgan spokeswoman said the SARs show the bank filed concerns early on and repeatedly about Epstein. \"It does not appear that anyone in the government or law enforcement acted on those SARs for years,\" the spokeswoman said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The reports are sent to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, part of the Treasury Department, which monitors the financial system for crimes such as money laundering and makes the reports available to law enforcement. Treasury representatives declined to comment Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The red flags were raised internally at the bank throughout its relationship with Epstein, who had dozens of accounts and moved millions of dollars. At one point, Epstein and his associates told JPMorgan staff the cash was needed to pay for fuel for his private jet, but some JPMorgan staffers were skeptical especially after media coverage of Epstein's 2006 arrest in Florida showed he was paying for sex with minors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2008, the bank filed another SAR on Epstein, citing the prosecution and flagging $800,000 in withdrawals in 2007 and 2008.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In an email exchange in 2013, JPMorgan staffers discussed whether they should include concerns in a SAR about Epstein potentially using the cash to pay for sex, not just for jet fuel. The bank did file a SAR raising concerns about the fuel story, showing one Epstein account took out more than $200,000 in cash in 2011 and $290,000 in 2012.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I think we should stick to taking out cash and traveling abroad to pay for fuel is not normal business practice. True, he has been known to pay cash for his massages but only minors are the issue and we have no proof, \" one JPMorgan staffer wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Once the bank decided to close Epstein's accounts in 2013, another JPMorgan staffer wrote to Mary Erdoes, who oversaw the private bank, saying Epstein had called him. \"Still looking for closure. Understands better now the impact of his cash activities — sticking to aviation needs,\" he wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the same message, the banker asked his boss whether JPMorgan could continue to work with Epstein through his clients' accounts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Erdoes replied with a single letter: \"Y.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Erdoes has said she didn't know about his crimes and the bank has said it regrets its relationship with Epstein.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2016, JPMorgan filed additional SARs that found that Epstein had sent more than $310,000 to a former model. The bank flagged the transfers for \"possible procurement of sexual\" services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The documents originate from a 2023 case that the U.S. Virgin Islands attorney general filed against JPMorgan, alleging that the bank facilitated Epstein's sex trafficking operation. JPMorgan agreed to pay $75 million that year to settle the suit before it went to trial, without admitting wrongdoing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The case exposed how deep Epstein's ties were with the bank. He introduced prominent clients and pitched executives on big deals. Bankers also continued meeting with him after firing him as a client in 2013.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Officials at the Gates Foundation also were also well aware of Epstein's checkered past in 2011 when the organization was in discussions with Epstein and JPMorgan executive Jes Staley on creating a potential charitable fund for superwealthy individuals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Bill and Jes share a mutual 'friend' in Jeff Epstein (an important behind the scenes 'broker' in the finance world with an unseemly reputation due to a criminal conviction: From JPM, we know that Jeff has the ear of Jes and has helped recruit (behind the scenes) some of JPM's biggest clients,\" according to a Gates Foundation memo.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gates has said it was a mistake to meet with Epstein. Staley, who left JPMorgan and went on to run Barclays, has maintained he never knew about Epstein's alleged crimes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Epstein was arrested again in 2019 and died in prison that August. Three days after his death, JPMorgan began filing SARs detailing even more of his history. The bank eventually reported more than $1 billion in transactions connected to Epstein associates, including Victoria's Secret billionaire Les Wexner and hedge-fund manager Glenn Dubin.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Black has said he paid Epstein for estate-planning and tax advice. Wexner has said he was defrauded by Epstein, his money manager, and cut him off in 2007. Dubin has said he was unaware of Epstein's alleged crimes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The filing said the wires were \"consistent with negative media involving sex trafficking of minors\" and alerted the regulator to Epstein's activity in Russia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to David Benoit at David.Benoit@wsj.com, Joe Palazzolo at Joe.Palazzolo@wsj.com and Khadeeja Safdar at khadeeja.safdar@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The Company's lead product candidate is briquilimab, a monoclonal antibody designed to block stem cell factor (\"SCF\") from binding to and signaling through the CD117 (\"c-Kit\") receptor on mast and stem cells. According to Jasper, the \"SCF/c-Kit pathway is a survival signal for mast cells and [the Company] believe[s] that blocking this pathway may lead to depletion of these cells throughout the body, including in the lungs and in the skin, which could lead to significant clinical benefit for patients with mast-cell driven diseases such as asthma and chronic urticarias\" and \"[t]o that end, [Jasper is] focusing on advancing a portfolio of clinical programs in mast cell driven diseases.\" In 2024, to \"strengthen [its] balance sheet and support development of briquilimab,\" Jasper completed an oversubscribed $50 million financing \"with a syndicate of leading life science investors,\" purportedly \"extending [its] cash runway through the third quarter of 2025.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In November 2023, the Company commenced a Phase 1b/2a clinical study of subcutaneous briquilimab for the treatment of CSU (the \"BEACON Study\"). When announcing the first patient dosing in the BEACON Study, Jasper's Chief Executive Officer Defendant Ronald Martell stated, in relevant part, that he was \"confident in the ability of our clinical organization to continue to execute at a high level as we advance briquilimab into clinical trials in CIndU and other mast cell-driven diseases.\" In December 2024, the Company commenced a Phase 1b/2a clinical study evaluating briquilimab in allergic asthma (the \"ETESIAN Study\"). In addition, Jasper has attempted to develop briquilimab as a one-time conditioning therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency (\"SCID\") patients undergoing a second stem cell transplant.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act -a law enacted by Congress in 2013 designed to improve and ensure the safety of the U.S pharmaceutical supply chain-all prescription drugs must be labeled with a unique product identifier that includes, among other things, a \"lot number.\" Drug \"lots\" are batches of a product that are manufactured, processed, packaged, or stored under the same conditions. If a medication is compromised, pharmaceuticals companies can use lot numbers to trace the affected batches and alert healthcare providers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to the Company, \"[t]he manufacture of pharmaceuticals is subject to extensive [current Good Manufacturing Practices (\"cGMP\")] regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control.\" Because Jasper does not currently own or operate any manufacturing facility, the Company relies on third-party contract manufacturing organizations to produce its drug candidates in purported \"accordance with cGMP regulations for use in [its] clinical studies.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Jasper lacked the controls and procedures necessary to ensure that the third-party manufacturers on which it relied were manufacturing products in full accordance with cGMP regulations and otherwise suitable for use in clinical trials; (ii) the foregoing failure increased the risk that results of ongoing studies would be confounded, thereby negatively impacting the regulatory and commercial prospects of the Company's products, including briquilimab; (iii) the foregoing increased the likelihood of disruptive cost-reduction measures; (iv) accordingly, the Company's business and/or financial prospects, as well as briquilimab's clinical and/or commercial prospects, were overstated; and (v) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On July 7, 2025, Jasper issued a press release reporting updated data from the BEACON Study. The press release stated that \"results from the 240mg Q8W and the 240mg followed by 180mg Q8W dose cohorts appear to be confounded by an issue with one drug product lot used in those cohorts, with 10 of the 13 patients dosed with drug from the lot in question,\" that \"[t]he Company is investigating the drug product lot in question and expects to have the results of that investigation in the coming weeks,\" and that Jasper was \"taking steps to ensure that drug product from the lot in question is returned to the Company and that sites have drug product from other lots to continue dosing.\" Further, the press release revealed that the Company \"has also determined that the drug product lot in question was used to treat participants enrolled in the ETESIAN [Study]. As a result, and in order to focus resources on advancing briquilimab in CSU, the Company is halting the study and pausing development in asthma.\" Finally, the press release stated that \"the Company is halting development in SCID\" and, contrary to its prior representation of having a strong balance sheet and a cash runway extending \"through the third quarter of 2025,\" that Jasper \"will be implementing a number of other cost cutting measures including a potential restructuring, to extend runway and reduce expenses.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On this news, Jasper's stock price fell $3.73 per share, or 55.1%, to close at $3.04 per share on July 7, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Market analysts were quick to comment on the Company's announcement. For example, on July 7, 2025, BMO Capital Markets published a report downgrading Jasper to market perform and lowering its price target from $6.77 per share to $4.00 per share (the \"BMO Report\"). The BMO Report stated, in relevant part, that \"potential Briquilimab drug lot issues, coupled with existing uncertainty around dose-response [], will pressure the [Jasper] story moving forward\" given, among other things, Jasper's \"financing overhang\" and market competition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After the end of the Class Period, on July 9, 2025, the Company issued a press release entitled \"Jasper Therapeutics Announces Corporate Reorganization and Other Cost Cutting Measures to Extend Cash Runway.\" The press release revealed that Jasper was reducing its workforce by approximately 50%, that \"[i]n order to focus resources on the development of briquilimab in chronic urticaria, Jasper is halting its other clinical and preclinical programs,\" and that Defendant Edwin Tucker was departing his role as the Company's Chief Medical Officer effective August 1, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.
