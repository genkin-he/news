After spiking on U.S. sanctions against Russia's largest oil company, prices have retreated with higher OPEC+ output and weaker seasonal demand containing advances. While the \"overarching bearish balance outlook continues to accelerate,\" risk premiums still exist as Russian output is likely to be a key focus, analysts at Rystad Energy say in a note. Rystad raised its Brent price forecast for 4Q to $63 a barrel from $62 a barrel. Brent is up 0.5% at $65.30 a barrel and WTI is 0.9 higher at $61.10 a barrel.(anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0940 ET - Despite an unexpected decline in GDP in August, Canada likely \"narrowly\" dodges two consecutive quarters of economic contraction when 3Q data emerges late next month, says Michael Davenport of Oxford Economics. Still, a 0.3% decline in August GDP \"certainly raises the odds of a technical recession,\" Davenport says. Oxford says it expects Canada's economy to struggle to grow in the coming months and remain vulnerable to further trade-related disruptions. Davenport says there's \"a chance\" of further Bank of Canada rate cuts should GDP and labor data weaken more than anticipated.

(najat.kantouar@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0932 ET - Disappointing monthly Canada GDP data won't prompt a change of course for the Bank of Canada, says Benjamin Reitzes, economist at BMO Capital Markets. However, Reitzes says the surprise 0.3% drop in August does reinforce BMO's belief that the risks remain skewed to the downside. The firm believes another quarter-point cut, in early 2026, is possible due to softness in the labor market, which would take the BOC's policy rate to 2%.

GDP on an industry basis surprisingly fell 0.3% in August, and the early estimate is for a 0.1% gain in September--which Figueiredo estimates puts 3Q GDP largely in line with the BOC forecast for 0.5% annualized growth. Only 43% of sectors tracked have posted positive growth over the past 3 months, or well below the historical average of about 60%, the economist says. Still, \"we don't yet see enough weakness for central bankers to cut rates any further,\" Figueiredo says. (paul.vieira@wsj.com, @paulvieira)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0904 ET - Canadian output in August was much weaker than consensus, and the advance estimate for September indicates soft momentum at the end of 3Q. This bears watching, says CIBC Capital Markets, as the Bank of Canada predicts a pickup in growth in 4Q. All told, Canada GDP in August fell 0.3%, versus an estimate for a flat reading. Statistics Canada's early estimate for September is that GDPedged upward by 0.1%. That would translate into a 0.4% annualized 3Q gain, or slightly below the Bank of Canada's forecast for 0.5% jump. \"The lack of momentum towards the end of the quarter may spook policymakers somewhat,\" says CIBC economist Andrew Grantham. The BOC cut its policy rate this week, to 2.25%, and signaled it would stay there so long as the economy unfolds as forecast.

The reduction in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods after the Trump-Xi meeting should boost the price competitiveness of Chinese exports and ease pressure on exporters, while the suspension of shipping levies will benefit Chinese shipbuilders and shipping firms. Although the summit didn't resolve deeper structural issues, it sets the stage for continued high-level exchanges next year that should help contain the risk of significant escalation in tensions, she adds. CGS International believes the improved backdrop strengthens the case for global investors to increase their Chinese equities allocation.

Despite a trade deal between the two countries, there was no concrete timeline or guidance on when Chinese companies might gain access to Nvidia's advanced AI chips, analysts led by Andy Yu write. This ambiguity is likely to weigh on AI infrastructure names, including data-center stocks, and large tech companies that depend on advanced chip availability for their AI-related businesses.

Meanwhile, she said, she isn't convinced inflation is on a firm track back toward the Fed's 2% target.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That combination suggests the Fed should be more reluctant to cut rates to support the labor market with rate cuts, which weaken the Fed's anti-inflation stance, Logan said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Logan hasn't been a member of the Fed's policy committee this year, under the system that rotates votes annually among the Fed's 12 reserve-bank presidents. But she made it clear that if she had gotten a vote this week, she would have dissented against the Fed's cut.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I would have preferred to hold interest rates steady,\" Logan said, according to a published version of her remarks. She said later in the speech that she is also skeptical that a further cut in December will be the right move.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Fed's decision to cut rates by a quarter point to a range of 3.75% to 4% at a second straight meeting was contentious, with two voters dissenting. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid took the same view as Logan, arguing the Fed should have kept rates still. Fed governor Stephen Miran dissented in the other direction, backing a half-point rate cut.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a press conference after the vote, Chair Jerome Powell said that another cut in December--something that many traders had been counting on--was far from a foregone conclusion. His comments likely reflected a base of skepticism about further cuts among the Fed's policy committee as the group met over two days this week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Logan acknowledged that the labor market has weakened, but said that future policy choices could respond quickly if the situation worsens further. \"These are all risks the FOMC will be able to closely monitor and address promptly if there is evidence they are becoming more likely to materialize,\" she said, referring to the Fed's policy committee by its acronym.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the other hand, she expressed impatience with persistent inflation, noting that prices already rose nearly at the Fed's annual target rate between January and August alone.

The energy research firm estimates that between 500,000 and 600,000 barrels a day of Russian oil production could be curtailed in the next two months as a result of the latest U.S. sanctions, but the risk of immediate production shut-ins are extremely marginal at the moment. \"Given that any impact on Russian output will take time to materialize and with Moscow keen to project stability, it is unlikely Russia will oppose another modest OPEC+8 production increase,\" says Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis. \"For the Kremlin, staying composed and signaling control remain central to its strategy.\" In afternoon trade, Brent crude and WTI rise 0.5% to $64.69 and $60.94 a barrel, respectively.

It also removed its Chinese CEO, citing concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia's move came after the Dutch chipmaker's Chinese unit resumed supplying semiconductors to local customers but stipulated that all sales to distributors would need to be settled using the Chinese yuan. Previously, transactions had been settled with foreign currencies like the U.S. dollar.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LARGE VOLUMES OF CHIPS</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company produces large volumes of chips in the Netherlands that are widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries.

Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or from the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution to the problem. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia said it is financially independent of Wingtech and it does not raise capital from Wingtech, the letter showed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A spokesperson for Nexperia confirmed it sent the letter and the company could not comment further. Nexperia China and Wingtech did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A spokesperson for the Dutch government referred questions about the wafer shut-off to Nexperia, saying the move had been a corporate decision while state intervention \"concerns the preservation of production capacity and is not aimed at the company's day-to-day operations\".</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Netherlands is in discussions with European governments and the European Commission, as well as Chinese authorities, \"to work toward a constructive solution,\" the spokesperson said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>IMPACT ON PRODUCTION </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Court filings showed that the seizure by the Dutch government came as U.S. pressure was rising on Nexperia after Wingtech was placed on a restricted-export list, though Dutch authorities say governance shortcomings were the trigger. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On October 4, China's commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips from China.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Industry bodies have sounded the alarm over the possible impact on production, with Stellantis </span><span> saying on Thursday that it had set up a \"war room\" to monitor the situation. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Japanese automaker Nissan </span><span> said it had enough chips at the moment to last until the first week of November without disruption. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some Nexperia products that used to cost just a few Chinese cents have gone up in price to two or three yuan each over the past two weeks, more than 10 times their original cost, according to a source familiar with the matter.</span></p></span></div></div>",
