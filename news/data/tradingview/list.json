Gold Fields has an option to earn into the Santa Cecilia project by funding a USD$48 million exploration option for a 75% indirect interest (10% earned to-date). Gold Fields is also a principal shareholder of Torq.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An approximately USD$11 million program, to be 100% funded by Gold Fields, is intended to target and further evaluate prospective areas, specifically Pircas Norte and Gemelos Norte, as well as other new areas with evidence of wide continuous Au-Cu mineralization.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the last drill program, the Santa Cecilia JV completed five drill holes at Gemelos Norte confirming a new copper-gold porphyry discovery including 450 m of 0.51 g/t gold and 0.155%copper. Step-out drilling at Pircas Norte extended mineralization at depth returning 206 m of 0.99 g/t gold and 0.109%Cu within 266 m of 0.81 g/t Au and 0.097%Cu.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Previous highlights from Torq's inaugural drill program include 557 m of 0.38 g/t gold, 0.23% copper and 56 ppm molybdenum in wall rock at a depth of 442 m - 999 m. This intercept bottomed in grade and represented an 81% increase in gold grade relative to historical drilling, indicating potential vectoring toward the higher-grade causative intrusion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company looks forward to testing the extent of the discoveries and evaluating additional highly prospective targets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This program was originally planned for early 2026 but has been delayed to later in the year for several reasons including the on-site death in November of an employee of a catering contractor who passed away at the exploration camp during off-duty hours. A preliminary review by Chilean authorities has ruled that the fatality was due to natural causes however governmental and potential civil suit investigations are ongoing. The Company maintains high standards of safety for its employees and requires its contractors to do the same. Neither investigation is expected to lead to legal proceedings which would have material adverse financial consequences to Torq.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shawn Wallace, CEO of Torq, commented: \"We have extended our sincere condolences to the family of the individual who passed away at site. The safety and well-being of all personnel and other stakeholders remains our highest priority. While drilling has been deferred, we remain committed to advancing Santa Cecilia responsibly and in alignment with all regulatory and community expectations. We appreciate the continued support of the local community and look forward to involving them in our plans as we move forward.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bryan Atkinson, P Geo. a consultant to Torq, is the qualified person who has reviewed the technical contents of this news release.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shawn Wallace</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CEO &amp; Chair</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For further information on Torq Resources, please visit www.torqresources.com or contact the company at (778) 729-0500 or info@torqresources.com.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Torq Resources</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Torq is a Vancouver-based copper and gold exploration company with a portfolio of premium holdings in Chile.

Prior quarters saw softer demand largely due to market uncertainty in the application of the U.S. Government's planned copper tariffs. Now that these tariffs have been implemented, product demand appears to be strengthening. The Division also posted gains in the quarter in operating income, Adjusted EBITDA, gross profit, and gross margin over the comparable prior-year period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consolidated loss in the quarter of $480,000 narrowed YOY from a loss of $1.4 million in the comparative period, largely driven by higher copper alloys sales revenue and reduced costs at the company's Engineered Materials division, which was closed in 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We saw strong signs of demand recovery in our second fiscal quarter almost across the board in copper alloy products, and those gains appear to be continuing into the current quarter,\" said Mark A.
