The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Two pieces of news are behind the move.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For starters, the company, which is developing the rare-earth Brook Mine in Sheridan, Wyo., said it signed an agreement to collaborate on rare-earth research and development with the U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory. That builds on an existing partnership with the lab, but Ramaco said it would also work with other Energy Department laboratories on rare earths.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The amount of money that might be spent wasn't covered in the news release. Ramaco didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Next, Ramaco said that Goldman Sachs will \"act as the exclusive structuring agent in connection with its previously announced initiative to establish a Strategic Critical Minerals Terminal at Ramaco's Brook Mine facility in Wyoming.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The terminal is a Ramaco idea to reduce America's dependence on supplies of Chinese rare-earth products. It could serve as a strategic stockpile where Ramaco and other producers could store the metals. Eventually, it could become a center for trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China dominates the global rare-earth market with an estimated 85% of global processing capacity. Rare-earth materials end up in everything from electronics to electric vehicles to wind turbines to fighter jets. Their use has almost quadrupled over the past 10 years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The move caps a wild month for Ramaco and other rare-earth shares. Shares traded as high as $57.80 and as low as $27.24. Catalyzing the volatility was a threat from China to restrict rare-earth exports. Chances of the country making good on that threat diminished as trade talks with the U.S. advanced.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All the volatility left Ramaco stock down 8.5% in October, and off 27% since China's threat in earlier in the month. October's decline still left Ramaco stock up 196% year to date.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The trading pattern has been similar for shares of MP Materials and USA Rare Earth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MP stock dropped 2.9% on Friday. USA Rare Earth shares fell 1.2%. Through Friday trading, MP stock was up 304% year to date. USA Rare Earth shares were up 69%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors might believe the Ramaco news represents competition for the other two, but the stock moves also might just be trading-related volatility. There is plenty of rare-earth business to go around.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MP, the largest of the three, makes only a fraction of the rare earths used by American businesses annually. USA Rare Earth and Ramaco don't have rare-earth revenue yet. USA Rare Earth is developing a mine in Texas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MP signed a blockbuster deal with the Defense Department in July that included an equity stake, a price floor for rare-earth materials, and a guaranteed customer for rare-earth magnets from production infrastructure the company is building.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deal reshaped the U.S. rare-earth industry, creating the frenzy investors have been dealing with for months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Weston Blasi</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One sportsbook had 96.7% of World Series bets on the Dodgers to beat the Blue Jays once the matchup was finalized</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most sports bettors want the Dodgers to win the World Series. Sportsbooks are praying for the Blue Jays.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tonight, the Toronto Blue Jays are hoping to win their first MLB World Series since 1993. And U.S. sportsbooks hope that the Blue Jays win, too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's because the Los Angeles Dodgers were heavily favored to beat Toronto in the series. In fact, once this year's World Series matchup was finalized, almost every single bet (96.7%) made on ESPN Bet over which team would win the World Series was made in favor of the Dodgers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The wagers have been driven by the Dodgers' popularity as reigning champions and as home to one of the best players in baseball, Shohei Ohtani. And this type of overwhelming liability could lead to a bad outcome for sports-betting companies if the Blue Jays don't win and the sportsbooks have to pay up - again.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Betting companies are already coming off a football season where FanDuel owner Flutter (FLUT) took a $370 million hit on NFL games after casual bettors benefited from some of the most \"customer-friendly\" betting outcomes that online sportsbooks have ever seen. So while a Toronto win would mean paying out some long-shot futures, it would still be a far better result for the betting operators than another Dodgers victory - which would trigger huge payouts on the most bet-on team all season.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sportsbooks typically favor outcomes that go against the majority of wagers placed on a sporting event, which is why nearly all of them are pulling for the Blue Jays right now.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Before the World Series began, the Blue Jays winning it all was a good outcome for the sportsbook,\" Seamus Magee, trading manager at BetMGM, told MarketWatch in an email.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Dodgers can still give them a run for their money, though. \"Toronto is still the preferred winner, but we wouldn't mind seeing a Game 7,\" Magee added. The series is currently 3-2 in favor of Toronto, and sportsbooks generally prefer longer series because more games equals more bets - and more juice for sportsbooks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, the Blue Jays winning the whole thing would provide a lifeline to betting companies. \"We definitely need the Blue Jays. Toronto winning would be a strong result for us,\" Caesars Sports head of baseball trading Eric Biggio said to Fox. \"If you know of any Blue Jays backers with deep pockets, you can send them our way.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The two most popular individual prop bets on BetMGM for Game 6 on Halloween night are Toronto's Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hitting over 0.5 home runs (+400), and Ohtani hitting over 0.5 home runs (+195). The biggest liability for World Series MVP - as in, the players who sportsbooks least want to see win the award - are Ohtani, Guerrero Jr. and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, in that order.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition to ESPN Bet (DIS), BetMGM (MGM) and Caesars (CZR), other U.S. sportsbooks were also showing an overwhelming amount of bets on the Dodgers heading into Game 6. But it's not just bets that were made in the days leading up to the World Series; fans have been backing the Dodgers all year long.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From the archives: How does a gambling site lose money? DraftKings just lost $250 million in revenue - mostly on NFL games.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Toronto opened the season at +6000 odds to win the World Series before the season (1.6% implied probability of winning), while the Dodgers went into the season at roughly +750 odds. In other words, expectations were low for Toronto heading into the year, and high for the Dodgers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even with those long-shot odds for Toronto, sportsbooks would rather pay out those bets than face the heavy losses that would occur with a Dodgers series win. That's because the Dodgers were the most wagered-on team in terms of total futures bets, and in total money at nearly every major sportsbook.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to betting data from DraftKings (DKNG), at the start of the MLB playoffs, 36% (or over 1 in 3) of all World Series winner bets were made for the Dodgers - more than triple the amount of bets on the next most wagered-on team. The Dodgers also had 22% of all money wagered (otherwise known as handle) to win the World Series.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>More bets were on the Los Angeles Dodgers than any other team to win the 2025 World Series.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's not clear exactly how much sportsbooks would lose if the Dodgers were to win, as the ones mentioned in this story declined to comment on potential loss amounts or betting figures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Several members of the r/BlueJays subreddit have begun sharing that they placed small wagers on their team to win the World Series at long odds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"That $20, +6000 bet I put pre-season on winning the WS is looking a lot more realistic,\" one Reddit user posted before the playoffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I grabbed it at +7500!\" another user wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sportsbooks typically profit from the \"vig,\" their commission on each bet. However, their strategy involves more than just balancing wagers. When a popular team, such as the Dodgers or Yankees, is heavily favored, sportsbooks adjust the odds to encourage betting on the underdog to minimize their risk. Despite this, sometimes bettors still take the favorite - and win.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unfavorable sports-betting outcomes can really hurt sportsbooks' bottom lines. For example, FanDuel, the Flutter Entertainment sportsbook, took a $74 million loss during a regular-season NFL game between the Detroit Lions and San Francisco 49ers, which ended in a 40-34 win for the favored Lions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For sportsbooks, the stakes are high and their rooting interest is clear: They're all in on the Blue Jays.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See: Sportsbooks were called 'victims' in new NBA gambling probe.
