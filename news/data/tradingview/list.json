It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,\" Trump said in his post, which included photos of the bathroom before and after the renovation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble,\" he said. \"This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!\" </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The White House did not immediately respond to questions about whether the bathroom project had undergone any formal design or approval process.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>TRUMP PLANNING BALLROOM</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump's abrupt demolition of the East Wing this month to make way for a 90,000-square-foot (8,360-square-metre) ballroom has been criticized for not first going through a proper review. The White House has said it would submit plans for the ballroom construction for review by the National Capital Planning Commission, which is chaired by Trump's staff secretary.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While presidents over the decades have remodeled rooms in their living space, Trump, a former New York real estate tycoon, has sought to remake the White House with particular gusto.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since taking office in January, Trump has put gold adornments and statuettes in the Oval Office, in a style he prefers. The grass in the Rose Garden was dug up and paved over with white stone.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Portraits of Trump have been hung throughout the property, and giant American flags erected on new flagpoles on the north and south lawns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The green-tiled Lincoln bathroom dated back to a White House renovation conducted by then-President Harry Truman in the 1950s, according to a Washington Post article from 2007.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the time, then-President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush undertook a renovation of the Lincoln Bedroom, which Lincoln used as an office. The Post article describing the Bush renovation said they had left alone the \"well-preserved\" bathroom.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Nvidia became the world's first $5 trillion company. Apple and Microsoft topped $4 trillion. And despite occasional disappointments, a spate of earnings from the so-called Magnificent Seven — which also includes Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Tesla — helped the Nasdaq finish October 4.7% higher.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The latest boost came from Amazon, which on Friday surged 9.6% to its first new all-time high since February after the e-commerce giant reported faster-than-expected increases in AI-related revenue and aggressive plans to grow data-center capacity. Amazon closed at a record market capitalization of $2.61 trillion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The group's market capitalization now makes up roughly 38% of the entire S&amp;P 500, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Their climb has helped carry stocks to record after record in the months since April's tariff-fueled market meltdown. And as tech companies continue to pump money into artificial intelligence, investors parse their reports for signs the rally can keep going.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Technology is just all this market seems to care about right now,\" said Liz Thomas, head of investment strategy at SoFi. \"I've lost count of how many new all-time highs we've hit this year in the S&amp;P.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other indexes are doing well, too. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on a six-month streak of gains, its longest in seven years. So far this year, the Nasdaq and S&amp;P have had 36 record closes and the Dow has had 15.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Not all tech stocks outperformed this week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple is betting that consumers will line up to buy the latest iPhone 17. The company expects revenue to increase 10% to 12% over the holidays, above Wall Street analyst expectations. Apple also plans to increase investments in AI, adding a major bump in spending. Microsoft also reported a $4.1 billion hit on its investment in OpenAI, up 490% from a year earlier.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some companies reported weakened spending from younger and lower-income consumers. Chipotle Mexican Grill's shares plunged on Thursday after it said customers were pulling back on spending, particularly younger consumers. The fast-casual restaurant chain was down 2.6% on Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We're really seeing a bifurcation in the market,\" said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon.com announced Tuesday that it was laying off thousands of workers, kick-starting a plan to cut up to 30,000 jobs. This followed Meta Platforms, which recently cut 600 jobs in its AI division. UPS, Target, and General Motors also announced large-scale job cuts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As companies continue to pump money into AI and shed workers, investors have looked to earnings reports to give them the confidence to continue participating in the market. \"When you look at the earnings growth that technology is going to pump out in the third quarter and for the full year, it's still the best-performing sector from an earnings standpoint, \" Thomas said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Federal Reserve cut rates by a quarter-point this week, but investors grew weary after Chair Jerome Powell cast doubts about whether there would be another rate cut in December. Powell said that central bankers have \"strongly differing views\" on what to do next. The decision has been complicated by a data blackout caused by the government shutdown.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Fed approved the rate cut on a 10-2 vote. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted against the decision because he favored no change in rates, while Fed governor Stephen Miran dissented in favor of a larger, half-point cut.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Economists and investment analysts anticipate that once more jobs data becomes available, it may reveal a more sobering picture of the labor market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If you enter a period where you've got net job losses, eventually it's going to hit the economy and it's going to hit equity markets,\" Tilley said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Oyin Adedoyin at oyin.adedoyin@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
