These efforts mark the next phase of the Company's \"Boots on the Ground\" initiative, accelerating patient access to ACP-01, Hemostemix's autologous angiogenic-cell-precursor therapy for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), pain relief, and wound healing, under Florida Senate Bill 1768 (SB 1768).</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Florida Opens the Door to Compassionate Innovation</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>SB 1768, enacted this year, establishes one of the most forward-looking regenerative-medicine frameworks in the United States.

For no-option CLTI patients-those suffering severe ischemic pain and non-healing wounds at risk of amputation-this statute provides a pathway to receive potentially limb-saving therapies such as ACP-01.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hemostemix's approach centers on physician enablement and statutory compliance, including licensure verification, disclosure of expected outcomes, adverse-event reporting, and integration with ongoing clinical protocols.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"SB 1768 beacons compassionate innovation, tackling pain and wounds in CLTI and similar conditions,\" said Thomas Smeenk, CEO of Hemostemix. \"Pain defines ACP-01's indications-from heart failure, angina, and cardiomyopathy to wound care and CLTI-while cognition defines our dementia work.

Marie, Ontario, has been navigating rougher economic waters since the Trump administration reimposed tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum in March 2025, citing the pretext of national-security concerns.
