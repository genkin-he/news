Through its award-winning Sembrando Vida program, the company delivered an Agreement for the Sustainable Use and Stewardship of the Mangrove Ecosystem (AUSCEM) to a local fishing association, granting community stewardship over more than 900 hectares of mangroves. This marked the first time an Ecuadorian port terminal formalized this type of environmental agreement under the Ministry of Environment and Energy framework.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Community-led environmental initiatives also gained momentum through the </span><em><span>Comunidad que Transforma</span></em><span> program, which engaged more than 1,800 participants in beach cleanups and waste collection efforts. More than 15 tons of waste were recovered and exchanged for essential goods valued at over US$35,000.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>Advancing Gender Equity and Inclusive Workplaces</span></em></p><p class=\"\"><span>DP World expanded opportunities for women across its operations and surrounding communities.
