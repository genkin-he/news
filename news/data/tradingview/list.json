According to the research institution, the world’s leading crypto exchange is maintaining its reputation after reaching its record high of $1.88 trillion in trading volume. </span></p><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1066.6666666666667px;aspect-ratio:1.7777777777777777\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:47cdf55f4094b-85cbf8054f23cc993b7dd1a235d394da-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Bitcoin\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:47cdf55f4094b-85cbf8054f23cc993b7dd1a235d394da-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f2ece8\"/></picture></div></figure></span><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, the trader sentiment within Bitcoin’s futures market evidently appears to be undergoing a transition, with data from the Bitcoin: Futures Taker CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta, 90-Day) informing the supposition. For context, this metric tracks the net difference between taker buy volume and taker sell volume over 90 days, revealing if the traders in the futures market are predominantly adding to its buying pressure or contributing to its selling pressure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>XWIN Research points out that as of the middle of 2025, Bitcoin’s taker buy volume dominated the futures market, as most traders accumulated positions. This period of accumulation, notes the analyst, was seen as the flagship cryptocurrency climbed above $100,000. However, from late August to the present, there has been a re-emergence of taker sell pressure, signaling the predominance of profit takers in the market. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>What This Means For Price</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Contrary to what this structural shift might be interpreted as, the educational institution explains that the market seems instead to be becoming more mature. A typical mature market, as XWIN Research points out, is one where the market participants manage their exposure, rather than chase any or all price spikes. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The reappearance of taker sell pressure therefore signifies a growing inclination among traders to protect their gains nested within the $110,000-$115,000 price range. Historically, this kind of “moderation” has often been a sign of long-term strength. Binance’s $1.88 trillion in trading volume also lends credence to this view, as it reveals the presence of solid institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aside from institutional backing, this trading volume also puts into perspective the width of global participation in the Bitcoin derivatives market. In the long run, the Bitcoin market could be in the early phases of a sustained and long-lasting expansion. At press time, Bitcoin is worth approximately $110,110. The premier cryptocurrency shows a slight growth of 0.40% in 24 hours. Also reflecting the online asset’s sideways movement is its net loss of 1.36% over the past seven days.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview</span></p></span></div></div>",

It also blamed the Dutch government's \"improper interference in internal affairs of companies\" for the supply disruption.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia, embroiled in a trade and geopolitical dispute between Washington and Beijing, stopped shipping chips from China, where it processes most of its products, several weeks ago after the Dutch seized control of the company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia was the latest case in which China showed how it can impose pain on global industries by flexing its export-control muscle. Both with rare earths and Nexperia, the global auto industry has been particularly vulnerable, grappling with Beijing's moves to constrain supplies of needed magnets and chips. China is a dominant producer of mature technology semiconductors widely used in vehicles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China's move to loosen export restrictions came out of a framework agreement reached during talks between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, according to people briefed on the matter. The return of Nexperia shipments is outlined in an upcoming White House document laying out the details of the trade deal, according to the people.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia has factories in Europe and Asia. About 70% to 80% of its products are processed in China before being delivered to customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The lack of Nexperia's diodes and transistors was starting to limit auto production around the world. Honda this week began stopping production across North American facilities in response to the semiconductor crunch.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The first face-to-face meeting between Trump and Xi in six years resulted in a temporary trade truce, highlighted by a reduction in stiff U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for a pledge by China to crack down on the export of chemicals used to produce fentanyl.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. agreed to put on hold for one year a decision to apply export restrictions on certain subsidiaries, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said Thursday. But automakers and suppliers were left guessing what, if anything, that meant for resolving the situation involving Nexperia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The extraordinary dispute began in late September after the Dutch government wrested control of the company from Wingtech, which is on a U.S. trade blacklist, citing a need to keep Europe from losing \"technological knowledge and capabilities\" necessary for its economic security.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Dutch government acted after the U.S. expanded the trade blacklist to include subsidiaries that are 50% owned by listed entities. Shortly after, the Chinese government ordered Wingtech to suspend Nexperia's exports from China.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia, which generated about $2 billion in revenue last year with about 60% coming from applications in the auto industry, had a substantial share of the market for basic chips found in hundreds of car components.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jared Mitovich</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gerry Clauss is a former electrician. But he had never worried so much about paying for electricity until the power bill on his single-family home hit $422 a month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That was over the summer, so he turned off the air conditioner, began freeze-drying bulk food purchases rather than storing them in his electric freezer, and started shutting off his lights more often.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's got to the point where people will do what they gotta do to survive,\" the 65-year-old from Hainesport, N.J., said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He said he plans to vote Tuesday for Republican Jack Ciattarelli in Tuesday's election for governor, motivated in part by soaring energy costs in an open race where they have become a hot topic. Clauss agrees with Ciattarelli's goal to quit a regional carbon-reduction program, which the former state assemblyman has pitched as a way to lower power bills — though Clauss supports clean energy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Big power bills are overlapping with rising food prices and inflation that remains persistently above the Federal Reserve's target, frustrating Americans. Fall weather lightens electric bills as people stop using air conditioning, but a cold winter could hike bills again for those who rely on electric heat systems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Retail power prices in New Jersey were up 19% in August from a year earlier, the latest state-by-state data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show, on the leading edge of a 6% nationwide increase in the same time frame. There are several driving forces, including a rapidly growing number of data centers pumping up demand in some regions. The slow addition of new power generators, retirement of old plants and costly grid upgrades are also playing a role.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consumers can mitigate their power use somewhat, but they have to keep the lights on, too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If strawberries are expensive, I'll buy apples — there are substitutes, \" said Meredith Fowlie, an energy economist at the University of California, Berkeley. \"Electricity, in the long run, there aren't many substitutes.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a group that helps states manage low-income utility assistance programs, said costs are a rising hardship. The organization projects customer electricity shut-offs due to unpaid bills could rise to 4 million nationwide this year, up from about 3.5 million last year and 3 million in 2023.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some of the biggest increases since last year are in parts of the Eastern U.S. where data centers are popping up, and where the grid is managed by operator PJM Interconnection. Wholesale prices — the price utilities pay for power — are rising, and can be passed on to the consumer with state regulatory approval.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The pressure on peak electricity demand capacity will likely persist, potentially meaning unyielding pressure on customer utility bills,\" the Bank of America Institute said in an October report. This will hit lower-income households disproportionately, the report said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The price on customers' bills can vary widely around the country due to many other reasons, too, including weather-influenced demand, the cost to fuel and run power plants, pricey fixes for aging infrastructure and state regulations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In Maine, customers have seen surging costs to help foot the bill to fix power lines damaged during winter storms in recent years, said Andrew Landry, the state's deputy Public Advocate. The New England state's retail prices are up 23% on the year through August.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The biggest utility there, Central Maine Power, is asking regulators for permission to increase bills more in the next five years to help further improve the grid to defend against damage, said Kimberly Harriman, deputy chief executive of parent company Avangrid. She said spending more now will ultimately save customers over the long run by lowering the likelihood of outages and costly repairs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has said the rate increase will add another cost burden for vulnerable people. Proposed rate increases are also facing opposition in places such as Minnesota, where rates haven't significantly risen in the last year, but could: A big utility there is seeking a 10% increase through 2026 for several stated reasons, including upgrades to boost reliability and preparation for rising power use.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Surging prices have become a big factor in New Jersey's governor's race, where Ciattarelli is running against U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat. At a debate in October, she called for a state of emergency on utility costs to allow her to freeze rates in place while pursuing cost-reducing measures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This utility rate crisis is kind of the issue that woke up the campaigns,\" said Ashley Koning, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Price increases are hitting businesses, too. Steve McFadden, owner of a coffee shop in Collingswood, N.J., said he has had to raise prices because of surging power costs. \"We can absorb some of it, but then it hits a saturation point,\" he said, adding that he had submitted his mail ballot for Sherrill with the issue in mind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the past year and a half, businesses looking for office space in southern New Jersey have increasingly asked about their exposure to higher electric bills, and more are opting for fixed energy contracts to keep prices stable, said Andrew Koller, a research analyst at Wolf Commercial Real Estate, a regional real-estate firm.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>HABcore, an affordable-housing provider in New Jersey, has seen rising electricity costs hit low-income residents who pay their own utilities in subsidized units, said Chief Executive Steve Heisman. The nonprofit is also feeling the pinch: Its group-living home in Asbury Park, which houses 30 people, saw electricity costs total $8,075 between June and September, up 35% from the same period last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Accountant David Healey said he had never budgeted for electricity until the power bill on his three-bedroom New Jersey house hit $550 by July.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's the difference between groceries or medicine or keeping the lights on,\" the 38-year-old in southern New Jersey said. Wanting to keep costs under control this winter, he just installed solar panels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Jared Mitovich at jared.mitovich@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

Its $300 bottles of wine sell briskly, as do its $75 lamb chops.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Six private dining rooms are already almost fully booked for evening business meetings and birthday parties through the end of the year. Revenues are better than they were before the pandemic, even when accounting for inflation. And customers show no signs of trading down from high-end menu items.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I'm really grateful for that,\" said co-owner Diana Lyne. She prepared for business to slow down earlier this year when President Trump announced widespread tariffs. \"We no longer truly understand the U.S. economy,\" she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All kinds of warning signs seem to be flashing through the economy, and in New York City in particular, where discontent over the high cost of living has propelled democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani to a commanding lead in the race to be New York's mayor. Yet many wealthy people in the city are spending freely. Like the U.S. broadly, rich people are keeping the party going in New York, and powering a burgeoning local economy that caters to the well-to-do.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The most affluent Americans have gained trillions of dollars in new wealth in the past five years, largely thanks to rising home prices and a robust stock market. Their wages keep rising, and they are landing big inheritances. And they are undeterred by continuing inflation and a hiring slowdown that is pressing working- and middle-class families.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The top 10% of earners made up 49.2% of all spending nationally in the second quarter of 2025, a record high driven by spending by the very richest in this group, according to an analysis of government data from Moody's Analytics. Spending by the top 10%, a group that includes households earning roughly $275,000 a year or more, rose 4.4% from a year earlier, compared with a 2% increase for people earning less.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About 30% of households in Manhattan earned $200,000 or more in 2024, compared with 14% of households nationally, according to the Census. (The median household income across the five boroughs is $81,228.) While that income may not make you feel rich in New York, the city attracts big spenders from around the world.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About 34,000 of the nearly four million New York City households that filed tax returns in 2023 earned $1 million or more, according to preliminary estimates from the city's Independent Budget Office. Nearly 2,000 of those households earned $10 million and up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The city claims 152 billionaires with their primary business address in the metro area, more than any other city in the world, according to data from Altrata, a wealth-intelligence firm.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"People with money still have money. People who are spending a couple thousand dollars on a group of 20 to go out for a night, they're not really changing how they spend,\" said Noah Tepperberg, co-chief executive of restaurant and nightclub operator Tao Group Hospitality. Revenue in the company's nightclubs is up 10% from a year earlier. The biggest challenge is the number of new venues competing for customers' business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>John Clyde decamped to his home in upstate New York after the pandemic emptied Manhattan's streets. The consulting firm he co-founded gave up its office space and went remote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now he's back in the city every other week, as much for fun as he is for work. The 54-year-old has tried many of the dozen or so Omakase sushi menus near his other home, a West Village apartment. He has seen favorite musical acts such as Counting Crows and David Byrne, and he doesn't sit in the nosebleeds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I want to be there and experience it up close,\" Clyde said. \"I tend to spend more than I used to.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cash is also pouring in from big spenders outside the city.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Luxury hotels saw the biggest gains in occupancy and average daily room rates year-to-date through September, compared with a year earlier, of any category, according to CoStar. Travelers want to stay in new boutique hotels and apartment suites that are hard to snag, said Henley Vazquez, the co-founder of Fora, a high-end travel agency. (The average client who books a five-star room in New York spends $1,710 a night, the highest of any U.S. metro.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The return of the wealthy to the city helped the economy come roaring back after the depths of the pandemic. Mamdani wants to raise taxes on people earning above $1 million a year, and his ascendance has prompted fears about an exodus of the wealthy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>City tax revenue rose more than 8% in the year that ended in June, driven largely by people earning more. The top 1% of earners pay nearly 50% of income taxes, according to a report from the city's comptroller using 2021 data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>High earners are vital to keeping the service economy humming, business owners said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since the pandemic, Aretsky's Patroon \"lost a lot of customers to their second homes or third homes.  They come in when they're in town. But we have new customers who have taken their places,\" co-owner Lyne said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The restaurant, which shut for six months during the pandemic, now has more than 70 employees and plans to hire more if private dining keeps booming.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On a recent Tuesday night, the newly refurbished Waldorf Astoria's swanky bar and lounge were brimming with guests, locals and suited businessmen indulging in $38 martinis and $28 bite-size pigs-in-a-blanket presented on a tiered silver platter. The hotel is within sight of JPMorgan Chase's new $3 billion Park Avenue skyscraper.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The city has always been a place of economic extremes, where great wealth and poverty exist side by side. Now, the rich are creating demand for services that surprises even veteran New Yorkers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You have people making $5 million a year who can't afford things. It's a strange alternate universe,\" said Rachel Glazer, a Compass real-estate broker who lives and sells property in Tribeca, one of the priciest neighborhoods in the city, where wealth creates competition for all kinds of services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are two kinds of people in the neighborhood, she said. One group includes professionals such as investment bankers and law-firm partners who would be extremely rich anywhere else. But here they are topped by the truly wealthy: heirs, celebrities and the very top earners in finance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A recent birthday party attended by one of her elementary-school-age daughters featured a spa day and gift bags with personalized robes for the children. Glazer booked a $377-a-month after-school gymnastics class for one of her daughters that meets once a week six months in advance out of fear of getting waitlisted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rents are up more than 7% across the city from a year earlier, according to StreetEasy. Some of the demand for rentals comes from wealthy people finding it is too expensive to buy, because of the combination of high home prices and mortgage rates above 6%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Those who do buy homes often have enough money to buy properties outright. About two-thirds of home purchases in Manhattan, where the median price is $1.2 million, were all-cash deals, according to real-estate brokerage Douglas Elliman. People are increasingly using money from family trusts to purchase apartments in the most expensive uptown co-op buildings, said Rich Ferrari, Elliman's New York City chief executive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Realtors are listing a handful of rentals for $100,000 a month and up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Living in a city dominated by wealth can be hard for people on more modest incomes. And price hikes also extend to smaller purchases: a takeout lunch is often $15 or more.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In this environment, even people who aren't the city's highest earners are swept up in the wealth economy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Recent New York University graduate Bryce Chan is spending $1,850 a month, or nearly half of her take-home pay, on rent for the Flatiron apartment that she shares with two friends. Her room has no window or air conditioning. Chan, who works in energy technology, calls cans of chickpeas from Trader Joe's \"a major food group.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the frugality, she often finds herself forking over up to $20 for her go-to tequila and soda. Chan and her friends try to limit themselves to a few drinks and find house parties later in the evening.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last year, West Village resident Ellie Williams, 26 years old, started documenting her weekends and posting videos of young people on the street talking about where they go out. She now has tens of thousands of followers, a fact she attributes to New Yorkers wanting to spend — but strategically.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Her friends will complain about spending if they buy five drinks at an unremarkable bar. But they are willing to shell out on hot spots that they consider to be unique experiences. When Williams visited the new East Village bar Schmuck, the line was out the door.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You have to go out in New York City,\" Williams said. \"That's the whole point of living in this amazing and beautiful city.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Rachel Louise Ensign at Rachel.Ensign@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "title": "AI Is Teaching the Next Generation of M.B.A.s the Classic Case Study — WSJ",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Lindsay Ellis</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When students turn to artificial intelligence to do assignments, it's usually to do the work easier, faster and, to the chagrin of educators, with less brain power. Not so at Northwestern University, where AI is revolutionizing the cornerstone of American business education — the case study.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For more than a century, M.B.A. students have learned business strategy through the case method. Professors assign write-ups of real-life corporate challenges. Students pore over pages of charts and reports on executives' perspectives, then debate in class the best plan of attack.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, AI is turning that method on its head. Students no longer read through every available factoid on, say, Walmart's wages for hourly workers and write a memo — tasks that can be easily circumvented with generative AI tools. Instead, M.B.A.s must draw out details and data through open-ended conversations with AI chatbots and then craft a strategy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Students who've worked through the AI-guided case — this one involves helping a school district erase a $50 million deficit fueled by transportation costs — say it more closely resembles what consultants and business leaders do in the real world: You're not handed information. You must determine what you need to know from a cast of AI-created school officials and employees, and grill it out of them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We started to fight fire with fire,\" says Kellogg associate professor Sébastien Martin, who created the tool — not as a shortcut but to slow students down and force them to think and engage.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most of them exchange an average of more than 50 messages with each character as they try to solve the school's budget crisis, Martin said. He and colleague Daniela Hurtado Lange began designing and crafting the AI school-district case in early 2025 and rolled it out to students a few months later. Martin estimates that more than 2,000 students have used AI cases as more professors integrate them into their classes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consultant 'PTSD'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At Kellogg, one-third of the Class of 2026 worked as consultants before enrolling. A slightly bigger share of last year's graduates landed in the field after graduation, making a median annual salary of $190,000. Similarly high percentages of students pursue consulting at other top business schools, including programs at Yale, Dartmouth and the University of Chicago.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is the exact kind of case that would come to me in consulting,\" said Aayush Khanna, 26, a second-year M.B.A. at Kellogg. Conversing with the chatbots felt so real, he said, that some of his classmates felt \"PTSD\" from their pre-M.B.A. careers in consulting, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You could feel the characters being designed in a way that emulates real-life experiences,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI isn't the first technology to transform the case method. A 1984 Boston Globe article detailed the \"case study in anxiety\" at Harvard Business School when students began more widely using personal computers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now at HBS, students are allowed to use technology including AI tools before and after class, but the classrooms themselves are generally tech-free, said Mitchell Weiss, an HBS faculty chair who teaches a second-year elective course that heavily integrates AI. (There are exceptions, including for hands-on AI classroom exercises.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In Weiss's public-entrepreneurship class, students practice selling police-record management systems to a chatbot posing as a police chief. Then, in class, they practice selling to one another — in front of a corporate-account executive — before selling to an interactive avatar. In another case, an AI tool evaluates students' spreadsheets forecasting funding.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Weiss has developed a similar experiment to Martin's at Kellogg, having students collect information through interviews with AI chatbots for a case. One recent topic was sovereign AI — whether countries needed to develop their own AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The AI exercise was more challenging for the students than the traditional method, Weiss said, because they needed to gather and prioritize the information themselves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There were also some kinks to work out in teaching, Weiss found. Unlike a typical case, that gives all students access to the same information, they came to the AI-case class with different facts because they asked the AI bots different questions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sassy characters</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the Kellogg school-district case, the AI-created superintendent shares that the transportation budget has become untenable. The students are tasked with delivering concrete recommendations on how to cut costs. The students then can text with the five virtual, AI-crafted characters — the superintendent, a principal, a bus driver and district finance and operations chiefs — that respond to users conversationally.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In building the case, Martin prompted the AI to study Boston, its school system's history of segregation, plus details on real schools' test scores and reputations.

Other market watchers say the sums are consistent with client execution and rebalancing. Market Sentiment Split </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sentiment indicators show a split mood.

Yet heads of some asset managers argue the opposite.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley has said institutions are “rushing in,” and he points to growing institutional interest as a signal that demand is building at higher levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Those two views sit at odds: visible outflows and rocky short-term flows on one side, and growing institutional allocation on the other. Price Context And What It Means </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bitcoin has been trading just a little over $110,000 as these moves happen. That price level matters because traders watch it as a barrier for bulls.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When big transfers land near key price points, they get extra attention; some see them as profit-taking, others as routine client service. Either way, the net effect on price depends on whether buyers step in to absorb the supply.Signals Traders Are Watching </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Keep an eye on three items: ETF flows, OTC activity, and on-chain outflows from known custodians. Spot crypto ETFs have shown net withdrawals in recent weeks, which can sap demand even if big institutions are slowly buying elsewhere.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If ETF outflows persist while wallets tied to major brokers keep moving coins out, price pressure may rise. But if inflows return to spot ETFs or large buyers match the OTC sales, that pressure can ease quickly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView</span></em></p></span></div></div>",

The Company's lead product candidate is MOLBREEVI (also referred to as \"molgramostim\"), an inhaled granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. MOLBREEVI is in a Phase 3 IMPALA-2 pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (\"aPAP\"), a chronic and debilitating rare lung disease characterized by the abnormal build-up of surfactant in the alveoli of the lungs. Savara has consistently represented that, based on investments in MOLBREEVI and its purported \"track record of strong fiscal discipline,\" the Company is \"sufficiently capitalized\" as early as through 2026 and as late as into the second half of 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In December 2024, Savara began a rolling submission of a Biologics License Application (\"BLA\")-</span><em><span>i.e.</span></em><span>, a submission requesting approval to distribute a biologic product across state lines-to the United States (\"U.S.\") Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") for MOLBREEVI for the potential treatment of aPAP (the \"MOLBREEVI BLA\"). In a press release announcing the submission, the Company touted that, \"given the positive results of the pivotal, Phase 3 IMPALA-2 trial, we believe MOLBREEVI demonstrates a favorable benefit-risk profile and could fundamentally change the way aPAP is treated,\" and that \"initiation of the [MOLBREEVI] BLA is an important milestone in potentially addressing the unmet need in aPAP, for which there are no approved medicines in the U.S. and Europe.\" Moreover, Savara represented that it \"expect[ed] to complete the submission of the rolling [MOLBREEVI] BLA by the end of [the first quarter of] 2025.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To obtain FDA approval of the MOLBREEVI BLA, Savara must submit, among other things, information regarding MOLBREEVI's chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (\"CMC\"). Specifically, the CMC section of a BLA must provide a detailed account of a product's manufacturing process-including process validation runs, stability testing, and analytical method validation-and detailed descriptions of facilities, equipment, and quality control procedures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the MOLBREEVI BLA lacked sufficient information regarding MOLBREEVI's chemistry, manufacturing, and/or controls; (ii) accordingly, the FDA was unlikely to approve the MOLBREEVI BLA in its current form; (iii) the foregoing made it unlikely that Savara would complete its submission of the MOLBREEVI BLA within the timeframe it had represented to investors; (iv) the delay in MOLBREEVI's regulatory approval increased the likelihood that the Company would need to raise additional capital; and (v) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On May 27, 2025, Savara issued a press release \"announcing that the Company received [a refusal to file] letter from the FDA for the [MOLBREEVI BLA] as a therapy to treat patients with [aPap].\" Specifically, Savara revealed that \"[u]pon preliminary review, the FDA determined that the [MOLBREEVI BLA] was not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review and requested additional data related to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC).\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Market analysts were quick to comment on the Company's announcement. For example, on May 27, 2025, Guggenheim published a report (the \"Guggenheim Report\") revising its price target for Savara to $8.00, down from the previous $9.00. Guggenheim stated that it \"do[es] not expect Savara to be profitable on a continuing basis until 2028 and expect[s] the company may raise additional capital, potentially through a secondary stock offering that could dilute the holdings of current investors.\" In addition, the Guggenheim Report noted that the \"CMC Delay Could Lead to Change in Molbreevi Manufacturing Strategy,\" predicting a delayed market launch sometime in early 2027, a year later than initially expected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On this news, Savara's stock price fell $0.90 per share, or 31.69%, to close at $1.94 per share on May 27, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then, after the end of the Class Period, on August 13, 2025, Savara issued a press release announcing the Company's financial results for the second quarter of 2025. Among other things, the press release revealed that, contrary to the Company's prior representations that it would complete its rolling submission of the MOLBREEVI BLA in the first quarter of 2025, Savara now \"plan[s] to resubmit the [MOLBREEVI] BLA in December [2025].\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.
