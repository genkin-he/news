The reforms passed with 77 votes in favor, 70 against and four abstentions. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Key among the changes is the replacement of the current environmental license with a broader “environmental authorization” for mining. Approval could take one of three forms based on risk: a full license, an environmental registry, or an environmental certificate.

The fuller license will still apply to higher-impact projects, officials say. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Large-scale mining development in Ecuador has been hampered by opposition from local communities, legal challenges and fluctuating regulations. The Fruta del Norte gold mine and the Mirador copper mine, both open since 2019, are currently the only two major operations in production.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>        The reforms also aim to establish a protected mining zone that would station troops in areas threatened by illegal mining and criminal gang operations.

He attributed the Treasury market's recent rally in long-dated government debt, and the resulting drop in yields, to broader fears about AI's destructive capacity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Thursday, yields on everything from the 1-year bill BX:TMUBMUSD01Y through the 30-year bond BX:TMUBMUSD30Y were slipping, despite a lack of any clear data or non-AI-related events that could explain those moves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Importantly, the benchmark 10-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, which is a peg for pricing new 30-year fixed mortgages, was on track to close Thursday's session at below 4.02%, which would be the lowest level of 2026. It is down from around 4.3% on Jan. 20.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An easing of that crucial rate since January has spilled over into mortgage financing, where rates for new 30-year fixed mortgages have fallen below the 6% threshold for the first time in three-and-a-half years, according to Freddie Mac.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read: Mortgage rates fall below 6%, giving buyers a glimpse of affordability</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Treasury yields act as a benchmark on borrowing costs for many American consumers and businesses. They can be influenced by a variety of things - such as the outlook for the U.S. economy and inflation, expectations for the path of interest rates, and rising geopolitical risks in the Middle East.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What's interesting now is that yields continue to trend lower even though the U.S. economy is generally holding up, expectations for the Federal Reserve's next rate cut have been pushed back to July, and the U.S. and Iran are involved in nuclear talks in Geneva that may reportedly produce an agreement. And while economic data have been mixed, most U.S. companies have avoided widespread layoffs - keeping a \"low-hire, low-fire\" labor market in place. Weekly jobless claims also remained near an exceedingly low level of 212,000 for the seven days that ended last Saturday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So long as workers have jobs, lower mortgage rates could help improve affordability issues. Yet fears of layoffs might still act as a counterbalance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read: CEOs say they won't add many jobs in 2026. Is a low-hire, low-fire labor market the new norm?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Within the bond market, \"there's been an ongoing bid related to job displacements from AI, and we've seen a drop in yields over the past couple of weeks because of that,\" LPL Financial's Gillum said in a phone interview. Thursday's bond-market moves \"seem like a continuation of that trade,\" he noted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gillum described the downward path in yields as an \"interesting dynamic\" in which the bond market \"is not trading how you would expect it to trade,\" given the potential for continued elevated inflation pressures over the next few years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We think, in the near term, that the AI buildout could keep inflation elevated for the next few years,\" Gillum said. \"What's interesting is that the bond market is not trading that. Instead, it's trading on the disinflationary impact that might happen a few years from now,\" as well as on a \"downgrade in economic expectations.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gillum's inflation view is shared by BofA Securities strategist Meghan Swiber and economist Stephen Juneau. In a note on Thursday, Swiber and Juneau wrote that they think, in the near-term, \"AI will drive more demand-side inflation from surging AI capex and a positive wealth effect.\" They added that \"the market narrative around disinflation effects has gotten ahead of itself\" because a slowing pace of price gains may not play out for another two years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Thursday, investors were reconsidering the likely winners and losers from AI. Shares of software companies like Salesforce (CRM) and Intuit (INTU) were rallying on the possibility that they might benefit from AI, after having previously been punished on fears that their industry might be wiped out. Meanwhile, stocks DJIA SPX COMP were mostly lower in afternoon trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Vivien Lou Chen</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The bank left its GDP forecast at 2.0% for 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The central bank said it still sees moderately faster growth, although from a higher base than previously estimated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the fourth quarter, Mexico's GDP grew 0.9% seasonally adjusted from the previous quarter, while third-quarter GDP was revised up to a 0.1% expansion from a previously estimated 0.3% contraction. The economy grew 0.6% in 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Private consumption growth is expected to accelerate gradually in 2026, while investment is likely to remain weak, at least until the second half of the year given uncertainty about the trade relationship with the U.S. and the coming review of the U.S.-Mexico Canada Agreement, the Bank of Mexico said. Exports are expected to continue with moderate growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The balance of risks for growth remains tilted to the downside, the central bank said. Downside risks include greater trade uncertainty with the U.S., geopolitical conflicts that may hurt global growth and trade, and Mexico's higher tariffs on countries with which it doesn't have a trade agreement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Upside risks to its forecast include a successful USMCA review, and the 2026 soccer World Cup which Mexico is co-hosting with the U.S. and Canada, and higher-than-expected U.S. economic growth, the central bank said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Anthony Harrup at anthony.harrup@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
