            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>CUPERTINO, Calif., Feb. 26, 2026 /CNW/ - </span><span> </span><span> — Boardwalktech Software Corp. (\"Boardwalktech\" or the \"Company\"), a leading digital ledger platform and enterprise software solutions company, is pleased to report its financial results for the three-month period ended December 31, 2025 (\"Q3-FY26\"). All figures are reported in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated. Boardwalktech's financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). Please refer to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&amp;A\") for the three-month period ended December 31, 2025, filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca for more information.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financial Highlights:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Revenues for Q3-FY26 totaled $1 million, unchanged from $1 million of   revenue reported in Q2-FY26. Revenues for Q3-FY26 decreased 25% from $1.3   million of revenue in Q3-FY25, primarily due to a decline in software and   subscription services revenue from two previously disclosed non-renewals   in Fiscal 2025.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Annual Recurring Revenue (\"ARR\"), a non-IFRS measure, at December 31,   2025 was $3.8 million. The Company defines ARR, as the annual recurring   revenue expected based on trailing quarterly revenue from license   subscriptions and certain recurring services.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Gross margin for Q3-FY26 was 86.9%, versus 86.7% in Q2-FY26 and 88.4% in   Q3-FY25. The improvement over Q2-FY26 is due to a decrease in cost of   sales, primarily hosting costs that are anticipated to continue at a   lower rate. The decrease from Q3-FY25 is due to lower revenue levels.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA for Q3-FY26 was a loss of $(0.2) million, which was a 35%   improvement versus $(0.4) million of adjusted EBITDA in Q2-FY26 and a 19%   improvement over $(0.4) million in Q3-FY25.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Net loss for Q3-FY26 was $(0.4) million ($(0.01) per basic and diluted   share), versus a $(0.5) million loss in Q2-FY26 ($(0.01) per basic and   diluted share), and a $(0.6) million loss in Q3-FY25 ($(0.01) per basic   and diluted share). This represented an 18% sequential improvement over   Q2-FY26 due to an increase in revenues and a decrease in costs. Total   selling, general and administration (\"SG&amp;A\") expenses in Q3-FY26 totaled   $1.1 million, a $0.1 million decrease from $1.2 million reported in   Q2-FY26 and a $0.3 million decrease from the $1.4 million reported in   Q3-FY25, as the Company continues to recognize savings from previously   announced cost alignment efforts.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Non-IFRS net loss for Q3 Fiscal 2026 (as defined in the Non-IFRS   Financial Measures section) totaled $(0.3) million ($(0.00) per basic and   diluted share), versus $(0.4) million in Q2 Fiscal 2026 ($(0.01) per   basic and diluted share) and $(0.4) million in Q3 Fiscal 2025 ($(0.01)   per basic and diluted share).   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Cash ending Q3-FY26 was $0.1 million, plus $0.4 million of accounts   receivables, while cash burn from Operations decreased by $0.9 million in   Q3-FY26 versus Q3-FY25, to a burn rate of $33,000 per month.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Outstanding debt as at December 31, 2025 was $2.5 million which was drawn   against the previously announced $4 million line of credit from Celtic   Bank. Due to requirements under IFRS, this debt was reclassified under   current liabilities even though the final debt maturity remains unchanged   at March of 2027. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Q3-FY26 Operational Highlights</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On November 4, 2025, the Company announced several contract renewals and   expansions increasing recurring revenue across multiple major enterprise   customers. The world's largest social media company renewed its services   agreement for another year, extending the partnership and expanding the   scope of work. A large global multinational IT services firm, both a   customer and partner, also expanded its engagement. A leading global   chemical manufacturer continues to expand its use of Unity Central to   improve supply chain visibility and enhance AI-driven information   management. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Subsequent to Q3-FY26 Operational Highlights:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On January 6, 2026, the Company announces the expansion and extension of   its contract with a leading global IT services firm to support a   top--five U.S. financial institution. Boardwalktech and the global IT   services firm have been jointly servicing this marquee U.S. bank since   2024, transforming manual workflows and processes into automated and   compliant solutions running on the Boardwalktech Velocity platform   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On January 20, 2026, the Company announced the launch of Boardwalk   Verity(TM), its next--generation Intelligent Controls Platform.   Purpose--built for highly regulated organizations, including banks,   insurers, and global financial institutions, Verity leverages Generative   AI and Agentic AI for controls automation, execution, validation, testing,   and continuous monitoring across thousands of business controls. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Management Commentary</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We continue to see existing customers expand deployments across Velocity and our Digital Ledger platform,\" said Andrew T. Duncan, CEO of Boardwalktech. \"Recent upgrade initiatives and new opportunities are expected to drive incremental professional services revenue and increase high-margin ARR. During the quarter, we enhanced Velocity with AI capabilities and subsequent to quarter-end we formally launched Verity, our first purpose-built AI product focused on automating internal controls testing and monitoring for financial institutions. Early traction with large banks and global partners reinforces our confidence in Verity as a meaningful growth driver. Unity Central also continues to gain momentum with AI enhancements improving enterprise data management and one supply chain customer already live and expanding usage based on measurable ROI. With previous cost reductions now taking effect and improved operating efficiency, we remain focused on accelerating revenue growth and moving toward Adjusted EBITDA breakeven in the near term. We believe the combination of Verity's launch, Velocity expansion, partner leverage, and continued cost discipline sets the stage for improved year-over-year performance and organic growth into Fiscal 2027 and beyond.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About Boardwalktech Software Corp.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Boardwalktech has developed a patented Digital Ledger Technology Platform currently used by Fortune 500 companies running mission-critical applications worldwide.
