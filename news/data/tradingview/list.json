In an analyst call Thursday, management said toy revenues were negatively impacted by tariff-related shifts in retailer buying patterns, a disruption that masked the company's true strength and momentum at the consumer level.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the outperforming segment of the quarter was the digital games division, which hosts the Toca Boca and Piknik platforms, that saw a 37% jump in revenue to $51.5 million, thanks to a focus on improved monetization and higher-value users rather than just total user numbers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, the company's point-of-sale performance was down only 1% in a market that fell 2.5%, which management said proved it is gaining significant market share. In the call, it also highlighted a strong performance in preschool, driven by its Miss Rachel partnership, and in its Wheels &amp; Action segment, where brands like Monster Jam grew faster than the industry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the third quarter, net income fell to $106.8 million, or $1.03 a share, from $140.1 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization on an underlying basis fell to $195.5 million from $277.5 million, but came in ahead of the $182.1 million consensus forecast.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Adriano Marchese at adriano.marchese@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Alina Dizik</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you dine out these days, you'll find a lot of trends on the menu.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Between omakase, small plates and cocktails with unpronounceable ingredients, even the most devoted foodies can get baffled when they walk into a restaurant. And don't forget the decorations that restaurants put up to make the perfect backdrop for selfies. Or the water that gets served in tiny bottles that need lots of topping up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Industry insiders have plenty of gripes about the played-out trends. \"It's so excessively over the top that it dilutes the entire reason for being there,\" says Omar Popal, co-founder of the Popal restaurant group in Washington, D.C.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So, which fads would the pros cross off the menu? We asked some experts to share the trends they find the most annoying.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Caviar on everything</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Restaurants are using caviar to create odd food combos and elevate unexpected dishes, adding the fish eggs to everything from cheesecake to chicken nuggets and hot dogs. But just dropping caviar into a dish doesn't guarantee better taste, says Leith Steel, a restaurant consultant at Carbonate, a hospitality agency in Cincinnati. \"It has a fairly subtle flavor, and it makes absolutely no sense to me to put it on a hamburger,\" she says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the end, she says, people end up paying a lot more for a fancy ingredient that may not deliver a culinary reward. \"You're asking somebody to pay extra for bragging rights,\" she says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Inadequate carafes</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Originally made in the 1800s for carrying beer, glass bottles with stoppers are popular, thanks to their classic design. But they just aren't practical, says Evan Hennessey, chef owner of Stages at One Washington in Dover, N.H. The \"swing top\" bottles look great, but they hold only two cups of water apiece — and for a thirsty table of four, that means constant refills.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It looks good on a picture, and that's about it,\" Hennessey says, adding that in his own restaurant, he uses larger carafes to smooth out service and keep diners from getting grumpy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another water gripe: Restaurants purposely not offering tap water can feel \"exclusionary,\" says Alexios Milioulis, a marketing executive at DineAmic, a Chicago-based restaurant group. Many diners don't want to be given the choice of \"sparkling or still\" without the option of drinking tap, he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Walls that make a statement</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Big displays with neon signs, selfie mirrors and even swings or old Vespas are an annoying part of today's restaurant scene, says Popal. For one thing, they can be a logistical hassle: As diners gather for photos, other people are forced to maneuver around them. Meanwhile, the statement wall may end up being a red flag for patrons, signaling that the restaurant cares more about the decor than the quality of the food.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Time limits for dining</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During Covid, many restaurants started enforcing time limits for taking up a table — and some never stopped. But these days, telling a table for two that they only have 90 minutes to eat is unappetizing, says Benjamin Berg, founder of the Berg restaurant group in Houston. \"It seems very transactional to me, and you start losing the whole hospitality thing,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And, since the pace of dinner service can depend on the restaurant's staffing that evening, slower service forces guests to rush and finish their food, he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At his restaurants, the staff may use subtle signs — such as turning up the music or bringing dessert menus — to entice diners to leave earlier, especially during the peak dinner times around 7 p.m. \"But if you're reminding me at the host stand about the time limit, do you even really want me here?\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Flowers you can eat</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chefs often use tiny flowers and microgreens to make plates pop, but they may end up confusing diners, says Alejandra Espinoza, owner and executive chef of Cotoa in Miami. Though the flowers are edible, most people push them off their plates because they aren't sure if they're food or not, she says. Diners are more willing to eat microgreens, but avoid them because they aren't sure about the taste.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, both types of delicate greens are expensive and impractical because they spoil after two days. \"Every chef is fighting for them, and they don't last very long,\" says Espinoza, who prefers using cilantro and other vibrantly colored greens to impart similar flavors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Long, scripted intros</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is tiresome to hear servers deliver endless preplanned patter at the table, says Milioulis. Minutes-long monologues about the menu, specials and style of the restaurant come across as \"robotic\" and alienate frequent diners or those who have already done their homework, he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We should never bore the guest with an entire spiel,\" he says. Shorter intros that leave room for a natural conversation feel more welcoming, he adds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Showy mocktails</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A lot of the spirit-free cocktails on drinks menus don't have the same sophistication as their alcohol-filled counterparts, say some critics. Just ask Jason Hall, a New York-based chef who doesn't drink alcohol. Mocktails \"come out in a Bordeaux glass with a big fruit garnish and a big straw, and you feel like you're getting this goofy thing,\" says Hall, who runs restaurants Sake No Hana and Cathedrale. \"It has way more pageantry than it needs.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So, when dining out, he passes up attention-grabbing mocktails and asks for simpler drinks such as tonic with nonalcoholic gin.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alina Dizik is a writer in Chicago.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Krystal Hur</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Warren Buffett still has a couple months left as Berkshire Hathaway's chief executive. The company's shares are already feeling his absence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Buffett, 95 years old, stunned investors at Berkshire's shareholder meeting in May when he revealed his plans to hand off his CEO duties to Greg Abel, his handpicked successor, at the end of this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The succession plan will also bring big changes to several treasured traditions for Berkshire watchers, many of whom treat Buffett's words of wisdom on business and investing as gospel. Abel will take over writing the annual letter to Berkshire's shareholders, Buffett's assistant confirmed to The Wall Street Journal, and will lead Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, Neb. Starting next year, Buffett, still chairman, will sit with the company's other directors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is another consequence to Buffett's retirement, especially to Berkshire shareholders, and it is already happening: Berkshire is losing its \"Buffett premium,\" or the higher price investors are willing to pay to own Berkshire's stock thanks to the longtime chairman and CEO's presence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire's Class B shares have declined 12% since the May meeting, in part on concerns about how Berkshire will manage without Buffett, some analysts say. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 index has gained 21% during that stretch. For the year, Berkshire shares are underperforming the benchmark index by the widest margin since 2020.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire is slated to report its third-quarter earnings on Saturday morning. But some on Wall Street are already looking past 2025 results and toward the road ahead, and they worry what comes next. Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods recently downgraded Berkshire to an \"underperform\" rating, one of just a handful of such ratings it has ever received, mostly in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, according to FactSet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The KBW analysts wrote that a decline in property catastrophe reinsurance pricing is expected to weigh on its insurance business, while the U.S.-China trade war threatens to weigh on its rail business's revenue. Lower interest rates could cut into the returns Berkshire gets from its mountain of cash. And, yes, Buffett's absence as CEO is another potential drag on shares, according to the analysts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There are people that have developed enormous confidence in Warren Buffett,\" says Meyer Shields, who co-wrote the note. \"For them, that's where the investment thesis starts and stops.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Buffett's remarkable stock-picking record has built such trust among investors that it has allowed the conglomerate to march to the beat of its own drum with little pushback. Berkshire has stuck to its knitting as an investor in search of bargains, even as a dizzying artificial-intelligence-stock rally left few corners of the market looking cheap. And while others have piled into shares of big tech behemoths, Berkshire has pared its position in Apple and built its cash pile to a record $344 billion, including equivalents, by the end of June.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are other oddities. Berkshire doesn't hold quarterly calls or issue financial guidance, unlike most other publicly traded firms, and the company's financial statements are sometimes based on estimates and subjective judgments somewhat opaque to investors. Some analysts say that investors could be less lenient with such quirks once Buffett steps down, but whether Berkshire will provide more clarity is another question.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Buffett is still chief executive for two more months and will continue sharing his thoughts to the investing world (and other subjects). A Thanksgiving letter to his three children and shareholders will be released Nov. 10, according to Buffett's assistant.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And many careful Berkshire readers will remember Buffett had already laid out his plans in the 2024 shareholder letter: \"At 94, it won't be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters,\" he wrote in March. \"Greg shares the Berkshire creed that a 'report' is what a Berkshire CEO annually owes to owners.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"And he also understands that if you start fooling your shareholders, you will soon believe your own baloney and be fooling yourself as well,\" he wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some investors also point out that the slide in Berkshire's stock came only after the stock staged its own record-breaking rally. Berkshire's price-to-book ratio, a valuation metric that divides a company's stock price by its book value, was trading at a multiyear peak of 1.7 the day before Buffett's announcement, above its 10-year historical average of 1.3.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group, says that the stock had only become overvalued in the days before the shareholder meeting, and that Berkshire shares' 5% gain this year still beats property-and-casualty insurers such as Progressive, whose shares are down 13% this year. Bloomstran has added to his Berkshire position in recent months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I don't think [Berkshire shares are] down at all because of the announcement,\" says Bloomstran, who has attended the company's annual meetings since 2000 . \"Everybody I know inside the Berkshire world has nothing but rave reviews and good things to say about Greg.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Henry Asher, president of the Northstar Group, which has owned Berkshire shares since 1988, says that he has held onto his Berkshire shares through their recent declines. Whether Abel can match Buffett's stock-picking record or not, Berkshire's businesses will remain the same, he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You're not going to cancel your shipment on the Burlington Northern because Buffett isn't there,\" says Asher. \"The businesses will continue to produce mammoth amounts of cash flow, with or without Buffett.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Krystal Hur at krystal.hur@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

Nanotyrannus was a slender, agile pursuit predator that could have run circles around the tyrant king,\" said paleontologist Lindsay Zanno of North Carolina State University and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, lead author of the study published on Thursday in the journal Nature.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The new analysis ends the debate around Nanotyrannus, Zanno said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It is not biologically possible to conclude that it is a juvenile T. rex,\" Zanno said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Their size difference was stark. Nanotyrannus had about 10% the body mass - about 1,500 pounds (700 kg) versus 15,000 pounds (7,000 kg). And it had about half the linear dimensions - approximately 18 feet (5.5 meters) versus roughly 40 feet (12.2 meters) long, and 7 feet (2 meters) versus 13 feet tall.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Nanotyrannus and T. rex are extremely different,\" said paleontologist and anatomist James Napoli of Stony Brook University in New York, co-author of the study.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nanotyrannus was a predator built for speed and agility, with long legs, a long snout with blade-like teeth and strong arms for manipulating prey. Tyrannosaurus was a colossal predator that was built for strength, with stocky legs, an enormous head, thick, banana-shaped teeth and greatly reduced arms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I suspect that these two species would have occasionally come into conflict, as predators tend to do, but the long legs of Nanotyrannus, and its small size, suggest that it mostly hunted smaller, faster prey than Tyrannosaurus,\" Napoli said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The researchers also determined that the Nanotyrannus specimens had sufficient anatomical differences to be divided into two separate species - Nanotyrannus lancensis and the newly named Nanotyrannus lethaeus. One of the Nanotyrannus fossils was part of the well-known \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" specimen, battling the horned dinosaur Triceratops at the time of death.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some scientific research into how Tyrannosaurus matured was based on the notion that the Nanotyrannus fossils represented T. rex juveniles, including studies that hypothesized that this apex predator experienced an extreme growth rate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"For decades, paleontologists have unknowingly used Nanotyrannus specimens as a model for teenage T. rex to understand the biology of Earth's most famous dinosaur. Those studies need a second look,\" Zanno said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The finding that Nanotyrannus and Tyrannosaurus shared the same landscape, along with myriad plant-eating dinosaurs, offers the latest evidence that dinosaur diversity was rich prior to the asteroid impact 66 million years ago that ended the age of dinosaurs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This discovery shows us that dinosaurs continued to evolve, innovate and diversify right up until their reign was cut short. This fits into a growing body of evidence proving that dinosaurs were not declining for millions of years before they went extinct, contrary to what we once thought,\" Napoli said.</span></p></span></div></div>",

He later denied to Reuters any link between the lyrics and the Nazis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AfD FINDS SYMPATHETIC EAR IN WASHINGTON</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The private reception in Manhattan, hosted by the New York Young Republican Club, underscores the AfD’s efforts to build international legitimacy and challenge what it calls undemocratic exclusion at home.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“We have no democracy anymore,” Gottschalk told attendees. “You can’t say what you think or what you like.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The AfD’s growing ties in Washington come as it surges in German opinion polls, threatening Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservatives ahead of a series of state elections next year that polls suggest could give the AfD its first state premier.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's a calculated opportunity to ... attract attention and achieve a proximity to government power that would be completely unthinkable in the concert of European or other states,\" said Oliver Lembcke, political scientist at the University of Bochum, referring to the AfD's series of meetings in the U.S. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The State Department did not comment but pointed to a photo  on X of Darren Beattie, the senior foreign service official, meeting with Wenzel Schmidt and his colleague Markus Frohnmaier.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The State Department official, who requested anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to media, said: \"When you have an organisation that's outside the mainstream, they crave the imprimatur of legitimacy that historically engaging with American diplomats has offered them.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many Germans are alarmed by the AfD, whose rise evokes unsettling parallels with the Nazi Party’s ascent in the 1930s, when authoritarian rule was established through legal means.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Germany's other parties refuse to work with its lawmakers by giving them influential positions in parliament or forming coalitions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That pact – known as the firewall – is undemocratic, the AfD argues. AfD politicians say they want to raise awareness about what they view as the worsening state of democracy in Germany, and gain high-profile backing abroad.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So far, they have struggled. The AfD is shunned by many of Europe's other far-right parties after a series of scandals and inflammatory comments. But, with the return of Trump to the White House, the AfD has found a sympathetic ear.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AfD WIELDS US TIES TO COUNTER POLITICAL ISOLATION AT HOME</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In February, U.S. Vice President JD Vance shocked European leaders by accusing them of censoring free speech, repressing political rivals and failing to control immigration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vance then met with AfD co-leader Alice Weidel in a sign of support shortly before federal German elections, where they came in an unprecedented second place.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the party's classification as extremist was tyranny in disguise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The AfD pounces on it whenever these comments come out, and they use it to pressure the government,\" the German government official said. \"This is a problem because outwardly we want and need good relations with Americans, and this sabotages it.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The AfD's grievances include wire-tapping by authorities,  moves to bar AfD members from the civil service and undemocratic attempts to exclude them from power, they told Reuters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>German intelligence earlier this year found the AfD to be \"extremist\" in part due to racist and anti-Muslim views. The designation allows the state to recruit informants and intercept communications and allows authorities to bar members deemed disloyal to the constitution from the civil service. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AfD politician Joachim Paul said the State Department had invited him to “explain the situation of the opposition in Germany” after he was barred from running for a mayoral position. German authorities had cited doubts about his loyalty to the country’s constitutional order.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paul said the U.S. officials he met in Washington were well-informed and told him they would follow his case. However, he added, they stopped short of offering direct assistance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AfD BUILT U.S. CONTACTS YEARS BEFORE TRUMP RE-ELECTED</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The foundation for the AfD's ties with the U.S. government was laid in the years running up to Trump's re-election.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The New York Young Republican Club has for years cultivated contacts with far-right European parties.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some former club members went on to hold senior positions in the Trump administration. Former club president Gavin Wax, who visited the AfD in Berlin in 2023, became chief of staff to the U.S. Undersecretary for Public Diplomacy, who until recently was Beattie. Beattie, now the department's Senior Bureau Official in Public Diplomacy, is on the club's advisory board.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before joining government, Wax met with right-wing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at a May gathering of nationalist parties in Budapest also attended by the AfD's Weidel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"In previous administrations, whether Democratic or Republican, the State Department didn't swing too much left or right,\" said the former State Department official. \"Now that's changing.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Frohnmaier, one of the AfD lawmakers photographed meeting Beattie, welcomed the U.S. interest in the party's challenges.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is \"our duty to raise awareness among democratic partners abroad about these developments, so that the anti-democratic forces in Germany encounter resistance from all sides,\" he said.</span></p></span></div></div>",
