            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Andrew Bary</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Charlie Munger ran the equity portfolio now worth about $500 million at Daily Journal, a public legal services company, for decades — and the company essentially decided to leave it alone after Munger's death in late 2023.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire Hathaway may be doing the same thing with most of its roughly $300 billion equity portfolio after Warren Buffett stepped down from the CEO role at the end of 2025. Munger was Berkshire's vice chairman and a longtime business partner of Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett, in addition to chairing Daily Journal for decades.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In his inaugural shareholder letter released Saturday morning, Berkshire CEO Greg Abel identified four large Berkshire equity investments — Apple, American Express, Coca Cola and Moody's — and suggested they are forever stocks, or close to it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Referring to the four companies, Abel wrote they are businesses \"we understand well, have a high regard for their leaders, and expect will compound over decades. This concentrated approach will continue, with limited activity in these holdings, though we may significantly adjust a holding if we see fundamental changes in its long-term economic prospects.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These stocks make up more than half of Berkshire's equity portfolio, and Abel also put Berkshire's stakes in five Japanese trading companies worth $35 billion in the same bucket. Together, these nine stocks comprise two-thirds of the portfolio.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Abel added that Berkshire had \"meaningful positions in a small number of other companies\" where \"capital allocation has been more dynamic\" and that they could become part of Berkshire's \"core holdings.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's notable that two of Berkshire's top five equity investments, Bank of America and Chevron, didn't make that core holdings list. Berkshire has cut its holding in Bank of America roughly in half to 517 million shares worth about $28 billion in the past 18 months. The Chevron stake totals about $20 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire has held its Coke and American Express stake for 40 years or more, and its Moody's stake for more than 20 years. Those are widely viewed as forever stocks by Berkshire watchers, due in part to a super-low cost basis. Berkshire paid an average of $3 a share for Coke in the late 1980s, compared with the stock's $81, a record close, on Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Apple stake is about a decade old. Buffett has cut it by about 80% from its peak a few years ago to 227 million shares at year-end 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Abel's statement suggests that the Apple stake will not be reduced further. Berkshire's cost basis in its Apple stake is about $27 a share, about a tenth of the current share price of $264. Berkshire's original cost basis on its stake of one billion shares was around $35 a share, but the company appears to have sold higher-cost basis stock to reduce its big tax bill from its Apple sales, mostly in 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The day-to-day management of the Berkshire equity portfolio remains unclear based on Abel's comments in the letter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Abel wrote that \"responsibility ultimately rests with me as CEO.\" Abel, however, has no experience as a portfolio manager, and has a full plate running Berkshire's 50-plus subsidiaries. Buffett has said that lack of formal investment experience doesn't matter, arguing that if a person can evaluate businesses as well as Abel can, he can pick stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Abel wrote that Buffett would be in the office five days a week and \"be available\" to consult on capital allocation, including equity investments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ted Weschler, who is about 64, has been investment manager at Berkshire since 2012. He and Todd Combs, who left Berkshire in December for an investment position at J.P. Morgan, had each run an estimated 5% of the equity portfolio, with Buffett handling the rest.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It had been expected that Weschler would play a much greater role with the portfolio after Buffett's retirement as CEO. But Abel wrote that Weschler would manage 6% of the investments, including a part of what Combs had run — not much changed from what he ran before.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is a different set-up than what Berkshire s tated when it hired Weschler in 2011. \"After Mr. Buffett no longer serves as CEO, Todd and Ted — possibly aided by one additional manager — will have responsibility for the entire equity and debt portfolio of Berkshire, subject to overall direction by the then-CEO and Board of Directors,\" according to the 2011 press release.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Abel wrote in his letter that \"equity investments are fundamental to our capital allocation activities.\" But it's not clear who will be making big stock-picking decisions. Some Berkshire watchers think that Abel will deemphasize equity investing as CEO.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That remains to be seen, but the lack of a day-to-day portfolio manager responsible for the entire portfolio — and Abel's suggestion about forever stocks — suggest that new equity investments may not be a big future source of value creation at Berkshire.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That would be notable, since Buffett built Berkshire in its early decades from successful stock investments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Andrew Bary</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire Hathaway's operating profits after taxes fell 30% in the fourth quarter to $10.2 billion, depressed by a drop of more than 50% in insurance underwriting profits and lower insurance investment income.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company bought back none of its own stock in the period, continuing a trend that began in May 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire's cash and equivalents stood at $373 billion at the end of 2025, down from a peak of $381 billion at the end of September.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusting for the timing of some Treasury bill purchases at the end of the third quarter, Berkshire's cash levels were higher at year-end than on Sept. 30.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire took a non-cash writedown of its equity stake in Kraft Heinz of $4.5 billion in the fourth quarter, capping a total of $8.3 billion of writedowns on that equity stake during 2025. Berkshire was carrying the 27% stake in Kraft Heinz at $8.6 billion at year-end 2025. That's close to the current market value of around $8 billion. The writedowns reflected the weakness in Kraft stock during 2025, when it fell about 20%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire filed earlier this year to potentially sell some or all of that Kraft interest, but has not made any sales yet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire's operating earnings after taxes per share fell 30% to about $7,093 per class A share in the fourth quarter relative to the year-earlier period. That fell well short of the FactSet consensus of $8,400 per A share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The lack of stock buybacks in the fourth quarter is a mild disappointment to Berkshire investors, but not a surprise. Analysts hadn't expected the company to repurchase shares during Warren Buffett's final three months as CEO. He was succeeded at the start of 2026 by Greg Abel, while Buffett remains chairman.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire also wasn't a buyer of its stock during January, Barron's calculates, based on the share count on Jan. 31 disclosed in Berkshire's 10-K report released Saturday. There were about 1.438 million shares of class A equivalent shares outstanding at year-end with class B shares converted to an equivalent amount of class A stock. Only about 35% of Berkshire's stock is now in the original class A shares.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The lack of stock buybacks indicates that the company doesn't view the stock as cheaply valued; Berkshire will repurchase its shares when it views them trading as a discount to the stock's intrinsic value \"conservatively determined,\" Abel said in his shareholder letter released Saturday morning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire's book value rose about 3% during the fourth quarter to about $499,000 per class A share, Barron's calculates. Berkshire stock now trades for about 1.5 times year-end 2025 book value, in line with its average price/book ratio in the past few years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire's total after-tax earnings in the fourth quarter were down about 2% to $19.2 billion. That figure reflects both operating income of Berkshire's businesses, and investment gains, mostly unrealized.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire chairman Buffett tells investors to focus on the operating profits, due to variability of investment gains from quarter to quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The drop in Berkshire's fourth-quarter operating profits is somewhat overstated, because the company includes in operating earnings non-cash currency swings mostly related to the company's yen-denominated debt that funds its equity ownership of five Japanese trading companies. Adjust for the currency swings, and the drop in earnings was about 28%. There were about $600 million of currency gains in the fourth quarter against $1.2 billion in the year-earlier period. Berkshire generates those non-cash gains when the dollar rises relative to the Japanese yen.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What Berkshire calls other income, which includes the currency swings, was down to $159 million in the fourth quarter from $1.8 billion in the prior period. Strip out the other incom, and operating profits after taxes would have been down about 20% year over year, Barron's calculates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Insurance underwriting results fell 54% to $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Insurance investment income was down 25% to $3.1 billion in the period. The decline in insurance investment income overstates the drop in Berkshire's total investment income, because the company has shifted a significant chunk of investments to the parent company from the insurance units.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The parent company had about $127 billion of cash and equivalents at year-end 2025, up from around $96 billion a year earlier. Having cash at the parent company gives Berkshire more financial flexibility, since insurance regulators can limit cash that can be upstreamed from insurance units.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire's parent-company investment income roughly doubled in the fourth quarter to $927 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire held a total of $321 billion of Treasury bills at year-end 2025, making it one of the largest holders in the world.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earnings at the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad rose 7% to more than $1.3 billion in the period, while profits after taxes at Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the company's big utility unit, were down 5% in the fourth quarter to $691 million. Profits rose 3% to $3.4 billion at the company's diversified manufacturing service and retailing segment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Insurance float stood at $176 billion at year-end, up $5 billion during 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire was a net seller of stocks for the third straight year in 2025, as Buffett and his investment managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs (Combs left Berkshire in December) found few major opportunities. The company was a net seller in the fourth quarter of about $3.5 billion of equities, selling $7 billion and buying $3.5 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the year, Berkshire was a net seller of about $14 billion of stocks in 2025, $134 billion in 2024 (when it unloaded much of its Apple equity stake) and $24 billion in 2023, Barron's calculates based on data in the 10-K released Saturday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire's equity portfolio stood at about $298 billion at year-end, and more than $315 billion when including the company's equity interests in Kraft Heinz and Occidental Petroleum.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire's class A shares finished Friday at $757,000 and the class B stock at $504.95.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Nicole Goodkind</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran Saturday may jolt oil markets on Sunday evening. They could also dim the odds of Federal Reserve rate cuts this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crude settled at $72.87 a barrel before the attacks. When trading resumes, prices are expected to rise as investors assess the risk to global supply, particularly through the Strait of Hormuz, which carries roughly one-fifth of the world's oil and liquefied natural gas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oil is likely to move higher when Asian markets open, with investors likely shifting toward dollar-denominated assets in the early phase of the conflict, said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. If crude climbs and stays elevated, gasoline prices will likely follow.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said the national average gasoline price, now around $3 per gallon, could rise to roughly $3.10 to $3.15 in the coming weeks if crude remains elevated. For the Fed, that increase arrives at a sensitive moment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Inflation has run above the central bank's 2% target for nearly five years — and tariff-related costs are beginning to work their way to the consumer, increasing prices. Services inflation has proved sticky, and markets have steadily scaled back expectations for rate cuts in 2026 as progress toward a 2% inflation rate has slowed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Energy is excluded from the core personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. Policymakers also often argue that monetary policy shouldn't respond to volatile swings in oil — but that approach is easier to defend when inflation is low and expectations are stable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Today, expectations are more fragile and gasoline prices remain one of the most visible costs for households.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After years of elevated inflation, another price hike at the pump risks reinforcing the perception that price pressures are becoming entrenched. If inflation stays around 3%, the dovish argument for easing becomes harder to make.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That could strengthen the hand of more hawkish Fed officials, who have warned against cutting rates prematurely. A majority of policymakers have already signaled that they want clearer evidence that inflation is returning to the central bank's target rate before supporting any shift toward easier policy. A sustained rise in oil would give them additional cover to wait.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors have begun adjusting and have pared back expectations for rate cuts beginning in June, according to the CME FedWatch tool.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, there's an argument to be made as higher oil prices tend to weigh on economic growth by squeezing household budgets and raising business costs. Energy functions like a tax, reducing discretionary spending and compressing margins. A large enough move could slow activity and cool demand-driven inflation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pressure on inflation, plus a potential drag on growth, complicate the Fed's calculus. Responding too quickly to higher energy costs could cause too much tightening. Ignoring them could mean that inflation expectations drift higher.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Policymakers may not reference Iran directly in their March statement, but they may acknowledge heightened geopolitical uncertainty and risks tied to energy prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The situation differs from 2022, when Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered a historic surge in oil prices. At that time, global demand was rebounding from pandemic lows and capacity was constrained. Iran is a smaller exporter than Russia, and current global supply-demand conditions are less strained.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, another supply-driven price shock, layered on top of tariffs and persistent services inflation, could increase the likelihood that rates remain higher for longer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Nicole Goodkind at nicole.goodkind@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The image depicts Knots developer Lucas Dashjr, a central proponent of BIP-110 (formerly BIP-444), crying. Habovštiak announced the project on X on Thursday, linking to a detailed write-up that includes step-by-step instructions for independent verification using any Bitcoin full node.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The demonstration is notable for what it did not use: the transaction contains no OP_RETURN opcodes, does not rely on Taproot (using SegWit v0 instead), and contains no OP_IF instructions. These are among the primary vectors that BIP-110 targets for restriction, and Habovštiak argues their absence proves that the proposal's restrictions can be circumvented without relying on any of them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The proof-of-concept arrives amid an ongoing and at times bitter dispute between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots camps over what types of data should be permitted on the Bitcoin network. BIP-110, originally introduced as BIP-444 in October 2025, proposes a temporary one-year soft fork that would cap OP_RETURN outputs at 83 bytes, limit individual data pushes to 256 bytes, and restrict other scripting features that enable large data storage. It was introduced after Bitcoin Core's v30 release effectively uncapped OP_RETURN data limits earlier that year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Luke Dashjr, the Bitcoin Core developer who maintains Bitcoin Knots and serves as CTO of Ocean mining pool, has been a vocal proponent of limiting arbitrary data on Bitcoin, calling inscriptions \"spam\" since 2023. BIP-110 proponents have argued that contiguous data storage creates legal risks for node operators and diverts Bitcoin from its core purpose as money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In his own posts on X, Dashjr contested the characterization of Habovštiak's transaction as \"contiguous,\" writing in one such post, \"His spam isn't and doesn't contain contiguous images.\" </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As of late January 2026, about 583 nodes, or 2.38% of the network, were signaling BIP-110 support, according to data published by Dashjr. The proposal is implemented exclusively through Bitcoin Knots, which has seen its node count grow roughly tenfold since the start of 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Habovštiak, a prolific open-source contributor, also produced a BIP-110-compliant version of the image transaction, tested against Bitcoin Knots' own regtest environment. The compliant version was reportedly larger than the original, which he argued demonstrates that BIP-110's restrictions would actually increase the total amount of data stored on the blockchain rather than reduce it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Habovštiak said the project was a one-time effort and that he would not be publishing his code, explicitly to avoid enabling a new wave of NFT-like activity on Bitcoin. He described himself as an opponent of blockchain spam who was motivated by what he considered \"untruths\" from the Knots camp.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There's something I hate much more than spam: Untruths,\" Habovštiak wrote. \"I tried arguing about this in the past, showed a contiguous image encoded to fit into witness, and yet, the Knots supporters are still saying the same stuff over and over.\" The Block could not reach Habovštiak or Dashjr for comment. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Daqo New Energy posted its first positive EBITDA in six quarters during Q3 2025, reporting $45.8 million in adjusted earnings as polysilicon prices recovered from $4.19/kg to $5.80/kg. The company sold 42,406 metric tons against production of just 30,650 MT, drawing down inventory accumulated during the brutal downturn that saw prices collapse 85% from 2022's $39/kg peak. With zero debt and $2.21 billion in cash and investments, Daqo possesses the balance sheet to outlast weaker competitors. But the company's 40% capacity utilization rate and production costs of $6.38/kg that still exceed selling prices raise fundamental questions about whether this cyclical inflection represents genuine recovery or merely a temporary reprieve in a structurally oversupplied industry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Business Model: Pure-Play Polysilicon Commodity Exposure</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Daqo operates a 305,000 MT annual polysilicon production facility in Xinjiang, China, using the modified Siemens process to produce high-purity silicon for photovoltaic manufacturers. Unlike vertically integrated competitors, Daqo sells exclusively into the spot market with no downstream wafer or cell operations to hedge commodity price volatility. The company has shifted its product mix toward N-type polysilicon, which now represents 70% of production compared to 40% in 2023. N-type material enables higher-efficiency solar cells and commands premium pricing, with Q3 2025 transactions ranging from RMB 49-55/kg versus RMB 32-35/kg for P-type material.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The polysilicon production process is energy-intensive, requiring 52-55 kilowatt-hours per kilogram at Daqo's facilities. This positions the company well below China's new mandatory energy consumption standard of 64 kWh/kg-Si, which took effect in September 2025. Producers exceeding this threshold must implement corrective improvements or face production restrictions. Industry estimates suggest 20-30% of older capacity may struggle to meet this standard, though the actual enforcement timeline and impact remain unclear. For Daqo, the regulation reinforces its cost advantage rather than creating immediate capacity rationalization. For Daqo, this regulation transforms a cost advantage into a regulatory moat.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Q3 2025: First Positive Quarter After Six Quarters of Losses</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Q3 2025 results marked a decisive turning point. Revenue jumped to $244.6 million from $75.2 million in Q2, driven by a 134% increase in sales volume and a 38% recovery in average selling prices. Gross margin turned positive at 3.9% compared to Q2's negative 108%, reflecting higher prices, lower production costs, and the benefit of inventory impairment write-downs taken earlier in the cycle.

Cash costs declined to $4.54/kg from $5.12/kg in Q2, representing an 11% sequential improvement and the lowest in the company's history. Total production costs fell to $6.38/kg from $7.26/kg. Operating at 40% capacity utilization, Daqo produced 30,650 MT while selling 42,406 MT, depleting inventory by roughly 11,750 MT to reach what management termed \"healthy levels.\" This inventory drawdown was strategicDaqo capitalized on favorable pricing to monetize stockpiles accumulated when prices traded below cash costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, the company still reported a GAAP net loss of $14.9 million, driven by operational losses of $20.3 million and an operating margin of negative 8.3%.

This $1.26/kg must cover $1.84/kg in depreciation plus all corporate overhead. With Q3 SG&amp;A of $32 million spread across 42,406 MT sold, overhead adds another $0.75/kg, bringing total cost to roughly $7.13/kg against $5.80/kg revenuea $1.33/kg shortfall.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company's full-year 2025 guidance of 121,000-124,000 MT production implies annualized capacity utilization of approximately 40%. At this utilization rate, Daqo's fixed cost burden remains elevated. Depreciation of $1.84/kg reflects assets designed for 305,000 MT annual output, meaning each kilogram of actual production must absorb 2.5x its proportionate share of fixed costs. Idle facility maintenance cost $0.16/kg in Q3, further eroding economics.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For Daqo to achieve sustainable profitability, one of three conditions must occur:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Polysilicon prices rise to $8.50-9.00/kg (47% above Q3 levels)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Cash costs decline below $4.00/kg (12% further reduction)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Utilization rates approach 75-80% to spread fixed costs</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Owner Economics: What Does Owning This Business Actually Mean?</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Viewing Daqo through an owner's lens reveals uncomfortable truths about commodity manufacturing businesses with high fixed costs and no pricing power. An outright owner of Daqo effectively purchases $6.7 billion in gross property, plant and equipment (depreciated to $2.8 billion net book value) operating at 40% capacity in a market where oversupply is forcing coordinated production cuts. The owner's return depends entirely on the polysilicon spot pricea variable beyond management's control.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consider the cash generation profile. At Q3's 40% utilization and $5.80/kg pricing, Daqo generates $53 million in quarterly gross cash ($1.26/kg 42,406 MT), or roughly $212 million annualized. Corporate overhead of $128 million annually ($32M 4 quarters) reduces owner cash flow to $84 million before taxes, maintenance capex, and working capital swings. This represents a 3.8% cash-on-cash return on the $2.2 billion market capitalizationworse than U.S. Treasury bills.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The asset turnover is equally concerning. Daqo generated $244.6 million in Q3 revenue (~$978 million annualized) against $2.8 billion in net PP&amp;E, implying 0.35x asset turnover. Best-in-class manufacturers target 1.0-1.5x turnover, but commodity businesses operating below 50% utilization structurally cannot achieve this. An owner is thus paying for dormant capacity that may never generate returns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The cyclical asymmetry compounds the problem. During upcycles, polysilicon prices mean-revert from oversupplied lows toward marginal cost, allowing efficient producers like Daqo to earn attractive returns for 12-18 months. But during downcycles, prices can trade below cash costs for years, as occurred from Q1 2024 through Q3 2025. The owner must fund cumulative losses during prolonged troughs, which can exceed the profits earned during brief peaks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Daqo's debt-free balance sheet and $2.21 billion in liquid assets provide crucial optionalitythe owner can survive extended downturns and potentially acquire distressed capacity. But this cash represents 98% of the current market capitalization, implying the market values the operating business at just $440 million ($2.64B market cap - $2.21B cash). Stated differently, investors are paying $1.44/kg of annual capacity ($440M 305,000 MT) for a business generating $1.26/kg in gross cash at 40% utilization.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The owner's worst-case scenario involves permanent demand destruction or technological substitution. If fluidized bed reactor processes mature to produce N-type material at meaningfully lower costs, Daqo's Siemens-based assets could become stranded. The owner would face a binary outcome: operate at cash-burning levels to maintain optionality, or permanently idle facilities and crystallize losses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Through-Cycle Economics: What Does Daqo Actually Earn?</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking at Q3 2025 in isolation misses the point. The real question for long-term owners is what Daqo earns across a full polysilicon cycle, not just at the inflection point.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Polysilicon completed a full cycle from June 2020 ($6.75/kg) to August 2022 ($39/kg) and back to late 2023 ($6.75/kg again). The upcycle lasted roughly 18 months while the downturn lasted about 16 months. Based on this pattern, here's what normalized economics look like:</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Mid-Cycle Assumptions:</span></strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Polysilicon price: $12-14/kg (midpoint between trough of $7/kg and sustainable high of $18-20/kg)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Capacity utilization: 65% (190,000 MT annually vs 305,000 MT nameplate)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Cash costs: $4.75/kg (modestly higher than Q3's $4.54/kg due to input inflation)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Total production costs: $6.25/kg (includes depreciation)</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Mid-Cycle Economics:</span></strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Revenue: 190,000 MT $13/kg = $2.47 billion</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Gross profit: 190,000 MT ($13 - $6.25) = $1.28 billion (52% gross margin)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Less SG&amp;A: $128 million</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>EBITDA: ~$1.15 billion (47% EBITDA margin)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Less depreciation: ~$300 million</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Operating income: ~$850 million</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>After-tax: ~$640 million (25% tax rate)</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>At $2.64 billion market cap with $2.21 billion in cash, the operating business trades at $440 million enterprise value. Mid-cycle normalized earnings of $640 million imply a 1.5x P/E on the operating assetsattractive if you believe mid-cycle conditions persist for 2-3 years out of every 5-year cycle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The problem is cyclical asymmetry. During 18-month upcycles at $18-20/kg pricing, Daqo might generate $1.2-1.5 billion in cumulative earnings. But during 24-month downturns at $5-7/kg pricing, the company burns through $200-400 million in cumulative losses. The fortress balance sheet matters because it funds the losses during troughs, but the operating business itself doesn't compound valueit redistributes it from weak cycles to strong ones.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the current $32.95 ADS price to work, you need to believe either: (1) this cycle's peak lasts longer than historical 18-month upcycles, or (2) industry consolidation permanently reduces capacity enough that mid-cycle prices settle at $14-16/kg instead of $12-14/kg. Neither seems obviously true based on China's track record of production discipline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Visualizing the Profitability Window</span></strong></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:993.2203389830509px;aspect-ratio:1.655367231638418\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/gurufocus:9f93845bc094b-0052b6c1a2b11e2bdea94467198cc4de-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"2023315380109484032.png\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/gurufocus:9f93845bc094b-0052b6c1a2b11e2bdea94467198cc4de-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#fafafa\"/></picture></div></button></figure><p class=\"\"><span>The polysilicon price cycle over the past five years tells the story clearly. Prices started at $6.75/kg in June 2020, surged to $39/kg by August 2022, then collapsed back to $4.19/kg by Q1 2024 before recovering to current levels around $8.30/kg. Plotting Daqo's cash costs ($4.50-5.00/kg range) and total production costs ($6.25-7.25/kg range) against this price history shows how narrow the profitability window actually is. The company operated below cash costs for four consecutive quarters in 2024, meaning every kilogram produced burned cash. Even at today's $8.30/kg price, Daqo barely covers total costs including depreciation. The chart makes obvious what the financials confirmthis business only generates attractive returns during brief 12-18 month windows when prices spike above $15/kg, which happened for maybe 15 months out of the past 60. The other 45 months were either marginal or cash-burning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Comparative Analysis: Daqo vs. Tongwei vs. GCL Technology</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Daqo's position becomes clearer when benchmarked against the industry's top two producers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Tongwei</span></strong><span> (910,000 MT capacity, 3.0x Daqo's size):</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Vertically integrated across polysilicon, wafers, cells, and modules</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Operated at 100% capacity utilization even during downturn due to internal consumption</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>H1 2025: RMB 4.96 billion net loss on RMB 40.5 billion revenue</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Q3 2025: Reduced losses to RMB 315 million from RMB 2.36 billion in Q2</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Cash costs estimated at RMB 35/kg (~$4.90/kg), slightly above Daqo's $4.54/kg</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Tongwei's vertical integration provides natural hedgingwhen polysilicon prices collapse, downstream wafer and cell margins expand. However, it also constrains strategic flexibility. Tongwei cannot easily curtail polysilicon production without disrupting its own wafer supply chain, forcing it to operate at higher utilization rates even at losses. This makes Tongwei the price-setting marginal producer; its cash cost of ~$4.90/kg effectively establishes the floor price below which the industry sheds capacity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>GCL Technology</span></strong><span> (480,000 MT capacity, 1.6x Daqo's size):</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Second-largest pure-play polysilicon producer</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Q3 2025: PV materials business returned to profitability with RMB 960 million profit vs. RMB 1.81 billion loss in Q3 2024</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Less transparent cost reporting, but industry sources suggest cash costs of RMB 40-45/kg (~$5.60-6.30/kg)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Operating rates between 30-60% during downturn</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>GCL's faster return to profitability compared to Daqo in Q3 suggests either superior cost structure or more aggressive inventory drawdowns. However, GCL's larger capacity and higher estimated cash costs mean it faces steeper challenges sustaining profitability if prices retreat from current levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Daqo's Competitive Position</span></strong><span>: At $4.54/kg cash costs, Daqo ranks among the global cost leaders, trailing only Tongwei's estimated $4.90/kg and well below the industry average of $5.50-6.50/kg. This cost advantage is criticalin commodity businesses, low-cost producers survive downturns while high-cost capacity exits. China's 6.4 kg/kg-Si energy consumption standard reinforces Daqo's position by forcing inefficient producers to either improve or shut down.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, Daqo's pure-play exposure means it absorbs full commodity price volatility. While Tongwei loses money on polysilicon during downturns, it partially offsets losses through downstream margins. Daqo enjoys no such buffer. The company's smaller scale also limits negotiating power with suppliers of silicon metal and electricity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Supply Chain and Input Cost Dynamics</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Polysilicon production requires three critical inputs: silicon metal, electricity, and coal. The math on input costs isn't encouraging.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Silicon metal represents the primary raw material at roughly $1.40-1.60/kg currently. It takes 3.5-4.0 kg of silicon metal to produce 1 kg of polysilicon, implying $4.90-6.40/kg in raw material costs. Forecasts project Northeast Asian silicon metal prices rising 7% annually, adding $0.35-0.40/kg to Daqo's cost structure by 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Electricity costs run $5.88-6.22 per MWh in Xinjiang, contributing roughly $0.60/kg to polysilicon production at 52-55 kWh per kg consumption rates. Daqo benefits from abundant coal-fired and renewable generation in Xinjiang, but seasonal variations affect pricing. A 2% annual electricity cost increase adds another $0.01-0.02/kg.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The compounding effect matters. With 7% annual silicon metal inflation plus 2% electricity inflation, Daqo faces ~$0.40/kg in cumulative cost headwinds by 2027. If selling prices stay flat at $8/kg while costs rise from $6.38/kg to $6.78/kg in 2026 and $7.18/kg in 2027, the already-thin margins evaporate. This is why the through-cycle analysis mattersinput cost inflation runs 5-7% annually while polysilicon prices historically mean-revert, creating a margin squeeze during the back half of every cycle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Valuation and Investment Framework</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>At $32.95 per ADS ($2.2 billion market capitalization), Daqo trades at 0.63x book value of $3.5 billion. This discount reflects the market's assessment that the company's assets cannot generate returns commensurate with their carrying valuea judgment supported by the operating reality. At 40% utilization and $5.80/kg pricing, return on assets approximates 1.3% ($84M owner cash flow $6.7B gross PP&amp;E), well below any reasonable cost of capital.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company's $2.21 billion in cash and investments represents 98% of the market capitalization, implying investors value the operating business at just $440 million. Stated differently, the market prices Daqo's production capacity at $1.44/kg of annual nameplate capacity ($440M 305,000 MT)a business generating $1.26/kg in gross cash at 40% utilization.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For Daqo to generate acceptable owner returns, the investment thesis requires belief in three sequential developments:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>First, polysilicon prices must sustainably exceed $8.00/kg to cover total costs including depreciation and overhead. Current prices of $8.30/kg represent meaningful improvement from Q3's $5.80/kg, but whether this level persists depends entirely on industry production discipline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Second, capacity utilization must approach 65-75% to spread fixed costs appropriately. At 40% utilization, each kilogram of production absorbs 2.5x its proportionate share of depreciation and overhead. Higher utilization dilutes this burden, but requires either Daqo taking market share from competitors or industry-wide demand growth outpacing supply additions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Third, input costs must remain stable or decline. With silicon metal prices forecast to rise 7% annually and electricity costs growing 2% annually, the cost structure faces $0.40-0.50/kg in cumulative headwinds by 2027. Unless production efficiencies offset these increases, margins compress even if selling prices hold steady.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Historical polysilicon cycles suggest prices above $9.00/kg attract new capacity within 18-24 months, limiting the duration of high-margin periods. Conversely, prices below $6.00/kg force capacity rationalization but inflict cumulative losses during extended troughs. The question for potential owners is whether Daqo's cost leadership and balance sheet strength position it to capture disproportionate value during the next upcycle relative to the losses absorbed during downturns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Risk/Reward Assessment</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The skew of outcomes favors caution. Bull case requires near-perfect execution of industry consolidation, sustained demand growth, and stable input coststhree conditions that must align simultaneously. Base case requires only moderate improvement from current state but offers limited upside given current valuation. Bear case requires merely a return to early-2025 conditions if consolidation efforts fail.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Polysilicon prices as of early January 2026 have continued recovering, reaching RMB 59,200/MT ($8.30/kg) with new orders above RMB 60,000/MT ($8.40/kg). This represents a 45% increase from Q3 2025's $5.80/kg and suggests the industry's coordinated capacity cuts are having near-term effects. However, sustainability remains questionable. The China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association projects January 2026 production could fall to 60,000-80,000 MT (from 115,000 MT in December 2025), but industry analyst Johannes Bernreuter cautions that Chinese polysilicon and wafer producers have historically failed to maintain production discipline once prices recover.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Conclusion</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Daqo New Energy has executed well within its controlachieving industry-leading cash costs, maintaining a fortress balance sheet, and surviving a brutal two-year downturn that forced weaker competitors into bankruptcy. The Q3 2025 inflection point demonstrates the company's operational excellence and cost discipline. However, Daqo cannot control polysilicon prices, which remain the dominant variable determining shareholder returns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The fundamental challenge is that Daqo operates a capital-intensive, commodity manufacturing business in a structurally oversupplied industry where China's top four producers control 65% of global capacity and built two-thirds of new capacity between 2020-2024. For shares to deliver attractive long-term returns from current levels, polysilicon prices must sustain $8.00-9.00/kg for multiple yearsa scenario that historically attracts new capacity and triggers the next downcycle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The current price recovery to $8.30/kg provides a tactical window for Daqo to rebuild margins and cash generation. Whether this represents a genuine inflection or merely a cyclical bounce will be determined by whether Chinese producers can enforce production discipline once prices reach profitable levels. History suggests they cannot. For investors willing to underwrite commodity cycles and bet on Daqo's survival as a low-cost producer, current valuations may offer value. For those seeking stable, predictable returns, the risk/reward profile warrants caution until multiple quarters of sustained profitability demonstrate the inflection is real rather than transitory.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Suddenly, what's old is new again.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> There's a popular trade sweeping Wall Street that's offering an old world solution to the threat of AI disruption: \"HALO,\" or \"Heavy Assets, Low Obsolescence.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> What that means is that more investors are betting that companies with hefty real assets such as grids, pipelines and heavy machinery are the ones least likely to be replaced by artificial intelligence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> \"I've come up with a term for the types of stocks that have run away with the stock market's gains this year. They are the HALO part of the market,\" investor Josh Brown wrote for CNBC earlier this month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> \"They have risks, but not AI risks. In fact, in many cases, AI will probably enable them to become even more profitable than they are today,\" Brown continued. \"So they actually go up as the LLMs advance.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> That idea is central to why many real world sectors are outperforming this year, even as the overall market and especially tech stocks have floundered. The two top-performing sectors are energy and materials, which are surging more than 23% and 15%, respectively. The third best-performing sector, consumer staples, has rallied more than 14%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Compare that to the market cap weighted S&amp;P 500, which is just slightly higher year to date.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Or even more worryingly, tech stocks. Only two of the \"Magnificent Seven\" names are higher this year, failing to rally even off the back of Nvidia's earnings beat, as investors worry their massive capex spending may not be justified.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Software stocks are lost in a bloodbath amid fears that advances coming out of Anthropic around agentic AI will cripple an industry reliant on scalability and high fees. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) is down more than 22% this year, and more than 30% off its recent high.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> And financials and commercial real estate are two other areas that have been hurt.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> The term has been quickly adopted on other parts of the Street. A note from the Barclays' trading desk last week said \"HALO\" names have benefited from the \"violent\" move into the more defensive parts of the market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Goldman Sachs' Guillaume Jaisson said that markets have been rewarding HALO, saying a basket of its capital intensive names have outperformed capital light stocks by 35% since 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> A note from the sales desk at Bank of America said HALO is a way for investors to avoid near-term volatility by taking advantage of a secular rotation into old economy cyclicals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> To be sure, there are many who worry that the panic selling that has defined the market as of late has been indiscriminate. As an example, some expect software stocks could be nearing a bottom, with some even emerging as winners despite the cascade of advances out of Anthropic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> In fact, tech is now about as cheap as consumer staples, suggesting the growth names are not nearly as overvalued as investors feared.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> \"The test for investors going forward will be whether [HALO] remains the correct investment as the AI narrative once again evolves, especially as the capex hump of hyperscalers is passed,\" read a note last week from the Barclays' trading desk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Yet the HALO crowd have reason to believe the trade is sustainable. Outside of a desire to escape the market's next AI victim, many HALO stocks have room to run after years of underperformance, can benefit from easier monetary policy and fiscal stimulus, and could even realize improved margins from AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Here are some of the HALO beneficiaries that Bank of America's sales desk identified.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple is just one of two Mag Seven companies that has eked out a gain this year, with the other advancer being Nvidia. The iPhone maker underperformed its cohort last year, yet investors are hopeful that the tech giant's foray into AI tied to its devices will revive the stock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Chevron is another example. The oil and gas giant, which is up more than 20% this year, was recently upgraded to buy at Melius Research because of an expected pickup in exploration.</span></p></span></div></div>",
