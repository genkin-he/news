The tricky part is picking the right hash function, since this choice will likely stick around for a long time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“This may be ‘Ethereum’s last hash function’, so it's important to choose wisely,” he said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake proposed “Lean Ethereum,” a plan to make the network quantum-secure, in August 2025. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Quantum safe data storage and accounts </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Regarding data storage, or “blobs”, Ethereum currently uses a system called KZG (Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg) for storing and verifying data. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The plan is to swap this out for STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge), which are quantum-resistant. “It’s manageable, but there's a lot of engineering work to do,” said Buterin.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Related: </span></strong></em><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Buterin outlines 4-year roadmap to speed up and quantum-proof Ethereum</span></strong></em></p><p class=\"\"><span>The third challenge is user accounts. Ethereum currently uses ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signatures, which are standard cryptographic keys. The fix is to upgrade the network so that accounts can use any signature scheme, including “lattice-based” quantum-resistant ones.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, quantum-safe signatures are much heavier computationally and would consume more gas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“The long-term fix is protocol-layer recursive signature and proof aggregation, which could reduce these gas overheads to near-zero,” he said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Quantum-resistant proofs are very expensive </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Quantum-resistant proofs are extremely expensive to run onchain so “the solution again is protocol-layer recursive signature and proof aggregation,” said Buterin.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Instead of verifying every signature and proof individually onchain, a single master proof or “validation frame” would verify thousands of them at once, keeping costs near zero.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“This way, a block could ‘contain’ a thousand validation frames, each of which contains either a 3kB signature or even a 256kB proof,” he explained.  </span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:494.2420681551116px;aspect-ratio:0.8237367802585194\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/cointelegraph:cf6ed46fe094b-4037ee90128a8c1afff0331aa08cd468-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/cointelegraph:cf6ed46fe094b-4037ee90128a8c1afff0331aa08cd468-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#f5f4ed\"/></picture></div></button></figure><p class=\"\"><span>Buterin also commented on the Ethereum Foundation’s “Strawmap” on Thursday, stating that he expects to see “progressive decreases of both slot time and finality time.” </span></p><p class=\"\"><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Magazine: </span></strong></em><span>Bitcoin may take 7 years to upgrade to post-quantum: BIP-360 co-author</span></p></span></div></div>",

According to reports, VanEck, WisdomTree, and Securitize were among the first major institutions to participate in the offering — a sign that the gap between conventional finance and decentralized protocols is narrowing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kulechov has also been vocal about what he sees as the next big opportunity for DeFi lending. Reports say he believes that tokenizing what he calls “abundance assets” — things like solar energy infrastructure, battery storage systems, and robotics used in labor — could open an entirely new category of collateral for decentralized lending. He expects those types of assets to be worth a combined $50 trillion by 2050.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>Featured image from BTCCard, chart from TradingView</span></em></p></span></div></div>",
