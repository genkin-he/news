            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>The recent Ethereum price rejection that pushed it back below the $4,000 level has created a concerning trend that could send the price spiraling. The major point of interest lies at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, where the last rejection occurred. Given this, it is likely that the Ethereum price could see more declines in the coming days, although there is still the possibility of the bulls taking over and invalidating the entire bearish setup.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Ethereum Price Is Showing A Lot Of Weakness</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The rejection from the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level marked the start of the decline from the $4,200 level during the last recovery. This rejection resulted in the formation of a lower high on the 4-hour timeframe, and historically, such lower high formations mean that there is more selling pressure piling up for the digital asset.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As the bullish momentum looks to be fading, it puts the Ethereum price in a precarious position. Crypto analyst The Alchemist Trader </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHUSDT/ycscLxZ5-Ethereum-Faces-Bearish-Pressure-After-0-618-Fibonacci-Rejection/\" target=\"_blank\">explains</a><span> that the rejection had come with increased bearish volume as investors offloaded their holdings on the market, putting bears in charge once again.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Following this development, the Ethereum price has continued to struggle around $3,900, where the next local support lies. The cryptocurrency has maintained a tentative hold at best on this local support, suggesting that the bulls could indeed be losing ground at this level.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If this corrective phase continues, then the Ethereum price decline is far from over. The current local weakness has put a strain on the support, and if $3,900 fails completely, the next major support lies below $3,400, more specifically at $3,385. This will serve as the next stronghold for the bulls to make their move.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“From a structural perspective, Ethereum’s inability to sustain momentum signals growing bearish pressure across lower timeframes,” the crypto analyst explained.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Case For ETH Bulls</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the mounting bearish pressure, there is still the possibility that the Ethereum price could break out of this downtrend. Just like with the bearish case, the key lies at the $3,900 support and how well it holds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the case that bulls are able to reclaim and hold this support with momentum, then it could invalidate the bearish setup that has emerged. In this case, the crypto analyst believes that the Ethereum price could resume its uptrend above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Julie Jargon</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Criminals increasingly use generative AI to mimic real people's voices and con their loved ones out of money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There's a simple solution to this high-tech problem: a code word.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you receive a call from someone who sounds just like your grandson and says he needs money or a gift card, the best thing to do is hang up and call your grandson. But if the voice is so convincing that you can't bear to do that, ask for your family code word. If the caller can't produce it, hang up. Likewise, if you are legitimately in trouble and need to call a loved one for help, say the code word so your relative knows it's really you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>People who haven't implemented a family code word have been burned by bad actors. I wrote earlier this year about a Colorado woman who received a call from a young woman who she said sounded just like her daughter. Only after wiring $2,000 to protect her daughter from danger did she learn the whole thing was a scam.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's easy to see how someone can be fooled. My colleagues recently created deepfakes of several Wall Street Journal staffers' voices, including my own, and it was hard to tell the human voices from the clones.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here are some tips on how to create and manage a family code word:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Keep it simple but strong. The code word (or phrase) should be easy to remember and something only family members would know. Criminals can find out a lot about you online, including on social media and publicly available databases. Don't use a word they could guess, such as the name of your street or pet, says Liz Hamburg, chief executive of Candoo Tech, which provides tech support and training for older adults. Instead, choose from family anecdotes, like an inside joke or your baby's first word — if it was something other than \"Dada.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Keep it safe. If you worry you'll forget the code word, you could store it in a password manager. If you write it down, hide the paper. (Don't stick it on your fridge where an unscrupulous repair person or more distant relative could see it.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Keep the circle tight. Only share the code word with close and trusted family members, and do it in person or over the phone. \"The wider the circle, the riskier it gets,\" Hamburg says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Have a Plan B. Some families prefer to have a code question to which only a family member would know the answer. Vince Martino, a certified fraud examiner in Downingtown, Pa., came up with some for his mother, who once received a call from someone pretending to be him (she didn't fall for it). He suggests pairing questions and answers that aren't available publicly, such as, \"What was the name of the motel we went to at the beach when I was growing up?\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the event that a caller could guess the right answer, Martino suggests having a backup question as well — a type of two-factor authentication.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The caveat. There are situations where a code might not be appropriate. People who have dementia might not be able to remember the word or think to ask for one. In that case, it's probably best to limit calls by blocking unknown numbers or following some of the other steps I included here, such as locking down social-media accounts and texting the loved one who is supposedly on the line.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Don't change the code word unless you need to. A shift in family dynamics — such as a relative getting divorced from a spouse who knew the code — could warrant a change. But if you're confident there's no breach in the tight circle of code-word holders, there's no need to change it. Introducing a new word could cause confusion, like forgetting which is the latest version.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jesse Ohlsson, a retired Air Force senior master sergeant in Carthage, N.Y., has had the same \"oddball\" code word with his two grown sons since they were young boys, when he came up with the word to ensure they didn't go off with an unauthorized adult.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's never been compromised,\" he says. \"It exists only in our memories.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Julie Jargon at Julie.Jargon@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

Premiums for many plans are shooting upward. The federal subsidies that most enrollees use to pay for their insurance are set to shrink, though Congress might still reverse that in coming weeks. New rules will add additional wrinkles, including the risk of higher tax bills.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The upshot: If you have Obamacare, you really need to dig in and be careful about what you choose during the open enrollment period, which begins Saturday and lasts until Dec. 15, for coverage that starts Jan. 1.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you don't, you could get hit with huge bills next year. You could also be locked into health insurance you can't afford.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is the most extreme pricing change we've seen,\" said Jeff Grant, a former official with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees federal ACA implementation. \"Nobody can understand what this means until they go shop.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here's what ACA enrollees need to know to navigate this year's hazards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Getting started</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You can start the shopping process on HealthCare.gov, the federal insurance marketplace that serves 30 states for 2026. If you don't live in one of them, it will bounce you to your state's website.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You should consider getting advice from an expert, perhaps someone recommended by a friend or relative. HealthCare.gov includes a \"find local help\" button that leads to advisers. Groups representing brokers and agents also offer directories.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many Obamacare insurance premium hikes for next year are well into double-digit percentages. Most enrollees don't pay the full premium, but declining federal subsidies will still leave them with far higher monthly bills.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The pain will be spread unevenly. Its impact will depend on factors like your income level, your age and what plans are sold in your area. Health research nonprofit KFF offers an explainer on how the subsidies work here, but the best thing to do is to get on your government marketplace for a reality check.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some of the biggest increases, in dollar terms, will hit people who make slightly over 400% of the federal poverty level, which is about $62,600 for an individual. Many of those people qualified for a subsidy this year, but they won't get any help at all next year because enhanced federal payments are set to lapse. You can find federal poverty level cutoffs for different family sizes here.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bigger bills</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kevin Foster, 64, a retired business consultant in Lafayette, Calif., logged on to the state marketplace recently to check his rates for next year and couldn't believe what he saw. Eligible for a subsidy in 2025, he and his wife are slated to lose it in 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The couple's monthly insurance bill of about $580 will shoot up to more than $3,200, or an annual cost of more than $38,000. The 2026 version of their plan comes with a family deductible of $14,400, pushing the total past $50,000.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It was really just pure shock,\" he said. \"I was like, 'Are you kidding me?'\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He's likely to have to tap his savings until he can get Medicare, he said, but he's also trying to find a cheaper plan, or an alternative like purchasing travel health insurance and temporarily relocating abroad.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For other enrollees, the rising costs are leading to wrenching choices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jordan Euckert and her husband currently pay $129 a month, after a subsidy, to cover their family of six in Bedford, Texas. Next year, the cheapest plan that includes the children's hospital and doctors their kids need will set them back about $550 a month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Euckert, 31, who works for a small construction firm, said the family probably can't afford that. Now, she's wondering if the couple should go uninsured, while keeping their children covered. Though both spouses are healthy, her husband's job as a roofer poses a constant risk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's just like all those what ifs, like what if I got sick, what if my husband got sick — what would we do?\" she said. \"I don't know.\" She is hoping the couple's agent can come up with a better solution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ACA enrollees said they are still hopeful that Congress might restore the bigger federal subsidies that are in effect this year. Democrats and Republicans have been clashing over the issue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Keep an eye on things, watch the news coverage,\" said Cynthia Cox, a vice president at KFF. If Congress does vote to block next year's drop-off in the payments, you will want to take another look at your insurance choice, because different 2026 plans might suddenly be more affordable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Limited options</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For most enrollees, the main option to hold down monthly costs will be choosing skinnier ACA plans, with higher deductibles and other out-of-pocket charges.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some enrollees are looking at other choices. Scott Leavitt, an insurance broker in Boise, Idaho, said a married pair of his clients who own their own firm are considering switching to a small-business plan, or coverage purchased for an employer, rather than an individual or family.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some ACA enrollees can join a spouse's employer plan, or might be forced to look for a job that comes with health benefits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Agents say ACA enrollees should be careful about products that don't carry the same protections as Obamacare plans. Short-term medical plans, for instance, can refuse to cover pre-existing illnesses, as well as drugs and other types of medical services. So-called healthcare-sharing ministry plans aren't regulated as insurance, and can have similar limits and shortfalls.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another type of product, known as fixed indemnity plans, will pay out a set amount for certain medical services, but their setup can leave patients on the hook for whatever a healthcare provider bills above that amount, potentially tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Once that $15,000 or $10,000 is done, there's no more coverage,\" said Heather Stone, a health-insurance broker based in Fort Myers, Fla. \"If you need chemo, it's not going to cover anything like that.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other wrinkles</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the ACA-subsidy sticker shock is hard to miss, many enrollees may not be aware of other new rules that could affect them this year. Here's a helpful tipsheet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For one thing, lower-income enrollees in the past could sign up for new ACA plans year-round, a loophole that has now closed. \"They are not going to let you find out you have an illness in April and then come back and enroll into a major medical plan,\" said Johnny Wallin, chief operating officer of Marketplace Insurance Exchange, a health-insurance brokerage.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of the biggest changes might not surface until tax season in 2027. When enrollees sign up for their 2026 plans, they have to estimate their income for that year. If they end up making more money than they estimated, they get too much subsidy, and they have to pay back the difference when they file their taxes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the past, the law capped how much most enrollees would have to repay, but that limit is now gone. So the tax bill could be thousands of dollars for some people.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After Ja'Net Adams chooses an ACA plan this year, she plans to meet with her accountant to plan for the tax implications. \"We're going to have to sit down in December and say 'What do we need to make sure happens in 2026 so that we don't have a big tax bill because of this?'\" said Adams, 44, who owns a financial consulting firm in Kernersville, N.C.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at Anna.Mathews@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

Rany is one of at least 36 people in the area, mostly children, with neurological disorders not explained by genetic tests, according to preliminary data from a groundbreaking study into the impacts of mercury contamination.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While scientists have warned of the risks that mercury could pose to Indigenous children in the Amazon, none have established a causal link to disabilities in their communities, as this study may soon do.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>EAT THE FISH POISONED BY MERCURY OR GO HUNGRY</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rany’s father, Rosielton Saw, has worked as a miner near their village for years, following in the footsteps of his father, Rosenildo.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sitting at the family's one-bedroom wooden home, the older man said he knew the mercury they used was dangerous.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But mining about 30 grams of gold per week provides just \"enough to support ourselves,\" Rosenildo Saw said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The family regularly eats surubim, a carnivorous fish that accumulates mercury in the river biome. Rany Ketlen, who has severe swallowing problems, drinks the fish broth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In recent years, government health officials have reported dozens of other patients in the wider region suffering from similar disorders. But a lack of testing and access to medical care has made it difficult to compile a full picture of the problem or establish the exact causes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now researchers are collecting data on neurological problems known to be associated with mercury poisoning, ranging from acute brain malformation to memory issues, in a multi-year study concluding by the end of 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The scientists involved in the latest unpublished research, backed by Brazil's leading public health institute, said a top suspect is the mercury seeping into waterways after miners use it to bind tiny specks of gold extracted from riverbanks – a largely lawless trade spurred on by record-high prices for the precious metal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The mercury has contaminated river fish that are a staple for Indigenous communities and accumulated in women's placentas, breast milk and offspring at alarmingly high levels, often two or three times the hazardous threshold for pregnant mothers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chief Zildomar Munduruku, who is also a nurse, said he cannot tell his people to stop eating fish, despite guidance from health officials.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“If we obey their rules, we will go hungry,” he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>EVEN IF MINING STOPS, MERCURY WILL LINGER</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Far downstream from Sai Cinza, diplomats and world leaders gather next month in the Amazon for the United Nations climate summit, known as </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">COP30</a><span>. Brazilian organizers have called it the \"Forest COP,\" focusing global attention on threats to tropical rainforests and their inhabitants, such as illegal mining across the region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has driven thousands of miners out of Indigenous lands since he returned to office in 2023. But the mercury left behind cannot be broken down as it cycles through air, water, and soil, fueling a lasting health crisis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Brazil's government has stepped up monitoring of mercury levels in the Munduruku Indigenous Territory, trained public health officials to identify early signs of mercury poisoning and invested in clean water sources for remote communities, the Health Ministry said in a statement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even if \"gold mining in the Amazon came to a complete stop, the mercury that was deposited ... would remain for many more decades,\" said Paulo Basta, a researcher at public health institute Fiocruz, who has studied mercury contamination of Indigenous people for more than three decades.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Papers, interviews and fresh data reviewed by Reuters suggest the humanitarian crisis unleashed by illegal mining will have permanent consequences for current and future generations of Indigenous communities in the Amazon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A 2021 study by Basta and his colleagues found 10 of 15 mothers tested in three Munduruku villages had elevated mercury levels. An earlier study found 12 of 13 people in a Yanomami village where mining was rampant had dangerous mercury levels in their bloodstream. Nearly all the 546 registered cases that were in the government's databases by March 2025 were collected by Basta and his team.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"That's just the tip of the iceberg,\" Basta said. The Munduruku, Yanomami, and Kayapó territories have populations of tens of thousands of people who could potentially be contaminated by mercury.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>PROVING CAUSATION IS NOT EASY</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the study now underway, Basta's team aims to provide a crucial missing link in the puzzle: proof that mercury is causing disabilities. For that, they are following 176 pregnant women to test babies during their first years of life.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At Sai Cinza, where Rany Ketlen and her family live, the researchers’ preliminary data showed that, on average, mothers in the study had mercury levels five times higher than the Brazilian Health Ministry considers safe and their babies had three times that level. Rany Ketlen's sister, one-year-old Raylene, is one of them, though she has not yet shown any symptoms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This mercury disease, if you don't look for it, you won't find it,\" said Cleidiane Carvalho, a nurse who set out years ago to connect researchers with the sick Indigenous children she came across. Without their studies, she worried, the crisis \"will be silenced, neglected forever.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But proving a causal link to mercury contamination has been a challenge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fiocruz researchers found that Indigenous communities often lack basic health services and are vulnerable to various infectious diseases, all potential causes of neurological problems. Marriage among close cousins, which can cause genetic disorders, is also more common in small Indigenous communities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is likely that mercury is among the causes of the conditions of the 36 patients who did not have an inherited genetic disorder, but that does not rule out other factors, said Fernando Kok, a geneticist at the University of Sao Paulo who is working on the Fiocruz study.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Exams that find mercury in people's bodies are like snapshots of a patient's recent diet, so they alone cannot prove a prior contamination as a cause of neurological problems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's a perfect crime, because it leaves no signature,\" Kok said.</span></p></span></div></div>",

At the same time, AI companies assembled the most valuable monopolies since Standard Oil, and they’re data monopolies that make protocol dominance look trivial by comparison. The AI industry is expected to generate over $300 billion in revenue by 2025, primarily through training models on trillions of tokens scraped from researchers, writers and domain experts. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bitcoin maxis fought block size wars. Ethereum debated MEV extraction. Meanwhile, OpenAI, Google and Anthropic scraped the entire corpus of human knowledge, locked it inside proprietary training runs and built moats that no amount of capital or talent can overcome.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto’s response was launching the ten-thousandth DeFi fork while the most consequential infrastructure battle of the decade happens offchain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto needs a wake-up call. It is catastrophically misallocating attention while AI companies perfect centralized control over intelligence itself, the ultimate network effect that makes liquidity pools look like child’s play.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Data set monopolies are permanent without intervention</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>DeFi demonstrated that financial infrastructure could be rebuilt transparently. Financial rails, however, are commoditized compared to knowledge monopolies. Every DeFi protocol competes on execution, composability and user experience because the underlying assets like tokens, stablecoins and liquidity are standardized and portable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI data sets are not portable. They’re locked inside training runs that cost $100 million and take months to complete. Once a foundation model reaches critical mass, it becomes prohibitively expensive to replicate. The first mover that assembled the training corpus wins permanently unless new infrastructure changes the rules.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Google has 20 years of search query data. Meta has 15 years of social interaction data, and OpenAI partnered with publishers who will never license the same content to competitors. These are permanent moats that compound with every new user interaction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto built decentralized alternatives to centralized finance, so where is the decentralized alternative to centralized intelligence? It doesn’t exist because crypto hasn’t treated data ownership as an existential fight worth having.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Crypto founders aren’t building data set protocols</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The brutal truth is that data set infrastructure is less exciting than yield farming. Crypto founders chase token velocity, speculative upside and viral growth mechanics. Building attribution layers for training data generates zero speculation, requires years of ecosystem development and demands partnerships with institutions that move slowly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Boring infrastructure, however, is precisely what mattered. Ethereum wasn’t exciting when it launched; it was a slow, expensive computer that academics appreciated. Chainlink wasn’t exciting; it was an oracle network that took five years to gain adoption. The most critical crypto infrastructure often resembled homework compared to the casino next door.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Data set attribution protocols are the homework right now. The market opportunity is larger than DeFi, the network effects are more potent than those of any protocol token, and regulatory pressure creates inevitable demand. Yet crypto capital flows into the next NFT marketplace instead of the infrastructure that could prevent AI companies from becoming more powerful than nation-states.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The window is closing fast</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI companies are not waiting for permission. They’re training GPT-5, Claude 4 and Gemini Ultra right now using data scraped from millions of creators who will never see compensation. Every training run that completes without onchain attribution makes centralized control more entrenched.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Once these models reach sufficient capability, they become self-reinforcing. Users generate data through interactions, which train the next version, and the next version attracts more users. The flywheel accelerates, and competitors cannot catch up because they lack both the initial corpus and the ongoing data stream.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto has maybe two years before this window closes permanently. After that, data set monopolies become facts of nature that no amount of decentralized infrastructure can dislodge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>What crypto should build instead of more DEXs</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The crypto industry needs data set registries where contributors cryptographically sign data licenses before any training begins. It requires attribution protocols that log which data sets influenced which model outputs, and micropayment rails that automatically split inference revenue among the original creators. It needs reputation systems that rank data set quality based on measured model performance, rather than subjective metrics.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The technology is simpler than most DeFi protocols. Data set registration requires cryptographic hashes, contributor wallet addresses, licensing terms in standardized formats, and usage logs. Training runs record the data used and when it was used — inference requests route payments to registered contributors proportionally.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This infrastructure doesn’t require new consensus mechanisms or experimental cryptography, but rather builders who prioritize preventing monopolies over farming liquidity rewards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Crypto’s mission or crypto’s obituary</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto’s founding thesis was preventing centralized control over valuable networks. Bitcoin prevented central banks from monopolizing money. Ethereum prevented tech companies from monopolizing computation. But if AI companies monopolize intelligence, those victories become irrelevant. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What good is decentralized money if centralized models control what people think? What good is decentralized computation if centralized training data determines which ideas get amplified? Intelligence is upstream of everything, from finance and governance to media and education. Whoever controls AI training data controls the future information environment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto can either build the infrastructure that makes data set monopolies impossible, or it can watch AI companies perfect the exact centralized control that blockchain was invented to prevent. There’s no third option where crypto remains focused on token speculation while being relevant to the most significant technological shift of the century.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The industry needs to build data set attribution infrastructure now, or write crypto’s obituary as the movement that talked about decentralization. In contrast, centralized AI companies built permanent monopolies on human knowledge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Opinion by: Ram Kumar, core contributor at OpenLedger.</span></strong></em></p><p class=\"\"><span>This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
