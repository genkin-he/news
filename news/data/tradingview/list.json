The Singapore-listed retailer's 3Q underlying core net profit grew 48% on year. The company's top-end US$270 million forecast for 2025 implies 35% on year growth, he notes. He doesn't see major operational headwinds in 4Q, expecting profit growth momentum to be sustained. DFI's convenience-store segment could be a key earnings driver with a potential operating margin target of 6%, given improved mix towards the higher-margin ready-to-eat sub-segment, he adds. DBS maintains its buy rating and US$3.90 target price. Shares gain 2.65% to US$3.48. (megan.cheah@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
