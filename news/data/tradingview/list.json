            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>International Finance Corp.’s (IFC) board has approved up to $100 million in financing for ATOME’s $630 million low-carbon fertilizer plant in Paraguay, marking a significant step toward final investment decision (FID) for the 260,000 metric tons per year facility, as per Chemweek.The World Bank Group’s private investment arm approved the financing package combining concessional debt and project-level equity for the Villeta Project, according to a company statement. The approval comes as global fertilizer markets face supply constraints and environmental pressures, with the project positioned to serve Paraguay’s agricultural sector while reducing carbon emissions compared to conventional production methods.ATOME is targeting a final investment decision before year-end, which would trigger construction of what it describes as a landmark facility for the region’s agricultural industry.The financing approval reflects IFC’s broader climate investment strategy, with the institution committing over $9 billion in long-term climate finance during 2024. IFC currently maintains approximately $17 billion in total exposure across Latin America and the Caribbean, positioning the Villeta Project within a substantial regional portfolio focused on sustainable development.The project’s debt financing structure includes multiple development finance institutions beyond IFC, with public disclosures showing participation from the European Investment Bank, IDB Invest, Dutch development bank FMO, and the Green Climate Fund. This multilateral backing suggests strong institutional confidence in the project’s viability and development impact potential.“The IFC Board’s approval of up to US$100 million of debt and equity financing for Villeta is another strong endorsement of the Project’s maturity, bankability, and positive development impact,” said Olivier Mussat, ATOME’s chief executive officer. “This is another important step towards finalizing the US$630 million project funding as we remain focused on achieving FID before the end of the year.\" mrchub.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The state-backed Irish bank currently has no bidders but expects to find a buyer in the first half of 2026. \"It is difficult to match up the confidence from management in the current business trends, the risk review process and the improving [return on tangible equity] outlook, with the decision from the board to start this process to sell the bank,\" analysts Andrew Stimpson and Fatima Ghaznavi write. While PTSB is already an attractive asset, buyers will want to know the outcome of the risk-model review, which KBW expects will vastly improve the capital ratio.

The Austrian lender's positives were the stronger net interest income on good loan volume growth and deposit repricing, better payments and securities-related fees and a lower negative hit in other results thanks to a one-off release of legal provisions in Romania, he says.
