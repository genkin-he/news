The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV, an exchange-traded fund that tracks software stocks, was almost 2%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Concerns have been brewing among investors that AI could do away with the need for workers across sectors, from insurance to wealth management to real estate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors not only worry that AI efficiencies will drive companies to cut costs and head counts; they also fear that fewer employees will directly translate to shrinking demand for traditional software licenses. Many business-software companies sell their products based on customer head count, or on a per-seat basis, and investors are looking carefully at whether software companies will be hit by a decline in these subscriptions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So when Block (XYZ) announced on Thursday that it is cutting more than 40% of its employees, some analysts interpreted the news as a prequel to a future where AI will replace the workforce. And those fears hit software stocks that were trying to recover after weeks of negative sentiment driven by AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Block job cuts are the latest blow to investor confidence in the software sector's ability to withstand the ongoing threat that AI will dramatically shift the future of work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Monday, software stocks lost over $200 billion in market capitalization after Citrini Research released a blog post depicting a hypothetical future where AI leads to mass layoffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read more: Did a blog post just cause software stocks to lose more than $200 billion in market cap?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Truist Securities analyst Matthew Coad said in a note that Block may be a   \"case study\" for how companies' investments in AI could \"adversely impact employment rates.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>J.P. Morgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang wrote in a note that a new \"world of work\" is \"impending,\" and that Block is \"proactively restructuring\" the company to adapt to that reality.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Don't miss: The stock market is reflecting fears of an AI apocalypse for white-collar jobs</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bernstein analyst Harshita Rawat said in a note that she wonders if Block's move could lend credence to the \"unemployment fears\" that have \"gripped markets\" recently.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Block may create a playbook for others,\" she added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That said, some analysts believe that software stocks have been caught in an AI-driven downward spiral that won't last. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF looked poised to eke out a small gain for the week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And some of the biggest software-sector declines on Friday seemed largely unrelated to the AI hysteria around Block's layoffs. Shares of Zscaler (ZS) and Elastic NV (ESTC) were losing more than 13% and 15%, respectively, as of midday, while PAR Technology's stock (PAR) was off nearly 30%. All three companies reported earnings on Thursday afternoon that were being poorly received by the market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That said, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a Friday note to clients that he expects the software space to see a \"major comeback\" in the coming months, as investors will recognize that the \"disconnected doomsday software trade\" is \"mispriced.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Hannah Pedone</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Fund has declared the February 2026 distribution pursuant to the Fund's managed distribution plan (the \"Plan\").
