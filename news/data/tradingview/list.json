While this work remains at theexploration stage, the data density and repeatability we are seeinghave provided management with sufficient confidence to move forwardwith a formal NI 43-101 resource estimation. We believe thisrepresents an important milestone in systematically advancing theProperty.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All drill results referenced herein have beenpreviously disclosed by the Company and are available on SEDAR+ andthe Company’s website.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The independent MRE will be prepared by a QualifiedPerson as defined under NI 43-101 and will include validation of thedrill database, geological modeling, grade estimation andclassification of the mineral resource estimate in accordance with CIMDefinition Standards. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company notes that undertaking a mineral resourceestimate following an initial drill campaign is not typical inearly-stage exploration. However, the consistency of geological andassay results encountered across both the Halo and Main zones has provided sufficientinformation to justify an independent technical assessment at thistime.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Importantly, Golden Cariboo’s current drillingprograms remain ongoing and are designed to continue testing the knownmineralized footprint beyond the areas contemplated for the initialMRE. Results from additional drilling may support future updates toany resource that may be estimated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Golden Cariboo cautions investors that mineralresources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstratedeconomic viability. The MRE will be subject to the assumptions,qualifications and limitations contained in the independent technicalreport to be filed on SEDAR+ upon completion. The Company will providefurther updates regarding the selection of the independent consultantand anticipated timing for completion of the MRE.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The technical information in this news release has beenreviewed and approved by Jean Pautler, an independent consultant commissioned by the Company. Jean Pautler is aProfessional Geoscientist (P.Geo.), registered with the Association ofProfessional Engineers and Geoscientists of the Province of BC(“APEGBC”) and licensed by Engineers and Geoscientists BC, and isa “Qualified Person” with respect to NI 43-101.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About Golden Cariboo Resources Ltd.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Golden Cariboo Resources Ltd. is rediscovering theCariboo Gold Rush by proceeding with highly targeted drilling andtrenching programs on its Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine property which isbordered by Osisko Development (NSE:ODV/TSXV:ODV), partly intertwinedwith them at the north end of the Cariboo Gold Project, and locatedalong a favourable corridor adjacent to the Spanish and Eureka thrustfaults over a 94,899 hectare (234,501 acre)area. Historically, over 101 placer gold creeks on the 90-kilometer(56 mile) trend, from the Cariboo Hudson mine north to the QuesnelleGold Quartz Mine property, have recorded production with successfulplacer mining continuing to this day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Golden Cariboo’s Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine propertyis 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) northeast of, and road accessible from,Hixon in central British Columbia. The Property includes the QuesnelleQuartz gold-silver deposit, which was discovered in 1865 and developedover a footprint of about 150m x 150m (&lt; 6 acres) at the Main zonestraddling Hixon Creek. Overall, the geological setting of the goldmineralization at the Company’s Quesnelle Gold Quartz Mine propertyshows strong similarities with the Spanish Mountain gold deposit,situated 120 km (75 miles) towards the southeast along the samegeological trend. As a sediment-hosted vein (SHV) deposit, the SpanishMountain deposit is considered to belong to the epizonal orogenicsubclass of gold deposits which include some of the world’s largestdeposits such as Muruntau, Uzbekistan and Bendigo, Australia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For further information please contact:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>GOLDEN CARIBOO RESOURCES LTD      </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“J.
