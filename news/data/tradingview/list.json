This creates a back-up plan if the AI strategy doesn't pay off. \"Some will argue that META has yet to scale any real tangible scaled new products from this growing investment cycle. We argue that the infrastructure is somewhat fungible and can be leveraged to scale the ad platform even faster in a worst case scenario,\" Black says.

The oil giant topped third-quarter profit forecasts despite softer crude prices, leaning on stronger trading and a timely boost from its new LNG project in Canada. Adjusted net income came in at $5.43 billionabout 10% lower than last year but comfortably ahead of estimateswhile net debt fell to $41.2 billion. CEO Wael Sawan's two-year push for leaner operations and cleaner balance sheets is starting to pay off, with the company keeping its $3.5 billion quarterly buyback intact. Shares have gained 16% in London this year, outpacing peers and closing some of the valuation gap with U.S. rivals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After a post-pandemic boom, the oil majors are tightening their belts again. Crude is down roughly 14% this year, and Shell's CFO Sinead Gorman said market fundamentals could tip toward oversupply by 2026. That's forced the industry to pull back on costs, trim investments, and in some cases scale down buybacks. Yet Shell's performance stood out, driven by what RBC's Biraj Borkhataria called strong operational indicators. The chemicals business remains the weak link, weighed by thin margins in both the U.S. and Europe, where high energy costs continue to squeeze producers. Shell is exploring options to divest some U.S. chemicals assets but cautioned that such moves will take time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sawan's approach is less about chasing size and more about discipline. While Exxon and Chevron bulked up with big acquisitions, Shell is taking a more selective route, watching for deals that fit its advantage. The strategy could be paying off: steadier cash flow, lower debt, and consistent returns are slowly turning Shell's results into what analysts have dubbed boringly strong. In a volatile energy world, that kind of predictability could be the company's most valuable asset.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Excluding the impact from revenue recognized over time, quarterly revenue was USD 228.9 million, which is well above the guidance of USD 215-225 million. Third quarter revenue in X-FAB's core markets — automotive, industrial, and medical — was at USD 215.7 million*, up 14% year-on-year and up 5% quarter-on-quarter, representing a share of 94%* of total revenue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Order intake for the third quarter amounted to USD 163.0 million, down 25% year-on-year and down 21% compared to the previous quarter. This is primarily due to continued inventory corrections by automotive customers as well as broader macroeconomic uncertainties resulting from geopolitical tensions and trade disputes. These factors have led to more cautious ordering patterns, while customers also take advantage of shorter cycle times placing orders later than usual and with reduced lead time. As a result, visibility is still restricted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The backlog for the third quarter came in at USD 346.9 million, compared to USD 412.9 million at the end of the preceding quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the third quarter, X-FAB generated automotive revenue of USD 146.9 million*, up 1% year-on-year and up 2% quarter-on-quarter. Third quarter industrial revenue was USD 47.6 million*, up 51% year-on-year and 1% sequentially, reflecting the overall recovery of the industrial end market. The gradual recovery of X-FAB's silicon carbide (SiC) business contributed to this positive evolution. Medical revenue in the third quarter hit a record USD 21.2 million*, up 74% year-on-year and 40% quarter-on-quarter, highlighting the steady growth of X-FAB's medical business. Third quarter growth was mainly driven by contactless temperature sensors, DNA sequencing, and echography applications.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the third quarter, CMOS revenue recorded a growth of 10%* year-on-year and 4%* quarter-on-quarter; microsystems revenue was up 27%* year-on-year and 9%* sequentially. X-FAB's SiC business continued to recover, and revenue grew strongly by 30%* year-on-year and 21%* quarter-on-quarter. The number of SiC wafers produced in the third quarter more than doubled year-on-year. SiC revenue growth is partially diluted by the much higher share of SiC raw wafers being supplied by customers today as compared to a year ago. This results in lower total billing due to less pass-through of substrate costs. The positive trend in the evolution of X-FAB's SiC business is underpinned by increasing bookings attributable to sustained demand from data center, electric vehicle, and renewable energy applications.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Quarterly prototyping revenue was USD 19.7 million*, down 16% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Prototyping and production revenue* per quarter and end market:</span></p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><span> </span><br/><span> in millions </span><br/><span>  of USD         Revenue     Q3 2024  Q4 2024  Q1 2025  Q2 2025  Q3 2025 </span><br/><span> Automotive    Prototyping       9.3      8.9      4.7      5.1      5.5 </span><br/><span>-------------  ------------  -------  -------  -------  -------  ------- </span><br/><span>         Production            136.7    119.7    130.8    138.2    141.4 </span><br/><span> --------------------------  -------  -------  -------  -------  ------- </span><br/><span> Industrial    Prototyping       8.2      9.6      8.8     12.1      9.7 </span><br/><span>-------------  ------------  -------  -------  -------  -------  ------- </span><br/><span>         Production             23.3     26.5     30.5     35.2     37.9 </span><br/><span> --------------------------  -------  -------  -------  -------  ------- </span><br/><span> Medical       Prototyping       3.0      2.3      1.5      1.8      2.8 </span><br/><span>-------------  ------------  -------  -------  -------  -------  ------- </span><br/><span>         Production              9.1     14.2     12.3     13.2     18.4 </span><br/><span> --------------------------  -------  -------  -------  -------  ------- </span><br/><span> CCC           Prototyping       3.0      2.6      1.1      1.7      1.6 </span><br/><span>-------------  ------------  -------  -------  -------  -------  ------- </span><br/><span>         Production             11.3     12.6     12.5     10.5     11.6 </span><br/><span> --------------------------  -------  -------  -------  -------  ------- </span><br/><span> </span></pre><p class=\"\"><span>Operations update</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In September, X-FAB announced the inauguration of its new cleanroom in Malaysia, which will increase the site's manufacturing capacity from 30,000 to 40,000 wafer starts per month. Production at the new facility is being scaled up progressively, with the full increase in capacity anticipated by the fourth quarter of 2026. The expansion will effectively double the capacity for X-FAB's popular 180nm BCD-on-SOI technology, which is particularly suited for applications such as smart motor drivers, smart LED drivers, and battery management systems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The recovery of X-FAB's silicon carbide business is supported by the existing SiC capacity at its Texas facility. The current installed capacity, combined with additional capacity scheduled to become operational by the end of 2026, will enable X-FAB to more than double its present production run rate without necessitating significant further investment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Capital expenditures for the third quarter amounted to USD 23.5 million, bringing total capex as of September 30 to USD 178.9 million.

The most common TEAEs were injection site reactions (9.9%), headache (9.9%), and back pain (7.6%) in those treated with gefurulimab and headache (12.4%), diarrhoea (8.5%), and upper respiratory tract infection (7.8%) in those who received placebo.1</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Notes</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span> </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>gMG</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>gMG is a rare autoimmune disorder characterised by loss of muscle function and severe muscle weakness.2</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Eighty-five percent of people with gMG are AChR antibody-positive meaning they produce specific antibodies (anti-AChR) that bind to signal receptors at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the connection point between nerve cells and the muscles they control.3 This binding activates the complement system, causing the immune system to attack the NMJ, leading to inflammation and a breakdown in communication between the brain and the muscles.4</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>gMG can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins for women before the age of 40 and for men after the age of 60.5 Initial symptoms may include slurred speech, double vision, droopy eyelids and lack of balance; these can often lead to more severe symptoms as the disease progresses such as, impaired swallowing, choking, extreme fatigue and respiratory failure.6,7</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span> </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>PREVAIL (ALXN1720-MG-301)</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>PREVAIL (ALXN1720-MG-301) is a global, Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, multicentre study evaluating the safety and efficacy of gefurulimab in adults with generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG). The trial enrolled 260 patients from 20 countries across North America, Europe, Asia and the Pacific region. Participants were required to have a confirmed myasthenia gravis diagnosis at least three months prior to the screening visit with a positive serological test for autoantibodies against AChR and Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Clinical Classification Class II to IV at screening.8</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive gefurulimab or placebo for a total of 26 weeks in the randomised controlled treatment period. Patients received a single weight-based loading dose on Day 1, followed by regular weight-based maintenance dosing beginning on Day 8 and once every week thereafter. The primary endpoint of the change from baseline in the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) total score, a patient-reported scale that assesses patients’ abilities to perform daily activities, was assessed at week 26 along with multiple secondary endpoints evaluating improvement in disease-related measures.8</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Patients who completed the randomised controlled treatment period were eligible to continue into an open-label extension period evaluating the safety and efficacy of gefurulimab, which is ongoing.8</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Gefurulimab</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gefurulimab, an investigational complement C5 inhibitor, is a novel dual-binding nanobody optimised for subcutaneous self-administration in development as a treatment for AChR-Ab+ gMG. The investigational medication works by binding to the C5 protein in the terminal complement cascade, a part of the body’s immune system. When activated in an uncontrolled manner, the complement cascade over-responds, leading the body to attack its own healthy cells. Concurrent binding of gefurulimab to serum albumin provides an extended half-life, enabling once-weekly dosing. Gefurulimab has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the US for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span> </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Alexion</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease, is focused on serving patients and families affected by rare diseases and devastating conditions through the discovery, development and delivery of life-changing medicines.
