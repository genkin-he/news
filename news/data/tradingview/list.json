The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV, an exchange-traded fund that tracks software stocks, was almost 2%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Concerns have been brewing among investors that AI could do away with the need for workers across sectors, from insurance to wealth management to real estate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors not only worry that AI efficiencies will drive companies to cut costs and head counts; they also fear that fewer employees will directly translate to shrinking demand for traditional software licenses. Many business-software companies sell their products based on customer head count, or on a per-seat basis, and investors are looking carefully at whether software companies will be hit by a decline in these subscriptions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So when Block (XYZ) announced on Thursday that it is cutting more than 40% of its employees, some analysts interpreted the news as a prequel to a future where AI will replace the workforce. And those fears hit software stocks that were trying to recover after weeks of negative sentiment driven by AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Block job cuts are the latest blow to investor confidence in the software sector's ability to withstand the ongoing threat that AI will dramatically shift the future of work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Monday, software stocks lost over $200 billion in market capitalization after Citrini Research released a blog post depicting a hypothetical future where AI leads to mass layoffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read more: Did a blog post just cause software stocks to lose more than $200 billion in market cap?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Truist Securities analyst Matthew Coad said in a note that Block may be a   \"case study\" for how companies' investments in AI could \"adversely impact employment rates.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>J.P. Morgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang wrote in a note that a new \"world of work\" is \"impending,\" and that Block is \"proactively restructuring\" the company to adapt to that reality.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Don't miss: The stock market is reflecting fears of an AI apocalypse for white-collar jobs</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bernstein analyst Harshita Rawat said in a note that she wonders if Block's move could lend credence to the \"unemployment fears\" that have \"gripped markets\" recently.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Block may create a playbook for others,\" she added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That said, some analysts believe that software stocks have been caught in an AI-driven downward spiral that won't last. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF looked poised to eke out a small gain for the week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And some of the biggest software-sector declines on Friday seemed largely unrelated to the AI hysteria around Block's layoffs. Shares of Zscaler (ZS) and Elastic NV (ESTC) were losing more than 13% and 15%, respectively, as of midday, while PAR Technology's stock (PAR) was off nearly 30%. All three companies reported earnings on Thursday afternoon that were being poorly received by the market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That said, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a Friday note to clients that he expects the software space to see a \"major comeback\" in the coming months, as investors will recognize that the \"disconnected doomsday software trade\" is \"mispriced.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Hannah Pedone</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

That's Creating an Opportunity</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By David Berman, The Globe and Mail</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Add Shopify to the list of Canadian stocks that are being battered over fears of disruption from artificial intelligence. But what if these fears are misplaced?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Within the blue-chip S&amp;P/TSX 60 Index, the five biggest laggards so far in 2026 all bear the scars of an AI drubbing, as investors envision chatbots displacing current software.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shopify, Constellation Software, Open Text, Thomson Reuters and CGI Group Inc. are down by an average of nearly 24% each this year, as of Friday morning. Shopify briefly lagged the five laggards earlier this week before the stock regained some lost ground.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For Shopify, which helps small and mid-sized merchants sell online with a broad suite of products and services, the threat from AI may appear large: If chatbots can lead consumers directly to merchants, Shopify could be sidelined.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors are clearly rattled. This is a company that has at times vied with Royal Bank of Canada as the country's most valuable public company, based on the total value of outstanding shares — underscoring its vaunted success as a global growth story.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shopify's market capitalization lags RBC by $100 billion, or 31%, as of Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>More importantly, the downturn is a snub to executives' insistence that the company is anything but a casualty of AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They believe that the technology will drive deeper online commercial activity for online merchants as shoppers — armed with chatbots such as ChatGPT or Gemini — find their way to Shopify-powered storefronts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shopify is encouraging this crossover with chatbots. In January, the company announced that it had co-developed with Google the infrastructure — called the universal commerce protocol — that can smooth out the entire online shopping experience.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Shopify is foundational in powering the commerce layer of the AI era, and we're just getting started,\" Harley Finkelstein, president of Shopify, said during a conference call with analysts on Feb. 11.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Judging from the share price and tumbling valuation, though, investors aren't buying these assurances — even as a number of experts have rushed to the defence of the beleaguered software sector in recent weeks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, believes that the AI threat to the software sector is one of several wrong-headed tech trades he has seen over the past 25 years where investors bet wrong.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The AI trade has been the 'fear of the unknown' for the tech and software sector in particular. For the bulls, it's like fighting a ghost, \" Ives said in a note last week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive officer and a key architect of the AI boom, argued earlier this month that fears of AI disrupting the software industry is \"the most illogical thing in the world.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That should put Shopify on the radar screens of investors looking for growth stocks that are now on sale.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Okay, Shopify can't be called cheap. The shares trade at 66 times estimated earnings, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. That's down from a price-to-earnings ratio of 96 at the end of 2025, but clearly still elevated even for a tech stock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mighty Nvidia, for example, trades at a significantly lower multiple of 25 times estimated earnings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking at Shopify from the perspective of estimated revenues, the stock is also expensive — even though its price-to-sales ratio has declined to 10.3, down from over 15 at the end of 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you're waiting for Shopify to fall to levels that are broadly recognized as a screaming bargain, the sidelines are probably for you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nonetheless, Shopify is enticing for a couple of reasons.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>First, it has undeniably strong growth prospects that help explain the heady valuation. In 2025, revenue increased by 30%, year-over-year, to US$11.6 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That marks an acceleration from 25% growth in 2024. Shopify has doubled its revenues in just three years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bullish case for the stock rests on Shopify continuing to expand at a brisk clip as it carves out a bigger share of the world's massive e-commerce market and grows into a valuation that is now well off its highs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The other reason the stock is enticing: Widespread concerns that AI is a threat are perhaps overstated or flat-out wrong.</span></p></span></div></div>",
