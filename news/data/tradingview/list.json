(\"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>MineMind Metals</span></strong><span>\") to establish a strategic joint venture framework for the collaborative exploration of critical battery metals, including lithium, cobalt, graphite, and other battery metal targets in the state of Nevada, USA through the application of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered mineral targeting models, and building on the completion of the foundational data preparation and processing phase announced on August 1, 2025, the preliminary prospectivity modelling of the initiative has now been completed, with initial results identifying several regions highlighting geological patterns consistent with known lithium mineralization. This early analysis not only showcase the AI mode's ability to recognize meaningful geological correlations but also highlight its potential to accelerate exploration targeting across Nevada.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The preliminary AI modelling utilized approximately 60 curated datasets drawn from public sources and internally generated datasets, which were processed through TerraDX's proprietary AI models to generate preliminary probability models highlighting geological patterns consistent with known lithium mineralization. The prospectivity analysis utilized publicly available national and state-level datasets from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology (NBMG). These included mineral occurrence and deposit databases, geochemical compilations, geophysical survey data, and geologic mapping products. The AI model correlated these datasets with regions of known lithium mineralization to identify areas exhibiting comparable data patterns within the analyzed inputs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This analysis represents an important milestone in the development of the initiative, as they confirm the AI system's capacity to identify subtle correlations and complex geological relationships that may be overlooked by traditional exploration methods.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The project will now advance into the second phase of the modelling, which will include additional training runs to sharpen predictive accuracy, exclusion mapping to systematically filter out unviable exploration zones such as population centers, national parks, and restricted-use lands, refining the phase I prospectivity zones into high-confidence, AI-derived exploration targets.

This strategy includes the exploration of prospective domestic properties through AI targeting, the development of proprietary recovery technologies to extract battery-grade materials from end-of-life batteries in collaboration with a globally ranked top 20 university1, and the extension of electric vehicle battery lifespan through the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc., patent-pending rebalancing software and hardware machine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The identification of regions with geochemical similarities to known lithium-mineralization regions is a strong validation of our AI-powered exploration approach,\" said Massimo Bellini Bressi, CEO of Battery X Metals. \"These early results strengthen our confidence as we move into the next phase of modelling and exclusion mapping, where we expect to refine these zones into high-confidence targets for field validation.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company intends to provide a further update upon completion of the secondary modelling phase.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nevada's Strategic Role in Advancing U.S. Battery Metal Supply Chain Independence</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nevada is one of the most resource-rich jurisdictions in the United States for critical battery metals, particularly lithium. The state is estimated to hold approximately 85% of the nation's known lithium deposits, largely due to the state's arid environment and closed basin hydrologic systems which have combined over millions of years to deposit vast amounts of the mineral deemed critical to the clean energy movement.2</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), commercial-scale lithium production in the United States in 2023 came solely from a continental brine operation in Nevada3 - the Silver Peak facility operated by Albemarle Corporation. This made Nevada the sole domestic producer of lithium that year. Nevada is also home to Thacker Pass, located within the McDermitt Caldera in Humboldt County. It is recognized as the largest measured lithium reserve and resource in the world. 4</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These developments align with federal policy initiatives to secure critical mineral supply chains. The Defense Production Act has been invoked to accelerate domestic lithium production and reduce reliance on foreign sources.5</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nevada offers a stable foundation for AI-driven exploration.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jonathan Cheng and Jason Douglas</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have walked back from the ledge — again. But even as the world's two superpowers deescalate a trade fight that had threatened to destabilize the global economy, a new reality is setting in — that Washington may finally have to give up on its long-standing aim of pushing Beijing to restructure its economy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For years and through successive U.S. administrations, senior officials in Washington had hoped that bringing China into the global trading system would open up the country's political system. In the decades since China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001, those hopes of political liberalization have largely been dashed. The sense of disappointment has only grown as Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who took power in late 2012, has tightened his control over the domestic political system and civil society more broadly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, many in President Trump's circle of senior advisers had held out hope for China's economic liberalization. White House officials spoke of using America's economic might to move China away from what they regarded as a mercantilist trade policy that privileged exports, subsidized manufacturing and discouraged its own 1.4 billion people from spending.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. strategists imagined that tariffs would squeeze exports and encourage China to find new sources of growth at home, perhaps by overhauling its health and social welfare systems to allow consumers to spend more and save less. By pressuring Beijing to boost consumption, the idea went, China would start buying more goods from the U.S. and the rest of the world, its trade surplus would shrink and U.S. businesses and farmers could tap a consumer market of unparalleled potential.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But while Trump's first-term tariff assault resulted in Chinese pledges to buy more American-made goods, it didn't accomplish any of these larger structural aims. The Biden administration, though rhetorically committed to many of these broader economic liberalization goals, focused most of its efforts on constraining China's technological ambitions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This time around, Trump's sky-high tariffs have failed to move China. Unlike virtually every other trading partner hit with tariffs, Beijing retaliated with stiff countermeasures of its own, using its grip on rare-earth metals to bludgeon American companies that rely on the critical minerals, while halting purchases of U.S. soybeans in a bid to punish America's agricultural sector.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China's \"shock and awe\" approach left the two superpowers mired in months of a tactical tit-for-tat, resulting in dramatic displays of brinkmanship and Thursday's meeting between Trump and Xi — but leaving big-picture American concerns about China's economic structure unaddressed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Trade talks with China this time around are more focused on stabilizing the relationship versus advancing it by addressing structural matters, which appears to be a lost cause,\" said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator now at the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With the two sides bogged down in horse-trading on tariffs and critical minerals, structural matters have been entirely set aside, Cutler added. \"The reality is that deescalation has become the objective of the trade talks with China, rather than breaking new ground.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even today, some Chinese officials acknowledge that the country's consumption is too weak and nod to the desire for some rebalancing. Yet efforts have been piecemeal, stymied by an ideological attachment to industrial production as the wellspring of prosperity and wariness of the painful reforms — in taxation, healthcare and social welfare — needed to make a durable shift.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When Trump was first elected in 2016, the U.S. adopted a more aggressive approach to force the issue, threatening a trade war that sought in part to change China's model. But rather than adopt the Western prescriptions, Beijing took advantage of Trump's exit from the Oval Office to instead make itself more impervious to pressure from Washington.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beijing systematically identified perceived \"chokepoints\" — that is, sectors where it was reliant on the U.S.-led West — and worked to disarm Washington's points of leverage. China did this by building up domestic industries, developing alternative sources for scarce inputs and carefully husbanding its strengths in areas where they saw a chance to seize control.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>More broadly, China has shifted its manufacturing model toward components and not just finished products — a change that has more deeply embedded the country in global supply chains, said Dinny McMahon, head of markets research at Trivium China, a research and consulting firm.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Xi Jinping has been talking about this since at least 2019 — strengthening global supply chains,\" McMahon said. Now, he said, \"almost any manufactured good you buy, no matter where it comes from, has some exposure to Chinese supply chains.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By finding ways to effectively hit back against the U.S., Xi forced Trump repeatedly onto the defensive — and in the process, established China as a peer rival to the U.S., able to defy the world's longtime superpower on trade, technology and, increasingly, geopolitics.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The U.S. has very little ability to influence China's macroeconomic strategy,\" said Oliver Melton, a director at China-focused consulting firm Rhodium Group. \"They have a different ideological understanding of what causes growth and economic development.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Whether Beijing sticks to its current program — of pursuing manufacturing and technological dominance at all costs — will resonate far beyond China's shores. Already, Chinese import growth has stagnated, and its surplus in goods has ballooned to more than $1 trillion. China has refused to cede significant ground in lower-value manufacturing to less developed economies, even as it gains expertise in making cars, aircraft, chips and other high-value goods.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The result, said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and a former head of the IMF's China division, is that China is stifling manufacturing in other countries, whether they're poorer economies trying to nurture a domestic factory sector or advanced economies facing a growing competitive threat. Trade barriers to Chinese goods are rising, and its own economy is menaced by deflation, the outgrowth of its rampant production.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"In the absence of aggressive reforms to restructure the economy, China's growth will slow while friction with its trade partners will increase,\" said Rhodium's Melton, who recently wrapped up five years as the U.S. Treasury Department's financial attaché in Beijing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When Beijing released the blueprint for its next five-year plan earlier this month, it made clear it has little intention of deviating from a path that has, in Beijing's eyes, worked exceptionally well. Chinese leaders reemphasized their commitment to technological self-sufficiency, pledging to pour more investment into advanced manufacturing and boosting exports.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If anything, the trade war has taught China the opposite of what the U.S. had hoped. Rather than prod Beijing to rebalance the economy, it showed Xi how essential it is for China to reduce its reliance on the U.S. in critical areas such as semiconductors and to develop economic weapons that allow it to hit back, such as its stranglehold on rare earths, said Henry Farrell, a professor of international affairs at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That calls for more industry-led growth, not less. China's goal, Farrell said, is to \"maximize its freedom to do what it wants to do without the United States being capable of determining its destiny.\"</span></p></span></div></div>",

To the victor will go the power to determine who gets mortgages, car loans and credit cards in the U.S. and how much they will pay for them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The battle pits Fair Isaac, the creator of the dominant credit-scoring algorithm, against three companies: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Those three companies supply the credit files that go into Fair Isaac's score, or FICO score. They are eager to break Fair Isaac's grip on determining creditworthiness. And they think they can do it by offering an alternative, a credit score they created and named VantageScore.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The FICO score has had such a lock on the business for so long that many think of it as a government statistic. The FICO score is used in about 90% of consumer-lending decisions in the U.S., according to industry analyst estimates, and Chief Executive Will Lansing is one of the highest-paid executives in the country.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>FICO dates back to 1956, when a Stanford University engineer, William Fair, and a mathematician, Earl Isaac, each put in $400 to start a company they called Fair Isaac. They invented the FICO score as a way to measure creditworthiness, or the risk that a borrower won't pay back a loan.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For banks and other lenders, the scores became a game changer. A score supplied a quick, easy way to evaluate a potential borrower. In the 1990s Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made FICO the required score for their mortgages, cementing the American consumer dependency on FICO.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, lit a match to the long-simmering tensions this year when he suggested FICO was engaging in anticompetitive behavior. \"FICO, and any other monopoly who has ripped off Americans for decades, should not be using improper efforts to threaten regulators,\" he wrote on X.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He opened the floodgates by declaring that VantageScore could now be used instead of FICO for many mortgage approvals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>VantageScore says it can increase access to credit for more consumers and help people who have limited credit histories buy homes or cars.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To the chief executive of FICO, \"choice encourages mortgage participants to shop for the most lax score\" and will create a \"race to the bottom\" that risks American taxpayers being on the hook if something goes wrong. \"The FICO score is the backbone of safety and soundness in the mortgage industry,\" Lansing said on a July conference call to discuss earnings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"What once seemed to be a very cordial and mutually financially beneficial relationship between four companies now seems to be closer to war,\" said John Ulzheimer, who has worked for or been affiliated with all the companies over the years in various roles including working with FICO scoring models.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This reporting is based on conversations with more than a dozen individuals involved in the industry, most of them current senior and midlevel executives within the credit scoring and reporting companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The 'Lord's work'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here's how your FICO score is determined: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion have the history of how you manage your debt and other financial information, such as whether you pay debts on time and if you have too much credit-card debt compared to a card's spending limit. They put all that information into a credit report.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They feed their reports into what the industry calls FICO's \"black box,\" which crunches the numbers and spits out a FICO score between 300 (the worst) and 850 (the best). FICO charges Equifax, Experian and TransUnion for each score and the three companies sell their reports plus the FICO score to lenders at a markup.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Signs of trouble for FICO's hold on the market emerged in 2006 when Equifax, Experian and TransUnion got together to create VantageScore.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>VantageScore claimed it could calculate credit scores for millions of people who often don't have FICO scores. VantageScore found a supporter in a then up-and-coming senator, Tim Scott, a Republican who is now chair of the Senate Banking Committee. VantageScore's pitch that it could help more people, including minorities, become homeowners particularly resonated with Scott.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Around 2014, the federal government began exploring whether changes should be made to the credit score used for mortgage underwriting, including looking at VantageScore as one option.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lansing, who got his start at consulting-firm McKinsey and held the CEO job at several companies before FICO, saw a path for FICO to start boosting its profits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>FICO hadn't raised the price for its signature mortgage-score product in decades and it still sat at a few cents per score. Some executives at the time continued to believe their main purpose was \"doing the Lord's work,\" one executive recalled.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The CEO and his top deputies thought they had long been underpricing the FICO score. They believed a big gap existed between the few cents FICO was charging for its scores and the value it brought to consumers being able to attain credit, lenders being able to originate more loans and the broader U.S. financial system.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some executives told Lansing it seemed like the wrong time to make a move. They were all expecting a decision from the government soon on VantageScore, and they worried that a price increase would give the credit-reporting firms and VantageScore ammunition against FICO.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lansing saw it differently: If the government decided to stay with FICO only and FICO increased prices, it would give critics ammunition to call it a monopoly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Privately, FICO's leadership was getting annoyed with having to partner with credit-reporting firms, which were becoming more and more competitors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The companies were tacking on a fee of their own that is currently about $5 on FICO mortgage scores. And they were making a push with lenders to use VantageScore on credit cards or other consumer loans, offering competitive pricing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>FICO's prices continued to go higher, particularly for mortgage scores. They hit $4.95 in 2025, dramatically higher than before Lansing had started the march by raising prices several years earlier.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While FICO executives continued to view their price as less than a Starbucks latte, the increases were eating into bottom lines for mortgage lenders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lenders generally charge a borrower the cost of the fee when a loan is closed. If a potential borrower walks away from a loan application, the lender eats the costs they've spent preparing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One senior executive in the credit-reporting industry told Lansing that his company's price hikes practices amount to price gouging.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But at FICO, Lansing's price increases were paying off.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In fiscal 2024, the company's revenue from selling credit scores was $920 million, nearly five times what it was a decade before. Sales of the scores now make up more than half of the company's overall revenue, compared to just 24% a decade ago. (FICO also sells software for marketing purposes and analytics.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company's profit last year was $512.8 million, also a five-fold increase over 10 years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lansing's pay rose too. In 2023, he was the fifth-highest-paid executive in the S&amp;P 500, ahead of Apple's  Tim Cook, thanks to a $30 million one-time retention and leadership award that vests over five years. Last year, he was paid $35 million, 28th on the S&amp;P 500 list.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company moved its longtime headquarters from San Jose, Calif., to Bozeman, Mont., near where Lansing owns a home and spends several months of the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Trump Administration broadside</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This year, Washington ramped up the pressure on FICO.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sen. Josh Hawley repeated his call to the Justice Department's antitrust division to open an investigation into the price increases. \"FICO has abused its government-granted market power,\" the Republican wrote in a letter to the Justice Department.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pulte, President Trump's outspoken head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, had been hearing from lenders and others about the rising costs of credit-scoring. An FHFA spokesman said, in a statement, \"U.S. Federal Housing is adamant that the Credit Bureaus and FICO compete and not take advantage of the American consumer.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pulte launched a broadside. In July, Pulte posted on X that to \"increase competition\" Fannie and Freddie would allow lenders to use VantageScore.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sen. Scott thanked Pulte for \"taking long-overdue action to lower costs and expand homeownership opportunities.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The sudden shift sent FICO shares falling about 9%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Industry players were left confused about how to implement the change.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>FICO ramped up lobbying, hiring firms with ties to the president who were going directly to Trump to make their case, according to people familiar with the matter. It was taking a page out of the book of the three firms behind VantageScore, which have collectively spent millions of dollars lobbying over the years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pulte accused FICO's \"unregistered lobbyists and others\" in August of \"wholly improper conduct...by trying to eliminate competition.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>FICO raised its pricing for the credit-reporting firms. The price per mortgage score would double to $10 next year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then it announced a more dramatic move to cut out VantageScore's backers, the three credit-reporting firms. Federal guidelines require home lenders to evaluate credit scores and reports from several credit-reporting firms. That created another invisible player in this market: companies that gather up the reports from all three and sell a combined report. In the jargon of consumer lending, they became known as \"tri-merge resellers.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>FICO decided to allow tri-merge resellers to calculate scores themselves by making its \"black box\" more available. FICO will charge those companies $4.95 per score, plus an additional $33 if the loan closes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The move cuts out the trio, whose shares sank while FICO surged.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They responded with deals that include giving away VantageScore, free, for many loans.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The government, meanwhile, keeps pushing for more change from FICO, credit-reporting firms and VantageScore. Pulte said on X, \"This is just the *start* of competition in Credit Scores, for the benefit of the American people.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com and Gina Heeb at gina.heeb@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
