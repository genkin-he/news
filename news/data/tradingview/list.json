            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>The US-Israel strikes on Iran, which killed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and led to Iranian retaliation against Israel and US bases in the Gulf, have pushed oil markets into focus. The concern is possible supply disruption through the Strait of Hormuz.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Brent crude was already trading higher at around $72 to 73 per barrel in late February as tensions rose. For the markets reopening, analysts expect prices to move higher again. If shipping through key routes is affected, crude could move toward $80 or higher.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For India, the situation brings back familiar risks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Around 50% of India’s crude imports — about 2.6 million barrels per day — pass through the Strait of Hormuz. Any disruption could raise the import bill, add to inflation, widen the current account deficit, and pressure margins in several sectors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Experts say spare capacity within OPEC+ could prevent prices from staying elevated for long. Saudi Arabia has indicated it can raise output if needed. However, a prolonged disruption would still have a meaningful impact.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bhavik Patel, Senior Analyst, Tradebulls Securities, said some geopolitical risk was already priced in.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“WTI was already trading at $68. After this pre-emptive strike, we expect prices to move higher,” she said. “How far crude goes now depends on US actions. If Iran’s export infrastructure is hit or shipping through the Strait of Hormuz is disrupted, global supply could tighten. That could add a $4 to $8 premium.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He pointed to supply-side support.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“Saudi Arabia has said it is willing to increase capacity if there is supply disruption from Iran. OPEC+ is also expected to raise production from April 1 by about 1,67,000 bpd because of this, the move in crude prices may be sharp but not sustained,\" Patel added. Prices would remain high only if disruption in the Strait continues, as importers would need longer routes, increasing cost and time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ponmudi R, CEO – Enrich Money, said the issue extends beyond geopolitics.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“This starts as an oil issue but quickly feeds into inflation and liquidity for global markets,” he said. Even a short disruption through the Strait of Hormuz could push crude sharply higher. A sustained rise in Brent toward the $83 to $95 range could lift inflation expectations globally. That would complicate central banks’ plans for rate cuts and put pressure on equity markets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For India, he said every $10 increase in oil prices significantly raises the import bill. It also adds to current account pressure and increases fiscal risks if steps are taken to protect consumers. Oil marketing companies, aviation, paints, autos and logistics could see margin pressure. IT stocks may stay volatile due to global risk-off sentiment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Strong domestic institutional flows, he added, could help limit broader market damage, keeping this a phase of high volatility rather than a deeper unwind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Prashant Vasisht, Senior Vice President and Co-Group Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA Limited, said the conflict would increase volatility in crude prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“The Strait of Hormuz is a critical energy route. About 20% of global petroleum liquids and 20% of global liquefied natural gas move through it,” he said. A prolonged or wider conflict involving multiple oil and gas producers could disrupt supplies and push global energy prices higher.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For Indian refiners, sourcing crude from the US, Africa or South America is possible. However, higher crude prices would still raise the import bill.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Elevated input costs would also weigh on marketing margins and profitability for oil marketing companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kunal Sodhani (Broader India Impacts) said nearly 50% of India’s crude — about 2.6 mb/d — moves through the Strait. A sustained 25% rise in oil prices could add around $15 billion to the import bill. It could widen the current account deficit by about 0.3% of GDP, raise inflation by roughly 0.7 percentage points, and reduce real GDP growth by around 0.2% if the situation persists.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Risks also extend to trade and remittances from the Gulf, estimated at $40 to 50 billion a year, and to the 9+ million Indians living in the region. Safe-haven demand could support gold and silver. Equity markets may see risk-off pressure, along with weakness in the rupee. India VIX typically rises 20–40% during such geopolitical events.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Market snapshot for India</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Upstream companies (ONGC, Oil India) may benefit in the short term from higher realizations. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Downstream companies and OMCs (IOC, BPCL, HPCL), along with aviation, autos, paints and logistics, face higher input costs and delayed price pass-throughs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The broader economy faces risks from inflation, current account pressure, fiscal strain and a cautious RBI stance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the global side, OPEC+ output increases from April and Saudi spare capacity could limit price gains if disruptions remain brief.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Markets reopen on Monday with volatility expected.

The price action seen during the last 30 minutes of Friday's trading session is testimony to that. The Nifty, trying to protect 25,300 for a better part of the session, slumped to 25,150, all in a matter of two minutes, and could not recover from that fall by close.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Global markets will only react to all of the developments over the weekend on Monday. This includes the US futures, who will resume trading on Sunday evening local time, while Asian equities, Indian equities, and other markets will also react to these developments on Monday morning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Before the markets open here in India, the bigger reaction will be seen on other asset classes beyond equities. Crude oil prices, Gold prices, moves on the US Dollar, the Yen, all of which will be significant and keenly monitored by the street. In fact, Barclays has already written in a note to clients that oil prices could go up to as high as $100 per barrel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> In case that does happen, it will be negative for the Indian downstream oil refiners, but beneficial for upstream companies such as ONGC and Oil India. Any potential rise in oil prices could also pressure the currency and that will also be one aspect that the street will closely monitor.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> More than the attack on Iran, there could be a bigger ramification on Indian companies that have a significant exposure to the middle east, particularly after Iran's retaliation, that has hit regions across the GCC, including Dubai, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi. Stocks like L&amp;T, Kalyan Jewellers, Welspun Corp, KEC International, all have exposure to the Middle East.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> The Nifty is already below the 200-Day Moving Average. Part of the accelerated sell-off on Friday could also be attributed to that. That now opens up levels on the downside, first of course being 25,000. Then come the January 21 swing low of 24,919 and the brief, budget-day intraday lows of 24,571 and 24,679 on February 2.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Any potential strengthening in the US Dollar could have ramifications for Metal stocks. The Nifty Metal index was the third-best performing sectoral index in February.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> \"The underlying trend of Nifty is sharply down. The overall negative chart pattern signals further downside to 24,700 levels in the near term. Immediate resistance is placed at 25,400,\" Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> The Nifty Bank had defended the 60,800 mark all through the week, but failed to do so on Friday. The index has closed at a very important support level of 60,500 and further downside could not be ruled out, particularly so if the markets open gap down on Monday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> \"Immediate support is placed around 59,800, followed by a stronger base near 59,000. Resistance is seen around the 61,000 zone,\" Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking said.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By James Mackintosh</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Forget AI. The big trade last year was to buy the idea that Europe has finally woken up to the need to spend big to defend itself.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But, after the best year ever for German defense stocks, investors now face the question of whether the trade is already over.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For those who haven't been paying attention, start with the case for investing in defense. Fracturing geopolitics and concern about U.S. defense guarantees have combined with Russia's assault on Ukraine to push European politicians, led by Germany, to commit to massive increases in military spending. The nationalistic shift and threats to supply chains have persuaded Europe to break with its traditional willingness to rely on foreign military suppliers, too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And not just Europe. \"There's been a fundamental shift in priorities away from economic efficiency and globalization towards national security and resilience,\" says Thomas Mucha, geopolitical strategist at Wellington Management.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Given all the extra money likely to come into defense companies, how could their stock prices not beat the market?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are two risks: Price and politics, where a lesson from the fall of the Berlin Wall should induce caution. Prices have soared, so a positive outlook for defense spending is already reflected in the jump in stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sure, Germany's spending has risen from just over 1% of gross domestic product a decade ago to more than 2% last year, with plans to rise to 3.5% before 2030. But German defense stocks — dominated by the tank maker Rheinmetall — more than tripled in the first nine months of last year, before easing a little.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Profits will rise a lot, but they need to. The German sector trades at 38 times forecast earnings, up from 20 times at the start of last year and far above the 15 times of the German market as a whole.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The politics argument is that as governments spend a lot more on defense, they will want to control how much of that leaks out again in the form of profits for shareholders. That's especially the case when companies are likely to be much more reliant on domestic sales than in the recent past.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We're talking about large public spending which will most likely be under scrutiny,\" says Vincent Mortier, chief investment officer at Amundi. \"The bigger they grow, the more there will be\" political pressure on margins, he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here we come to the lesson from the fall of the Berlin Wall. U.S. weapons manufacturers actually performed better in the years since the end of the Cold War than during it. That's despite U.S. military spending plummeting from around 7% of the economy in 1988 to about 3.7% today, as politicians spent the peace dividend elsewhere.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From just before the Wall fell to now, the \"guns\" sector had the third-best total return out of 49 U.S. sectors defined by Kenneth French, a Dartmouth finance professor. It came in behind software and microchips. Aerospace, where major defense stocks including Boeing sit, also did well, coming in sixth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But from 1963 to 1988 the double splurge in spending for Vietnam and the Cold War did little to help military stocks. They came in 25th. At the top were the sectors that might be more associated with a peace dividend: tobacco (\"smoke\" in Prof. French's definition), \"fun,\" \"meals\" and \"soda.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This counterintuitive ranking wasn't because the period included the Swinging Sixties. It's politics. For all the left-wing concern at the time about the military-industrial complex, profit margins were much lower in the 1980s than since 2010. They hit their highest in 2022, in data going back to the early 1980s.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some of the post-1989 margin improvement is because companies were allowed to merge, although that has been true of other sectors. Some of it is because corporate taxes came down. But I would argue a lot is because companies increasingly sell to foreign customers that have less ability to extract lower prices by pointing to fat profits. Smaller domestic military budgets also reduce the need for companies to kowtow to politicians by maintaining unprofitable operations in their districts or supporting civilian projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors betting on how much of the peace dividend will return as spending on defense should also focus on how much of it will be allowed to flow through to shareholders of arms manufacturers, especially in Europe. Guns might be less lucrative than you think.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to James Mackintosh at james.mackintosh@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

Iranian state media said an explosion was heard in Tehran on Sunday morning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Saturday, Iran launched hundreds of missiles and drones in response to the initial attacks, targeting U.S. troops in the region and cities in Israel and Arab countries allied with Washington and leading to widespread flight cancellations in the region. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Pentagon said there were no U.S. deaths or injuries, but the strikes raised concerns of new risks for Americans. A senior U.S. intelligence official told Reuters that while the largest threat stemming from the attack was against U.S. military personnel in the Middle East, cyber attacks could also target critical U.S. infrastructure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dubai's international airport and its landmark Burj Al Arab hotel sustained damage and four people were injured. Abu Dhabi Airports said in a post on X that an incident at Zayed International Airport in the UAE's capital resulted in one fatality involving an Asian national and seven injuries. It later deleted the post.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tehran warned on Saturday that the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow passage through which around a fifth of global oil consumption passes, had been closed, raising expectations of a sharp jump in oil prices. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a statement early on Sunday, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the country's armed forces soon would retaliate again with their biggest offensive operation ever at U.S. bases and Israel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>        Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, told an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Saturday that hundreds of civilians had been killed and injured in the U.S. and Israeli strikes. Iravani called Iran's retaliatory attacks a matter of self defense, saying the bases of hostile forces are legitimate military targets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, told the council that he deeply regretted that an opportunity for diplomacy had been \"squandered.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SUPREME LEADER KILLED</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Witnesses said some Iranians took to the streets in Tehran, the nearby city of Karaj and the central city of Isfahan to celebrate after reports of Khamenei's death emerged. Videos posted on social media, which Reuters was unable to immediately verify, also showed celebrations in other locations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Israel and the U.S. timed the attacks to coincide with a meeting of Khamenei and his top aides, according to two U.S. sources and a U.S. official familiar with the matter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Khamenei was working in his office when the attack occurred on Saturday morning, Iranian state media said. His daughter,  grandchild, daughter-in-law and son-in-law were also killed, Iranian state media reported. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Revolutionary Guards issued a statement mourning the loss of \"a great leader.\" Trump, in a social media post, called him \"one of the most evil people in History.\" </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on Iranians to rise up and overthrow their government in the wake of the attacks, which took out at least seven senior military commanders, according to Israel's military.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Experts said that while the deaths of Khamenei and other Iranian leaders would deal a major blow to the country, it would not necessarily spell the end of Iran's entrenched clerical rule or the Revolutionary Guards' sway over the population.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>FAILED NEGOTIATIONS</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Israeli military operations over the past two years had already killed some of Iran's senior military officials and severely weakened several of Tehran's once-feared proxy forces across the Middle East.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After Israel pounded Iran in a 12-day air war in June, joined by the United States, the U.S. and Israel had warned they would strike again if Iran pressed ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the UN Security Council meeting on Saturday, envoys from Russia and China criticized the U.S. and Israel for launching the strikes while Tehran was negotiating with Washington. Russia's U.N. envoy Vasily Nebenzya said Iran had been \"stabbed in the back\" and disputed the U.S. claim that preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon justified the attacks. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Senior U.S. officials said on Saturday that the latest talks showed Iran was not willing to give up its ability to enrich uranium, which the Iranians argued they wanted for nuclear energy but U.S. officials said would enable the country to build a nuclear bomb.</span></p></span></div></div>",
