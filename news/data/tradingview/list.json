No amount of operational improvement changes the fact that earnings rise and fall with LME prices. The relevant question for investors is not whether Alcoa is better than it used to be it demonstrably is but whether it is the best investment opportunity in aluminum today.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We address that question directly. When benchmarked against Norsk Hydro and Century Aluminum the two most investable Western aluminum peers Alcoa is not the lowest-cost producer, nor the cleanest balance sheet, nor clearly the cheapest on P/FCF or EV per tonne. Norsk screens better on several simple valuation metrics. Century offers more torque in certain spot-price scenarios but carries materially higher balance sheet risk. Our thesis is not that Alcoa is improved. It is that if you expect structurally higher aluminum prices, Alcoa offers the most torque-adjusted exposure to that view without requiring a binary balance-sheet bet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alcoa combines full vertical integration (bauxite ? alumina ? aluminum), $675 million in permanent cost reductions that lower the breakeven, 100% AWAC ownership eliminating 40% NCI leakage, and a balance sheet that has reached its target range for the first time since the 2016 separation. The result is a business that generates meaningful excess cash at normalized prices, survives troughs, and provides operational leverage to aluminum that neither Norsk (too diversified, lower beta) nor Century (too leveraged, single-segment) can replicate on a risk-adjusted basis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This report benchmarks all three names explicitly, shows under what aluminum price assumptions each is the better bet, and makes the comparative case for Alcoa as the highest-quality cyclical torque play in the sector.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Competitive Benchmarking: Alcoa vs. Norsk Hydro vs. Century</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investment decisions are relative.

Norsk Hydro screens better on several straightforward metrics: lower EV/tonne (~$6,500 vs. Alcoa's ~$7,600), a cleaner balance sheet (0.3x net debt/EBITDA), a meaningful dividend yield (~3.5%), and lower beta (~1.3). For investors seeking steady aluminum exposure with income, Norsk is arguably the safer choice.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Century is the cheapest on EV/tonne (~$3,500) and offers the most raw torque to spot aluminum: its higher operating leverage and smaller scale mean earnings explode in a $3,000+/tonne environment. But Century is a single-segment smelter with no upstream integration, ~1.5x leverage, no dividend, and a cost position in the second-to-third quartile. It is a leveraged bet on price, not a business you own through cycles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alcoa sits in the middle and that positioning is the thesis.

Its downstream value-added segments (extrusions, energy) provide earnings diversification that Alcoa and Century lack. Century is barely cash-flow positive and faces balance sheet stress. Alcoa survives generating an estimated $950M$1,000M EBITDA versus $289M in 2023 at the same price, thanks to $675M in cost savings but does not offer the best risk-adjusted return. If you expect a prolonged downturn, Norsk is the better name.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>At mid-cycle ($2,700/t): </span></strong><span>Alcoa's vertical integration and cost improvements produce comparable EBITDA to Norsk (~$1,800M each) but on a lower EV/EBITDA multiple (~5.1x vs. ~5.9x), implying greater value per dollar of earnings. Century generates modest FCF but cannot match the through-cycle reliability of either larger peer. This is Alcoa's sweet spot: generating meaningful excess cash ($775M normalized FCF) with the balance sheet capacity to return it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>At elevated ($3,200/t): </span></strong><span>Both Alcoa and Century offer significant torque, but Alcoa captures margin at every stage of the value chain (bauxite, alumina, aluminum) while Century captures only the smelting spread. Alcoa's beta of 2.01 means the stock price amplifies the move. Century's beta is higher (~2.5), but the balance sheet risk makes it a less reliable way to express the view.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The takeaway: Alcoa is the best risk-adjusted bet if you believe aluminum prices will be at or above mid-cycle ($2,700+/t) through the next 23 years. If you expect a sustained downturn, Norsk's diversification protects better. If you want maximum binary torque and accept the leverage risk, Century is your trade. Alcoa occupies the middle ground which, for most allocators, is exactly where you want to be.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Three Structural Improvements That Justify Mid-Cycle Confidence</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The scenario matrix above depends on Alcoa's cost structure being durably improved. This section provides the evidence. The transformation is not speculative; it is completed and auditable in the financials.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>1. $675 Million in Permanent Cost Savings Lower the Breakeven</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In January 2024, Alcoa announced a target of $645 million in profitability improvements by year-end 2025. By Q4 2024 a full year ahead of schedule the company had exceeded the target by $30 million, delivering $675 million in annual run-rate savings. These are not cyclical gains from favorable input prices. They encompass $100 million in raw materials procurement, an 8% reduction in electricity consumption per tonne, and operational efficiencies across the refining and smelting base.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The practical significance: in 2023, with aluminum averaging ~$2,250/tonne, Alcoa posted adjusted EBITDA of approximately $289 million on its legacy cost structure. Applying $675 million in structural savings to that same price implies EBITDA near $950$1,000 million a level that would have produced meaningfully positive FCF rather than the $436 million cash outflow actually recorded. The cost program did not merely improve peak earnings; it shifted the entire distribution of outcomes upward.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>2. 100% AWAC Ownership Eliminates 40% Earnings Leakage</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The August 2024 all-stock acquisition of Alumina Limited for $2.8 billion eliminated the 40% noncontrolling interest in AWAC, the JV holding five of the world's twenty largest bauxite mines and alumina refineries outside China. Every dollar of refining and mining profit now accrues entirely to Alcoa shareholders. In 2025, alumina prices fell ~42% while aluminum surged Alcoa captured margin at both stages. This natural hedge is unique among the peer set: Norsk has partial upstream integration; Century has none.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The acquisition was funded with stock (diluting shares from ~178M to 259M, a 45% increase). This dilution is real and material. If Alcoa fails to grow earnings proportionately or implement buybacks, per-share value creation will lag total business value. This is the highest-priority capital allocation item to monitor.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>3. Balance Sheet at Target Creates Room for Returns</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net debt declined from ~$2.4 billion (mid-2024) to $1.5 billion (year-end 2025), funded primarily by the $1.35 billion Ma'aden JV sale. Cash on hand: $1.6 billion. Debt-to-equity: 0.40x. Current ratio: 1.56x. For the first time since the 2016 separation, future FCF is not earmarked for emergency deleveraging. This is what separates Alcoa from Century: both offer cyclical torque, but only Alcoa can credibly return cash through the cycle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Normalized Free Cash Flow: What Alcoa Generates Through the Cycle</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The central question for a permanent owner is not what Alcoa earns at $3,100/tonne, but what it earns at a normalized price.

Analysts say the group is now expected to resume hikes, starting with a modest increase of 137,000 barrels a day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An output boost would signal the alliance is restarting the gradual rollback of voluntary cuts of around 1.65 million barrels a day originally set to remain in place through the end of 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some analysts expect the remaining curbs to be unwound within six months, while others see the process stretching to year-end. Many warn, however, that only about half of any quota increase typically translates into actual output, as some members face capacity constraints.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OPEC didn't respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The oil market should be able to absorb further barrels,\" said Giovanni Staunovo, strategist at UBS. The ICE Brent forward curve remains in backwardation--meaning near-term oil prices are higher than future prices--suggesting the market is tight in the short term.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Goldman Sachs sees OPEC+ positioned to raise production modestly from April to June after a series of supply disruptions earlier this year, particularly in Kazakhstan, and due to lower-than-expected inventories in OECD countries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Much of the anticipated surplus remains outside major pricing hubs, with Russian, Iranian, and Venezuelan barrels accumulating on tankers at sea. Meanwhile, geopolitical concerns are keeping front-month prices supported.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In midmorning European trading Friday, Brent traded around $71 a barrel, while WTI was above $65 a barrel. A February survey of major Wall Street banks compiled by The Wall Street Journal showed Brent crude is expected to average at around $61 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at $58 in the second quarter--above previous projections by around $1, but still below 2025 levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The resumption of output hikes would come as markets closely monitor developments in the Middle East, wary that any escalation between the U.S. and Iran could disrupt energy flows in the oil-rich region. The two countries are expected to resume discussions next week after the latest round of talks wrapped up on Thursday without a deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Any escalation of conflict is likely to see OPEC step in to calm the market,\" said Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari, commodity analysts at ANZ Research. If disruptions occur, OPEC+ is expected to tap spare capacity--with most of it sitting in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Giulia Petroni at giulia.petroni@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>    Asian naphtha prices on Friday were buoyed by firm demand and higher LPG prices, with refining margins nearing a one-year high and east-west spreads at six-year wide, while April spot activity was in full swing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A slew of spot buying activities for April cargoes were ongoing as buyers had to replenish their usual requirements in line with earlier expectations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sellers raised their offers citing prices for replacement product liquefied petroleum gas since late week on supply disruptions, though forward availability should increase soon given an opened arbitrage from west to east.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most April deals for open-spec naphtha were done at $9 to $13 per ton premiums for northeast Asia linked to CFR Japan quotes, while deals to southeast Asia were mostly at premiums of $5 to $9 per ton. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Refining margins closed at $111 per metric ton on Friday, their highest since end-March last year. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The east-west price spreads held firm at nearly six-year highs of $48 per ton, steady from the previous session, supported by firmer Asian swaps.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For gasoline, spot sales activity mostly came from China's oil majors looking to clear their March requirements in line with earlier expectations. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While paper markets remained in contango, March-April intermonth spreads did narrow slightly through the course of the week. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gasoline cracks regained some ground week on week to $8 a barrel, clawing back some losses since three weeks ago.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>NEWS</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- The cost of hiring a supertanker from the Middle East to China exceeded $200,000 a day on Thursday for the first time since 2020 as the threat of U.S. attacks on Iran grows and buyers seek to lock in oil cargoes, according to data and market sources.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- The United States has slowed the sale of Russian oil giant Lukoil's international assets to use them as a bargaining chip in the Ukraine peace talks, according to four sources familiar with the discussions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- Saudi Arabia may raise April crude prices to Asia for the first time in five months due to higher demand from India, in an effort to replace Russian supplies and soothe supply disruption fears as the threat of a U.S.-Iran military conflict grows, refining sources said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SINGAPORE CASH DEALS </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- Two naphtha deals, no
