Adjusted pretax profit hit $1.99 billion, ahead of the $1.79 billion analysts had penciled in, powered by standout performances in wealth management and global banking. CFO Diego de Giorgi said the bank could now meet its 2026 return-on-tangible-equity goala year earlyafter what he called a strong quarter of progress. With income from global banking up 24% to $588 million and wealth income jumping 28%, management has raised its 2025 income outlook to the upper end of the 5%7% range. Shares climbed 3.1% in London, extending a 53% rise this year and leaving the FTSE 100's 19% gain far behind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The improvement comes as the bank's Fit for Growth restructuring enters its second yeara sweeping program of cost cuts and efficiency drives across hundreds of initiatives. Standard Chartered took a $138 million charge tied to the overhaul this quarter but said savings should accelerate through 2025. The bank is doubling down on wealth, too. A $1.5 billion expansion plan aims to attract $200 billion in new assets by 2029. In the third quarter alone, it added $13 billion in net inflows and 67,000 new affluent clients, underscoring the momentum building in its Asian wealth franchise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The results landed against a calmer geopolitical backdrop after US President Donald Trump's summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping produced what Trump called an amazing meeting. The US agreed to halve fentanyl-related tariffs, while China paused new rare-earth export curbsa detente that could ease business anxiety worldwide. De Giorgi said the move improves confidence for investors and businesses alike, a backdrop that could work in the bank's favor as global trade stabilizes. Credit impairments rose slightly to $195 million, while private-credit exposure remained contained below $3 billion, suggesting the bank's risk profile remains under control as it pushes for stronger, earlier returns.</span></p></span></div></div>",

While the new trade agreement is supposed to last for one year, the analysts think tensions are \"very likely\" to reescalate before the end of the one-year truce period. \"We believe continued economic/trade clashes between the two superpowers are inevitable,\" they say. The U.S. government has signed a raft of deals on rare earth materials, while Beijing has invested heavily in chipmaking, Nomura says. This cycle of tension, escalation and truce is likely to be the new normal for U.S.-China relations, the analysts add. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
