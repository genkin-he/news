Discovery. Netflix previously signed an agreement with Warner, but the target company's board said an improved offer from Paramount tabled Monday was superior. The company has lost roughly $172.84 billion in stock market value from September to the beginning of this week--a period in which Netflix looked to be in pole position to acquire Warner's streaming and studios businesses. Paramount Skydance jumps 8.4% premarket, while WBD slips 2.2%. (josephmichael.stonor@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
