This is just a mine, a camp, a</span><br/><span>water treatment plant with the associated equipment. We are in a</span><br/><span>province that is focused right now on speeding up mine-permitting</span><br/><span>timelines.”&lt;/span&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"text-align:left; \"&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;span style=\"\"&gt;“Assuming studies and permits go the way that we</span><br/><span>expect, we believe we could start developing the underground at Rowan</span><br/><span>in 2027, and have that project in production in 2028.”&lt;/span&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"text-align:left; \"&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;span style=\"\"&gt;“By then, Madsen will be getting to a depth where the</span><br/><span>ounces of gold per vertical meter are quite a bit higher.

Those two veins sit between the planned</span><br/><span>portal and where the rest of the mine is.

Zoom’s federated architecture expands to include NVIDIA Nemotron open technologies to support AI Companion 3.0 across industries such as finance, healthcare, and government. This framework is expanding to a next-generation hybrid language model approach, a breakthrough AI architecture that can intelligently route queries between Zoom’s proprietary Small Language Models (SLMs), optimized for low latency and quality for a particular skill or tasks, and a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) for complex reasoning. The new hybrid model will accelerate enterprise productivity and collaboration experiences with optimized cost efficiency, quality, and latency.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Zoom’s AI framework uses a federated architecture to intelligently select the best AI model for each task. Through this approach, Zoom AI Companion can leverage NVIDIA’s advanced AI infrastructure, services, and software, alongside other models, delivering enhanced capabilities while optimizing cost for customers. This includes Zoom’s new 49-billion-parameter LLM, based on NVIDIA Nemotron and developed with NVIDIA NeMo tools to achieve the optimal balance of speed, cost, and accuracy. This innovative architecture allows enterprise customers and government organizations to benefit from both open and closed model innovation, delivering greater cost efficiency, faster AI workflows, deeper reasoning capabilities, and more efficient collaboration within AI Companion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Accelerated AI innovation and interoperability</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>This initiative is set to power the next evolution of Zoom’s federated AI architecture, which dynamically incorporates optimal models, including the Llama Nemotron Super-based reasoning model, to deliver the ideal balance of accuracy, performance, and cost.

This partnership allows us to deliver powerful, security-focused, and scalable AI experiences to our customers at rapid speed.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Through this work, NVIDIA and Zoom are further accelerating AI innovation and enterprise readiness.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“The integration of NVIDIA Nemotron into Zoom AI Companion allows enterprises like NVIDIA to experience a private, powerful, and personalized work environment for enhanced productivity,\" said Kari Briski, vice president of generative AI software at NVIDIA. \"Our collaboration with Zoom to bring smart and efficient AI reasoning to customers is just beginning.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>A responsible AI foundation</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Zoom is committed to expanding the AI frontier responsibly and plans to utilize NVIDIA Nemotron reasoning models to enhance decision-making and manage multistep tasks across meetings, chat, documents, and more.

During the   third quarter of 2025, the Bank recognized additional interest income of   $473,000 from the pay-offs of three relationships that for portions of   the last year were considered non-performing. The decrease since December   reflects three large relationships being placed back on accrual status   due to making contractual payments for at least six consecutive months   and the pay-offs of three large relationships in the third quarter of   2025 offset by placing two large relationships on non-accrual status.

The report highlights key financial metrics, business performance indicators, and strategic initiatives that provide insight into the company's current position and future outlook.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Financial Highlights</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>For the third quarter of 2025, Itron reported a revenue of $582 million, a 5% decrease compared to the same period in 2024. The GAAP net income attributable to Itron, Inc. was $66 million, down by $12 million from the previous year. GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) stood at $1.41, a decrease of $0.29 per share. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.54, down $0.30 per share.

Device Solutions revenue fell by 16%, driven by lower legacy electricity product sales in EMEA and reduced North American water volumes. Networked Solutions revenue decreased by 6% due to project deployment timings, while Outcomes revenue increased by 11%, reflecting higher recurring revenue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gross margin improved to 37.7%, up 360 basis points from the previous year, due to favorable customer and product mix. GAAP operating expenses increased slightly to $138 million, while non-GAAP operating expenses remained unchanged at $130 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP operating incomes saw increases, driven by higher gross profit.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>On October 6, 2025, Itron announced the acquisition of Urbint, Inc., a privately held software company based in Miami, Florida, for $325 million. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025 and will be funded through cash on hand.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Management's Perspective</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>Tom Deitrich, Itron’s president and CEO, commented, \"Itron delivered third quarter results with record margin, profitability, and cash flow. Our customers are confronting a dramatic increase in complexity and uncertainty, and as reflected in our results, they are actively deploying advanced technology to address these challenges. Itron’s Grid Edge Intelligence solutions are designed to solve dynamic problems in a rapidly changing world.
