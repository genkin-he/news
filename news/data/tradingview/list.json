The report represents the latest iteration in a bi-annual series of comprehensive market analyses, positioning Abu Dhabi as a regional leader in data-driven decision making in real estate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ADREC’s flagship report serves as the definitive source for transparent real estate insights, featuring market values reaching historic highs driven by sustained economic growth, robust population expansion of 7.5% in 2024, and foreign investor confidence. The report encompasses detailed supply and demand analytics, transaction performance metrics, geographic distribution patterns, and forward-looking projections through 2030.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The report demonstrates Abu Dhabi's position as a global real estate destination of choice, with a sector defined not only by growth, but by stability, transparency, and long-term confidence.\" said H.E Rashed Al Omaira, Director General of ADREC. \" The data confirms that demand fundamentals remain strong, supply expansion is disciplined, and price movement is occurring in an orderly and sustainable manner. These dynamics reflect the strength of Abu Dhabi’s economic foundation and the effectiveness of a regulatory framework designed to safeguard investors while enabling responsible development.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"As we look towards 2030, continued planning discipline, advanced digital infrastructure, and strengthened governance will remain central to shaping a resilient real estate ecosystem that supports Abu Dhabi’s position as a leading global destination to live, invest, and thrive.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Transaction Values Reach Historic Peaks Across All Sectors</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The 2025 transaction performance establishes new benchmarks for market activity, with total real estate values hitting AED 142 billion, representing a remarkable 44% acceleration from 2024 levels. Real estate sales dominated market activity, accounting for a record-high AED 93 billion and representing 66% of total transacted value, signalling exceptional market health and transaction robustness.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Residential unit sales emerged as the primary growth driver, expanding from approximately AED 19 billion in 2022 to AED 76 billion in 2025, representing a fourfold increase driven by off-plan sales growth and master-planned community development. The market's international appeal is demonstrated through foreign investment patterns, with resident expatriates and non-resident foreign investors driving 62% of total 2025 residential sales value. Top 10 developers capture 91% of residential off-plan primary sales value totalling AED 50 billion, while the top 10 projects contributed 32% of total sales at AED 24 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Supply and Demand Dynamics Drive Exceptional Price Performance</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Abu Dhabi's real estate market establishes fundamental strength through sustained demand-supply imbalances across all sectors. The emirate's residential inventory reached 401,000 units in 2025, with occupied units growing at 6.6% annually compared to supply growth of 2.8% since 2022, creating conditions for accelerated price appreciation. Apartment prices recorded their sharpest annual increase in recent years, with sale prices rising 19% and new lease prices climbing 16% between 2024 and 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Villa performance mirrored this strength, with sales prices increasing 13% and rental yields demonstrating robust 14% growth in investment zones. The market's structural health is evidenced by rental units comprising 71% of total occupied units, driving strong rental yields across the emirate. Future supply projections indicate continued momentum, with residential stock expected to grow 2.9% annually through 2030, supported by 43,000 new units anticipated from investment zones where 98% of new apartments will be delivered.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Commercial Real Estate Achieves Peak Occupancy and Pricing Power</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Abu Dhabi's commercial sectors demonstrate exceptional performance, with retail and office markets reaching multi-year occupancy highs driven by economic expansion and constrained supply growth. The retail sector achieved total supply of 3.8 million square meters by 2025, with street retail and community malls forming the market backbone at 44% of total gross leasable area. Overall retail occupancy surged to 94% in 2025, reaching a five-year peak supported by demand growth outpacing 2.3% annual supply increases, resulting in new lease prices accelerating 8% year-over-year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Office market performance proved equally robust, with total supply reaching 3.4 million square meters and occupancy maintaining structural strength above 96%. Supply growth of less than 2% compared to 2024, combined with 9% job growth and 6.4% expansion in professional roles, drove new office lease prices up 11% in 2025. Yas Island emerged as the leading office destination, driving 20% of new supply between 2022 and 2025, highlighting geographic diversification within the emirate's commercial landscape.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ADREC's technological advancement of digital real estate services, including virtual transaction capabilities, enhanced analytical tools, and expanded market transparency aligned with the Abu Dhabi Government Digital Strategy 2025–2027.

While the stock may be volatile until the investigation is clarified or settled, the decline of around 30% since the probe's announcement seems to have priced in its potential drag to earnings, they say. The analysts view the pullback as an opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate on Trip.com's shares, as the online travel agency remains well-positioned to benefit from Chinese travel-demand growth. DBS maintains its buy rating and HK$563.00 target price on Trip.com's Hong Kong-listed shares. It also retains its US$72.00 target price on the ADRs. The Hong Kong shares rise 2.4% to HK$410.00 while the ADRs last closed at US$52.27. (megan.cheah@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

The installation is expected to serve as a strong reference site in one of North America’s most important greenhouse regions – Leamington, Canada. This project will strengthen our positioning in ongoing discussions and increase our chances of being shortlisted for larger LED projects currently under evaluation. Establishing credible reference cases in key markets is an important step in building long-term trust and visibility for Heliospectra.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, we see a structural market development unfolding. Europe has long prioritized high-efficacy LED fixtures due to elevated energy costs. In 2025, we clearly saw this focus accelerating in Canada — one of the world’s largest greenhouse markets. With persistently high energy prices, we anticipate a substantial replacement market emerging in 2026 and 2027. Heliospectra is well positioned to capture this shift.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our partnership with Cree and the implementation of OSRAM’s newest PURSA LED platform — currently delivering the highest efficacy levels available on the market — further strengthen our technological competitiveness. Combined with the recent start of our new contract manufacturing partner in Poland, we are lowering lead times and reducing exposure to import duties, improving both flexibility and cost efficiency.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Innovation Moving Toward Commercialization</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Innovation remains at the heart of our strategy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During 2025, project Green Control, led by Wageningen University and partners was approved. The project aims to revolutionize greenhouse horticulture by shifting from conventional climate control to \"plant-driven\" control using AI, sensors, and 3D modeling, further validating our plant-driven cultivation approach.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>helioSENSE team has now expanded to four dedicated specialists and is approaching commercialization of our first solution, Light Use Efficiency Threshold LUEt. This is a major milestone and positions us to introduce our first commercial helioSENSE projects during 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In parallel, helioCORE™ continues to evolve. Our energy-management capabilities, including integration with peak prediction services, enable growers to actively avoid high-cost energy periods — particularly at year-end when tariffs can significantly impact operating costs. These tools are becoming increasingly relevant as energy volatility continues to shape greenhouse economics.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To further strengthen our position in smart lighting and plant-driven cultivation, we are actively building partnerships focused on data-driven growing. This includes collaborations with sensor suppliers, energy peak prediction providers, photosynthesis specialists, and weather data partners.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our objective is to integrate helioSENSE into a broader intelligent control solution capable of managing lighting and energy screens in a coordinated way. By incorporating direct plant feedback into the growing environment, we aim to help growers reduce energy consumption — one of their most significant cost factors — while simultaneously improving yield and crop quality.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Encouragingly, all projects delivered during 2025 were executed successfully, and customer feedback has been very positive. Operational execution remains a key strength of our organization.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Strengthening the Organization</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>During 2025, we expanded our team in the Netherlands, and onboarded a highly experienced team across sales, technology, and operations. This strengthens our commercial reach and execution capacity. And we now enter 2026 with higher expectations and a more mature organization.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is also encouraging to see increased inbound activity. Through our inbox and CRM system, we track a growing number of quotation requests and solution downloads. Customers are increasingly finding us proactively — a strong indicator that brand awareness and market credibility are improving. We also see an increase on the size of the greenhouse projects quoted, and more often find ourselves on the short list.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Focus for 2026</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our main operational focus in 2026 will be our supply chain management and further strengthening our partnership with our contract manufacturing partners. Ensuring that we are ready for larger projects in 2026. Together, we have will refined our stock strategy to increase flexibility and responsiveness in the production chain. Thanks to our modular system design, we can maintain a very late decoupling point in production, allowing us to adapt configurations closer to delivery — creating greater flexibility for our customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our second major objective is to secure the first commercial helioSENSE projects and successfully launch LUEt into the market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, we remain convinced of our future success and will continue strengthening our commercial organization and support teams to match the growing opportunity pipeline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Entering 2026 with Confidence</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>2025 tested our resilience.
