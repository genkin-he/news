This backdrop leaves the country's government bonds, or OLOs, juggling near-term political risk with medium-term fiscal risk, he says. However, the fact that Belgium has completed its 2025 bond issuance program barring some small optional reverse inquiry auctions, \"might help OLOs tide through this period of political uncertainty.\" The 10-year OLO yield rises 0.9 basis points to 3.175%, according to Tradeweb.
