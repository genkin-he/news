Lee faces the dual challenge of protecting South Korea's export-driven economy and lowering tensions with North Korea amid rising China-U.S. competition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earlier this week, Lee also hosted U.S. President Donald Trump for a rushed state visit, showering him with gifts and praise before announcing a surprise trade deal aimed at lowering U.S. tariffs in return for billions of dollars in South Korean investment in the United States.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lee is set to hold similar events for Xi on Saturday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Gyeongju, including a summit meeting and state dinner. This is Xi's first visit to South Korea in 11 years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Seoul is a key U.S. military ally, hosting thousands of American troops and relying on the U.S. nuclear umbrella for protection from nuclear-armed North Korea. Yet its economy is deeply entwined with not just the U.S., but also China, which has grown increasingly challenging for South Korean companies and wields influence over North Korea.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lee's office has said that he and Xi will discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, a diplomatic phrase used to refer to North Korea's nuclear weapons, which are banned by United Nations Security Council resolutions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pyongyang, a military and economic ally of China, issued a statement on Saturday dismissing the denuclearisation agenda as an unrealisable \"pipe dream\". </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump had offered to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his visit to South Korea, but Pyongyang did not make a public response.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump met with Xi on Thursday ahead of the APEC summit, striking a deal that includes lower U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for Beijing's crackdown on illicit fentanyl trade, the resumption of U.S. soybean purchases and continued flow of rare earths exports. The Chinese president also held talks with the leaders of Japan, Canada, and Thailand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In closing remarks at APEC on Saturday, Xi proposed the establishment of a World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organization, while Lee said he hoped for regional collaboration on AI and demographic changes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A source familiar with negotiations confirmed Chinese state media reports on Saturday that member states had agreed on a joint leaders' statement, as well as declarations on AI and demographic change.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CHARM OFFENSIVE?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As Trump skipped this week's APEC leaders' summit, China positioned itself as the predictable champion of free and open trade, a role the U.S. has dominated for decades. China will host APEC in Shenzhen next year, Xi announced. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>John Delury, senior fellow at the Asia Society, said China has yet to launch a charm offensive toward U.S. allies like South Korea, amid pressure from Trump's tariffs and uncertainty over U.S. military commitments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I think Beijing is in a phase one approach where they are sitting back a little bit and letting the Trump administration do damage on its own,\" he said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We have not seen China launching big charm offensives to try to capitalize on some of that damage,\" he added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A second phase could include more outreach, but it could also see Beijing ramp up pressure of its own, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>South Korea has voiced concerns about the impact of China's rare earth export controls and called for the removal of Chinese sanctions on five U.S.-linked units of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean </span><span>. Beijing said the sanctions were related to security risks stemming from the company's cooperation with U.S. investigations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Seoul is also hoping that Xi's visit may lead to Beijing relaxing years-long restrictions on South Korean entertainment content, effectively banned after the 2017 deployment of the U.S.-led Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defence system in South Korea.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>South Korea has also expressed concerns over structures placed in disputed waters between the countries, which China claims are for fishing purposes.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto analyst @BullrunnersHQ on X social media has issued a new market update, suggesting that XRP may be on the verge of a major rally as traditional markets reach record highs. His latest technical breakdown links the recent strength in the NASDAQ to potential moves within the crypto sector, warning that the “unthinkable” is about to occur for XRP soon. The analyst highlighted that XRP’s price structure and broader crypto signals are aligning for a decisive move that could determine whether the current bull market cycle continues or starts to reverse.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>XRP Set For Unthinkable Upside Rally </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to @BullrunnersHQ, the equity market is approaching critical levels that could dictate the next major trend in the crypto market and XRP price. Despite the crypto market struggling to reach similar highs, XRP remains firmly above the $2.50 range. He described this setup as “the unthinkable” moment for XRP, where the asset could finally break free from its prolonged consolidation and rally by “multiple hundreds of percent.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notably, @BullrunnersHQ asserts that XRP’s price structure remains technically healthy despite market volatility. The analyst also noted that the overall crypto market cap and sentiment indicators have improved, with the Fear &amp; Greed Index climbing to 42 from mid-October lows. He further emphasized that Bitcoin continues to hold comfortably above its 50-week EMA, showing a pattern consistent with previous rallies that led to new peaks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The analyst added that BTC’s new local high around $116,000 and a bullish crossover between the 10 EMA and 20 EMA suggest that momentum is returning to risk assets, setting the stage for XRP to outperform potentially. Notably, this period mirrors earlier market cycles where Bitcoin’s consolidation above key levels triggered explosive altcoin rallies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>XRP, which has held its support much longer than most cryptocurrencies in the market, could climb to a new all-time high once momentum shifts. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To support his analysis, @BullrunnersHQ has referenced crypto market expert and Chartist Peter Brandt’s discussion about whether the NASDAQ’s recent price action represents a breakaway or an exhaustion gap. While Brandt leans cautiously bearish from an equities standpoint, @BullerunnersHQ remains confident that even if stocks slightly pull back or halt temporarily, money could still rotate into cryptocurrencies, potentially fueling XRP’s next major rally. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Analyst Warns Of Exhaustion Gap And End Of Bull Market</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In his analysis, @BullrunnersHQ also referenced crypto trader Abdullah, who believes that the NASDAQ’s rally also shows signs of an exhaustion gap, a signal often seen near the end of a bull market uptrend. Absullah points to overbought readings in both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic RSI on the weekly timeframe, indicating that the markets could be nearing the end of their current bull market phase. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>@BullrunnersHQ agreed that the market may be nearing exhaustion but reiterated that XRP’s position offers more upside potential compared to other assets. He also emphasized that Bitcoin must continue to hold between $107,000 and $109,000 on the weekly timeframe. A failure to do so could signal the end of the broader bull market.</span></p></span></div></div>",

But that’s just 2.5% from Thursday’s close of 6,822.34, with two months left to go.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While Wall Street remains generally bullish about the prospects for US stocks, there are legitimate reasons for caution. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said a third interest-rate cut is far from assured. And results from tech behemoths raised concern about spending on artificial intelligence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are signs that the economy is slowing and cracks are forming in the riskier parts of the credit market, calling into question the health of the American consumer. A handful of stocks are responsible for the bulk of the index’s gains, an alarming development should those heavyweights falter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And while some strategists have started dialing down their bullishness after Powell’s comments on Wednesday — even though the final two months of the year are generally seasonally strong — there is another, more pedestrian explanation for the bets crowding where they are: investors tend to load up near big, round numbers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“The 7,000 strike price is a very popular psychological level,” said Joseph Ferrara, an investment strategist at Gateway Investment Advisors. In options parlance, a strike is the level a trader can buy or sell the underlying asset as of the expiry date.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“A round strike is just going to get more attention,” said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then there are the more abstruse reasons, owing to the complexities and vagaries of the options market. One is a type of equity financing trade known as a box spread that often uses index options. Murphy attributes around half the open interest at the 7,000 level to such “financing plays.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then, there are what’s known in the industry as the call-selling “whales,” notably, JPMorgan Asset Management, which has a large number of call-selling funds. One of them, the JPMorgan Hedged Equity Fund, has a wager that the S&amp;P 500 won’t end the year past 7,000. Such funds gives away upside to buy insurance against a market drop. A host of asset managers now systematically sell calls, which can help anchor the market at certain levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Regardless of the reasons, Murphy suggests investors who have missed out on some of the gains in the AI darlings consider single-stock options rather than making bets on the broader index. For portfolio managers in the unenviable position of chasing the retail-driven AI surge, calls on individual names represent a more efficient tool than index options, he said.“The S&amp;P has not been as explosive as single names,” Murphy said. “Long story short, retail has been all in on AI, institutional investors have been a little more cautious and skeptical of the rally, so it’s something of a no-brainer for them to buy upside in Mag7 names.”</span></p></span></div></div>",

At the same time, we continued to diversify into Oceania, South America, and Africa to offset market headwinds in Asia, North America, and Europe. During this period, our total revenue increased by 27.43%, driven by a 51.89% surge in domestic sales and new customer acquisitions from the emerging markets. As global disruptions and uncertainties gradually subside, we believe our solid sales base will support a strong rebound, providing a renewed springboard for future growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"During this period, we increased research and development spending by 53.50% to advance production process technologies, customization capabilities. To address rising material, labor and bad-debt costs, we adopted a volume-first strategy to expand market share and better absorb fixed costs. While this temporarily compressed our margins, we view it as a strategic short-term trade-off that does not diminish our underlying profitability potential.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Furthermore, our successful Nasdaq IPO in July 2025 has strengthened our balance sheet and enhanced our capital resources to pursue additional strategic initiatives and market opportunities. As personalization and customization evolve from niche segments into mainstream consumer trends, we believe that our business is well positioned to leverage flexible pricing, expand value-added services, and enter a virtuous growth cycle, supported by our diversified market reach, growing product suite, accumulated technological expertise, and enhanced capital base.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Looking ahead, our current strategy, anchored in continuous product and technology innovation, will remain as the foundation for sustainable growth and global expansion, particularly in the North America market.

The increase was primarily attributable to an approximately $3.91 million increase in sales in mainland China, and partially offset by the decrease of approximately $1.18 million in sales in Asia (excluding mainland China). The increase in revenue in mainland China and the decrease in other Asian markets were mainly due to uncertainties in overseas markets, where customers' demand and consumption prospects remained relatively weak, leading the Company to strengthen its domestic sales initiatives, such as increasing participation in trade fairs and promotional events, expanding direct marketing and business negotiations with key customers, and adopting more competitive pricing to strengthen its market position in mainland China.</span></p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><span> </span><br/><span>                         For the Six Months </span><br/><span>                               Ended           For the Six Months Ended </span><br/><span>--------------------- </span><br/><span>                           April 30, 2025           April 30, 2024                Change </span><br/><span>---------------------  ----------------------  ------------------------  ------------------------- </span><br/><span>                          Sales      As % of       Sales      As % of </span><br/><span>---------------------                                                                  ------- </span><br/><span>Country/Region           Amount       Sales       Amount      Sales         Amount          % </span><br/><span>---------------------  -----------  ---------  -------------  ---------  ------------  ----------- </span><br/><span> Mainland China        $11,459,301  92.38%      $  7,544,314  77.50%     $  3,914,987    51.89% </span><br/><span> Asia (excluding </span><br/><span>  mainland China)          371,784   3.00%         1,556,241  15.99%      (1,184,457)  (76.11)% </span><br/><span> North America              59,069   0.48%      `    123,884   1.27%         (64,815)  (52.32)% </span><br/><span> Europe                    427,115   3.44%           499,126   5.13%         (72,011)  (14.43)% </span><br/><span> Oceania                    39,715   0.32%             7,970   0.08%           31,745   398.31% </span><br/><span> South America              11,634   0.09%             2,468   0.03%            9,166   371.39% </span><br/><span> Africa                     35,616   0.29%                 -      -%           35,616   100.00% </span><br/><span>                        ----------  -----          ---------  ----- </span><br/><span> Total                 $12,404,234    100%      $  9,734,003    100%     $  2,670,231    27.43% </span><br/><span>                        ==========  =====          =========  ===== </span><br/><span> </span></pre><p class=\"\"><span>Cost of Revenue</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cost of revenue was $11.06 million for the first half of fiscal year 2025, representing an increase of 42.70% from $7.75 million for the same period of last year.
