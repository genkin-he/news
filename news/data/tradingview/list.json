While the leading altcoin notably showed a significantly volatile price action, bearish sentiments reigned supreme, resulting in a net 4.37% loss. Interestingly, popular expert Ali Martinez has highlighted a critical price level for Solana investors’ attention amid the current market uncertainty. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>To Fly Or Crash? Solana Future Rests On Key Price Point </span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a recent X post, Martinez dives into the present Solana market structure, highlighting several potential developments tied to the $180 price level. Notably, the daily chart reveals that Solana has been strictly trading in an ascending channel since May 2025, with zero deviations recorded. Importantly, the altcoin has been moving near the lower boundary of this channel, currently around $180, which acts as a pivotal support. This price point also aligns with the 200-day simple moving average, thereby reinforcing its validity.</span></p><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:864.8878107944208px;aspect-ratio:1.441479684657368\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:fde2b621c094b-258dfc1271944df7dbbcdbdc2efe9062-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Solana\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:fde2b621c094b-258dfc1271944df7dbbcdbdc2efe9062-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f7f7f7\"/></picture></div></figure></span><p class=\"\"><span>Furthermore, on-chain data from the leading analytics platform Glassnode shows that 24.5 million SOL were purchased at this level, reflecting a high market demand that will likely prevent further price incursion upon a retest. Looking at Martinez’s analysis, a consistent price hold above $180 retains the validity of the ascending channel and presents a setup for a potential price gain to $230, with further price targets at $290. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, if an overwhelming bearish pressure pushes Solana below $180, investors can expect a further decline to around $115, while a potential crash to $50 is also feasible. Therefore, Solana’s behavior at $180 presents a possible 56% gain or 72% loss from current market prices. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Solana Market Overview </span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>At press time, Solana (SOL) is trading at $185, up 4.57% over the past 24 hours. Despite the daily rebound, its monthly performance remains negative, with a 14.27% decline highlighting the broader weakness seen in the last week. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a notable development, Bitwise launched the first-ever Solana Spot ETF on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) this week, marking a major milestone for altcoins. The achievement was quickly followed by Grayscale, which introduced its own Grayscale Solana Trust, further signaling growing institutional interest in Solana.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This week’s events represent a significant step toward broadening institutional access to Solana and other altcoins, paving the way for deeper market participation beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to SoSoValue data, the two newly launched ETFs have already attracted strong demand, recording $154.73 million in net inflows and $439.97 million in net assets within the first three trading days.

Now it's a question of taking some profits or holding for a rally at year-end.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With the S&amp;P 500 on pace for a 16% yearly gain already, investors find themselves at a familiar crossroads: lock in profits while they are hot, or stay greedy and bet on a typical year-end rally that could push stocks to new highs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The S&amp;P 500 SPX just defied one of Wall Street's most entrenched seasonal clichés - \"sell in May and go away\" - with its strongest May-through-October stretch since 1950. Historically, this six-month stretch is the worst seasonal period for stocks, with an average gain of only 2.1%, according to data compiled by LPL Financials.

Seasonality simply reflects the broader market climate rather than the immediate setup on Wall Street - meaning stock performance through year-end doesn't have to follow any seasonal script, LPL's Turnquist noted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After all, \"economic conditions, earnings, geopolitics, along with fiscal, monetary and trade policy, are much bigger drivers of price action\" in the stock market this year, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stovall told MarketWatch that macro forces also support the case for a year-end rally. His CFRA team continues to see stock prices advancing through the end of 2025 on \"an improvement in earnings-growth expectations\" combined with potentially another interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve in December.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We're still looking for two Fed rate cuts in 2026, so that could also help to shore up stock prices, at least through the end of April,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See: Will the Fed cut interest rates in December? Here's what experts are saying.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. central bank last week voted to lower the target range for the federal-funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 3.75% and 4%, and officially announced its plan to stop shrinking its portfolio of assets beginning Dec. 1. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned investors against assuming another rate reduction will follow in December, saying it's \"not a foregone conclusion\".</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a result, investors have scaled back expectations for a December rate cut, with fed-funds futures traders on Friday only pricing in a 69% chance of a rate reduction at the end of the year, down from 90% before the October policy meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See: Here's what a government shutdown means for markets - and your wallet</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Of course, investors can't ignore the political storm clouds gathering in Washington. The ongoing government shutdown - now stretching into its second month - is beginning to ripple through the economy and straining American households.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The longer the government shutdown lasts, the bigger of a potential drag it could have on consumer confidence, said Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at SimCorp. \"So far, we haven't seen the impact, but I've got to imagine that eventually we are going to see the impact, as people are not getting paid or [receiving] food benefits,\" she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. stocks finished higher on Friday, while also scoring weekly and monthly gains.

It culminates efforts New Mexico has made to expand access to free child care since the governor and state legislature created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department in 2019. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The launch comes as other Democratic-run states, cities and counties eye a step popular among working families. Connecticut recently passed a bill making child care free for those families earning under $100,000 per year and no more than 7% of income for those earning more. New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has proposed no-cost universal child care.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>BIG SAVINGS FOR FAMILIES</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Taos special education teacher Allyson O'Brien expects to save around $12,000 a year in child care bills for her son Otis, who is nearly 2-1/2. She and her husband Shawn O'Kelly, a truck driver, earn a fraction above New Mexico's previous income cap for free child care, which was about $129,000 per year for their family of four.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We'll be able to go on vacation, we won't have to decide what bills we're going to pay, like, are we going to do propane or the mortgage?\" O'Brien said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To achieve a fully universal system, New Mexico must create nearly 14,000 more child care slots and recruit 5,000 educators, according to its Democratic-run government. The state is establishing a $12.7 million low-interest loan fund to construct and expand child care facilities. It is also increasing reimbursement rates to providers that pay entry-level staff a minimum of $18 per hour, above the state's $12 hourly minimum wage, and offer full-time care.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alison McPartlon, director of the University of New Mexico-Taos Kids' Campus child care center, said her waiting list is so long some children do not get in before they start kindergarten. She said higher reimbursement rates will help her retain and recruit educators.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There will be more centers coming up,\" said McPartlon, describing the shift to universal child care as \"incredible.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ADDRESSING POVERTY</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham told reporters child care was \"the backbone of creating a system of support for families that allows them to work, to go to college, to do all the things they need to do to continue to lift New Mexico out of poverty.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nearly 18% of New Mexicans live below the poverty line, according to the U.S. Census, making it one of the poorest states. Slightly larger in area than the United Kingdom, with only 2.1 million people, New Mexico is paying for universal child care primarily through funds generated by its oil and gas sector, the second-biggest of any state.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Research shows quality child care lifts education outcomes, especially among low-income families, according to Philip Fisher, a professor of early childhood learning at Stanford University.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reading levels of New Mexican students fall far below the national average when children are first tested around age 8 or 9, according to studies by Neal Halfon, professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Los Angeles. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Annie E. Casey Foundation has, for years, ranked New Mexico last among states in both education and child well-being. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     New Mexico joins countries such as Norway and Belgium that offer free universal child care for children under 3, and Bulgaria, where early childhood education is free for all children until elementary school. New Mexico is going further by offering no-cost child care for children up to age 13. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Critics such as New Mexico State Representative Rebecca Dow, a Republican, say it makes no sense to give wealthier families free child care when they could receive federal tax breaks for child care included this year in President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dow, the founder of a daycare center, said research showed the best place for a young child was at home and the state should give families tax credits for \"mom to stay home\" with the kids.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There is no capacity, people are going to be disappointed,\" she said of the state's push for universal free day care.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Mark A. Jamison</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About the author: Mark A. Jamison is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and the director and Gunter Professor of the Public Utility Research Center at the University of Florida's Warrington College of Business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI looks like a circular money machine. Microsoft owns a major stake in OpenAI, which in turn invests in AMD. Nvidia puts billions of dollars into OpenAI and holds equity in CoreWeave, one of Microsoft's cloud suppliers. The same dollars are simply bouncing between balance sheets, rather than creating new economic activity. Equity markets are soaring, paying little mind to this web of financing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So alarmists say. But the evidence suggests something different, a powerful technological transformation that remains grounded in fundamentals. There is little reason to panic about an AI bubble — at least not yet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A bubble requires euphoric overvaluation and a disconnect between price and performance. Today's AI boom shows neither. The market is concentrated in highly profitable incumbents with real earnings, strong cash flows, and global-scale innovation. There is plenty of excitement, but that is different from irrational exuberance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is true that AI-related companies, specifically those in the Magnificent Seven, account for roughly three-quarters of S&amp;P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth, and 90% of capital-spending growth since late 2022. No wonder more than half of fund managers surveyed by Bank of America called AI stocks a bubble and ranked an AI-driven equity bubble as the biggest risk facing markets. This seems doubly alarming given the financial links between these firms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet these links are more likely just signs of evolving corporate strategies and risk management. AI is still sorting out its business models. Partial equity stakes allow companies to share risks and profits as they figure out how to leverage layers of the AI stack — chips, data, software, or applications — to deliver the most value. Antitrust regulators likely would have blocked full mergers, so looser forms of vertical integration may be the only practical way for these firms to innovate across corporate boundaries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Global spending on AI is expected to top $375 billion this year. Spending on data centers alone could hit $3-4 trillion annually by 2030. Some see echoes of the late-1990s telecom and internet boom, when fiber-optic firms were valued by the number of cities they promised to serve, not the profits they actually earned.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI companies are different. Most AI-related capital spending is financed through free cash flow, not debt. The Mag 7 have strong balance sheets, post average returns on equity near 46%, and trade at roughly half the earnings multiples of dot-com era darlings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>James Pethokoukis, my colleague at AEI, has noted that today's valuations reflect solid profits, \"fortress-like balance sheets,\" and disciplined forecasts, not blind exuberance. The AI capital expenditure boom looks more like a race than a bubble — one fueled by genuine technological advances and intense global competition, particularly with China.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unlike the internet bubble, where clicks stood in for cash, AI is already producing measurable economic gains. Small businesses using AI see productivity gains approaching 40%. AI systems have long powered Amazon's logistics, Netflix's content suggestions, and Meta's advertising efficiency. Generative tools are cutting costs in design and coding. And large-language-model users are beginning to bypass traditional search engines entirely, creating new advertising markets for AI companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, investors and policymakers should keep an eye on a few pressure points. First, profitability. Some firms experimenting with AI are falling short. Many by now are familiar with the MIT study that found 95% of organizations report earning zero return on investment on their AI projects, largely from their failure to make meaningful change.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Power is another problem. Data centers are already straining U.S. electric grids. Their power needs are expected to triple by 2028. Yet some utilities hesitate to expand capacity without support of federal regulators, who are worried about impacts on rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Third, regulation: Europe is trying to stymie U.S. AI companies with a regime of fines, and China is a politically risky market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The real test for AI will be in how firms respond to disruption — whether by shrinking from it, as the MIT study found, or by embracing it, as Amazon and Goldman Sachs have done.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For now though, what we are witnessing doesn't look like a bubble. It looks, to me, more like the early stage of a decades-long technological supercycle. The challenge isn't unrealistic dreams, but too little electricity to power them and too much regulation that squelches them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's newsroom.

LED boards inside the ground, big-screen videos and press backdrops will also display the Dogecoin motif during games and media events.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These activations are part of a wider plan that includes testing Dogecoin as a payment option for tickets, merchandise and concessions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>What The Announcements Leave Out</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deal’s exact financial terms were not disclosed. No price tag or ownership percentage was published by either side. Reports have disclosed that a board reconstitution and the appointment of a new president are planned, but names and dates have not been shared. Push For Real-World Use Of Dogecoin </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>House of Doge framed the investment as a chance to push Dogecoin beyond online chatter and into everyday use at a sports venue. The group said the club will act as a platform for broader community initiatives and commercial experiments with crypto payments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fans could be given new ways to pay and buy, if pilot projects roll out as described. There is, however, a question about how smoothly such systems will be adopted in a lower-division club environment and what regulatory checks will be required in Italy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Marco Margiotta, CEO of House of Doge, said placing the Dogecoin logo front-and-center on the club’s jersey means it will show up in every match photo and TV shot.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He said frequent exposure will make people recognize the brand, and that recognition can lead to practical uses and wider global acceptance.Local Reaction And Broader Implications </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some local journalists praised the capital boost, noting that lower-division clubs often face tight budgets. Others warned that visibility for a cryptocurrency brand does not guarantee long-term financial stability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Market observers will be watching whether the partnership drives measurable increases in matchday revenue or merchandise sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Community groups, who are central to the club’s identity in Trieste, have been cited as needing reassurance that traditions will be respected. DOGE Price Update </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, after sliding about 7% in the past 24 hours, DOGE is trading at $0.18. The coin is up 11% so far this year, but that still leaves it roughly 70% below its 2021 peak of $0.73.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView</span></em></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Alistair MacDonald and Heather Somerville</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ukraine has pioneered the use of drones in battle. Now Western investors are trying to get a piece of the action.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Foreign investment in Ukrainian drone makers and other defense technology has risen this year, founders and investors say, driven by the prospect of the battle-tested technology winning a slice of rising military spending.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In Ukraine, the added financial firepower is helping professionalize outfits that began in garages and military units — giving them a chance to compete abroad with Western players. The Ukrainian startups also offer the U.S. possible solutions for its shortcomings in drone technology.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Are they scrappy? Yes. Are they all working in bombed-out buildings with pliers found on the side of the road? No,\" said Justin Zeefe, a founding partner at Los Angeles- and Kyiv-based Green Flag Ventures. \"They know what they are doing.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Green Flag was set up in 2023 to invest in Ukrainian companies, and the venture-capital firm says that in recent months there has been growing interest in its inaugural $20 million fund.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Western investors see Ukrainian drone makers as less risky after many companies generated a couple of years of revenue, secured customers outside their home country and added governance controls, Zeefe said. Kyiv has also recently said it would allow defense companies to export for the first time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ukraine has been at the forefront of drone warfare since Russia's 2022 invasion, with the war serving as a testing ground for new technology. Most of the unmanned aerial vehicles in action are made by local startups, whose products are often considered more effective than those of their U.S. and European counterparts. Their UAVs also cost a fraction of the price of those made in the West.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kyiv-based Swarmer in September raised $15 million in a funding round — including U.S. investors — that the startup said was the single-largest investment in a Ukrainian defense-tech business since the start of the war.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company, which started out of a garage in 2023, makes artificial-intelligence software that has been used by Ukraine to coordinate drone swarm attacks on Russian positions. It plans to use the fresh funds to open offices in Warsaw and Austin, Texas, as well as to develop new software.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While investments are small compared with the riches flowing into American defense-tech companies and other hot sectors such as AI, the number of deals is increasing rapidly and Ukraine-focused funds are raising more money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ondas Capital, an American fund, said recently that it expected to invest at least $150 million in combat-proven technology, mostly in Ukraine. Four European venture-capital firms said at a September defense-technology conference in Ukraine that they plan to invest a combined $100 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The conference attracted 5,000 investors and executives, its organizers said, up from 1,000 the year before.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Much of the money arriving in Ukraine so far is European. That is partly because the startups are too small for mammoth American funds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investing in Ukrainian drones also comes with risks. The country has a history of corruption, the UAV market is crowded, and simply visiting to scout deals is arduous and potentially dangerous.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There is a business opportunity here, and that is why people are jumping in,\" said Eveline Buchatskiy, managing partner of D3, referring to the potential for these companies to capitalize on increased European military spending. The fund, which counts former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt among its backers, was established at the start of the war to invest in Ukrainian defense technology.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Attracting venture capital in the first two years of the war was \"almost impossible,\" according to Yevhen Zhebko, co-founder of Teletactica, which makes drone communication systems. \"Everyone tried to understand, will we survive?\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In July, Teletactica raised $1.5 million from investors including Green Flag. The funding has helped the company scale up production for the front lines. It is also expanding in Latvia and Estonia, where officials have requested small batches of the firm's technology, Zhebko said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Foreign money is already shaking up the sector. U.S. investment firm MITS Capital recently consolidated four Ukrainian defense businesses into one larger company, called MITS Industries. The new entity is to be based in Denmark to address investor concerns about Ukrainian governance and capitalize on Scandinavian demand for equipment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Western companies are also investing. Germany's Quantum Systems in July agreed to acquire a 10% stake in Frontline, a Kyiv-based drone maker, and said it would help scale up manufacturing in Ukraine. Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The investment comes just two years after Frontline began in an unheated, abandoned building. Now it has more than 100 employees and is rapidly boosting production. One key selling point: At $3,000 a piece, its flagship drone costs less than a sixth of the price of what the company sees as its nearest Western competitor.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In \"Europe and the U.S. there are [comparable] companies but they offer the same capability for a much higher cost,\" said Mykyta Rozhkov, Frontline's chief marketing officer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lower production costs are encouraging Western governments to look to Ukraine too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Pentagon has already awarded a small number of contracts to Ukrainian startups for technology including long-range drones and counterdrone systems. Now, the U.S. and Ukraine are negotiating a deal under which Ukrainian companies would share their drone technology in exchange for royalties or other forms of compensation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.K. and Denmark have signed their own deals with Kyiv, aimed at getting Ukrainian drone makers to manufacture in their countries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To be sure, the sector is crowded. Ukraine already has more than 300 drone makers, according to the Ukrainian Council of Gunsmiths, a trade organization. Hundreds more are springing up across Europe and the U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Industry executives predict a shakeout when the war ends.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Employees of Plural, a venture-capital firm whose investments include German defense startup Helsing, recently attended a defense conference where Ukrainian startups pitched investors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The vast majority won't make it,\" said Khaled Helioui, a partner at the London-based firm. But, he added, as long as some of the startups make it, \"you have winners.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Alistair MacDonald at Alistair.Macdonald@wsj.com and Heather Somerville at heather.somerville@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
