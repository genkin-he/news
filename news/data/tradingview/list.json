The China-focused REIT's revenue and net property income declined in 3Q, and rents were renewed at lower rates across retail, business-park and logistics-park assets, she notes. While the Singapore-listed REIT's manager could consider unit buybacks using the net proceeds from a recent divestment, Lim thinks the window of opportunity has narrowed due the REIT's unit-price recovery this year. OCBC raises its 2026 distribution-per-unit estimate by 2.4%, leading to a higher fair-value estimate of S$0.74 versus S$0.705 previously. The bank maintains its hold rating, citing a poor rent-renewal outlook and foreign-exchange headwinds. Units rise 1.3% to S$0.80. (megan.cheah@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

This comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates Wednesday but said rates wouldn't necessarily fall in December. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank held rates steady Thursday and pointed to a resilient economy. As U.S. and eurozone rate-cut expectations have fallen, so U.K. rate-cut expectations have also slipped. Money markets price a 62% chance of the Bank of England cutting rates by the end of 2025, down from 72% a week ago, LSEG data show. Ten-year gilt yields climb 2.2 basis points to 4.430%, Tradeweb data show. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Mitsubishi Chemical Group Corp. said its net profit more than doubled to Yen110.1 billion ($716.5 million) in the fiscal six months ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of Yen40.9 billion a year earlier, as per Chemweek.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, the company did not disclose specific reasons for the profit increase. Sales for the company fell 10.5% year over year to Yen1.7 trillion, and operating profit slipped 19.6% to Yen86.4 billion.The interim consolidated accounting period was marked by a slowing economic environment, influenced by the widespread effects of the US trade policy. While the company benefited from economic stimulus measures in China and aggressive fiscal spending in certain European nations, overall growth remained sluggish, the company said.Mitsubishi Chemical has revised its forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026. The company now anticipates a net profit of Yen125 billion, down from a previous projection of Yen145 billion. Sales expectations have been adjusted to Yen3.7 trillion from an earlier estimate of ?3.6 trillion, while the forecast for operating income has been lowered to Yen176 billion, compared to the prior estimate of ?202 billion. The anticipated decline in income is attributed to a reduction in price gaps and decreased sales volumes, particularly in the methyl methacrylate (MMA) and derivatives segment, as well as in the basic materials and polymers segment.In the specialty materials segment, revenue decreased by 3.2% year over year to Yen520.6 billion. However, core operating income rose by 36.3% to Yen33.4 billion, driven by increased sales volumes from recovering demand for high-performance engineering plastics and the effects of production rationalization. The segment also benefited from improved selling prices in semiconductor-related businesses, despite facing challenges in the carbon fiber and composite sectors due to inflation-related cost increases.Conversely, the advanced films and polymers sector experienced a decline in sales revenue, primarily due to inventory adjustments by customers and foreign exchange impacts. The advanced solutions segment also reported decreased revenue, largely due to reduced demand for electric vehicle applications in Europe and the US and lower sales volumes of printing materials resulting from US tariffs.In the MMA and derivatives segment, revenue declined by 20.6% year over year to Yen178 billion, with core operating income down by 84% to Yen4.2 billion. The decline was driven by falling market prices for MMA and a decrease in sales volume due to diminished demand. Revenue from the coatings and additives sector also experienced a decline. The drop was attributed to a significant decrease in sales volume, largely resulting from reduced demand for paints, adhesives, inks and other related applications.Mitsubishi Chemical’s basic materials and polymers division saw a sales drop of 28% year over year to Yen386.4 billion. However, core operating losses in this division narrowed from Yen12 billion to Yen2.7 billion. The improvement in operating income can be attributed to several factors, including a widened price gap between raw materials and finished products, particularly in the polyolefins segment. Additionally, the impact of scheduled maintenance on ethylene production facilities was less severe than anticipated. The division also benefited from enhanced inventory valuation gains and losses within the carbon products business, alongside effective cost reduction efforts.However, the overall sales revenue decline was primarily driven by several challenges. The transfer of shares of a specified subsidiary in the purified terephthalic acid business significantly impacted revenue. Furthermore, the division experienced a drop in selling prices, which correlated with lower raw material prices and adverse foreign exchange impacts.In the carbon products segment, revenue also suffered due to the transfer of shares of a specified subsidiary in the cokes business. Sales volumes decreased because of reduced cokes production capacity, while selling prices for cokes fell in line with declining raw material prices and sluggish market demand.The industrial gases segment, managed by Nippon Sanso Holdings Group, reported a modest 1.1% increase in sales to Yen647 billion, although core operating income dipped by 1.3% to Yen93 billion. The increase in sales was attributed to the acquisition and consolidation of the industrial gas business in Australia and New Zealand, alongside effective price management efforts. However, overall demand remained sluggish, impacting sales volumes, particularly in Europe and the US.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>mrchub.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
