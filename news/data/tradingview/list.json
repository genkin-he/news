For additional risks and uncertainties regarding the Company, its business activities, its ability to qualify for and receive any additional funding from any U.S. or Canadian government, the CDF and the aforementioned projects (generally), see the risk disclosure in the Company's MD&amp;A for Q2 2025 (filed on SEDAR+ on August 28, 2025) (www.sedarplus.ca) as well as the risks described below.

He said inflation has remained above the Fed's 2% target for more than four years and that price increases are widespread across the economy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Schmid argued there is little sign that the Fed's rate stance is doing much to restrain the economy. A surge of business investment, high stock prices and easy corporate borrowing conditions instead suggest that current rates might not be leaning heavily against economic growth and inflation, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Schmid was one of two officials to dissent from the Fed's decision to ease rates by a quarter point for the second straight meeting. The other, governor Stephen Miran, dissented in the other direction, backing a larger, half-point rate cut.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Schmid acknowledged that the job market has weakened. He argued that if factors such as technological or demographic change have reduced hiring, lower rates might not do much to reverse them.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a December cut isn't a foregone conclusion following a widely-expected 25 basis points cut Wednesday. \"Our short-term call on the dollar remains more one of lack of direction rather than the initiation of a more sustainable rebound,\" Pesole says. The dearth of U.S. data during the government shutdown prevents markets from making any conviction call on slower Fed easing. The DXY dollar index is unlikely to rise above 100.000, he says. It trades flat at 99.527 after reaching a three-month high of 99.724 Thursday.(renae.dyer@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
