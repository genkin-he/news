Systems that are programmable. Intelligence that is embedded. Assets that are verifiable. Rails that institutions can scale on.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Global markets are entering a structural transformation. Artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming embedded into capital allocation, enterprise operations, and regulatory oversight. Digital assets are evolving from trading vehicles into programmable utility frameworks capable of moving value instantly and transparently. Climate accountability is moving from narrative commitments to measurable, auditable instrumentation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Tomorrow Company is designed to operate at the intersection of these structural shifts - and to grow with them. The merger unites two powerful and complementary platforms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>CUT Carbon Distributed Technologies AG</span></strong><span> contributes a tokenized carbon utility framework structured around verifiability, traceability, and retirement mechanics. Built within Liechtenstein's Blockchain Act framework and deployed on Ethereum Mainnet, CUT's model emphasizes measurable CO₂ reduction linkage and immutable audit trails across issuance, transfer, and retirement. As regulators, institutions, and global enterprises demand higher standards of disclosure and impact validation, programmable carbon infrastructure becomes foundational to next-generation capital markets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paul Thomson, Co-Founder of CUT Carbon Distributed Technologies AG, commented:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Tokenized commodities are moving from intention to instrumentation. For tokenized carbon credits, what matters now is verifiability-traceable assets, defensible controls, and retirement mechanics that stand up to real scrutiny. By integrating into The Tomorrow Company's broader infrastructure platform, we believe we can accelerate adoption and bring institutional-grade carbon instrumentation to global markets.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Complementing this climate utility layer is </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Plato Technologies Inc.</span></strong><span>, which brings an AI-driven intelligence engine purpose-built to convert fragmented global data into deployable, decision-ready workflows. Plato's vertically focused intelligence products are designed for repeat enterprise usage and global distribution, with an operating discipline centered on scalable infrastructure and cost efficiency.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bryan Feinberg, CEO and Founder of Plato Technologies Inc., stated:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"AI is only transformative when it moves from insight to execution. This merger connects measurable data verticals with a distribution-driven intelligence engine designed to operate at scale. The opportunity ahead is not incremental - it is to embed AI directly into the infrastructure layer of emerging digital markets.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Tomorrow Company</span></strong><span> is structured as a diversified Web3 infrastructure holding platform with multiple reinforcing value engines. The strategy extends beyond a single asset class or vertical. Leadership intends to expand tokenized asset frameworks beyond carbon into additional real-world asset categories where verifiability and programmability unlock new liquidity. The Company plans to accelerate the deployment of vertical AI intelligence products across sectors where data fragmentation creates inefficiencies. It also intends to pursue selective acquisitions and integrations aligned with durable utility, regulatory alignment, and institutional capital flows.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Management believes that over the coming years, the convergence of AI and tokenization will redefine how capital is raised, allocated, verified, and measured.

NOI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notes to the Reconciliations of FFO, Normalized FFO, Normalized FAD and NOI</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These supplemental performance measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other REITs. Consequently, funds from operations (\"FFO\"), Normalized FFO, Normalized Funds Available for Distribution (\"FAD\") and NOI, as presented herein, may not provide a meaningful measure of the Company's performance as compared to that of other real estate investment trusts. Since other REITs may not use a similar definition of these performance measures, caution should be exercised when comparing FFO, Normalized FFO, Normalized FAD and NOI, as presented herein, to that of other REITs. These performance measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP as they exclude the changes in operating assets and liabilities, and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of performance or as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity, and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>Funds From Operations - FFO</span></em></p><p class=\"\"><span>FFO, as defined by NAREIT and applied by the Company, is net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses on sales of real estate properties, impairments of real estate properties, and real estate depreciation and amortization after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, if any. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from that of the Company; and therefore, caution should be exercised when comparing the Company's FFO to that of other REITs. FFO per diluted share assumes the exercise of stock options and other potentially dilutive securities. Normalized FFO excludes from FFO certain items which, due to their infrequent or unpredictable nature, may create some difficulty in comparing FFO for the current period to similar prior periods, and may include, but are not limited to including, impairments of non-real estate assets, gains or losses attributable to the acquisition and disposition of non-real estate assets and liabilities, and recoveries of previous write-downs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>FFO and Normalized FFO are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the realizable value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate asset values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative and should be supplemented with a measure such as FFO. The term FFO was designed by the REIT industry to address this issue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>Funds Available for Distribution - FAD</span></em></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition to the adjustments included in the calculation of Normalized FFO, Normalized FAD excludes the impact of straight-line rent revenue adjustments and amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts. The Company also adjusts Normalized FAD for the net changes in its credit loss reserves, non-cash share-based compensation expense, SHOP capital expenditures as well as certain non-cash items related to equity method investments, such as straight-line lease expense and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments. Normalized FAD for the year ended December 31, 2025 included an adjustment for transaction costs incurred related to a large SHOP transaction that did not materialize.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Normalized FAD is an important supplemental performance measure for a REIT and a useful measure of liquidity as an indicator of the Company's ability to distribute dividends to its stockholders. GAAP requires a lessor to recognize contractual lease payments as income on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease. This straight-line rent adjustment has the effect of reporting rental income that is significantly more or less than the contractual cash flows received pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement. GAAP also requires any discount or premium related to indebtedness and debt issuance costs to be amortized as non-cash adjustments to earnings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>Net Operating Income - NOI</span></em></p><p class=\"\"><span>NOI is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate assets. NOI is defined as total revenues, less tenant reimbursements and property operating expenses. The Company believes NOI provides investors relevant and useful information as it measures the operating performance of the Company's real estate assets at the property level on an unleveraged basis. The Company uses NOI to make decisions about resource allocations to its segments and to assess the property level performance of its investment portfolios.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>Same Store</span></em></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company defines Same Store as real estate properties owned, consolidated and operational for the full period in both comparative periods and that are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that the Company may include selected properties that otherwise meet the Same Store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but not a full, period for one or both of the comparative periods, and in management's judgment such inclusion provides a more meaningful presentation of the Company's segment performance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Newly acquired properties, recently developed or redeveloped properties, and properties undergoing an operator transition will be included in Same Store after five full quarters from the date of acquisition, transition or being placed into service. SHOP properties and properties with triple-net leases that have undergone operator or business model transitions will be included in Same Store once operating under consistent operating structures for the full period in both periods presented.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Properties are excluded from Same Store if they are: (i) sold, classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP; (ii) impacted by significant disruptive events such as flood or fire; (iii) those properties that are currently undergoing a significant disruptive redevelopment; or (iv) those properties that are scheduled to undergo operator or business model transitions, or have transitioned operators or business models after the start of the prior comparison period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Consolidated Statements of Income</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>(in thousands, except share and per share

The Company believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations (and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with GAAP. As a result, the Company is disclosing certain non-GAAP results, including (i) Adjusted non-GAAP net income (loss) and (ii) Adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS, which generally excludes amortization expense, share-based compensation, impairment charges, expenses related to our acquisition of BAQSIMI®, certain debt issuance costs, legal settlements, and other one-time events in order to supplement investors' and other readers' understanding and assessment of the Company's financial performance because the Company's management uses these measures internally for forecasting, budgeting, and measuring its operating performance. Whenever the Company uses such non-GAAP measures, it will provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures set forth below and should consider non-GAAP measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Market Data</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This press release contains market data that we obtained from industry sources.
