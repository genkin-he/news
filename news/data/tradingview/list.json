            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Joanne Kaufman</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Walk-ins are welcome at Susan's, the \"brightly lit box\" of a nail salon that's the setting for \"Pick a Color,\" Souvankham Thammavongsa's slender, superb debut novel. And when business is sluggish, the mani-pedi price drops to 10 bucks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The one-star rating may or may not explain why there generally aren't sufficient advance bookings to keep the five chairs at Susan's continuously occupied. In any case, increasing traffic is the understandable goal of the shop's proprietor, Ning, who readers follow through a typical, typically long workday. And people can't always be counted on to keep their appointments. Their loss, as far as Ning is concerned.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There are others like us scattered around the city,\" she notes. (That American city is never specified.) \"And some are just a few doors down from us. But we're the best. It's no lie and I'm not kidding anybody when I say that. We're the best. I get people in and out, in and out, and so do the Susans.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To be clear, regardless of what's written on the ID tags, no employee is actually named Susan. \"So many girls come and go. I don't want to bother getting new name tags each time,\" says Ning, who is eminently practical — she pushes cost-effective threading over wasteful wax and tops off nail-polish bottles with polish thinner — and always eager to cut her losses. \"Besides, you know, it's never difficult to pronounce a name like Susan.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To add to the aura of interchangeability, Ning and her employees are all more or less the same height; they dress alike (black pants, black T-shirt, black running shoes), leave their nails unvarnished and keep their glossy black hair at the same length. Noting a follicular discrepancy, Ning grabs a pair of scissors and demands that one of the nail technicians, Mai, submit to an immediate 2-inch trim.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This insistence on absolute conformity is framed as Ning's desire to make things simpler for the clients (there's also a bit of contempt mixed in). It can be better read as Ning's desire for anonymity — she hasn't heard anyone call her by her real name in what seems like decades, and she's good with it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But all those efforts at twinning are a bit futile. Ning can't help but stand out. Ironically, considering her profession, she is missing her left ring finger, a loss that is noted several times but cannily goes unexplained. \"I don't hide what I don't have,\" she says. \"I spread the space I do have wider. Pinky finger and middle finger go their separate ways.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, her frequently stated eagerness to get customers in and out, in and out, 20 minutes max — \"and that goes for the girls too, if they don't have what it takes\" — seems more about a discomfort with intimacy and attachment than about a drive for maximum efficiency and maximum revenue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But Ning defends her impatience. \"People in love are boring,\" she notes of a steady, chatty customer known simply as the waitress.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Most people are not that interesting,\" she says at another point. \"They're the same to me. Hands and toes, toes and hands.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ning, 41, is a former boxer and Olympic hopeful whose time in the ring informs her world-weary, world-wary worldview, her tough management style (\"I don't like to chitchat, no how-are-yous, no coddling\") and her quick, jabbing insights about both the employees and the clients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apparently, the easiest shakedown targets are single people. \"They aren't spending it on anyone, and so they have a little more to spend on themselves,\" Ning thinks. \"And they'll do anything — anything, I tell you — if you can help them imagine not being alone anymore.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The new girl didn't knock, or do anything to call attention to herself, \" she thinks, summing up a fresh hire. \"Probably thinks when she breathes she's making too much noise. . . . The way she waves her hand tells me everything about her. Quick, eager to please.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The steady-paced, often mordantly funny \"Pick a Color\" explores the immigrant experience, the long tail of trauma, the indignities suffered by low-wage workers and their companion emotions: loneliness, loss and grief.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There's an unexpected visitor at the end of the day — Ning's abusive former boss, the owner of a high-end salon a few blocks away, comes by, ostensibly to take advantage of the $10 mani-pedi offer. At the end of the encounter, \"something strange happens,\" Ning says. \"As I pull back my arm, she reaches out and slides her hand gently along and then touches my finger. The missing one. . . . She moves to hold what is left of my finger, a little round bump, with a gentleness I didn't think she was ever capable of and gives me a kind smile.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The exchange leaves Ning with an unfamiliar sense of warmth. Certainly not lasting warmth. Surely not a lot of warmth. Maybe — this would be more in keeping with things — just one coat of it.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Ms. Kaufman writes on culture and arts for the Journal.</span></li></ul></span></div></div>",

Four years ago, the Fed rolled out the standing repo facility, which offers overnight lending to banks and Treasury-market dealers. Its goal is to cap the rate at which funds trade in the repo market, but in recent days, some repo funds have been more expensive than SRF borrowing, signaling that the SRF isn't fully accomplishing its aim. The SRF is seeing its first bout of sustained daily use as the Fed's balance-sheet shrinkage drains reserves from the banking system, and some participants may not be fully ready to use it, Logan says in a Friday speech.

            "title": "'Land Power' and 'The Land Trap': The Human Story Has Many Plots",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Edward Glaeser</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Is acreage overrated? Land was humanity's greatest asset for almost all of history, but collectively, agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting accounted for less than 1% of U.S. gross domestic product in 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Two books provide contrasting perspectives on land. In \"Land Power: Who Has It, Who Doesn't, and How That Determines the Fate of Societies,\" Michael Albertus emphasizes the politics of land reform, focusing on farmland and the developing world. Farms figure in Mike Bird's \"The Land Trap: A New History of the World's Oldest Asset,\" but his emphasis is on the financial perspective, particularly the real-estate bubbles that have emerged since 1990. For Mr. Bird, land is largely an asset, its value based on \"what sort of activity is going on all around it.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The two writers' perspectives reflect their backgrounds. Mr. Albertus is a professor of political science at the University of Chicago and a distinguished scholar of land redistribution. He has shown that autocracies redistribute more land than democracies and that in Colombia land reform \"reduced guerrilla activity\" in those areas that \"threatened serious violence.\" Mr. Bird is the Economist's Wall Street editor; he originally joined the magazine as its Asia business and finance editor. Hence his focus here on East Asian real estate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mr. Bird begins in colonial America, where the English colonists realized that their new societies \"would be defined by an enormous wealth in land\" and attempted to \"turn land into money\" through land-based credit or land-based currency. The Debt Recovery Act of 1732, we are told, formalized the \"ability of creditors to foreclose on American land\"; without it, lending on land would have been almost impossible. Mr. Bird cites Claire Priest's excellent \"Credit Nation: Property Laws and Institutions in Early America\" (2021), the book to read on colonial financial institutions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While Mr. Bird discusses at length a failed Massachusetts land bank's misadventures with printing mortgage-backed currency, Mr. Albertus doesn't even mention the assignat, issued during the French Revolution and backed by land taken from church and crown. Instead, Mr. Albertus's discussion of the French Revolution focuses on how, \"with the abolition of feudalism, the breakup of large properties, and the end of noble and clerical privileges rooted in land ownership, France ushered in a new age of emancipation and individual equality.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mr. Albertus is right that the French Revolution was a \"turning point in human history,\" not merely the event that gave us the assignat. He is right, too, about the importance of redistributing farmland. But I am less sure about his claim that, because of a growing 19th-century population, \"land's connection to power became ironclad.\" Land and power were linked in most agricultural societies. Mr. Albertus's statement that \"who held power in this world depended on the land they held\" seems far truer before 1800 than afterward. The battleship and the maxim gun, not the English countryside, empowered the Victorian imperialists.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mr. Albertus also argues that the struggle over land ownership has produced \"racial hierarchy, gender inequity, underdevelopment and environmental degradation.\" Maybe. The conquest of the Americas and the use of enslaved labor for farming was indeed catastrophic for Africans and Native Americans, but Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and Idaho were the first four states to give women the vote. Farming the Amazon is still producing \"environmental destruction on a massive scale\" but, as Mr. Bird's chapter on Singapore reminds us, development can soar without land as long as there are strong property rights and accessible, excellent schools.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mr. Bird also discusses land redistribution, from the incremental version favored by Henry George, the 19th-century American political economist, to the violent reforms implemented by Mao Zedong in China. George's \"Progress and Poverty\" (1879), Mr. Bird suggests, was \"quite possibly the most influential piece of political writing of an entire century.\" George argued that the woes of the world could be solved by a single tax on land. Such a proposal might not have been Maoist in scale, but it was still land redistribution: \"We shall be all the more ready to listen seriously to Mr. George,\" a London Times article declared, \"when he desists from proposing that in order to re-establish peace and good will on earth we shall begin by appropriating the property of others.\" Moreover, George's single tax targeted valuable urban land far more than most land reforms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mr. Bird, like Mr. Albertus, takes a generally positive view about land redistribution in Japan and Taiwan, and he treats as a hero Wolf Ladejinsky, the American economist who argued that widespread land ownership improves the incentive to farm well. Mr. Bird notes that while \"the results of the land reform programs in East Asia are the subject of a lively historical debate,\" they deserve some credit for \"avoiding the bleak outcomes of collectivization in the countries that fell under the control of communists.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mr. Bird sees these land-reform efforts \"to reshape the ownership, distribution and use of agricultural land\" as a thing of the past: \"The combination of the agricultural transformation delivered by the Green Revolution, combined with political pressure from both the left and right, brought Ladejinsky's struggle to a functional end even before his death\" in 1975. Mr. Albertus disagrees, arguing that \"the same dynamics\" that once \"forced land to be reallocated are still present today.\" This difference reflects differences between Mr. Bird's East Asian perspective and Mr. Albertus's developing-world lens. Agricultural land and land reform remain a big deal in the poorer parts of the planet, but actual acreage becomes increasingly irrelevant as societies acquire wealth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These geographic differences also explain why the back halves of the two books are so different. Mr. Albertus travels from Bolivia to South Africa to give us a rich catalog of land-reform efforts. A Colombian initiative encouraged gender equity with \"joint titling to couples and prioritized women at risk.\" In postapartheid South Africa, land restitution, often with public funds and land, \"contributed to restoration and reconciliation.\" Mr. Albertus is an excellent guide to these changing landscapes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But even if we accept Mr. Albertus's view that \"our lives today are determined by the choices that were made when the land shifted hands\" over the past two centuries, it does not follow that shifting land around is more effective an antipoverty tool than, say, investing in education or urban sanitation. Mr. Albertus's own work, cited by Mr. Bird, finds that \"land reform actually lowered levels of human capital accumulation\" in Peru and that \"under certain conditions it also has the potential to stunt urbanization, wealth accumulation, and ultimately education by encouraging land reform beneficiaries to remain in the countryside and employ their children on the farm rather than migrating to urban areas where opportunities for upward mobility are greater.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The back end of Mr. Bird's book is a romp through the real-estate convulsions of Asia and the U.S. The author takes us back to the mountains of debt that fueled speculators of the early American republic; Michael Blaakman's \"Speculation Nation\" (2023) provides the authoritative treatment of that mania. Mr. Bird emphasizes that land is easy to borrow against because \"it is both immobile and extremely durable.\" Unlike a factory built to make a particular product, land is easy to repurpose — which makes foreclosed land easy to sell.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We learn that Henry Fok, \"a Hong Kong real estate tycoon,\" provided the road map for real-estate funded urban growth in China. As Mr. Bird tells us, Fok explained to Zhao Ziyang, China's premier in the 1980s, that in Hong Kong \"the government owned all of the land and funded its own capital expenditures with an extensive land-leasing program.\" As a result, \"Shenzhen's model of financing itself\" through real estate \"was adopted practically wholesale from the British colony.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Missing from both books is a serious discussion about the connection between property rights and the value and use of land. The powers of a landowner can range from the almost full sovereignty enjoyed by a mighty feudal noble to the essentially nonexistent rights I have over the protected swampland outside my window. Over the past 60 years, the nature of land ownership in the U.S. has changed because land-use regulations have increasingly limited the right to build. In 1763, William Pitt the Elder trumpeted the rights of the small English landholder: \"The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown. It may be frail — its roof may shake — the wind may blow through it — the storm may enter — the rain may enter — but the King of England cannot enter — all his forces dare not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement.\" That proud sentiment, linking freedom with land, feels increasingly untrue.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Mr. Glaeser is a professor of economics at Harvard and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.</span></li></ul></span></div></div>",

He added that such behavior has prompted packaged-goods makers to boost promotions, helping offset higher prices across the industry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The pullback is most apparent among the company's value-oriented and midpriced brands, Wallace said. \"In the U.S., we still see the premium and super premium growing very, very nicely.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Colgate-Palmolive said prices across its portfolio were up 2.3% from a year earlier, offsetting lower volumes and boosting sales.
