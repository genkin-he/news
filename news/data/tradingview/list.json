It will be released in Japan on November 13, 2025, and will subsequently be available in Taiwan, Indonesia, and Singapore.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This device is equipped with the high-performance SoC \"Snapdragon(R) 7s Gen 3 Mobile Platform\", which improves CPU performance by approximately 20 %, GPU performance by approximately 40 %, and AI performance by approximately 30 % compared to the SoC of the previous model (*2). This ensures smooth and comfortable use whether for gaming, video playback, or enhanced AI functions. With the energy-efficient Pro IGZO OLED display and a large-capacity 5,000 mAh battery, users can enjoy up to two days of usage with 10 hours of daily use from a full charge (*3).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The camera features advanced AI correction functions praised in the high-end \"AQUOS R10\". The AI functionality that automatically removes unwanted shadows in photos has been further enhanced. In addition to \"Cooking\" and \"Text\" modes, a new \"Showcase Mode\" has been added, which reduces reflections when photographing objects through glass. The AI image synthesis processing technology also enhances detail fidelity when zooming or using night mode. Users can enjoy high-quality photography from close-ups to ultra-wide angles. Additionally, the new AI function \"Vocalist\" improves call quality. By registering their own voice, users can enable the AI to identify and cut out any voices or background noise during calls, ensuring only their voice is transmitted clearly to the other party, achieving comfortable and engaging conversations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The color variations feature a lineup of six colors inspired by fashion trends. The main color, Denim Navy, evokes the hue of denim fabric combined with leather patches, reminiscent of jeans. The device's compact size and lightweight design (approximately 166 g) meet MIL-STD-810H standards (impact resistance meets MIL-STD-810G), ensuring reliable use in daily life with water resistance and shock resistance (*4).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Outstanding Features</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1. Achieves a smooth and comfortable user experience with high-performance SoC</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2. New AI features enhance camera quality and call clarity</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>3. Offers six color variations inspired by fashion trends</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>*1 The information described in this news release is for the product to be marketed in Japan. Release dates and device specifications will vary depending on the country and region where the product is sold.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>*2 Comparison with the SoC \"Snapdragon(R) 7s Gen 2 Mobile Platform\" used in the 2024 model AQUOS sense9.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>*3 This estimate is based on proprietary criteria assuming a total usage of 10 hours per day, comprising 4 hours of video streaming, 3 hours of music streaming, 2 hours of social media browsing, and 1 hour of gaming. Actual battery life may vary depending on the usage environment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>*4 Tests have been conducted in accordance with 15 criteria of the U.S. Department of Defense procurement standards (MIL-STD-810H), including waterproofing (immersion), waterproofing (raindrops), vibration resistance, humidity resistance, high-temperature storage (fixed and variable), high-temperature operation (fixed and variable), low-temperature operation, low-temperature storage, temperature endurance (thermal shock), low-pressure storage, low-pressure operation, icing (condensation), and icing (freezing). Testing has also been performed in accordance with the U.S. Department of Defense procurement standards (MIL-STD-810G) for shock resistance (drop). The performance of this product has been verified under testing conditions. Operation of all functions in every situation during actual use is not guaranteed. Furthermore, it does not guarantee that the device will remain undamaged or malfunction-free against all shocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Main Features</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1. Achieves a smooth and comfortable user experience with high-performance SoC</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The device is equipped with high-performance SoC \"Snapdragon(R) 7s Gen 3 Mobile Platform\". Compared to the SoC of the previous model, it offers approximately 20 % improvement in CPU performance, approximately 40 % in GPU performance, and approximately 30 % in AI performance, ensuring smooth and comfortable operation even in scenarios requiring advanced processing, such as AI functions. The display features Pro IGZO OLED technology, which automatically adjusts the refresh rate between 1-Hz and 120-Hz. It supports a maximum of 240-Hz equivalent motion (*5) and boasts a peak brightness of 1,500 nits for excellent visibility outdoors. Moreover, with the energy-efficient Pro IGZO OLED display and a large-capacity 5,000 mAh battery, users can enjoy up to two days of use with 10 hours of daily usage from a full charge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>*5 In apps with smooth high-speed display and game settings registered in the gaming menu turned on, the display is updated 120 times per second while a black screen is inserted between frames. This realizes the display state change to achieve 240 times per second, four times as fast as when these settings are turned OFF (the display state changes 60 times per second). Depending on the specifications of the application, 4x speed (240-Hz) display may not be possible.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2. New AI features enhance camera quality and call clarity</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the first time in the \"AQUOS sense\" series, the device features an AI function that automatically removes shadows during food and text photography. Additionally, a new \"Showcase Mode\" has been introduced, which reduces reflections from glass and aquariums. This allows users to take photos with their desired compositions without worrying about reflections, eliminating the need for post-editing. Furthermore, text capture includes both shadow removal and correction for trapezoidal distortion, making images easier to read.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The device features a high-quality camera system equivalent to the \"AQUOS R10\" and supports AI image synthesis technology. By processing images with more information than RAW data, it significantly enhances detail and tonal gradation during zoom or night mode photography. Additionally, it is equipped with a 50.3 MP standard and wide-angle camera. The standard camera's 1/1.55-inch image sensor reduces noise in low-light conditions, allowing for beautifully captured night scenes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Additionally, the new AI function \"Vocalist\" improves call quality. By registering their voice, users can enable the AI to identify and cut out other people's voices or background noise during calls, ensuring that only their voice is transmitted to the other party. This allows for comfortable conversations even in noisy environments, without worrying about location.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>3. Offers six color variations inspired by fashion trends</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The device's body colors are inspired by three fashion styles: \"Casual\", \"Kireime\", and \"Basic\". Users can choose from a rich selection of six colors, including Denim Navy, which evokes the hue of jeans. Additionally, alongside the launch of this model, official cases will be available. There will be six silicone cases that match the device colors, as well as special cases created in collaboration with the sneaker brand \"SPINGLE\". Furthermore, Sharp-certified accessories will feature cases designed with denim fabric in collaboration with denim brands \"KOJIMA GENES(R)\" and \"BLUE SAKURA\".</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other Features</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dual Box Speakers</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the first time in the \"AQUOS sense\" series, the smartphone features box speakers on the top and bottom, delivering a 25 % increase in perceived sound pressure and an 85 % increase in bass sound pressure compared to the previous model (*6).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>*6 Comparison with the 2024 model AQUOS sense9.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>New Photo Style Filters</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Eight new \"PHOTO STYLE filters\" curated by professional photographers have been added, including Evening Glow, Cool Night, Cafe and Bar, Summer Colors, Cinema Film, Monochrome, Heisei POP, and Showa Retro.

The Jays MLB playoff run is likely to provide a lift in October, says BMO Capital Markets' Benjamin Reitzes. That may offer some support after Statistics Canada estimated GDP edged up 0.1% in September, following an unexpected 0.3% contraction in August. Major sports and entertainment events often sway economic indicators, at the edges at least. The rare appearance of five of Canada's National Hockey League teams in the playoffs boosted attendance at arenas and lifted activity for the arts, entertainment and recreation industry in April, while the Toronto leg of Taylor Swift's blockbuster tour drove a temporary acceleration in hotel inflation last November.

One of the biggest questions patients have after surgery is: \"What foods can I eat?\" Your diet plays a big role in how quickly and comfortably you heal after wisdom teeth removal. Eating the right foods can help prevent irritation, reduce discomfort, and support the recovery of your mouth, gums, and jaw to full health. Here's a guide to what you should eat and what foods to avoid after wisdom teeth removal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Best foods to eat after wisdom teeth removal</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>After your wisdom teeth are removed, your mouth may be sensitive and irritated by certain types of food. These options will give you the nutrients and food you need to recover without damaging or causing pain around the extraction sites:1</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Soft dairy products</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yogurt, pudding, or cottage cheese can serve as a source of protein and calcium to support recovery. Colder foods may also feel soothing around the surgical site and against swollen gums.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Mashed potatoes and soft vegetables</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pureed carrots, soft-cooked squash, and mashed potatoes are easy to chew and swallow post-surgery, and they provide essential vitamins your body needs to help heal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Smoothies and shakes</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Blended smoothies and milkshakes aren't just a sweet treat as a reward for making it through surgery. Including leafy greens like spinach or kale or adding protein powder can also make them a great source of nutrition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Scrambled eggs</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking for an easy breakfast after oral surgery? Scrambled eggs are soft, easy to eat, and quick to prepare when you're too exhausted to cook.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Applesauce and pureed fruit</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Applesauce and other fruit cups are gentle on your gums, making them a great sweet treat post-surgery.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Foods to avoid after wisdom teeth removal</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>With how sensitive your mouth is after wisdom teeth surgery, it's important to be aware of what foods you shouldn't eat. Not only may these options cause pain and discomfort, but they might also prolong the recovery process:2</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Crunchy or hard foods</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chips, popcorn, nuts, or raw vegetables can scrape against your healing gums or get stuck in extraction sites, causing irritation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Sticky candies</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Caramel, gum, and sweet candies may taste good, but they can also irritate sensitive areas and leave residue that attracts bacteria.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Spicy foods</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even if you pride yourself on handling all levels of spice, consider sticking to more neutral foods during recovery. Spicy foods can irritate your gums and increase swelling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Acidic foods</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Citrus, like oranges and grapefruits, along with other acidic foods like tomatoes, can sting sensitive areas and cause discomfort.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Alcohol</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alcohol can interfere with the healing process and may interact negatively with pain medication. Stick to other drinks like water or unsweetened tea until you're fully recovered.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Pick the right choices for a speedy recovery</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Understanding how your diet affects your oral health is always important, but after oral surgery, the right foods can ease your pain and make the recovery process easier. This extends beyond just the food you eat, as certain practices like using a straw can dislodge blood clots in the extraction area. Adjusting your diet during recovery may be annoying, but your mouth will thank you in the long run.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Contact Information:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Name: Sonakshi Murze</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Email: Sonakshi.murze@iquanti.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Job Title: Manager</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>SOURCE:</span></strong><span> iQuanti</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire</span></p></span></div></div>",

To date, Rio Tinto has incurred exploration-related expenses of USD 4.73 million on the Project, having completed multiple programmes of surface mapping and geochemical sampling, ground-based geophysics and four diamond drill holes.  This decision follows Rio Tinto's prior notification to the Company of its decision to exercise its Stage 1 earn-in rights under the JV agreement (as announced on 10 July 2025).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aterian will now regain control of the Project, and the Company believes this provides an exceptional opportunity to unlock the broader value of the licence area, where significant tantalum, niobium and lithium mineralisation potential remains untested. The Company may now directly capitalise on the extensive exploration investment already completed and maximise the full critical mineral potential of HCK-including high-grade tantalum and niobium systems that have historically supported local artisanal mining.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Key Points:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·   </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Full control of the Project is returned to Aterian</span></strong><span>, following Rio Tinto's investment in early-stage exploration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·     </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>High-grade lithium drill intersection recorded:</span></strong><span> 6.90m at 2.11% Li₂O, including 3.45m at 3.20% Li₂O.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·    </span><span>Mining optionality exists for development of broader mineral systems: extensive tantalum, niobium, and lithium targets remain to be advanced.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·     </span><span>Immediate benefit to Aterian shareholders arising from the Company inheriting the complete exploration dataset and drilling results at no additional cost.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The cessation of the HCK JV is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's near-term operations. Rather, Aterian views the regained control and dataset as a strategic opportunity to capture the full project value and to continue building its position as the only LSE-listed company with an operating presence, including a mineral trading facility, in Rwanda.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aterian Chairman, Charles Bray, commented,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Aterian wishes to express its sincere appreciation to Rio Tinto for its collaboration, technical expertise, and the high-quality work completed on the Project. While Rio Tinto's strategic decision reflects its requirement to focus solely on world-class, tier-one lithium deposits, its considerable spend at HCK has delivered us a fully funded exploration database, enhanced geological knowledge and clear optionality over multiple critical minerals. The return of ownership of HCK marks an opportunity for Aterian to unlock value on our own terms especially through dedicated tantalum and niobium mining. Rio Tinto's exploration programme provides a springboard to assess and develop the tantalum-niobium potential within the licence area.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Christopher Mims</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There's a paradox at the heart of modern AI: The kinds of sophisticated models that companies are using to get real work done and reduce head count aren't the ones getting all the attention.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ever-more-powerful frontier and reasoning models continue to nab headlines for smashing cognitive records. They're passing legal and medical licensing exams, and winning math olympiads. Leaders of major artificial-intelligence labs — from OpenAI's Sam Altman and Anthropic's Dario Amodei to Demis Hassabis of Google-owned DeepMind and Elon Musk at xAI — talk about a future of \"AGI,\" artificial general intelligence, in which AIs are as smart as humans.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Supposedly, these AI megabrains are the ones coming for all our jobs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But when you talk to chief executives at companies that currently rely on AI day in and day out, you hear a different story. For the overwhelming majority of tasks, it's not the biggest and smartest AI models, but the most simplistic that are winning the day. These unsung heroes of AI, the ones actually transforming business processes and workforces, also happen to be the smallest, fastest and cheapest.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The reality is, for many of the operations that we need computing for today, we don't need large language models,\" says Kyle Lo, a research scientist who builds open-source large language models at the nonprofit Allen Institute for AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI-powered companies have found success by building their software and services more like an assembly line of AI: Information goes in one end, and data, actions or products come out the other. In between, many smaller, simpler, more specialized, faster and cheaper-to-operate AIs are doing all the work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Companies that need to get real work done with so-called AI agents, on a large scale, are finding that \"small language models\" are more than good enough to power them. What's more, companies are realizing that they have no choice but to use these small language models, because they are more affordable, and in some cases better suited to the tasks at hand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is how the future of agentic AI is being built, one workflow at a time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Building the AI factory</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It might look like AI-powered systems are becoming more capable because the underlying AI models are becoming smarter. The biggest AI models certainly are advancing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In many cases, though, the truth about corporate productivity gains is that the impact AI is having — on competitiveness, jobs and the like — is the result of human engineers getting better at stitching together smaller, simpler AIs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aurelian is a Seattle-based startup that uses generative AI to automate responses to nonemergency calls to 911 centers. New York City-based Hark Audio uses AI to identify, clip and collect memorable moments from the world's half a million or so active podcasts. In San Francisco, Gong uses AI to scan and digest every call its customers' sales reps have ever recorded, to help them sell more. And Airbnb uses AI — including open-source models from China's Alibaba — to automatically resolve a significant portion of customer-service issues faster than its human representatives can.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even Meta uses small AI models in this way. In its most recent earnings call, finance chief Susan Li said that when it comes to delivering ads, the company doesn't use its biggest AI models, \"because their size and complexity makes it too cost prohibitive.\" Instead, Meta uses its big models to transfer the requisite knowledge about targeting ads to smaller, more lightweight, specialized models that are used in production.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What all these companies have in common is that they have built internal knowledge factories that daisy chain together small, simple, fast AIs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a factory, widgets travel down a conveyor belt, and workers tweak those widgets along the way. In what you might call an AI knowledge factory, chunks of data flow through pipelines of conventional software and are handed from one simple-minded AI to the next, with each one altering, sorting or transforming it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In this analogy, the conveyor belt is made of conventional software — those tried-and-true existing pathways for data, which many companies have built up over years, or even decades. And the workers along the conveyor belt are AI tools powered by small language models.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a group of researchers from Nvidia and the Georgia Institute of Technology wrote in a recent paper, the rise of AI agents (like our assembly line workers) is \"ushering in a mass of applications in which language models perform a small number of specialized tasks repetitively and with little variation.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Small language models, they wrote, are \"sufficiently powerful, inherently more suitable, and necessarily more economical\" for such work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI in action</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gong, which helps its clients sell more stuff, is an illustrative example. Company co-founder Eilon Reshef says its customers — which include Google and Cisco — might ask its conversational AI questions like, \"Why am I losing deals?\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To answer, Gong uses a mix of costlier, more advanced AI tools and smaller, less expensive ones. Its systems assign tougher tasks to more advanced models. Think of it like a manager delegating tasks to workers with different degrees of expertise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gong's software typically starts by sending the user's question — in this case, \"Why are my sales declining?\" — to one of the \"smart\" AI models from the likes of Anthropic or OpenAI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The initial prompt includes a request for the AI to come up with a broad plan to answer the question. Because those smart models are expensive — and take longer to \"think\" about questions — Gong uses them as little as possible.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Once a frontier reasoning model, the largest of the large language models, spits out a high-level plan, Gong's software pipeline springs to life. First, it combs through what can be tens of thousands of recorded sales calls with customers. Then Gong uses smaller language models to summarize the conversations surfaced by that search. Next, yet another language model can scan those summaries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the end of this process, all of this data is handed back to one of the smart, slow, expensive frontier AIs, which transforms it into a report. This report outlines, in a way that would normally require hundreds of hours of work by a smart human, what's working and what isn't, across all the sales calls a company is having.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You might use the cheapest LLM to find out if a conversation is relevant, a reasonably cheap LLM to find the right information inside it, and then maybe a more-expensive frontier model to come up with the action document,\" says Reshef.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Faster, cheaper AI</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The difference in cost between the biggest and most sophisticated models and the smallest and cheapest is huge. Using an industry-standard weighted average, OpenAI's smallest, fastest model, GPT-5 Nano, costs around 10 cents per million tokens, while the full-fledged, more sophisticated GPT-5 costs around $3.44 per million tokens. Tokens are the basic units of text that AI processes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What's more, big models can sometimes use thousands of times as many tokens to complete a task, as they burn through them in an internal monologue they use to reason through an answer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's important to note that when it comes to AI models, \"smallest and least smart\" doesn't mean least capable. Indeed, small models can be tuned — either as part of their training process or, increasingly, through elaborate prompts — to behave in a way that is specialized for the task at hand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The giant LLM models are incredibly smart, but they don't offer us an efficient way to leverage our unique proprietary data, or a way to incorporate feedback from our editors,\" says Don MacKinnon, chief executive of Hark Audio. The team at Hark has spent years creating a library of tens of thousands of clips of podcasts selected and edited by humans, which the company's engineers used to fine-tune a customized AI that can now automate that entire process.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Across all the companies I've spoken with about their use of small models, there is a remarkable consistency in how they structure their systems. This suggests that there are only so many ways to build AI agents that actually, consistently work — and that nearly all of them include small language models.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Christopher Mims at christopher.mims@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

And it can be especially overwhelming if you're on a tight schedule, or traveling with young children and older family members.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition to being time-consuming and often stressful, the long trip from curb to departure gate isn't something all fliers are physically prepared to handle. And it isn't just those with mobility issues — some travelers just have difficulty trekking through long airport corridors with their gear.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We're all aging while our airports are getting bigger,\" says Ty Osbaugh, principal architect at Gensler, the architectural firm behind dozens of new airport terminals, including one that opened in September at San Diego International Airport.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To help fliers navigate these behemoths, airlines and airports have added improved signage, interactive maps and digital displays showing estimated walking times to departure gates. They've also updated their apps with better maps and flight information.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But as airports around the world become ever larger and more complex, interest is growing in more-personalized assistance programs that promise a less-painful airport experience for travelers who are willing to pay.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Offered by airlines and other companies for a fee, these services may include perks like personal concierges, assistance with luggage, expedited security access, access to VIP lounges and more — and in many cases you don't have to be a first-class passenger, frequent flier or premium credit-card holder to book them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paul Tumpowsky, chief revenue officer of Fora Travel, a travel agency, says he almost always recommends that his clients use some sort of airport-assistance service. It can be pricey, depending on the services you choose, but it is usually worth it, he says. \"Coming off a crowded plane at a strange airport, nothing beats seeing someone holding a sign with your name on it,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here is a closer look at some of the services available:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Airline add-ons</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At least three major U.S. airlines — Delta, United and American — and Air France and British Airways are among the carriers that offer premium hand-holding services for passengers at key airports.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Delta's Delta VIP Select program is available in 11 of its domestic hubs, including New York (at LaGuardia and JFK), Los Angeles, Atlanta and Minneapolis. The service includes a guide to take you through the airport, help with check-in and baggage, complimentary access to Delta's Sky Club lounges and in some locations a private car to take you straight to the plane. Prices start at $550 for the first passenger, and $100 for each additional flier per trip.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>United passengers can get VIP treatment at the airport through the airline's Signature Service program, available at 21 airports in the U.S. and abroad. A greeter will meet you at the curb, accompany you through security and get you inside the airline's club, starting at around $250 a person.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Air France offers a range of concierge services at Paris Charles de Gaulle for prices starting at $350 a person. British Airways offers its fliers access to an airport concierge through a partnership with Diamond Air. It can be particularly useful for travelers flying in and out of airline's base at Heathrow Airport, which has the most flight connections of any airport in the world. The service will send someone to meet you upon arrival, escort you through immigration and customs and take you to your connecting flight. Prices vary.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>American Airlines' Five Star Service program, meanwhile, is available only to passengers traveling in business or first class. It is offered at 22 U.S. and international airports, including New York, Los Angeles, London and Tokyo, for $350 for the first person, $100 per additional adult and $50 per child.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Of course, for fliers whose main concern is mobility, airlines operating in the U.S. are required to provide transportation to and from gates via wheelchair at no additional charge for those who need it. Airlines suggest you request wheelchair assistance when you book your flight or up to 48 hours before departure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Concierge companies</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Travelers who want a personal airport guide also can work with separate concierge companies, some of which have contracts with big airports around the world.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Their airport sherpas will help you avoid lines at check-in, escort you to a fast-track security lane, get you into a VIP lounge and take you to your gate when it's time to board. If you're arriving from abroad, they can meet you at your arrival gate and help you through customs. In some places this service could include transfers by limo directly to the waiting aircraft.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Providers include the Queen of Clubs, offered by a boutique luxury-travel company in several European countries, including the U.K. and France, as well as larger networks such as Perq Soleil and Royal Airport Concierge, which are in hundreds of airports worldwide. Prices vary; a meet-and-greet or a transfer service at major international gateways in Europe and Asia could range from $250 to more than $500 a person.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A newer arrival in this business is Clear Concierge, a new service from Clear, the ID security firm that speeds fliers through security checkpoints faster by verifying their identify for an annual fee. The company is now offering Clear members a personal escort who will take them from curb through security for $99, to a wider array of services that will get them all the way to the departure gate for $179. It's being rolled out at 23 major U.S. airports, including Denver International, Orlando and Salt Lake City.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Luxury offerings</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For a true splurge, a small number of clubs can offer passengers flying commercial a whiff of the private-jet lifestyle, bypassing the hated airport experience altogether.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the U.S., the PS brand (for private suite) offers fliers a sanctuary in the form of a separate terminal away from the main airport. There, travelers get full lounge amenities and can check their luggage, get a boarding pass and clear security and customs privately. Michael Holtz, CEO of travel firm SmartFlyer who uses the service often, says a private car service takes passengers to and from the lounge and the plane, which they board or disembark from via the jetway stairs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>PS is available in Los Angeles and Atlanta and plans to add locations in Miami, Dallas and Paris.
