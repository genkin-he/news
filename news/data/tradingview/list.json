(\"Silverco\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to report assay results from its 5,500-metre 2024 diamond drill program at the Company's 100%-owned and </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>permitted Cusi Property</span></strong><span> (\"Cusi\"), located approximately 90 kilometres northwest of the Los Gatos Mine in Chihuahua, Mexico.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Cusi Mine was in commercial production until September 2023, when it was placed on care and maintenance. The property has seen limited modern exploration, and results from the 2024 drill campaign represent </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>a step change in both size and grade potential</span></strong><span> of the mineralized system. Building on these results, Silverco is advancing a 15,000-metre 2025 drill program, with initial assays expected in the fourth quarter of 2025. The Company's objective is to convert this new geological understanding into an expanded, higher-grade resource base to support possible restart of operations as soon as H2 2026, subject to technical studies, financing, permitting and a positive restart decision.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Mark Ayranto, CEO of Silverco, commented</span></strong><span>:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"When we acquired the Cusi Mine in early 2024, we recognized the untapped potential of the San Miguel Vein within the inset claims which we were able to acquire concurrently through an additional transaction. Our initial 2024 drill program has confirmed significant, open-ended resource potential that we are now actively expanding. We believe the San Miguel Vein can underpin a higher-grade production profile upon the planned mine restart in H2 2026.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Perhaps even more significant is our interpretation that all major mined veins at Cusi may continue within a down-thrown block to the northeast. This model was validated by the recent discovery of </span><span>519 g/t AgEq over 3.2 metres in a 200-metre step-out hole at the Eduwiges Extension. This marks the third vein with open mineralization confirmed in extension drilling. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Cusi has the </span><span>potential to be substantially larger and higher grade than previously recognized.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Two drill rigs are currently active on these targets, and we anticipate the first results from the ongoing 2025 program in November.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Details of the 2024 Drill Program</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The 2024 program consisted of 14 diamond drill holes, totaling 5,518 metres. The 2024 program was primarily focused on testing the down-dip plunge of historical drilling on the consolidated San Miguel inset claims and testing the extension of Eduwiges to the east of the Cusi fault. Drilling was performed from surface by a local contractor, utilizing portable drill rigs. All core was HQ in size.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Figure 1: 2024 Drill Program Collar Locations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/10393/272520_f48493a1040a88a6_002full.jpg</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>San Miguel Vein - Inset Claims Target</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>With the acquisition of the Cusi Property, the Company additionally acquired and consolidated two inset claims along the San Miguel vein system. This area has a small open pit mine at surface (~30 m depth) and minor underground workings from historical mining, assumed to be pre-2000s.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Historical drilling, conducted in 2006 and 2007, targeted approximately 30 m below the open pit and returned excellent results, including hole DC07B077 which hit 482 g/t Ag over 7.5 m and DC06B030 which returned 390 g/t Ag over 7.0 m. No drilling was completed after 2007 as the ownership of the claims was subsequently disputed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The 2024 drilling in this area targeted the interpreted, high-grade, down-plunge extension of the San Miguel vein system, which had never been drilled. The objective was to test the continuity of the structure within the Company's recently acquired inset claims. A strike length of approximately 250 m was drilled over the vein with the deepest intercept at 250 m below surface. This drilling was on average 175 m below the historical intercepts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The San Miguel vein system was hit in the majority of the drill holes, with the best intercept in </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>CU-24-08</span></strong><span> with </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>7.5 metres of 364 g/t AgEq.</span></strong><span> Hole CU-24-08 was the deepest intercept of the program highlighting that the vein system is currently open at depth and increasing in width. Other intercepts of note are highlighted in Figure 2 and Table 1. The system remains completely open at depth and along strike. Another ore shoot directly to the east of this drilling remains open as well, with only historical, near surface drilling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Figure 2: San Miguel Long Section, +/- 150 m, Looking WNW</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/10393/272520_f48493a1040a88a6_003full.jpg</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The mineralization at the San Miguel vein system is hosted within a sequence of rhyolite lapilli tuff. The host rock is characterized by strong to moderate silicification and local oxidation and chlorite alteration, indicating a significant hydrothermal system was active in the area.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The mineralized structures consist of a series of steeply-dipping, parallel veins, primarily presenting as a hydrothermal breccia. This breccia is a fractured and cemented rock, with fragments of the host rock and angular quartz clasts cemented by silica. Vein widths are variable, ranging from less than 1.0 m to exceeding 5.0 m, and are steeply dipping at 70-80o.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Eduwiges Downthrown Block Target</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>This portion of the 2024 program was designed to test the interpreted fault-displaced, or \"downthrown,\" continuation of the Eduwiges vein system. This downthrown extension was previously discovered and partially mined in the Promontorio zone (Figure 4) where deeper drilling has shown both lateral and vertical continuity past existing workings. Similarly, surface exploration drilling at the San Juan system (Figure 5) in 2021 also intersected this key structural feature.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hole </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>CU-24-10C </span></strong><span>successfully intersected the Eduwiges vein structure to the east of the Cusi fault, returning </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>3.2 metres of 519 g/t AgEq.</span></strong><span> This intercept is a 200 metre step out from historical workings at Eduwiges 190 m from hole </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>CU-24-05</span></strong><span> intercept of </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>2.5 metres of 265 g/t AgEq</span></strong><span>. Historical drilling in the area was unable to successfully target the vein. This intercept confirms the Company's structural model and provides a new, deeper exploration horizon that is predicted to host the same high-grade potential as its shallow, un-faulted counterpart, on all the vein systems on the Cusi property.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Figure 3: Eduwiges Long Section +/- 100 m (mine as-built unclipped), Looking NNW</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/10393/272520_f48493a1040a88a6_004full.jpg</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Cusi Downthrown Block Targets</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company's exploration target is based on a structural model which suggests a significant post-mineral fault has displaced all the vein systems on the property to the east of the Cusi fault. This means the downthrown block, while occurring at a deeper elevation relative to surface, represents the same favorable relative elevation within the overall epithermal mineral system. This structural understanding indicates the continued potential for the same high-grade silver mineralization found in the un-faulted portions of the deposit. A conceptual exploration model is provided in Figure 4, with the Promontorio underground workings reference for scale.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The previous project owner had discovered this structural continuation east of the Cusi fault in the Promontorio vein system, mining a portion of the first downthrown extension. Exploration drilling at Promontorio shows that the vein system continues, however only limited step out drilling has been performed. This drilling had outlined historical intercepts such as DC21M837 with 8.1 m of 286 g/t AgEq, DC17B718 with 4.2 m of 834 g/t AgEq, and DC17B757 with 3.5 m @ 361 g/t AgEq. The Company plans on following up on these results through underground drilling at Promontorio.

Nick Horsley, Chief ExecutiveOfficer of Hi-View, commented: “This latest phase of work at GoldenStranger has given us a much clearer framework for defining drilltargets. The new data confirms that gold, silver and coppermineralization is strongly linked to structural intersections along awell-defined corridor, and several of these areas now stand out ashigh-impact drill targets. These findings mark a pivotal step forwardfor Hi-View as we transition from regional data collection to targeteddrilling designed to expand and discover mineralization across theproject. New Geophysical data has now created new areas of interest on theGolden Stranger which warrant further exploration.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Highlights of the Summary Include:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Nine preliminary drillholes are planned to test the main GoldenStranger mineralized corridor and new copper-gold anomalies identifiedduring the 2025 fieldwork. </span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Structural mapping confirmed two dominant joint and vein orientations,north-northwest with secondary west-northwest structures, which can beused to optimise drill targets.

The main shear(faults) and orientation of a mineralized rhyolite dyke that intrudesthrough the main zone is 350°/51-56° (Figure 2). Secondarystructures, or antithetic faults, are oriented 309°/70°. These typesof synthetic/antithetic fault systems are common in horst and grabenstyle structural regimes like in the Toodoggone District. Historicaldrilling and trenching shows zones of high and low grade intersectionsalong the targeted primary fault direction, which can be explained bymineralization being concentrated along antithetic fault sets and oreshoots (Figure 3).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Click Image To View Full Size</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Figure 1: Golden Stranger 2025 structural data of veins and jointsmeasured in 2025 showing the main structural trends.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Click Image To View Full Size</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Figure 2: Golden Stranger 2025 structural data of faults and a rhyolitedyke contact that is associated with the main zone mineralizationtrend</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Click Image To View Full Size</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Figure 3: Schematic of structural regime at Golden Stranger.Mineralization localized along secondary structures and oreshoots</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Golden Stranger Main Ore ZoneDetails</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Main Zone hosts semi-continuous mineralizationoutlined by historical drilling and trenching over a 270-metre strike,averaging 4–7 metres true width to a depth of 80 metres (Figures3–4). Mineralization appears locally discontinuous along the main350° trend, likely due to concentration along secondary structuresand intersections spaced roughly 60 metres apart.
