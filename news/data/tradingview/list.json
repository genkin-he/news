However, a further bid from the streaming giant is expected, Badcock says. Moreover, it isn't clear that Paramount will be able to return with a higher offer, Badcock adds. \"They seem to have passed the ability to pay, but they don't seem to have run out of willingness to pay.\" (josephmichael.stonor@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

The Company raised £12 million in its IPO via a placing and subscription at 200p per share and was admitted to trading on AIM with a market capitalisation of approximately £13.6 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vulcan Two's stated strategy at the time of IPO was to lead the consolidation of the private prescription sector of the regulated UK ePharmacy market, one of the fastest growing and most profitable sectors of the market. The Group's CEO and COO, Michael Kraftman and Brendan O'Brien, have significant experience in the eCommerce healthcare sector, having built Vision Direct, one of Europe's leading online contact lens suppliers between 2009 and 2021, through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. The Directors believe that a similar opportunity for growth and consolidation currently exists in the UK ePharmacy market, and, at the time of IPO in September 2025, they had identified a pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since IPO, the Directors have progressed conversations with certain acquisition targets from this acquisition pipeline and Vulcan Two has now entered into conditional share sale and purchase agreements with all of the shareholders of three companies, being CloudRx, Webmed and Hyperdrug, which the Directors intend to acquire simultaneously. The Directors believe that the Targets are each high-quality businesses that bring attractive assets and capabilities that can be leveraged across the Enlarged Group. Furthermore, the Directors believe the formation of the Enlarged Group creates a market presence and a platform from which the Company can pursue its objective of building the UK's leading regulated ePharmacy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is proposed that the Targets will be acquired for an aggregate consideration of up to approximately £41.7 million, the significant majority of which will be settled in cash. The Acquisitions, individually and collectively, will constitute a Reverse Takeover. In order to fund the consideration for the Acquisitions, the Company intends to raise gross proceeds of approximately £40.0 million by way of a Placing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company is currently an \"investing company\" under the AIM Rules for Companies. On completion of the Acquisitions and upon Readmission, the Company will become an operating company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Information on the Targets</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CloudRx</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CloudRx is a digital prescription platform and fully regulated pharmacy, dispensing and distributing prescription medicines via its B2B2C platform. The maximum consideration payable for the acquisition of CloudRx is approximately £36.0 million, of which approximately £32.0 million becomes payable in cash on CloudRx Completion (subject to customary post-completion adjustments for net debt and working capital), £1 million will be satisﬁed by the issue of the Consideration Shares, and up to £3.0 million is payable in deferred cash consideration, payable over the next two years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CloudRx was founded in 2019 and has become a large digital private prescription dispenser by volume. The business has grown from a £5.4 million revenue business in the year to 30 November 2021, predominantly fulfilling private HRT prescriptions, to a £23.2 million revenue business in the year to 30 November 2025, fulfilling prescriptions across numerous product categories.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CloudRx provides a digital end-to-end prescription fulfilment service for private prescribers. The CloudRx software allows doctors and clinicians to generate a digital prescription and transmit the prescription directly to CloudRx for fulfilment. A CloudRx pharmacist reviews and approves the prescription, patient payment is taken directly by CloudRx or by the prescriber, and CloudRx dispenses and ships the medication to the patient.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The CloudRx platform is designed to make the prescribing and fulfilment process as simple and efficient as possible for prescribers and patients. Prescribers can create fully electronic, digitally signed prescriptions for their patients, removing the manual administrative side of generating and processing prescriptions, and enabling them to more efficiently meet demand. Prescribers benefit from access to real-time stock availability and pricing and can issue repeat prescriptions and prescriptions for 20 controlled drugs. Prescribers can write and submit prescriptions directly through the CloudRx web platform or can integrate the functionality of the platform into their practice management system (for example, the Semble clinical system) via CloudRx's proprietary API. This purpose-built cloud-based API integrates with existing technology tools used in the issuance and fulfilment of prescriptions. CloudRx estimates that its API is integrated with over 80 per cent. of the private practice systems market by number of prescribers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Patients benefit from a range of payment and delivery methods, with next day delivery as standard and real-time order tracking. Both prescribers and patients can log in to the platform to view the status of orders.

Business development and outbound sales activities at the Targets have been relatively modest to date. The Company is currently recruiting sales personnel, who will operate across the Enlarged Group with the objective of driving prescriber growth and reducing churn among clinics and patients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·    The opportunity to cross-sell products, including offering complementary products to customers during the check-out process. There are currently very few cross-selling initiatives at the Targets. The Directors believe that cross-selling has the potential to grow volumes and average order value across the Enlarged Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·    The implementation of deep data analytics to better understand the drivers for churn and improve retention within the businesses and product categories. Analytics are expected to inform strategy around extended working hours, later carrier collections, additional patient support channels or agentic AI tools to improve customer service.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·     The development of a consumer-facing brand to encompass the entire product range and patient acquisition business model. The Directors will seek to establish a 'household' brand name, improving trust, reducing churn and reducing customer acquisition costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·      The use of digital marketing to further professionalise and digitise marketing across the Enlarged Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·     The optimisation of service levels across the business, with the objective of differentiating from competition by delivering a 'best-in-class' service. This approach follows the strategy employed by the CEO and COO during their time at Vision Direct, creating service driven retention improvements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To support and accelerate growth, the Directors intend to take certain structural and logistical actions in order to create a scalable platform. This platform will be designed to deliver faster organic growth at higher margin and to put the infrastructure in place to support rapid inorganic growth. The platform will be built on certain key pillars, which are as follows:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·     The integration of the Targets into a single operating entity, allowing for the Enlarged Group to be operated and monitored as one business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·     The establishment of a central warehouse facility, to reduce warehousing and logistical costs, rationalise and simplify processes, improve carrier terms and signiﬁcantly enhance service and delivery times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·     The implementation of a central enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") system across the Enlarged Group to bring all key processes onto a single managed platform. The introduction of an ERP will follow a phased approach, ensuring efﬁcient implementation whilst avoiding disruption to the underlying businesses. The Company is currently working with an ERP provider to scope out the requirements of the system and the applicability of the ERP provider's platform for the needs of the Enlarged Group and has appointed an ERP Director to manage and oversee the integration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·     The uniﬁcation of brands under a single name and brand message, operating from a single consumer-facing web platform. The establishment of a single brand is anticipated to create logistical simplicity and to improve brand recognition for the Enlarged Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Following the Acquisition Completions, the Directors will oversee a structured integration of the Targets to ensure continued operations with little disruption. The Directors have agreed ﬁnancial reporting lines and processes with key management personnel of the Targets ahead of Completion, to ensure that ﬁnancial information across the Enlarged Group is reported in a timely and accurate manner.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company's strategy remains to create the UK's leading regulated ePharmacy, focused on private prescriptions, and the Directors believe that the Acquisitions will create a market presence and a platform for growth, establishing the core foundations for this strategy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Market</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>An ePharmacy is a digital platform that allows customers to fulﬁl prescriptions as well as buy over-the-counter medicines and other healthcare products through a website or mobile application.

Over the past ten years, numerous ePharmacies have emerged, fulﬁlling both NHS and private prescriptions. The market is experiencing rapid growth, driven by an expanding number of approved treatments, increased convenience, discretion, accessibility and speed of treatment against the backdrop of the decline of public healthcare services, including longer waiting times, reduced GP accessibility and treatment rationing. The UK digital pharmacy market was worth US$2.7 billion in 2024 and is forecast to increase to US$4.2 billion by 20291, making it one of the fastest growing digital pharmacy markets globally. The digital pharmacy market in the UK also has one of the highest patient penetration rates, measured at 32.8 per cent. in 2024, and forecast to increase to 60.4 per cent. by 20282.

The UK's telemedicine market was worth US$2.0 billion in 2023 and is forecast to reach US$7.6 billion by 20303 (20.5 per cent.

These include, but are not limited to, the categories below.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>HRT Treatments</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sales of HRT medication in the UK have expanded considerably in recent years, reﬂecting both rising demand and increased access through private healthcare channels. Market research indicates that the UK HRT market generated revenues of approximately US$930 million in 2022 and is forecast to grow to around US$1.64 billion by 2030, implying a compound annual growth rate of c.7.4 per cent. over the period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This growth has been driven in part by greater public awareness of menopausal symptoms and available treatments, alongside structural pressures within the NHS that have encouraged patients to seek private consultations and prescriptions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The structural drivers of this growth are expected to remain in place going forward, with an ageing population, increasing awareness of menopausal symptoms and increasing trust in HRT medication, which have increased both diagnosis and treatment rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>GLP-1 Weight-Loss Treatments</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One significant driver of growth in the UK ePharmacy market has been the rapid increase in use of GLP-1 weight-loss medications in recent years. GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as semaglutides (e.g. Wegovy®) and tirzepatides (e.g. Mounjaro®), are metabolic therapies that mimic the action of the endogenous GLP-1 hormone, reducing appetite and slowing digestion to support clinically significant weight reduction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The MHRA authorised Wegovy®and Mounjaro®for weight loss in the UK in 2023. Since approval, usage of these medicines has grown rapidly, driven predominantly by private prescriptions across digital health and specialist weight-loss providers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the UK, the number of people using GLP-1 medications for weight-loss has grown to approximately</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1.5 million to 2.5 million users in just 3 years. Going forward, the UK market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of approximately 17.7 per cent. between 2025-20305, supported by increasing prescriber adoption, broader clinical use cases and expected improvements in supply availability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Mounjaro®, raised prices by up to 170 per cent. in the UK in September 2025. The full effect of this price change on the overall demand for Mounjaro®in the UK remains to be seen. However, following a pre-rise volume increase ahead of the price change and a subsequent drop in the months following, subsequent CloudRx management accounts show revenue from sales of Mounjaro®returning to strong growth in December 2025 and January 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>GLP-1 weight-management therapies are available in the UK through the NHS for eligible patients. However, due to concerns raised by NHS England including cost (Mounjaro®is estimated to cost the NHS approximately £125 per patient per month), and availability of services, a phased roll-out is being undertaken. In December 2024, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (\"NICE\") published recommendations that NHS England identify a priority cohort of 220,000 patients for use of tirzepatide (i.e. Mounjaro®), which represents approximately 0.3 per cent. of the UK population. The guidance recommended that an eligible population of approximately 3.4 million should have access to tirzepatide by 2037, which represents approximately 5 per cent. of the UK population.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These targets remain modest relative to underlying need, with approximately 30 per cent. of adults in the UK classiﬁed as obese and a further 36 per cent. classiﬁed as overweight.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Directors believe several structural growth drivers underpin the expected market growth of GLP1 weight-loss medications in the UK, including the underlying efﬁcacy of GLP-1 treatments for weight-loss, increased social validation of GLP-1 treatments as adoption increases, continued high-levels of obesity in the UK, further competition increasing supply and driving further adoption, and the introduction of oral GLP-1 formulations in the future. Underlying market growth and limitations on access through the NHS are therefore expected to continue to channel signiﬁcant demand for GLP-1 weight-loss treatments into the private prescription market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ADHD Treatments</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sales of ADHD medication in the UK have increased substantially in recent years, reﬂecting a marked rise in diagnosis and prescribing volumes. NHS prescribing data shows that ADHD medication prescriptions in the UK increased at approximately 18 per cent. a year between 2019 and 20246. This increase has been observed across numerous regions of England and has been attributed to greater clinical and public awareness of ADHD, including among adults, alongside expanding use of medications, where alternative therapeutic options are limited or unavailable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Directors believe that the growth in ADHD medication sales is likely to continue. There are believed to be over 131,000 patients currently on the NHS waiting list for ADHD diagnosis and a lack of availability of medicines in the market. As NHS services struggle to keep pace with demand, there has been a rapid growth in the private sector provision of ADHD services and medications, a trend which the Directors expect to continue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>5.

The sector is primarily regulated by the GPhC, the MHRA, the GMC, the CQC and the VMD. These regulatory bodies have strengthened oversight in recent years to improve patient safety, medicine quality and the integrity of digital services. Online pharmacies must comply with strict standards relating to safe dispensing, data protection, prescribing practices, licensed medicines supply and adherence to enhanced safeguards for high risk medicines. These requirements continue to evolve, reﬂecting both technological innovation and increased regulatory scrutiny.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company has considered the Targets' historical compliance with applicable UK pharmacy and online prescribing regulations as part of its due diligence processes. This work included reviewing GPhC registrations, MHRA and VMD licensing compliance, prescribing and dispensing practices, clinical safety protocols, and compliance with distance selling standards. Internal records and disclosures evidencing regulatory adherence were examined, alongside independent market and regulatory materials. This assessment was aimed at obtaining comfort that the target businesses have operated in accordance with the relevant UK regulatory framework and maintain the controls required of regulated ePharmacy operators.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Going forward, the Enlarged Group maintains a robust compliance framework and intends to proactively adapt to evolving regulation in the sector. The Directors will consider investing in compliance systems that seek to embed regulatory compliance into standard operating practices and to develop enhanced prescribing and dispensing safeguards across all Group companies. The Company will also consider the establishment of a Regulatory Advisory Board composed of experienced pharmacy, clinical governance and regulatory specialists to provide ongoing guidance and independent challenge. This structured governance approach will support continuous compliance and help ensure the Enlarged Group remains aligned with best practice standards, as the UK ePharmacy regulatory environment continues to evolve.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span> </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Use of the Placing Proceeds</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The net proceeds of the Non-VCT Placing, together with the existing cash in the Group, will be used to:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·      satisfy the initial cash consideration payable to the Sellers pursuant to the Acquisitions;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·      provide working capital for the Enlarged Group and support the Enlarged Group's business plan; and</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·      provide available cash for further bolt-on acquisitions, alongside existing Group cash reserves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The net proceeds of the VCT Placing will be used to support the growth of the trade of CloudRx.

Accordingly prospective investors should carefully consider the speciﬁc risk factors set out below in addition to the other information contained in this Announcement before investing in Ordinary Shares. The Board considers the following risks and other factors to be the most signiﬁcant for potential investors in the Enlarged Group, but the risks listed do not necessarily comprise all those associated with an investment in the Enlarged Group and are not set out in any particular order of priority. Potential investors should review this Announcement carefully and in its entirety. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Enlarged Group's business, ﬁnancial condition, capital resources, results and/or future operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such a case, the market price of the Ordinary Shares could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment. No assurance can be given that investors will realise a proﬁt or will avoid a loss on their investment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Board or which the Board currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on the Enlarged Group's business and the information set out below does not purport to be an exhaustive summary of the risks affecting the Enlarged Group. In particular, the Enlarged Group's performance may be affected by changes in the market and/or economic conditions and in legal, regulatory and tax requirements. An investment in the Ordinary Shares described in this Announcement is speculative. Potential investors are accordingly advised to consult an independent professional adviser authorised for the purposes of FSMA who specialises in advising on an investment of this kind before making an investment decision. A prospective investor should consider carefully whether an investment in the Enlarged Group is suitable in the light of their personal circumstances and the ﬁnancial resources available to them. If you are in any doubt about the action you should take, you should consult your independent professional adviser authorised under FSMA.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A.     Risks relating to the Acquisitions</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span> </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Acquisitions may not be completed</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Acquisitions are conditional, amongst other things, on:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(i)     the approval of the Resolutions by the requisite majority of votes cast by Shareholders, with such approval to be sought at the General Meeting;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(ii)    the Placing Agreement becoming unconditional in all respects, save for any condition relating to Readmission; and</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(iii)    Readmission, including, in respect of the CloudRx Acquisition, the Consideration Shares being admitted to trading on AIM.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There can be no guarantee that all of these conditions will be satisﬁed and there is therefore no guarantee that the Acquisitions will complete. In particular, there can be no assurances that Shareholder approval for the Acquisitions will be forthcoming.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the Acquisitions do not complete, the beneﬁts expected to result from the Acquisitions will not be achieved, the Placing will not complete, the Group's reputation may be adversely impacted, and the Group's ability to deliver value for Shareholders, or to implement its strategy, may be prejudiced. Accordingly, the market price of the Ordinary Shares may be adversely affected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Further details of the terms of the Acquisition Agreements and the Placing Agreement will be set out in the Admission Document.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Group may fail to integrate the Targets successfully or within the expected time period, or may fail to realise the envisaged beneﬁts from the Acquisitions</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Integrating the businesses of CloudRx, Hyperdrug and Webmed is expected to be a complex process. The Group cannot guarantee that the integration process following the Acquisition Completions will be completed successfully or that the integration process will achieve the anticipated beneﬁts, either within the timeframes stated by the Board or at all, which may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, ﬁnancial condition, or operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Integration costs relating to the Acquisitions may be greater than anticipated</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group will also incur integration costs to combine the businesses of the Targets into the operations of the Group. The actual costs of the integration process may exceed those which are currently estimated and there may be additional and unforeseen expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisitions. Although the Directors believe that the costs of integration will be more than offset by the realisation of the beneﬁts resulting from the Acquisitions, this net beneﬁt may not be achieved in the short-term or at all. These factors could materially adversely affect the business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Costs are payable by the Group even if the Acquisitions fail to complete</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group has expended signiﬁcant funds in pursuing the Acquisitions. Costs of approximately £4.3 million, which include legal, accounting, tax, ﬁnancial adviser, transaction fees, certain break fees and other costs, are payable irrespective of whether the Acquisitions complete. The Group will therefore incur signiﬁcant abort costs if the Acquisitions fail to complete, which would reduce the Group's available ﬁnancial resources.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Unaudited historical ﬁnancial information may contain errors</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Certain historical ﬁnancial information that will be included in the Admission Document (including information on the Targets) is unaudited. Such ﬁnancial information may contain errors or omissions due to the absence of an audit and may not be fully comparable to audited ﬁnancial statements. Whilst certain due diligence has been conducted to help verify the unaudited historical ﬁnancial information on the Targets, prospective investors should not place undue reliance on the unaudited ﬁnancial information in the Admission Document and should carefully consider the risk that the actual ﬁnancial position and results could differ from the information presented.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Due diligence carried out on the Targets may not have revealed all relevant facts or uncovered signiﬁcant liabilities</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The objective of the due diligence conducted by the Group and its advisers on each of the Targets (which are each privately held companies) is to identify any material issues which might affect the Group's decision to enter the Acquisition Agreements, the terms of the Acquisition Agreements, and ensure, as far as possible, the sufﬁciency of warranties, covenants or indemnities given by the Sellers to Vulcan Two within the relevant Acquisition Agreements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In undertaking due diligence on the Acquisitions, the Group has utilised its own resources and relied upon third parties to conduct aspects of the due diligence process (and in respect of third parties, those third parties have conducted their due diligence within an agreed scope of work and materiality threshold). This due diligence process has relied on data provided by the Targets and public information.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There can be no assurance that the due diligence conducted by the Group and its advisers has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts and liabilities that may be necessary or helpful to evaluate the Acquisitions, the terms of the Acquisition Agreements, or the adequacy of the warranties, covenants or indemnities given by the Sellers for all of the liabilities relating to the operations and activities of the Targets, including, but not limited to, tax liabilities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Vulcan Two will not have full recourse against the Sellers in respect of all potential liabilities in connection with the Acquisitions, whether identiﬁed or unidentiﬁed</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreements, the Sellers provide Vulcan Two with warranties, covenants and indemnities in relation to the Targets. However, these warranties, covenants and indemnities may not cover all potential issues or liabilities associated with the Targets, whether identiﬁed or unidentiﬁed, and such warranties, covenants and indemnities are limited within the Acquisition Agreements, including in scope, duration and/or amount. Vulcan Two may not have full recourse against, or otherwise recover in full from, the Sellers in respect of all losses which it may suffer in respect of a breach of those warranties and covenants, or in respect of the subject matter of any of the indemnities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition, the Group will be dependent on the ongoing solvency of the relevant Sellers to the extent it seeks to recover amounts for claims brought under such warranties, covenants and indemnities. To the extent the Group suffers any losses and is unable to recover such losses from the Sellers it could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operation, and ﬁnancial condition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>If the Acquisitions do not complete, a future acquisition by the Group is likely to be classiﬁed as a Reverse Takeover which may require Shareholder approval, may result in additional costs for that Reverse Takeover, and may result in the suspension of trading of the Company's Ordinary Shares</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Each of the Acquisitions (individually and collectively) constitute a Reverse Takeover under the AIM Rules for Companies and as such, each Acquisition requires the approval of Shareholders which will be sought at the General Meeting. If the Acquisitions do not complete, then the Company is expected to remain an \"investing company\" under the AIM Rules for Companies. In such case, it is expected that the next acquisition or acquisitions by the Group may also constitute a Reverse Takeover requiring Shareholder approval (which may or may not be obtained), which may result in additional expenditure in connection with that Reverse Takeover.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In accordance with the AIM Rules for Companies, if the Group fails to make an acquisition or has not substantially implemented its Investing Policy within 18 months of the Original Admission Date, the Group will require Shareholder approval for its Investing Policy at each subsequent annual general meeting until such time as the Group has completed an acquisition or the Investing Policy has been substantially implemented. If no acquisition is made by the Group, or the Investing Policy has not been substantially implemented, the Directors may, at any subsequent annual general meeting, ask Shareholders to consider whether to wind up the Group and return funds (after payment of the expenses and liabilities of the Group) to Shareholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shareholders should note that if an acquisition is considered to be a Reverse Takeover and the Shareholders approve that acquisition, trading on AIM in the Ordinary Shares will be cancelled and readmission to AIM or another listing venue will be required to be sought in the same manner as any other applicant applying for admission of its securities for the ﬁrst time. At such time, trading in the Ordinary Shares will normally be suspended following the announcement of any such acquisition until the Group has published a readmission document in respect of the Group (as enlarged by such acquisition).</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>VCT investors should be aware of the possibility that only the VCT Placing Shares might be issued and that their investment in the VCT Placing Shares is not conditional on the Acquisitions, Readmission, or the issue of the Non-VCT Placing Shares or the Consideration Shares</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>VCT investors should be aware that an investment in the VCT Placing Shares would complete prior to, and is not conditional on completion of the Acquisitions, Readmission or the issue of the Non-VCT Placing Shares and Consideration Shares. The working capital statement that will be set out in the Admission Document assumes that all of the New Ordinary Shares are issued and Readmission takes place. If all of the New Ordinary Shares are not issued, the Acquisitions do not complete and Readmission does not take place, the Company may not be able to implement its strategy and pursue growth opportunities that will be described in the Admission Document.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Further details of the VCT Admission and Readmission will be set out in the Admission Document.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>B.    Risks relating to the business and operations of the Enlarged Group</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Potential loss of longstanding relationships with CloudRx's key partners following the Acquisition Completions</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Targets, and particularly CloudRx, have built up a number of longstanding relationships with certain partners. Some of the contracts under which these relationships operate contain clauses which allow the counterparty to terminate without cause or on written notice during or at the expiry of the respective term or renewal period. A large number of CloudRx's key partner contracts have also surpassed the initial term of the contract and are rolling on a year-by-year basis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A key element of the Directors' strategy for CloudRx depends on developing and maintaining long-term relationships with key partners such as clinics, healthcare providers, and practice management systems, through which those key partners refer their patients to CloudRx. The Enlarged Group is therefore dependent on key partners (including Newson Health, Clinical Partners and Lotus Health). There can be no guarantee that these relationships with key partners will continue or that key partners will not scale back their engagement with the Enlarged Group or cease to refer patients altogether. Should any of these relationships cease, it could have a material adverse effect on the ﬁnancial position and prospects of the Enlarged Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Certain supplier contracts of the Targets also provide an opportunity for the counterparty to terminate or renegotiate those agreements as a result of a change of control, or a material change having occurred to the Target (including due to the Acquisition Completions). Although the Enlarged Group has no knowledge to suggest that any such key contracts will be terminated by a counterparty, the Directors cannot guarantee that a counterparty will not do so.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Following the Acquisition Completions, any loss of, or change in, a Target's key relationships with its partners or suppliers (including a reduction in supply, or the supply on less favourable terms, or, in the case of CloudRx, a reduction in patient referrals from key partners) could have a material adverse effect on the ﬁnancial position and prospects of the Enlarged Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Any failure by the Enlarged Group to retain or recruit key employees and consultants could have an adverse impact on the Enlarged Group's ability to meet its strategic objectives, including integration of the Targets</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The future growth and success of the Enlarged Group is highly dependent on a limited number of people and the Enlarged Group's ability to recruit in the future.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Directors believe that the ongoing service of Michael Kraftman and Brendan O'Brien, until such time when suitable replacements may be recruited, trained and integrated into the business, is critical to the prospects of the Enlarged Group. While Michael Kraftman and Brendan O'Brien have each entered into service agreements with the Company, which include a non-compete provision to minimise the risk of them setting up a competitive business, there is no ability to bind them in to work for the Enlarged Group. Therefore, the Enlarged Group will not be able to use their knowledge, resources, experience and skills, should they leave the Enlarged Group which could have a material adverse effect on the business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Enlarged Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Keith Butcher, the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer of the Enlarged Group, is employed on a six-month contract which is due to expire on 21 July 2026. Under the terms of the service agreement, Mr Butcher will receive a salary of £120,000 for the fixed term and a capital raising success bonus of £80,000 payable on completion of a capital raising (as defined in the agreement, which will include the Placing). The service agreement is terminable in various specified circumstances and Mr Butcher's appointment may be extended by agreement between the Company and Mr Butcher. Mr Butcher's service agreement contains post-termination restrictions, including restrictions on the solicitation of customers and employees of the Group for a period of 6 months after termination. Mr Butcher will be appointed as a Director of the Company upon Readmission. The service agreement is governed by English law.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Should the Enlarged Group fail to reach an agreement to extend Mr Butcher's employment beyond this date, the Directors will need to recruit a replacement Chief Financial Ofﬁcer. Failure to recruit an appropriate candidate, or a delay in the recruitment of an appropriate candidate, could have a negative impact on the operations and prospects of the Enlarged Group, including the process of integration following the Acquisition Completions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Key individuals at the Targets, including the CloudRx Seller (Daniel Lee), who is the current chief executive ofﬁcer of CloudRx, are being retained by the Enlarged Group following the Acquisition Completions through service agreements and consultancy agreements. These key individuals may choose to allocate their time and effort to their other business interests, and may fail to perform their roles to the extent anticipated. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations, ﬁnancial condition and future prospects, including the integration process.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition, other employees at the Targets may not wish to remain in place following the Acquisition Completions, including as part of the integration process and may therefore resign. The loss of personnel could negatively impact the operations, and ultimately the proﬁtability, of the Enlarged Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the Directors will take reasonable steps to ensure that knowledge, skills and expertise are shared by key employees with the Enlarged Group, so as to avoid the Enlarged Group being unduly dependent on individuals, such measures may prove not to be effective if there were adverse circumstances beyond the Enlarged Group's control affecting key personnel or the wider pool of employees.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Further details of the Executive Directors' and Keith Butcher's service agreements will be set out in the Admission Document. Further details of the CloudRx Seller's consultancy agreement will be set out in the Admission Document.

Experienced employees in the pharmaceutical and ecommerce industries are in high demand and competition for the recruitment of employees in the UK can be intense.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the Enlarged Group relocates all or part of the operations of any Target to a different location or seeks to consolidate operations into other Enlarged Group facilities, some employees of the Targets may be unwilling to relocate to work at these facilities, or may not wish to remain in their existing roles. Accordingly, a change of location may result in a loss of expertise or have an adverse impact on the integration of the Targets, and require increased recruitment and training costs for new employees.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the Enlarged Group's business is unable to retain or attract high-quality, skilled employees who are experienced in the pharmaceutical and ecommerce industries, replace the loss of any key personnel, is required to materially increase the amount the Enlarged Group offers in remuneration to secure the employment of key personnel, or is unable to ﬁnd adequate third parties to perform these services on reasonable terms and on a timely basis, its operating and ﬁnancial performance could be adversely affected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Customer acquisition costs may increase, particularly for the Enlarged Group's B2C channel and GLP-1 weight-loss treatments</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Enlarged Group's strategy is dependent on generating meaningful customer acquisitions and sales from marketing activities, including for sales through its B2C channel and for sales of GLP-1 weight-loss treatments. If the price of marketing the Enlarged Group's products increases, or, for instance, if the GLP-1 weight-loss market becomes more competitive, the Enlarged Group may be required to increase its marketing spend on search engines, social media platforms or other forms of advertisement or to allocate a larger portion of its marketing spend to these areas of its business. If the Enlarged Group is unable to generate meaningful customer acquisitions and sales from its investment in marketing activities, the Enlarged Group's revenues, margins and growth could be adversely affected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>A failure by the Enlarged Group to protect its intellectual property rights could adversely affect its business</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Enlarged Group relies on a combination of trademarks, service marks, domain name registrations, common law rights and statutory copyright protection to protect its intellectual property. The Enlarged Group will endeavour to maintain the protections it currently has in place with respect to intellectual property and access to proprietary information, including entering into agreements with its new employees, consultants and contractors and parties with whom it does business in order to protect its intellectual property and limit access to and disclosure of its proprietary information. However, the Enlarged Group cannot be certain that the steps it has taken will protect its technology or intellectual property either from third party challenges, from unauthorised use or the reverse engineering of its technology.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A failure to protect the Enlarged Group's intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, ﬁnancial condition and operational results. Similarly, an infringement by the Company of any existing intellectual property rights or trademarks or the inability to secure trademark protection could also lead to litigation and/or materially adversely affect the company's business, ﬁnancial condition and operational results.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Enlarged Group depends on certain technology and software that it does not own</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Certain technology that is used by the Enlarged Group uses software and/or intellectual property that is ultimately owned by third parties and is either used by the Enlarged Group pursuant to the terms of a licence or has been created by a third party for the Group but may not have been validly assigned to the Group. To the extent that the Enlarged Group changes the manner in which it uses intellectual property under licence, there is a risk that such modiﬁed use constitutes a breach of the relevant licence terms. In those circumstances, the owner of the third party intellectual property could restrict or prevent the use of the intellectual property, or seek to bring infringement proceedings against the Enlarged Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If third parties change, restrict or withdraw access to or dispute the Enlarged Group's use of such software or intellectual property, alter licence terms, or if there are defects in the assignment or transfer of software developed for the Group, the Enlarged Group may incur additional costs, suffer service disruption, or become subject to litigation which could adversely affect its operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Further details of the material intellectual property rights of the Targets, including the CloudRx licence referred to above will be set out in the Admission Document.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The implementation of new ﬁnancial controls and internal reporting procedures could harm the Enlarged Group's ability to produce timely and accurate ﬁnancial information</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Enlarged Group will implement various new processes and controls to allow it to produce accurate and timely ﬁnancial statements and to monitor and manage risks relating to ﬁnancial reporting. If any of these processes or controls were to fail, or if the implementation of these processes and controls took longer than envisaged, the Enlarged Group may be unable to produce ﬁnancial information accurately or on a timely basis. Any concerns that investors may have in respect of the potential lack of available and current ﬁnancial information and the controls the Enlarged Group has in place could adversely affect the Enlarged Group's share price.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Reliance on information technology systems and controls, including systems relating to patients and dispensing activities</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The operation of the Enlarged Group's business is reliant on information technology systems, including systems relating to patient records, inventory control, and product dispensing. These systems are vulnerable to damage, breakdown or interruption from human error or events beyond the Enlarged Group's control, such as natural disaster, power outages or telecommunications or data network failures. Modiﬁcations or upgrades to these systems could also result in interruption to the Enlarged Group's business. The occurrence of any such damage, breakdown or interruption could adversely affect the Enlarged Group's business, ﬁnancial condition, results or future operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Following the Acquisitions, the Directors will implement certain new processes and procedures to ensure the efﬁcient and effective management of the Enlarged Group. The Directors are also intending to implement an Enterprise Resource Planning system (\"ERP\") across the Enlarged Group, as part of the Enlarged Group's broader integration plan, including to assist with dispensing and fulﬁlment activities. A delay to the implementation of the ERP, or changes to existing processes and operations of the Targets while the ERP is being implemented could create process inefﬁciencies and disruption, and could have a negative impact on relationships with key partners and patients or the ability to fulﬁl prescription orders in a timely manner. Any such outcome could have a negative impact on the ﬁnancial condition and the prospects of the Enlarged Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Enlarged Group will handle conﬁdential data, including patient data, and may face risks relating to cyber attacks and data security</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Enlarged Group will handle conﬁdential data relating to patients, prescriptions and medicines, and other sensitive information which is subject to heightened regulation. The Enlarged Group and its pharmacy platforms will be at risk from cyber attacks. Cyber attacks can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events and may include (but are not limited to) criminal activity, denial of service attacks, computer viruses, power outages, natural disasters, accidents, or equipment failure. Malicious third parties may also seek to gain unauthorised access to the Enlarged Group's software for the purpose of misappropriating intellectual property or sensitive information (such as patient data). These cyber attacks could cause operational disruption which delays or prevents the fulﬁlment of prescriptions or delivery of medicines to patients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Processes and controls have been implemented which aim to mitigate these risks and protect patient data and the continuity of its services. However, these measures do not guarantee that the Enlarged Group will not be adversely affected by a cyber attack. If the Enlarged Group suffers a cyber attack, this could expose the Enlarged Group to potential ﬁnancial, regulatory (including under UK data protection laws) and reputational harm. The Enlarged Group may also incur signiﬁcant costs to repair any damage caused to the Enlarged Group's information technology systems and handling complaints relating to the loss of patient data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Enlarged Group is likely to require additional capital to support its acquisition strategy and such capital might not be available on acceptable terms or on a timely basis</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Enlarged Group is likely to require additional funding to support its future growth, including to fund its acquisition strategy to acquire complementary businesses beyond the Acquisitions, penetrate new markets or invest in long-term assets, such as warehouse facilities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Enlarged Group may seek ﬁnancing via equity fundraising or debt ﬁnancing to raise capital for its future acquisitions, expansion into new sectors or markets, or its working capital. Such equity or debt capital may not be available to the Enlarged Group at the time the capital is required, on terms acceptable to the Enlarged Group, or available at all. A delay or failure to obtain equity or debt ﬁnancing on a timely basis, or on acceptable terms, could constrain the Enlarged Group's ability to execute its strategy and may adversely affect its growth prospects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the Enlarged Group obtains debt ﬁnancing, the debt may be secured over material assets, including shares of material subsidiaries such as Vulcan Two, and may contain ﬁnancial and operational covenants. A breach of such covenants could trigger obligations to repay borrowings in whole or in part, potentially necessitating asset sales within a limited timeframe. This is more likely in circumstances where there has been a downturn in values in the ePharmacy sector or if the Enlarged Group has not generated sufﬁcient cash ﬂows to meet repayment requirements. If this occurs, this may have a material adverse effect on the Enlarged Group's ﬁnancial condition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Company has a lack of trading history on which to base an investment</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company was incorporated on 6 August 2025 and has since such time been an \"investing company\" under the AIM Rules for Companies. The Company has carried on minimal trading activities to date and so does not itself have a track record or operating history. Accordingly, as at the date of this Announcement, the Company has no meaningful operational or ﬁnancial data upon which prospective investors may base an evaluation of the Company, its strategy or its prospects. The past performance of companies managed by the Directors is not necessarily a guide to the ﬁnancial prospects of the Company. The value of any investment in the Company is, therefore, wholly dependent upon the successful implementation of the Company's longer-term business strategy, including the completion of the Acquisitions and, thereafter, the integration of the Acquisitions, and expansion of the Enlarged Group through the acquisition of further businesses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span> </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Risk of adverse impact on sales from potential rebranding</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>As part of its strategy to develop a uniﬁed consumer-facing brand, the Enlarged Group may undertake a rebranding exercise. Any change to trading names, domain names, or CloudRx, Webmed or Hyperdrug's branding or logos may reduce existing brand recognition and customer loyalty and result in customer confusion. There is also a risk that the new consumer-facing brand does not achieve the intended market positioning with customers, requiring higher marketing spend to rebuild brand awareness. These factors could reduce customer conversion and sales, which could have an adverse effect on the Enlarged Group's business and prospects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Litigation, disputes and other adversarial actions in the ordinary course of business could materially adversely affect the Enlarged Group</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Although the Enlarged Group is not currently party to (either as a claimant or as a defendant) any litigation, it may become involved in litigation or disputes from time to time, such as the dispute referred to below relating to the CC Agreement. In addition, the Enlarged Group may be subject to other claims and complaints, including adversarial actions, by key partners, patients, customers, employees, suppliers, regulators and others in the ordinary course of business. Signiﬁcant claims or a substantial number of small claims may be expensive to defend, may divert the time and focus of the Directors and senior management away from the Enlarged Group's operations and may result in the Enlarged Group having to pay monetary damages, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Enlarged Group's ﬁnancial condition, business, prospects and results of operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On 28 February 2025, Vulcan Two Ltd entered into an engagement letter with Chrystal Capital Partners LLP (\"CC\") in relation to the introduction of potential investors in Vulcan Two (\"CC Agreement\"). The CC Agreement terminated on 28 August 2025. The terms of the CC Agreement, which is governed by English law, provided for a retainer fee of £10,000 per calendar month and a percentage commission if funds are raised by the Company from certain investors, each payable in certain circumstances (amongst other things, a commission fee may be payable to CC in the event that certain investors introduced by CC to the Group before termination of the CC Agreement invest in the Group (including a debt or equity investment) within a period of 24 months following such termination date, being 28 August 2027).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Between August and December 2025, the Company received correspondence from CC and CC's legal representatives asserting that commission fees may be payable to CC in relation to the IPO and associated placing. The Company has obtained legal advice in relation to its obligations to CC under the CC Agreement. The Company considers that no commission fees: (1) are payable to CC in connection with the IPO and the associated placing and the Placing; and (2) would be payable to CC in respect of future fundraises (including the Placing, if the Placing completes) unless investors in those fundraises had been introduced by CC to the Group before 28 August 2025. In relation to the CC Agreement, the Company received a draft particulars of claim in December 2025, which has been responded to and since such time, the Company has received no further correspondence from CC.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the Enlarged Group has taken, and intends to continue to take, such precautions as it regards appropriate to avoid or minimise the likelihood of any litigation, disputes or claims, the Directors cannot preclude the possibility of litigation being brought against the Enlarged Group. In addition, adverse publicity or substantial litigation against the Enlarged Group could negatively impact its reputation, even if the Enlarged Group is not found liable, which could have a material adverse effect on the Enlarged Group's business and ﬁnancial condition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Enlarged Group is subject to operational risks in the ordinary course of business which may not be adequately insured</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Targets maintain insurance policies, including professional indemnity, public liability and employers' liability policies. These policies are intended to address operational risks faced by the Targets in the ordinary course of business, such as patients receiving incorrect medication, patients experiencing unexpected adverse reactions from medication, or injuries to employees from the use of heavy machinery at the Targets' premises. There can be no guarantee that the Enlarged Group has insurance cover that is adequate to meet its risks. In addition, certain risks may be, or may become, either uninsurable or not economically insurable or may not be currently or in the future covered by the Enlarged Group's insurance policies. In addition, even if a loss is incurred, the Enlarged Group may be required to pay a signiﬁcant excess on any claim to the insurer before the insurer is obligated to reimburse the Enlarged Group for the loss, or the amount of the loss may exceed the Enlarged Group's coverage for the loss. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Enlarged Group's business and ﬁnancial condition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>C.    Risks relating to the industry in which the Enlarged Group operates</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Enlarged Group may be subject to adverse changes in consumer habits or consumer sentiment and key markets may not grow at the same pace as they have historically grown or as fast as current forecasts indicate</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Enlarged Group's strategy is built on the projected growth of its key markets. However, historical trends may not be indicative of future trends and forecast or estimated growth rates may not be accurate, in whole or part, or ever materialise. Consumer sentiment towards certain product categories, such as weight management and weight-loss treatments, lifestyle and wellness related products, or changes in trends such as levels of pet ownership in relation to Hyperdrug's products and services, is subject to rapid change and can be inﬂuenced by matters such as evolving social attitudes, media coverage, perceived health risks, and/or the availability of alternative treatments. A shift in consumer preferences away from the Enlarged Group's products, whether due to changes in consumer habits, lifestyle trends, changes in demographic markets, negative publicity or emerging alternative treatments, could lead to a material reduction in the Enlarged Group's sales, as well as obsolete inventory, both of which could result in a material adverse impact on the Enlarged Group's operations and ﬁnancial performance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>There may be a decrease in consumer demand for GLP-1 weight-loss treatments and changes in regulation which adversely impact the use of GLP-1 for weight-loss treatments</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is a risk that consumer demand for GLP-1 weight-loss treatments may decrease due to a variety of factors beyond the Enlarged Group's control. Usage of GLP-1 treatments for weight-loss has increased rapidly in recent years, making it difﬁcult to accurately forecast the trajectory of the market in the future. Shifts in consumer preferences, the emergence of new or alternative treatments, or evolving attitudes among healthcare providers and patients could reduce the uptake of GLP-1 weight-loss treatments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Whilst GLP-1 products are considered clinically safe and have been used to treat other medical conditions for a number of years, there is a risk that the long-term side effects from using these products for weight loss are not yet fully understood. Accordingly, there is a risk that regulatory or reputational changes could adversely affect the market for GLP-1 weight-loss treatments. Regulatory authorities may introduce new guidelines, restrictions, or safety warnings that limit the availability of GLP-1 treatments for weight-loss applications. There can be no assurance that the Enlarged Group will be able to anticipate or mitigate the effects of such regulatory or reputational changes, which could have a signiﬁcant adverse effect on its business, ﬁnancial condition, and results of operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Price increases from manufacturers and supply chain disruptions for GLP-1 treatments could have a negative impact on the Enlarged Group</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>At present, the GLP-1 weight-loss market is dominated by a small number of manufacturers that control pricing and product supply. As a result, the price at which these products are available to consumers can be subject to price increases by individual manufacturers or supply chain disruptions, which are outside the control of the Enlarged Group. If the Enlarged Group cannot effectively pass price increases through to consumers, its margins may reduce. Similarly, if the Enlarged Group increases its pricing to reﬂect its higher costs, sales volumes may decline. These adverse price increases and supply chain disruptions could reduce consumer demand for GLP-1 treatments and could impact the Enlarged Group's sales and proﬁt margin.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Enlarged Group will be required to comply with stringent laws and regulations which are speciﬁc to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry, including those relating to the sale of pharmaceutical products</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The industry in which the members of the Enlarged Group operates is governed by various laws and regulations. In the UK, the ePharmacy sector is primarily governed by the GPhC, the MHRA, the GMC, the CQC and VMD. The Enlarged Group must adhere to laws governing remote healthcare and healthcare delivery (including in relation to the sale and marketing of pharmaceutical products, safe dispensing practices, advertising, data protection, and licensing). Such laws and regulations are subject to change and interpretation. There is a risk that the Enlarged Group fails to comply with such requirements and as a result, may be exposed to regulatory action such as the loss of regulatory approvals and ﬁnes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Certain regulatory approvals may be required for the Enlarged Group to secure new contracts or operate in sectors or markets in which the Enlarged Group seeks to expand. The process of obtaining such regulatory approvals may be costly, time-consuming and divert the time and focus of senior management which could prevent the Enlarged Group from its operations. This could have a material adverse impact on the Enlarged Group's business, ﬁnancial performance and operations. Failure to comply with regulatory approvals or regulation could lead to complaints to regulators, litigation and compensation claims from patients. Such action, as well as safety incidents or bad patient outcomes, could result in signiﬁcant negative publicity. This may adversely impact the Enlarged Group's reputation and ﬁnancial performance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is also a risk that new laws or regulations are introduced that materially impact the sale of certain products in the Enlarged Group's markets. For example, products representing a signiﬁcant proportion of the Enlarged Group's revenue (such as GLP-1 weight-loss treatments, as referred to above) could be restricted as to which patients it is legal to sell them to, or which channels it is legal to supply them through, or could be completely banned. Any such new laws or regulations could therefore adversely impact the Enlarged Group's ﬁnancial performance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Enlarged Group's compliance with laws and regulations relating to the ePharmacy market may be more costly or require more resources than expected</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Enlarged Group is likely to incur costs related to the requirement to adhere to strict regulations overseen by the GPhC, the MHRA, the GMC, the CQC and VMD. These include but are not limited to the costs of regulatory approvals and implementation and/or maintenance of systems to meet required regulatory standards. Additional costs may be incurred if the Enlarged Group requires professional advice or a compliance audit to ensure it remains compliant with changing regulations and its existing regulatory obligations. If these costs or the time required by senior management to ensure compliance with these regulations are greater than anticipated, or if the Enlarged Group fails to comply with these regulations, such non-compliance could adversely impact the Enlarged Group's reputation and ﬁnancial performance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Enlarged Group will be required to ensure that clinically safe processes are in place for its handling of medicines</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Enlarged Group's dispensing and inventory handling activities must comply with stringent clinical governance and safety standards (including those set by the GPhC, the MHRA, the GMC, the CQC and VMD). These standards require controls such as patient identity veriﬁcation, prescription screening, appropriate labelling processes, appropriate inventory storage and secure delivery to the correct patient. Failure in these processes, such as supplying incorrect medicine to a patient or dispensing expired or tampered products could cause patient harm and result in regulatory investigations and sanctions. The Enlarged Group may also be subject to product recalls, reputational harm and a loss of trust from healthcare providers and patients. While the Enlarged Group intends to maintain clinically safe processes and undertake regular employee training, there can be no assurance that errors will not occur, and any such incidents could materially adversely affect the Enlarged Group's ﬁnancial performance and reputation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Enlarged Group may face product liability risks leading to liability claims, reputational harm, and regulatory penalties</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Enlarged Group's business is dependent upon maintaining a strong reputation amongst regulators, healthcare providers, and its customers. The Enlarged Group may face product liability risks from customers or others coming into contact with products sold by the Enlarged Group if it inadvertently distributes counterfeit, expired or incorrect medications. If the Enlarged Group cannot successfully defend itself against product liability claims, the Enlarged Group could incur substantial liabilities. In addition to presenting potential signiﬁcant health risks to customers, product liability claims may also result in decreased demand for the Enlarged Group's products, related litigation which creates a distraction of management's attention from the Enlarged Group's primary business, regulatory penalties or loss of licences, which would materially adversely affect the Enlarged Group's operations and ﬁnancial performance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Enlarged Group may be susceptible to illegal trade in medicines</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The pharmaceutical sector is exposed to illegal trade risks, including counterfeiting, theft, prescription fraud and illegal diversion (that is, when medicinal products are found in a market where they were not sent and where they are not approved to be sold). Public loss of conﬁdence in the integrity of pharmaceutical products as a result of illegal trade, which is beyond the Enlarged Group's control could materially adversely affect the Enlarged Group's ﬁnancial performance. In addition, undue or misplaced concern about this issue may cause some patients to stop taking their medicines, with consequential risks to their health. If the Enlarged Group is found liable for breaches in its supply chains, authorities may take action, ﬁnancial or otherwise, that could adversely impact the distribution of its products and have a detrimental impact on the Enlarged Group's reputation and ultimately its ﬁnancial performance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Enlarged Group will face competition risk from existing providers in the ePharmacy sector, as well as the threat of larger new entrants into the ePharmacy sector</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The industry in which the Enlarged Group intends to operate is subject to domestic and global competition. The Enlarged Group has a number of competitors in this market, some of whom have been operating for longer and have larger market shares than that of the Enlarged Group. The Enlarged Group has no inﬂuence or control over the activities or actions of its competitors, including existing ePharmacies, traditional pharmacy groups, online private prescription providers and new entrants into those markets, whose activities or actions may adversely impact the Enlarged Group's operations and ﬁnancial performance. Larger competitors may beneﬁt from stronger consumer brands, greater resources, more extensive product ranges, preferential wholesaler terms and purchasing power, priority access to constrained product supply (including GLP-1 weight-loss treatments) and better standards of customer service.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The highly competitive nature of the ePharmacy market means that the Enlarged Group needs to continually innovate its products and services, maintain high standards of customer service and successfully market its offering. The ePharmacy market is also characterised by high price transparency between competitors, which can increase customer acquisition costs and compress margins.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These factors may lead to downward pricing pressure and erosion of margins and may adversely impact on the Enlarged Group's ability to retain existing customers or partners as well as attract new customers or partners. This may restrict the Enlarged Group's ability to offer competitively priced products and grow its customer base. This failure to compete effectively could negatively impact the Enlarged Group's revenue, proﬁtability or cash ﬂow.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Risk of key partners of CloudRx developing their own prescription fulﬁlment capabilities</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>CloudRx has a number of key prescribing partners that may seek to develop their own prescription fulﬁlment capabilities rather than relying on the capabilities of CloudRx. If these key partners develop such capabilities, CloudRx and the Enlarged Group could experience a reduction in demand, loss of key partner relationships (and therefore patient referrals), or increased pricing pressure on its products or services as such partners have alternatives available to them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Enlarged Group may also incur additional costs in attempting to retain these key partners or to diversify its sources of patient referrals from such key partners. There can be no assurance that the Enlarged Group will be able to offset the loss of business from such partners, or to successfully diversify its sources of patient referrals, and any resulting decline in sales could have a material adverse effect on the Enlarged Group's business, ﬁnancial condition, and results of operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Enlarged Group relies on third parties for the supply and transportation of its inventory and signiﬁcant disruption to the supply chain may adversely impact the Enlarged Group's ability to fulﬁl orders</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Enlarged Group relies on certain key suppliers, wholesalers and manufacturers for the timely supply of its inventory, without whom the Enlarged Group would not be able to fulﬁl orders. Many of the products sold by the Enlarged Group (including GLP-1 weight-loss treatments) are difﬁcult to substitute in a timely manner or at all. A variety of issues might disrupt supply chains and result in product shortages. For example, political, legal and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers or manufacturers are located, suppliers' failure to meet the Enlarged Group's standards, issues with labour practices of its suppliers, the availability and cost of ingredients to suppliers, transport availability and cost, and inﬂation could interrupt the Enlarged Group's sourcing activities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Any of these factors which cause service disruption and are beyond the Enlarged Group's control, could have negative implications for the Enlarged Group. The Enlarged Group cannot guarantee that services and products delivered from third parties will remain of a high quality in the future and be provided without interruption. In the event of a major disruption to the timely supply of third party products and services, there may be a loss of product sales and alternative suppliers may only be available at higher prices or at the cost of some delay in supply which could negatively affect the Enlarged Group's operations, ﬁnancial results and performance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Risk that medication manufacturers develop the capability to dispense and deliver prescriptions directly to patients</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is a risk that certain medication manufacturers may develop the capability to dispense and deliver products directly to patients. Should the Enlarged Group fail to incorporate its services into any such supply chain, and should such prescription fulﬁlment processes become commonplace, for key product lines or across the market more generally, the Enlarged Group may suffer a signiﬁcant reduction in patient volumes, which could have a material adverse impact on the Enlarged Group's operations, ﬁnancial results and performance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Failure to manage inventory levels: insufﬁcient levels of inventory may lead to loss of sales or loss of customers, while excess inventory could lead to increased costs associated with disposal or the costs of writing off expired inventory</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Enlarged Group may be required to carefully manage inventory levels to operate the business through online platforms successfully. Medicines and other ePharmacy products may have limited shelf-life dates and so the Enlarged Group will aim to avoid accumulation of excess inventory, while at the same time minimising out-of-stock levels and maintaining in-stock levels across all product categories. While the Directors intend to implement the ERP to assist with inventory management, if the time taken by the Enlarged Group to obtain new inventory or sell existing inventory is not anticipated correctly, inventory levels will not be appropriate and this may result in a loss of sales, a loss of customers who are unsatisﬁed with delivery times, or increased costs of maintaining and managing inventory. Furthermore, the Enlarged Group could incur additional costs for the disposal of expired products or the costs of writing off expired inventory.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Enlarged Group may be subject to international trade risks and the impact of tariffs from countries from which it sources products</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>At present, the Enlarged Group sources the majority of its products from UK suppliers. However, it may source products from outside of the UK in the future. Accordingly, the Enlarged Group may be subject to the risks pertaining to international trade, particularly those risks including the imposition of taxes or tariffs on imports, increasing trade tensions arising from geopolitical conditions and changes to import restrictions. If these risks were to affect the Enlarged Group's ability to source goods, or signiﬁcantly increase its costs of sourcing goods, the Enlarged Group's proﬁt and overall ﬁnancial condition may be materially adversely affected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>D.    Risks relating to the Ordinary Shares and their trading on AIM</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The share price of the Ordinary Shares may be subject to market price volatility and the market price of the Ordinary Shares may decline disproportionately to developments that are unrelated to the Company's operating performance</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Potential investors should be aware that the value of shares can go down as well as up and that an investment in a share that is traded on AIM may be less readily realisable and may carry a higher degree of risk than an investment in a share listed on the Ofﬁcial List. The return that investors may realise for their holding of Ordinary Shares, as and when they are able to do so, may be inﬂuenced by many factors, some of which will be speciﬁc to the Enlarged Group and others of which will be external and unrelated to the Company's operating performance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In recent years, ﬁnancial markets have experienced signiﬁcant price and volume ﬂuctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies. Any recessionary economic environment, and the resulting increased levels of volatility and related market turmoil, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future income, business, operations, ﬁnancial condition, share price and ability to pay a dividend or return capital to Shareholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Share liquidity could impact the ability of investors to sell Ordinary Shares at a time when they want, impacting the ability of investors to realise their investment in the Ordinary Shares</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>At present, the Company is a small AIM-traded company with low share trading volume. Following Readmission, there may still be low liquidity in the market for the Ordinary Shares and investors may, therefore, be unable to sell their Ordinary Shares. It may be more difﬁcult for an investor to realise his or her investment in an AIM-traded company, such as the Company, than a company whose securities are listed on the Ofﬁcial List. There can be no assurance that an active trading market in the Ordinary Shares will develop, or if developed, that it will be maintained. The AIM Rules for Companies are less demanding as compared to the rules which apply to an entity admitted to the Ofﬁcial List, and investing in shares on AIM may entail higher risks than investing in shares admitted to the Ofﬁcial List.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AIM is a market for emerging or smaller, growing companies and may not provide the liquidity normally associated with the Ofﬁcial List or other exchanges. The future liquidity in the market for the Ordinary Shares cannot be guaranteed. In particular, the market for the Ordinary Shares may be, or may become, relatively illiquid and therefore the Ordinary Shares may be or may become difﬁcult to sell.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>There is no guarantee that the Enlarged Group will maintain its quotation on AIM</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Enlarged Group cannot assure investors that the Enlarged Group will always retain a quotation on AIM. If it fails to retain such a quotation, certain investors may decide to sell their Ordinary Shares, which could have an adverse impact on the price of the Ordinary Shares. Additionally, if in the future the Enlarged Group decides to obtain a quotation on another exchange in addition to AIM, the level of liquidity of the Ordinary Shares traded on AIM could decline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Dilution of Shareholders' interest as a result of additional equity fundraising (such as the Placing) and share consideration for acquisitions</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Enlarged Group's strategy involves acquiring complementary businesses beyond the Acquisitions. Those further acquisitions may be funded by the issue of further Ordinary Shares and/or cash which may be funded either by bank debt, if available to the Enlarged Group, or further equity fundraising. It is possible that the Enlarged Group may decide to issue, pursuant to a public offer or otherwise, additional Ordinary Shares in the future at a price or prices higher or lower than the Placing Price. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of new equity or equity-linked securities (or there is a public perception that such an issuance may occur), other than on a pro-rata basis to existing shareholders of the Company at the relevant time, the percentage ownership of existing shareholders of the Company will be reduced. Shareholders may experience subsequent dilution as any new securities may also have preferred rights, options and pre-emption rights that are senior to the Ordinary Shares. The Enlarged Group may also issue Ordinary Shares as consideration for acquisitions which would also dilute Shareholders' respective shareholdings, resulting in lower voting rights, and less amounts (such as dividends, if these are paid) for such diluted Shareholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span> </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Dilution of Shareholders as a result of the exercise of management incentive arrangements</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vulcan Two has implemented a Management Incentive Plan under which the percentage ownership of a Shareholder could be diluted. The Management Incentive Plan will be further described in the Admission Document.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If new Ordinary Shares are issued to participants in the Management Incentive Plan, the percentage ownership of a Shareholder could be reduced resulting in decreased ﬁnancial returns and voting rights for diluted Shareholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is anticipated that in due course the Company will establish a further share incentive scheme for executive management, key employees or directors of the Enlarged Group in due course (as will be summarised in the Admission Document). Such a further share incentive scheme would likely provide for the grant of options to acquire Ordinary Shares which, if exercised, would also result in a Shareholder's returns being diluted, and the dilution of voting rights and the percentage of the share capital of the Company held by Shareholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Lock-in and orderly market arrangements expire one year from Readmission</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company has entered into lock-in and orderly market arrangements with certain Directors (the \"Vulcan Locked-in Shareholders\").

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Kirk Maltais</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. farmers are receiving more help from the Trump administration this year, but for many, it's simply not enough.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Farmers, frustrated by years of thin margins, are bracing for another difficult year as less than half are forecast to turn a profit in 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Steve Turner farms 3,250 acres of corn, soybeans, and other crops in Chandlerville, Ill., alongside his wife and two sons. His sons also operate a small trucking firm, with one of his sons selling seeds on the side. Jobs outside of the farm are common in rural areas, and they've become increasingly important for farmers needing to scrape by in tough times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"In these economic times, diversified income becomes a need and necessity,\" said Turner.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the first time since Covid-19 in 2020, under 50% of producers are expected to be in the black, according to data from the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp., otherwise known as Farmer Mac. Fears of another tough year in farm country have lenders cautious ahead of the start of spring planting in April, with farm debt estimated by the Department of Agriculture to rise by 5.2% in 2026 to $625 billion, a new record.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We see farmers saying 'yeah, it's getting too hard,'\" said Shelby Bass, author of an outlook published by agricultural lender AgAmerica this month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's even with the $44 billion in direct payments coming from the federal government this year - the second-largest swath of federal aid to farmers on record. This is the first week for farmers to file to receive their share of an $11 billion tranche of so-called \"bridge payments,\" according to the USDA.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While farmers welcome the help, the aid comes after years of falling behind financially, meaning that a lot of the money will go directly back to creditors. With costs for necessary inputs such as fertilizer and seeds higher than they were at this time last year, cash-strapped farmers are stuck in a vicious cycle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If you're having to spend a lot of your money on debt payments, you have a lot less cash available,\" said Carrie Litkowski, senior economist with the USDA's Economic Research Service, during a presentation at the USDA's Agricultural Outlook Forum in Arlington, Va. last week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amplifying the crunch in working capital is the Supreme Court ruling Friday that global tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act were illegal. President Trump has said that his tariff campaign will continue using different statutes, instituting a new 10% global tariff using Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, and promising even more.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A new round of tariff wars is the last thing farmers like Turner want to hear. \"It adds a lot of market uncertainty out here, and a lot of volatility,\" he said. \"Usually, that doesn't work long-term for our profitability.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to Turner, his budget going into planting season is tight. \"Every input we do to raise a crop is higher than last year,\" said Turner. \"It makes it very hard to set up this year being very profitable.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some 93% of agricultural lenders surveyed by Farmer Mac said that they expect farm debt to grow over the course of this year. A separate study from Purdue University shows that farmers in Indiana will likely lose money for almost any row crop they plant this spring.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Corn planted in average soil with a typical corn-soybean crop rotation is projected to lose nearly $150 an acre, while soybeans planted in a normal rotation are seen losing almost $90 an acre. Planting corn is more expensive due to the amount of fertilizer it requires.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the other side, prices for corn and soybeans have improved since finding lows last summer. But they remain roughly 80 cents to 90 cents a bushel off from what Purdue forecasts as \"break-even levels\" for farmers working on average productivity soil.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But forecasts are assuming that a major weather event doesn't completely reshape the market, which is not a safe bet. In spring 2019, lackluster farming economics turned around as flooding prevented many farmers from planting crops. While taking many Midwestern farmers out for the year, the flooding pushed corn prices up 20% by that summer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Absent severe weather disturbances in the Corn Belt, farmers are left in a position where they must once again withstand economic pressure that doesn't appear to be going anywhere.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Let's just say this is a continuing cycle,\" said Turner. \"It's going to get very difficult for a lot of guys out here.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
