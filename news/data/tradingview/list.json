MorenoDV_ states that this important observation suggests a complete exit of weak hands from the market as well as significant absorption of recent liquidation pressure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking ahead, if the STH holders maintain a muted response to other bearish triggers, it would suggest a market stabilization phase that has historically preceded a bullish market recovery arc. On the other hand, an increase in STH exchange inflows and realized losses would indicate market drawdown is incomplete, and investors still stand at risk of further decline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Bitcoin Price Overview </span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is valued at $67,007, reflecting a slight rebound of 4.41% in the last 24 hours.

While he cautioned that the results are far from production-ready, the broader message was clear: AI is rapidly transforming how blockchain infrastructure is built.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>AI Coding Is Moving at Unprecedented Speed</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to Buterin, creating a rough version of such a complex roadmap in just two weeks would have seemed unrealistic only six months ago. He said that the AI-generated code likely contains critical bugs and incomplete sections. Some components may be placeholders rather than fully implemented features.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, the speed of development itself marks a shift.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Buterin also shared that he recently built a version of his blog software in about an hour using an open-source AI model running locally on his laptop. More advanced systems, he suggested, could potentially complete similar tasks even faster.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The takeaway is not that AI can instantly produce secure blockchain infrastructure. Rather, it shows how dramatically development timelines are shrinking.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Speed Is Only Half the Story</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Buterin stressed that faster coding alone is not enough. In his view, the real opportunity lies in balancing speed with stronger security practices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Instead of using AI only to write more code, developers can use it to:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Generate significantly more test cases</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Run deeper security audits</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Create multiple independent implementations of the same system</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Formally verify critical components</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>One collaborator from the LeanEthereum initiative reportedly used AI to help produce a machine-verifiable proof for one of the complex mathematical theorems underlying STARK-based cryptography.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For Ethereum, which increasingly relies on advanced zero-knowledge systems, such verification tools are essential.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Formal Verification May Become Standard Practice</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>A core principle of LeanEthereum is to formally verify all components wherever possible. Formal verification means mathematically proving that code behaves exactly as intended.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In blockchain systems that secure billions of dollars in value, reducing even small vulnerabilities can have an outsized impact. Buterin suggested that AI is accelerating the ability to produce verified proofs and stress-test implementations at scale.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He was careful to add that no one should expect to enter a single prompt and receive perfectly secure code. Bugs, inconsistencies and design trade-offs will remain part of the process.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, debugging and testing cycles could happen five times faster and far more thoroughly than before.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Could Ethereum’s Roadmap Finish Earlier Than Expected?</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>While Buterin did not make any firm predictions, he encouraged the community to stay open to the possibility that Ethereum’s long-term roadmap could be completed faster than many anticipate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>More importantly, he suggested that it could reach higher security standards than traditionally expected for complex distributed systems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If AI continues improving at its current pace, development bottlenecks that once slowed blockchain upgrades may become less restrictive.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Heather Haddon</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dutch Bros, a coffee and beverage chain still unknown in many parts of the country, is becoming a thorn in Starbucks's side.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Founded in 1992 by two Oregon dairy farmers transitioning away from their family business, Dutch Bros is now the third-largest coffee chain by U.S. sales and locations, behind Starbucks and Dunkin', according to market-research firm Technomic. Starbucks still accounts for around 48% of sales in the U.S coffee-chain market, but Dutch Bros and other smaller competitors have started to erode its lead.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gen Z has flocked to Dutch Bros for its eye-popping energy drinks and other cold beverages that people can customize, like an OG Gummy Bear Lemonade and the Shark Attack Rebel, with layers of green, red and yellow fruit flavors — and 111 grams of sugar for an iced large. The 1,140-location chain also sells coffee, but little of it is hot, with roughly 90% of Dutch's drinks served cold. That's how young people like their beverages, chain executives say.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The market is moving that way, and that is the core to what we do,\" says Dutch Bros' chief marketing officer, Tana Davila.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Her job is to help the Tempe, Ariz., company maintain its edge in an increasingly competitive time for beverages. Starbucks in January announced it would introduce its own customizable energy drinks, news that drove down Dutch Bros' stock. McDonald's is introducing new cold beverages in the U.S. this year after testing crafted sodas and energy drinks in some U.S. stores, with drinks featuring Red Bull especially doing well, executives say.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now, customized energy drinks account for roughly 25% of Dutch Bros' $1.6 billion business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here is how Dutch Bros intends to manage rising competition, and what's next in the beverage wars.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Battling the big names</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WSJ: The energy-drink business is getting increasingly competitive, with Starbucks, McDonald's and other bigger brands moving in. How are you trying to keep your edge?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>TANA DAVILA: I see us as the creators of customizable, made-to-order energy. It evolved from guests coming and wanting to add flavors to energy drinks. Over time, we've built our own proprietary energy-drink brand, Rebel. We flavor it, we let you add whatever toppings you want. The energy market is growing at a faster rate than coffee, so we are very well positioned to continue to lead.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WSJ: More beverage brands are letting their customers tailor their drinks, but it is hard to pull off and still deliver fast service. How are your drink customizations unique and why are they important to Dutch Bros?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DAVILA: It's been central to the brand from the very beginning. With our coffee, energy, lemonade, tea and sodas, you can basically build whatever you want. It's 40-plus flavors and you can mix and match them and build your own custom creations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We're now featuring a banana-bread mocha. You can have that as a latte, you can do it as a mocha or a blended coffee freeze. You can add syrup drizzles on top, you can add soft-top cold foam. If you want to add boba or other types of toppings, or make it a protein-based drink, you can. It is pretty endless.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WSJ: Where do you find inspiration for flavors or trends?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DAVILA: We're looking at what's happening in the grocery stores, what's happening in third-wave coffee bars, what's happening in the mixology space. A good example is putting boba on an energy drink. I saw it within [teas], but really the idea came from what I was seeing in cocktails. Another example is cookie butter that was trending, especially with the younger demographic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Obstacles and innovations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WSJ: What are some of the brand's biggest challenges right now, and how are you addressing them?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DAVILA: The No. 1 is just convenience. There's not a location close to me. That's table stakes [a basic requirement]. Other brands have more locations and better convenience. On our side, we do extremely well in loyalty. Our opportunity is just taking away these more-logistical aspects to allow us to better compete in the market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WSJ: Only about a third of your business is in the morning, while the rest is midday and later. Chains like Starbucks and Dunkin' are fighting for more of that afternoon business. But, as a coffee chain, don't you want more morning business?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DAVILA: We obviously have some strength in selling treats and indulgences and our energy offering, which tends to be more afternoon. One of our opportunities is to drive that habitual routine. We asked loyalty customers what else they wanted, and ordering ahead was the No. 1 thing they requested. They didn't know if they could get in and out on their morning commute, it wasn't predictable enough for them, and they didn't have time to wait in the long line.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WSJ:  Starbucks has had mobile ordering for years. Can you catch up?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DAVILA: We honestly don't have a goal. We want to provide a different way for people to use the brand. You have to be a loyalty member to order ahead, so it serves in the broader loyalty strategy. Right now, it's about 14% of orders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WSJ:  You have a low percentage of food sales compared with Starbucks. Is that a problem you are trying to address?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DAVILA: Food is another good example where we're trying to remove a barrier to visitation and a reason why people aren't coming to us today, particularly in the morning. Historically, it was basically a couple of flavors of muffin tops. We're adding a bakery assortment. Then there's a hot-food component, like two breakfast sliders. I've done quite a bit of work on how the assortment has the maximum reach with the least number of items.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WSJ: Restaurant chains are battling to attract younger consumers. What do you know about Gen Z consumers, and how are you attracting their dollars?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DAVILA: They buy a higher share of iced beverages. They love to customize and love friendly service. Those are all areas where we really excel. We are very focused on social media and how our brand shows up there. We also have merch drops, where we'll give away something, like straw toppers and bumper stickers, with a drink purchase.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WSJ:  Do people really care about bumper stickers?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DAVILA: People do, you would be surprised. It's something different and unexpected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Spreading the reach</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WSJ:  You grew your store count by 16% last year, faster than many competitors. Can you grow at that clip and not struggle to attract sufficient sales?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DAVILA: We've done it through innovation and making sure we have relevant offerings and driving innovation, like protein coffee. The second piece is the Dutch Rewards program. We're really proud that [around] 73% of our transactions go through it. We find that our best guests want to be in our program, and they want to engage with the brand. They earn points and are incentivized to come to earn free drinks. It's our way of discounting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The third piece is around advertising, and specifically in new markets. There are still a large group of people that are unfamiliar with our brand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WSJ: How are you trying to change that?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DAVILA: I certainly aspire for us to be a household name. We started on the West Coast, have been moving east and then there's opportunity to continue to move into the Midwest and the Northeast. We also are not afraid to build density in markets versus having a one-off type of approach.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We have over 200 shops in Texas. Most of those are basically new over the last couple of years. What we've been able to do there is introduce the market to the brand, create scale. We have density in terms of the market and the penetration.</span></p></span></div></div>",

It's about territory, and one side is encroaching on the other's home turf.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The competitors are two of the nation's biggest supermarket chains: Publix and Kroger.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While they have long sparred in the Deep South, Florida-based Publix has set up a new front near Kroger's headquarters in Cincinnati. Publix, a beloved Florida grocer with about 1,400 stores, envisions a dozen locations operating in Kentucky by year's end.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's the frontier of Publix,\" said Devin Dosher, assistant manager of the Publix in Boone County, who has spent 13 years with the company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kroger, the nation's largest supermarket operator, with about 2,700 stores, isn't standing pat. It dropped prices at its northern Kentucky stores when Publix moved in and opened a refurbished supermarket in the area last fall. In its hunt for growth, Kroger wants to open more stores in Publix's home state, including in Jacksonville.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Executives at Cincinnati-based Kroger said nearby stores initially took a sales hit when Publix first opened, but they have since returned to earlier levels. But Publix still has more locations to open, and that could test Kroger's dominance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The battle illustrates the potential risks and rewards of spending millions on real estate and new operations to win over shoppers. Kroger and Publix aren't just competing with each other; they're facing the likes of national retailers including Walmart and other regional outposts for food.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ultimately, consumers might be the big winners. Shoppers at both stores say they are enjoying increased promotions and buy-one-get-one-free deals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This will be an interesting experiment,\" said Craig Johnson of Customer Growth Partners, a Connecticut retail consultant. Publix invests in the customer experience, from clean stores to more checkout lines that make it easier to get in and out. Kroger, while it still invests in its stores, is more focused on deals to attract shoppers, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Supermarkets operate with razor-thin profit margins, stoking fierce competition to win as many customers as possible. That competition involves routinely monitoring rivals' prices and shifting their own accordingly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Expanding service areas gives companies a chance to build leverage with suppliers and offer goods at lower prices, a potential boon to shoppers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aldi has said it plans to open 180 new U.S. stores this year, rapidly expanding into Colorado and Arizona, putting pressure on Albertsons's Safeway stores. Sprouts Farmers Market is expanding its presence in Whole Foods Market's hometown of Austin, Texas. Whole Foods has been trying to grow in the Northeast.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About 20 miles south of downtown Cincinnati, the new Publix sits just past a roundabout at the front entrance of a glitzy subdivision known as Triple Crown. The building with a red-brick facade and bright green letters anchors a small shopping center in the suburban area.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hundreds of people lined up outside the new supermarket on opening day last May. Some superfans came in Publix-branded flip-flops and shirts, while others were eager to get a \"pub sub\" or the chain's signature key lime pie. Lines of parked cars stretched out from the parking lot for at least the following three weeks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Martin Schmidlin, a Cincinnati elevator inspector, hasn't shopped at Kroger since Publix opened a store in the area. Schmidlin has often vacationed in Florida and was thrilled once he heard Publix was coming to town. He said that, while some Publix items are more expensive, the store makes up for it with buy-one-get-one-free sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'Breaking' a monopoly</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Kroger long had a monopoly on the area,\" Schmidlin said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The new Publix was built with bright lights and wider aisles to give customers more space to navigate with shopping carts. It has a smoothie and coffee bar and a seating area where a group of local women gathers every Wednesday to play mahjong.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Publix officials said that while some consumers believe it might be more expensive, its value proposition is just as competitive once its sales and store experience are factored in.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Debbie Caldwell, who lives in the Cincinnati area, is originally from Georgia and has been to many Publix stores. But Caldwell prefers Kroger, largely because of its discounts. Publix has strong loyalty in the Deep South, she said, but it might struggle to break into the market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Once the newness wears off, we'll see how it goes,\" she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kroger operates about 100 stores around the Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio, metro areas. Jake Cannon, who oversees Kroger's stores in the region, said the rivalry with Publix only makes his Kroger stores sharper, in areas such as customer service, where Publix excels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Publix isn't going to try to beat us on price,\" he said. \"They can't. That's not the model.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of Kroger's newest stores in the area could serve as a competitive response to Publix. The store in Edgewood, Ky., was built with a large deli and restaurant area that rivals Publix's new format. It was meant to resemble Murray's Cheese, the famous cheesemonger in New York City's Greenwich Village, which Kroger bought in 2017. Cannon said the revamp wasn't because of Publix, but it does help the company's chances.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Andy Waters, who works at the University of Cincinnati, said that local supermarket prices dropped when Publix opened in the area.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That same month, a Kroger supermarket roughly seven miles away held a promotional event where shoppers could spin a giveaway wheel at the front of the building to win free items. Waters said his two children won free ice cream and popcorn, cementing his family's loyalty to the hometown chain. Kroger's loyalty program that allows customers to earn discounts on gasoline also helps, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"My kids love Kroger — they want to work there,\" Waters said while shopping for lunch items at the store.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Patrick Thomas at patrick.thomas@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>The crypto market is staging a sharp comeback today, with total market capitalization climbing back above $2.3 trillion. After days of heavy selling and extreme fear, buyers have stepped in, pushing major cryptocurrencies higher across the board.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So what is driving the rally in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP and why are altcoins suddenly flashing green?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here is a simple breakdown of what is happening.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>1. A Technical Bounce From “Extreme Fear”</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The biggest reason behind today’s price jump is a technical rebound.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Crypto Fear and Greed Index recently dropped to 16, deep in “extreme fear” territory. Historically, when sentiment becomes this negative, markets often see a relief rally because prices are considered oversold.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The total crypto market had fallen near $2.17 trillion before reclaiming its short-term moving average around $2.29 trillion. That recovery signaled that sellers were losing momentum and short-term buyers were returning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This type of bounce is common after sharp liquidations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>2. Massive Liquidations Cleared the Market</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earlier, geopolitical tensions following US strikes on Iranian targets triggered heavy volatility across global markets. Crypto futures were hit hard.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Roughly $515 million worth of leveraged positions were liquidated within 24 hours, according to derivatives data.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Bitcoin saw around $187 million in liquidations</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Ethereum and major altcoins followed</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Open interest remains elevated near $400 billion</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>When too many traders are using leverage, a sudden price move can force exchanges to automatically close positions. This creates sharp drops, but once the liquidations are flushed out, prices often rebound quickly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That appears to be what we are seeing today.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>3. Bitcoin Is Leading, But Altcoins Are Catching Up</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the time of writing:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Bitcoin </span><span> is trading near $66,400, up over 4 percent in 24 hours</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Ethereum </span><span> is around $1,978, gaining nearly 7 percent</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>XRP is up more than 7 percent, trading around $1.37</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Solana jumped over 9 percent</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Cardano gained nearly 7 percent</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Dogecoin climbed more than 5 percent</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>BNB added close to 5 percent</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Bitcoin dominance remains high at around 58%, which usually signals investors are still prioritizing larger, relatively safer assets. However, the strong gains in Layer 1 tokens show that risk appetite is slowly returning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>4. Short Covering Is Adding Fuel</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Funding rates across major exchanges recently turned slightly negative. That means many traders were betting on further downside.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When prices start rising unexpectedly, short sellers are forced to buy back their positions to limit losses. This creates a “short squeeze,” pushing prices even higher in a short period of time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That extra buying pressure is amplifying today’s rally.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>5. Broader Market Correlation</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto has shown a strong correlation with US equities recently, particularly the S&amp;P 500. As traditional markets stabilized, digital assets followed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The market is currently treating crypto as a macro risk asset. When stock sentiment improves, Bitcoin and altcoins tend to benefit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>What Happens Next?</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The important level to watch is around $2.27 trillion in total market cap. If the market stays above this support, the next resistance zone lies between $2.41 trillion and $2.47 trillion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Traders are closely monitoring:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>New headlines related to US and Middle East tensions</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Funding rates flipping strongly positive or negative</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Whether open interest continues to decline or rebuild</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Bitcoin dominance trends</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>If leverage rebuilds too quickly, another wave of volatility could follow. But if sentiment slowly improves without excessive speculation, this rebound could extend further.</span></p></span></div></div>",

This suite provides the large capacity, low latency, and premium user experience required for the emerging mobile AI era. </span></p><span> AI is rapidly emerging as the core engine of the intelligent world. According to IDC, AI applications and devices have seen explosive growth over the past year: global monthly active users surpassed 1 billion, AI-powered smartphones accounted for over 50% of new shipments, AI glasses and other emerging devices saw an annual growth rate of over 50%, and token consumption surged by hundreds of times. This brings great opportunities for the mobile industry but also raises multi-dimensional requirements on the network. For example, AI multimodal interactions increase uplink traffic demand by three to five times; real-time decision-making requires low latency and deterministic assurance; ubiquitous AI agents demand more secure and reliable wide-area connectivity.  Currently, 5G-A has become the mainstream commercial technology for global operators, and is also the focus of service innovation and future evolution. The U6GHz band, with its large bandwidth and superior coverage, is becoming a key band for 5G-A evolution and commercial use. Following WRC‑23, U6GHz has been designated as a key mobile communications band. China, the UAE, Brazil, and several European countries are actively promoting spectrum identification, allocation, and testing. In terms of the industry chain, mainstream CPEs and smartphones are expected to be commercially available in 2026, paving the way for large-scale commercial use of U6GHz.  Huawei's full U6GHz product suite covers a complete matrix of macro sites, micro sites, and microwave equipment, maximizing the advantages of ultra-large bandwidth in U6GHz. It precisely meets the core requirements of mobile AI applications for high capacity, low latency, and superior experience, providing a systematic solution for both the performance leap of 5G-A networks and the seamless evolution towards 6G.  To address outdoor coverage and capacity needs, Huawei has launched a series of AAU products. The U6GHz 256 TRX AAU adopts the extremely large antenna array (ELAA) design and digital-analog hybrid intelligent beamforming algorithms to deliver coverage capabilities comparable to C-band. Meanwhile, with the hyper-resolution MU-MIMO algorithm and 400 MHz ultra-large bandwidth, the product can achieve ultra-large capacity of 100 Gbps in the downlink and over 10 Gbps in the uplink, as well as optimal experience of 10 Gbps in the downlink and 1 Gbps in the uplink, to cope with the connection pressure brought by massive AI terminals and applications. To meet the network performance and deployment requirements in different scenarios, Huawei will also launch U6GHz AAUs with flexible combinations of channels and arrays, helping operators deploy 5G-A networks on a large scale in U6GHz and fully meet service requirements in the mobile AI era.  To meet the high concurrency and large capacity requirements of indoor AI applications, Huawei has launched U6GHz small cell products. They support the ultra-large bandwidth of 400 MHz in U6GHz and integrate and coordinate the U6GHz band with all sub-6 GHz bands. With simplified design and deployment, the products can help operators ensure consistent multi-dimensional experience of AI applications in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, allowing users to enjoy high-quality connections anytime and anywhere.  In terms of transmission, Huawei has launched new microwave products to meet the high‑bandwidth transmission requirements of U6GHz base stations. With industry-unique full-duplex technology, they can significantly improve the bandwidth and capacity of transport networks, meeting the peak traffic requirements of 5G-A and laying a solid foundation for evolution to 6G.  As AI adoption accelerates, U6GHz has become the key to exploring the present and unlocking the future. Huawei's full U6GHz product suite is now commercially available. It can not only address the capacity challenges of 5G-A, but also support smooth evolution to 6G. This will open up new commercial opportunities for operators and lay a robust connectivity foundation for the intelligent world.
