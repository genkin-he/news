The company forecast year-over-year revenue growth of 13% to 14%, representing a deceleration from earlier in the year.

AssetMark's platform supports 10,500 advisors and roughly $158 billion in client assets, while Efficient Advisors supports roughly $3 billion in client assets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Maiuri says his firm is buying Efficient to serve more registered investment advisors. \"Adding more RIAs to our platform is a big part of our strategic focus,\" he says, noting that the RIA sector is growing by 8% to 10% per year.

Starting next month, advisors using AssetMark's platform will be able to invest in private equity, private credit, and infrastructure funds in a single account, according to Maiuri.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The new services should help advisors appeal to wealthier clients, Maiuri says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AssetMark is also considering more acquisitions. \"We'll continue to look for opportunities like this,\" Maiuri says. \"We're growing. We're doing it organically and inorganically, and we'll continue to look for great opportunities in the marketplace.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AssetMark has an existing business relationship with Efficient Advisors. Efficient is owned by PCS Retirement, a retirement plan provider that also offers products on AssetMark's platform. PCS is owned by holding company Fiduciary Services Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both AssetMark and FSG are backed by private-equity.
