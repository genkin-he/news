            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By David Benoit, Joe Palazzolo and Khadeeja Safdar</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In April 2002, JPMorgan Chase raised a red flag about Jeffrey Epstein.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bank had noticed his accounts were cashing an unusual number of checks, many for $9,500 or $9,800 — just under the $10,000 limit that draws increased attention.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>JPMorgan filed what's known as a suspicious activity report, or SAR, to federal law enforcement because of a clear pattern of transactions typically meant to evade authorities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bank would file another report in December 2002 and another in April 2003. The flags were raised well before any public knowledge of Epstein's crimes and associations with girls and young women, but had little impact on his activities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Epstein would be arrested in Florida three years later, plead guilty in 2008, and then continue his extravagant lifestyle until 2019. He would remain a JPMorgan client until 2013, meeting with top executives from the bank and connecting them with his wealthy associates, including Leon Black and Bill Gates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The documents show the knots JPMorgan and all banks can tie themselves in, especially with lucrative clients. On the one hand, they are filing reports warning law enforcement that their client looks suspiciously criminal. But unless their regulators or law enforcement reply otherwise, the banks can continue to serve the client, having fulfilled their obligation with the SAR.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A JPMorgan spokeswoman said the SARs show the bank filed concerns early on and repeatedly about Epstein. \"It does not appear that anyone in the government or law enforcement acted on those SARs for years,\" the spokeswoman said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The reports are sent to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, part of the Treasury Department, which monitors the financial system for crimes such as money laundering and makes the reports available to law enforcement. Treasury representatives declined to comment Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The red flags were raised internally at the bank throughout its relationship with Epstein, who had dozens of accounts and moved millions of dollars. At one point, Epstein and his associates told JPMorgan staff the cash was needed to pay for fuel for his private jet, but some JPMorgan staffers were skeptical especially after media coverage of Epstein's 2006 arrest in Florida showed he was paying for sex with minors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2008, the bank filed another SAR on Epstein, citing the prosecution and flagging $800,000 in withdrawals in 2007 and 2008.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In an email exchange in 2013, JPMorgan staffers discussed whether they should include concerns in a SAR about Epstein potentially using the cash to pay for sex, not just for jet fuel. The bank did file a SAR raising concerns about the fuel story, showing one Epstein account took out more than $200,000 in cash in 2011 and $290,000 in 2012.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I think we should stick to taking out cash and traveling abroad to pay for fuel is not normal business practice. True, he has been known to pay cash for his massages but only minors are the issue and we have no proof, \" one JPMorgan staffer wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Once the bank decided to close Epstein's accounts in 2013, another JPMorgan staffer wrote to Mary Erdoes, who oversaw the private bank, saying Epstein had called him. \"Still looking for closure. Understands better now the impact of his cash activities — sticking to aviation needs,\" he wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the same message, the banker asked his boss whether JPMorgan could continue to work with Epstein through his clients' accounts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Erdoes replied with a single letter: \"Y.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Erdoes has said she didn't know about his crimes and the bank has said it regrets its relationship with Epstein.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2016, JPMorgan filed additional SARs that found that Epstein had sent more than $310,000 to a former model. The bank flagged the transfers for \"possible procurement of sexual\" services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The documents originate from a 2023 case that the U.S. Virgin Islands attorney general filed against JPMorgan, alleging that the bank facilitated Epstein's sex trafficking operation. JPMorgan agreed to pay $75 million that year to settle the suit before it went to trial, without admitting wrongdoing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The case exposed how deep Epstein's ties were with the bank. He introduced prominent clients and pitched executives on big deals. Bankers also continued meeting with him after firing him as a client in 2013.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Officials at the Gates Foundation also were also well aware of Epstein's checkered past in 2011 when the organization was in discussions with Epstein and JPMorgan executive Jes Staley on creating a potential charitable fund for super wealthy individuals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Bill and Jes share a mutual 'friend' in Jeff Epstein (an important behind the scenes 'broker' in the finance world with an unseemly reputation due to a criminal conviction: From JPM, we know that Jeff has the ear of Jes and has helped recruit (behind the scenes) some of JPM's biggest clients,\" according to a Gates Foundation memo.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gates has said it was a mistake to meet with Epstein. Staley, who left JPMorgan and went on to run Barclays, has maintained he never knew about Epstein's alleged crimes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Epstein was arrested again in 2019 and died in prison that August. Three days after his death, JPMorgan began filing SARs detailing even more of his history. The bank eventually reported more than $1 billion in transactions connected to Epstein associates, including Victoria's Secret billionaire Les Wexner and hedge-fund manager Glenn Dubin.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Black has said he paid Epstein for estate-planning and tax advice. Wexner has said he was defrauded by Epstein, his money manager, and cut him off in 2007. Dubin has said he was unaware of Epstein's alleged crimes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The filing said the wires were \"consistent with negative media involving sex trafficking of minors\" and alerted the regulator to Epstein's activity in Russia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to David Benoit at David.Benoit@wsj.com, Joe Palazzolo at Joe.Palazzolo@wsj.com and Khadeeja Safdar at khadeeja.safdar@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The update adds support for Spanish, Italian, French, Korean and Japanese, making it easier for developers and ecosystem products to localize wallets and improve UX for non-English users. Technical details and implementation notes are available in the release notes on GitHub.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>ADA Info</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cardano </span><span> is a public blockchain platform for smart contracts, similar to Ethereum. Launched in 2017, it was developed by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. The Cardano project is known for its emphasis on a research-driven approach, and it was the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Cardano blockchain operates in a unique way. It uses a new proof of stake algorithm known as Ouroboros. Unlike proof-of-work blockchains, which rely on miners to verify transactions and create new blocks, the Ouroboros algorithm chooses a node (stakeholder) to generate a new block based on the proportion of cryptocurrency that stakeholder holds. This makes the Cardano network highly scalable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cardano’s ADA token is used for transactions within the network as well as a way for network participants to vote on changes to the platform. It is designed to ensure that owners can participate in the operation of the network. Because of this, those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes to the software.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of the most distinguishing features of Cardano is its layered architecture including the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL) and the Cardano Computation Layer (CCL). The CSL manages the cryptocurrency ADA, and handles transactions, while the CCL is responsible for the smart contracts and computation. This separation allows for better network security, flexibility, and simplicity in the design of smart contracts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In conclusion, Cardano is an innovative blockchain platform that“s designed to be secure, scalable, and sustainable. It”s unique in the cryptocurrency world due to its science-based approach, its layered architecture, and its focus on stakeholder voting.</span></p></span></div></div>",

But Circle is basically a money-market fund with tech wrapping. If they're holding $500 billion to $1 trillion in Treasurys and rates move 100 basis points, that's a massive duration risk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We lived through Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). I watched \"safe\" Treasury positions blow up when liquidity disappeared. Why wouldn't Circle face the same disaster if they scale to Fed infrastructure levels? Or are you assuming they'd have Fed backstop facilities similar to the discount window?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Also, political question: Can you imagine [Sen.] Elizabeth Warren's reaction when a private crypto company becomes systemically important to U.S. banking?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Patricia</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dear Patricia,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You're asking the right question, which is why you're in finance and not a crypto influencer with a YouTube channel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yes, Circle faces duration risk if it scales to the $500 billion to $1 trillion range. And yes, SVB should terrify anyone paying attention. But here's the critical difference: SVB was a bank pretending to be a tech company. Circle is a tech company that would become, if my thesis plays out, a systemically important financial institution - whether they want to or not.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Circle gets Fed backstop facilities, discount-window access, FDIC insurance on USDC (or something functionally equivalent) and enough regulatory scrutiny that its compliance department becomes larger than its engineering team. It becomes a boring utility that happens to process a trillion dollars in settlements annually.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Will Circle's executives like this? Probably not. Will they have a choice? No.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Your political instinct is correct. Pick any regulator - they'd all lose their minds. But here's the beautiful irony: The solution to \"private crypto company becomes systemically important\" is to wrap it in so much regulation and government backstop that it becomes de facto nationalized.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Circle becomes the post office of digital money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Circle becomes the post office of digital money. Boring, essential, quasigovernmental and impossible to kill. Its executives will spend more time in Senate hearings than in board meetings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As for duration risk: If Circle reaches Fed infrastructure scale and doesn't have sophisticated risk management, it deserves what happens. But unlike SVB, it won't be allowed to fail quietly. Too many banks depend on it by that point. The Fed either backs it or admits the system was always a house of cards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I know which way I'd bet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Charlie</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>P.S. Somewhere in Circle's San Francisco office, there's a founder who dreamed of disrupting banking. That person is now filling out their 47th regulatory filing of the week. This is what winning looks like.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dear Charlie,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You explained Fed policy, made me laugh and validated my rage all in one article. That line - \"And you wonder why nothing works anymore\" - should be on a T-shirt.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>My insurance premiums are up 40%, my grocery bill is insane, and now I find out the Fed is losing $200 billion annually on a problem they created?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the Fed is this incompetent with banking system liquidity, why should I trust them with anything? Shouldn't I buy silver, gold and bitcoin and give up on the dollar entirely?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Peter</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dear Peter,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Should you trust the Fed? Of course not. They pay banks $200 billion a year not to use something banks actually need. Then everyone stands around, confused about why the system doesn't work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But distrusting the Fed and abandoning the dollar are completely different moves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Your landlord doesn't accept silver. Your insurance company doesn't take bitcoin. And the IRS will hear your theory about returning to the gold standard - right before they garnish your wages.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Fed deserves every bit of your skepticism. Your grocery bill proves it's either lying or incompetent, possibly both. But being angry at the system and having a workable alternative to the system are two completely different problems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One is easy. The other requires moving to El Salvador.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Charlie</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>P.S. I agree about the T-shirt. If I make one, I'll send you the first copy. Won't fix your grocery bill, but at least you'll look good being angry about it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dear Charlie,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Futures prices are already anchored in the stock markets, even without the eight-hour funding rate settlement. Technically, perpetual futures should function efficiently without the need for periodic settlements or payouts every eight hours.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Also, regarding the discussion about bank leverage, reserves, clearing and liquidity - it seems there could be a more robust approach. For instance, banks could provide security against the leverage they extend, drawing from their reserves, assets and collateral they receive from borrowers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Leverage providers could be incentivized throughout an ongoing perpetual-futures trade by receiving a nominal, dynamically adjusted fee based on the trade's duration. That would create a simpler, more transparent and self-sustaining system without generating systemic stress.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Patrick</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We're stuck with eight-hour settlements because changing requires admitting we were wrong, and financial people would rather eat glass.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dear Patrick,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You've stumbled onto something embarrassing: The entire financial system is running on technology designed by people who thought eight-hour intervals were sophisticated because they could divide 24 by three.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Perpetual futures don't need eight-hour cycles. BitMEX picked eight hours in 2016 because it was tidy, not because physics demanded it. It's the QWERTY keyboard of crypto - we're stuck with it because changing requires admitting we were wrong. Financial people would rather eat glass.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The funding rate simply needs to keep futures prices honest by making arbitrage attractive. DeFi protocols figured this out years ago. Perpetual Protocol does it every block - constantly funding settles in seconds. No more timing games. No more sophisticated traders opening positions after funding and closing before the next one, like teenagers sneaking home after curfew.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Why haven't Binance and Bybit adopted this? Because they're making money on the current stupidity. Never interrupt an enemy when he's making a mistake - especially when you're the one collecting fees.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now for the truly hilarious part: U.S. banks get free intraday overdrafts from the Fed. Zero cost. Just post some collateral and overdraw all you want, as long as you're square by 6 p.m.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before 2008, banks paid market rates for intraday liquidity. This created what economists call \"discipline\" and normal people call \"not being morons.\" After 2008, the Fed decided to give away the store. Massive reserves, free overdrafts, zero price signals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The result? Banks are sitting on trillions in unproductive reserves because they have no idea what liquidity costs. Neither does anyone else.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Fed's own economists admit intraday credit has real value, but refuse to charge for it. It's like running a bar where the drinks are free, but you need a credit card on file. Everyone gets drunk and nobody learns anything.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Your proposal - dynamic fees based on duration, real collateral, transparent pricing - isn't radical. It's how perps already work. Crypto traders in 2025 have better risk management than Bank of America.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Banks could do continuous settlement. They could price intraday credit dynamically. They could manage collateral instead of tracking it in Excel like it's 1987. Technology exists. What's missing is the willingness to admit that the current system is a tire fire wrapped in compliance theater.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So yes, your idea works. And yes, it'll happen. Either because banks wise up, or because the next crisis forces regulators to stop pretending that free liquidity and moral hazard are sound public policy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I'm betting on the crisis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yours in fiscal anarchy,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Charlie</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>P.S. The really depressing part? Someone at the Fed likely has already written a paper explaining all of this. It's sitting in a drawer somewhere, gathering dust next to the report about how maybe we shouldn't have bailed out everyone in 2008.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Charlie Garcia is founder and a managing partner of R360, a peer-to-peer organization for individuals and families with a net worth of $100 million or more.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Agree?
