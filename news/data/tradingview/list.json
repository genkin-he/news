The press release reported second quarter 2025 adjusted earnings of approximately $5.50 per share, which was \"below . . . prior expectations\" due to \"medical cost pressures in all three lines of business.\" The Company also announced that it \"expects these medical cost pressures to continue into the second half of the year\" and cut guidance for expected adjusted earnings per share 10.2% at the midpoint, from \"at least $24.50 per share\" to a \"range of $21.50 to $22.50 per share.\" The press release revealed Molina was experiencing a \"short-term earnings pressure\" from a \"dislocation between premium rates and a medical cost trend which has recently accelerated.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On this news, Molina's stock price fell $6.97 per share, or 2.9%, to close at $232.61 per share on July 7, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then, on July 23, 2025, Molina issued a press release reporting its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025 and further slashing the Company's full-year 2025 earnings guidance.

Molina also cut its guidance for its full year 2025 GAAP net income 27% to $912 million.

The Q3 work program consisted of sampling and additional geological mapping. The purpose of the exploration program was to validate the previous results and to aid in designing a drill program. Phase 1 and 2 results confirmed the accuracy of the historical Newmont results and, in some instances, exceeded the earlier results. Furthermore, geologic mapping shows that the previous drilling may not have been in the most optimal direction. Our geological team will determine a new drill direction.

The work was a continuation of the Phase 1 program summarized in the Company's news release dated September 18, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Phase 2 program focused on the Joramina and Randypata Zones. Several old mine workings were located and sampled in both exploration phases. A long, well-developed 157 metre drift trending with an azimuth of 120 degrees was located within the main Joramina area, yet it was never documented in any of the previous operator exploration programs. Thirty-one samples were taken from the drift in 5-meter composite chips. The best gold results show two consecutive samples returning 10 metres of 2.32 grams Au/tonne. The best silver result was a 5-metre composite returning 4.085 ounces Ag/tonne. The drift is within the area of the proposed drilling and is in excellent condition and may be used in the future for underground drill sites.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Additional surface sampling was conducted approximately 100 metres northeast of the drift confirming that the silver-gold mineralization is structurally controlled with several fractures and veinlets trending NE-SW dipping Northwest. One chip sample across 0.70 metres returned 17.41 grams Au/tonne and 13.94 ounces Ag/tonne. Galena (Lead Sulphide) and Sphalerite (Zinc Sulphide) are present in the veins but have not yet been assayed for these elements. The Company will assay some of the samples for lead and zinc when check assays are being performed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Phase 2 program also included a brief surface review of the Randypata Zone. Twenty-one samples were taken over the historic 2-kilometre Ag anomaly. This area is untested by drilling. The best result came from an area where a road cut exposed a strongly oxidized breccia, where a random composite grab sample returned 0.20 grams Au/tonne and 8.55 ounces Ag/tonne. Follow-up work is required in this area to determine the extent of the Ag mineralization.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Magma is pleased with the results of the first two phases of the initial exploration programs. The Company is now convinced the previous drill programs did not adequately test the Joramina zones. A drill program will be designed to test the gold-silver mineralized structures with the optimal drill direction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Seventy samples were collected during phase 2 and analyzed at the Independent Mining Lab Services based in Huancayo in south-central Peru.

However, Trump told reporters after the meeting that Nvidia's Blackwell chips weren't specifically discussed, according to multiple reports.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump said he told Xi that Beijing would have to negotiate with Nvidia directly but the U.S. was willing to be \"the arbitrator or the referee\", according to Reuters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nvidia has been targeted by Chinese authorities, who have discouraged the use of its AI processors by domestic customers. Nvidia is currently forecasting  no Chinese revenue for its current quarter, which implies a loss of between $2 billion and $5 billion in potential sales, according to the company's executives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, signs of U.S. spending are strong. Each of Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Google-parent Alphabet said in earnings reports on Wednesday that they will raise their capital expenditure, largely due to investment in AI data centers.

President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping struck a relatively positive tone Thursday after their first meeting in six years, agreeing to another truce without addressing the core issues at the heart of their intensifying rivalry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The two agreed the U.S. would cut the 20% fentanyl-related tariffs it implemented early this year in half as China agreed to do more to curb the flow of fentanyl precursors. That would bring tariffs levied this year on China down to 47% from 57%. It also extended by a year a pause on an increase in the reciprocal tariff that was set to go into effect Nov. 10.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beijing also agreed to buy soybeans — 12 million metric tons through January and then a minimum 25 million metric tons a year for the next three years, easing pressure on American farmers who had been reeling as China turned to Argentina and Brazil for its purchases.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most important, the leaders said they would hit pause on measures that fueled the latest flare-up. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business that the U.S. would suspend for a year a change in its Affiliate Rule that significantly expanded the number of Chinese companies on its so-called entity list by including subsidiaries of those already on the blacklist. Beijing said it would delay new rare earth controls that could restrict critical inputs for autos, semiconductors and military equipment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The de-escalation took a worst-case scenario off the table for markets and gave them the benefit of lowered tariffs for now. The general positive tone out of the 100-minute meeting — with Trump rating it a 12/10 — and both leaders stressing that the stability of the relationship is good for investors, could mean investors have more muted reactions to future flare-ups in the relationship, says Vivian Lin Thurston, portfolio manager for William Blair's Emerging Markets Growth fund.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The discussions could also be a near-term positive for companies like Nvidia that have been caught in the middle of the escalation as U.S. restrictions on China's access to advanced technology has hit the Chinese sales of chipmakers like Nvidia. One of Xi's priorities in recent years has been to get the U.S. to loosen its expanding web of export controls.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Thursday, the U.S. signaled it would ease some of its restrictions, but a White House official said the two sides didn't discuss Nvidia's more advanced Blackwell chip.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After initially banning the sale of advanced chips, like Nvidia's H20, to China, Trump eased the restrictions. However, Beijing has been pushing its companies to not buy them and instead use domestic alternatives as it tries to reduce its self-reliance. Trump said Thursday that Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang would be talking with Chinese officials.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Much of what was agreed upon between the leaders has yet to be finalized. Bessent said the agreement trade negotiators hashed out in Malaysia ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting could be signed as soon as next week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But analysts stress that this detente, like the others this year, are still fragile, with the details often contributing to recent flare-ups. \"This does look like a standstill, with both sides agreeing to pause some of the more effective technology export controls but there are still a lot of issues unresolved,\" says Everett Eissenstat, partner at Squire Patton Boggs, who was formerly deputy director of the National Economic Council in the first Trump administration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the list of issues the two discussed, including the suspension of port fees and a finalization for Chinese company ByteDance to divest TikTok coming in the coming weeks and months, analysts taking a step back stressed the fragility of the situation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deal is largely a return to the fragile truce of earlier in the year — with many of the potential irritants in the intensifying relationship still looming.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is all just walking back from the ledge on few areas where we were walking toward it. Compare now to six months ago, it's worse — with a lot of collateral damage, most notably with the billions of dollars U.S. agriculture has lost,\" says Philip Luck, director of the CSIS Economics Program who previously served as deputy chief economist at the State Department in the Biden administration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump said he plans a state visit to China in April, with Xi expected to visit the U.S. after, with those meetings serving as anchors for more progress in the relationship and potentially an eventual deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But that also leaves time for continued volatility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The most important takeaway: Both countries have found levers that work to bring the other side to the table, if they need to,\" says Owen Tedford, analyst at Beacon Policy Advisors. \"It would not surprise me when the relationship inevitably slips back again to see these floated again or reimposed.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Reshma Kapadia at reshma.kapadia@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
