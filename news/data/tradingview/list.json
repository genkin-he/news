As traditional drivers of consumption falter, a generation raised on e-commerce and hustle culture is seeking comfort elsewhere.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wellness has become the new luxury, but with a metaphysical twist. What was once limited to gyms and health supplements now includes meditation apps, temple retreats, sound healing, and traditional medicine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Digital meditation platforms, premium wellness products, and spiritual tourism are reshaping consumer spending as young Chinese prioritize emotional well-being over traditional status symbols,\" said analysts at consumer research publication Jing Daily. On Xiaohongshu, China's Instagram-like lifestyle platform, the most-searched wellness hashtags in the first half of 2025 were \"spiritual healing\" and \"temple tourism.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even China's retail scene has been transformed by this mood. Cafes and teahouses in Beijing and Chengdu now double as pseudo-temples, selling fortune charms, herbal infusions, and \"Stay-Up-Late Water\" tonics meant to balance urban overstimulation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jewelry sellers livestreaming on Taobao report surging sales of crystal bracelets and talismans, products that blend fashion with mysticism. One online category tracker estimated more than a million units of such items sold in January alone, totaling roughly 100 million yuan ($14 million) in revenue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"China is at the starting point of the era of spiritual consumption, with diverse core consumption motivations for trendy products,\" analysts at ZheShang Securities said in a research note.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Temple tourism, once a niche pursuit, has become a social phenomenon. Travel platform Qunar shows visits to temple scenic areas up more than 300% year-over-year in early 2025, with about half the visitors born after 1990.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Popular sites such as Hangzhou's Lingyin Temple or Chongqing's Huayan Temple now rank alongside theme parks in online popularity metrics. Many of these young pilgrims aren't strictly religious. They are seeking something else: order, symbolism, and a sense of calm in an increasingly unpredictable environment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This change in mind-set fits within a broader cultural arc that includes the \"Buddha-like\" attitude and the \"lying flat\" movement — rejections of relentless competition in favor of detachment. When the external ladder feels shaky, many turn inward or sideways, experimenting with astrology, breathwork, or incense-lit rituals that blur the line between spirituality and self-care.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Brands have noticed. Global and domestic companies are layering ritual and authenticity into their marketing. Some luxury labels have quietly joined with wellness retreats, while Chinese lifestyle companies are launching product lines inspired by temple aesthetics or traditional medicine heritage. The appeal isn't necessarily faith but grounding — a sense that consumption can be linked to reflection rather than ambition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet the trend carries risks. The Chinese government remains officially atheist and keeps tight control over organized religion. Commercialization of spiritual themes walks a fine line, and companies that lean too heavily on superstition may face scrutiny. Analysts also caution that the trend may prove cyclical — an emotional coping mechanism tied to the current downturn rather than a permanent shift in values.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For investors, the new landscape offers both opportunity and caution. Listed wellness and lifestyle platforms, tourism firms with temple-town exposure, and consumer brands tied to traditional medicine could benefit from this wave of emotional and spiritual consumption. But the winners will be those who understand the deeper motivation: the search for stability and identity in uncertain times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a country where \"consumption downgrade\" has become a buzzword, the rise of spiritual consumption represents not withdrawal but reorientation. It replaces conspicuous display with introspection, trading \"look what I own\" for \"look how I feel.\" As China's economic model evolves, so too does its consumer soul — and for the country's youth, meaning itself has become the most sought-after luxury.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to editors@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>How many traders close at the target?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Answer to this simple question is not too many. If I were to look at my own history, a lot of my trades have been closed at a point that was not the desired target. This is important to the context of “Slow and Spread”.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before we come to that let me share a market scenario. Imagine indices have been trading with a tight range of around 3% for over 3 months. Right after coming out of that range, we expect the index to blow past the previous highs. When that does not happen, one would like to re-think. This reminds us of the times we are in right now.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now, to take care of this scenario, one would like to take it slow. With slow we mean less aggressive. With lack of aggression comes inherent reduction in risk. Reduced risk automatically makes us more efficient. The logic behind being more efficient is you either win more or lose less. With lack of aggression, we definitely lose less and thereby become more efficient.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We are talking about lowering the aggression or slowing down by using Option Spreads. This is a topic that has been touched upon often but like Table Salt it has a million use cases. This is one of the sweetest. Let us understand and analyse.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Option Spread means a combination trade where one Buys an Option and Sells an Option simultaneously. There are many kinds of Option Spreads. The one that we are talking about is the Vertical Spreads.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vertical Debit Spreads are the spreads that has both options of the same type and expiry date. Also, the debit element of spreads indicate we have to pay premium to get into the trade. Higher Strike Calls and lower Strike Puts are relatively less expensive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vertical Debit Spreads will involve Buying a Call/Put and Selling a Higher Strike Call/ Lower Strike Put. This will make us have a premium outflow.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Example: With a stock trading at 1500</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bullish Spread = Buy 1500 Call &amp; Sell 1540 Call</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bearish Spread = Buy 1500 Put &amp; Sell 1460 Put</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Let us do a Comparative Analysis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1109.9337748344371px;aspect-ratio:1.849889624724062\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/moneycontrol:5ff7a8182094b-6b806b45520c8350bbaaa6dde0eea442-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"sa\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/moneycontrol:5ff7a8182094b-6b806b45520c8350bbaaa6dde0eea442-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f7f7f6\"/></picture></div></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The example carries a stock at 1500 with over 30 days left for expiry. Grey line indicates what would be the profit or loss across the prices of the stock after 6 days, considering there is a weekend in between. We are assuming that the trade has 1480 Stop loss and 1540 Target.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Buy Call has 11951 likely profits at target against 5164 worth of loss if the trade hits a Stop-Loss. This converts into Reward/Risk = 2.3</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Call Spread has 5294 likely profits at target against 2358 worth of loss if the trade hits a Stop-Loss. The Reward/Risk = 2.25</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a nutshell, we have 2 trades with almost similar Reward/Risk, but Spread has a capacity to losing a lot less in the same trade than Buy Call.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This way we make Slower money but more efficiently. This is because with the same amount of money to lose now we can 2 trades and not one.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Only downside is that Spread has profits locked at 1540 (Sell Call Srike). But as discussed in the beginning, we don’t wait till target right?Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>A gold loan is a one-time, lump-sum loan you get by pledging jewellery or coins. The lender values your gold, sanctions an amount, and disburses it to your bank account. You repay in fixed monthly instalments over a defined tenure. It feels like any other EMI loan—predictable amount, fixed end date, and a clear path to closing the loan and releasing your gold.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What a gold overdraft is</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A gold overdraft turns your pledged gold into a revolving credit line. You receive a sanctioned limit and can draw, repay, and redraw within that limit during the facility’s validity. Interest accrues only on the amount you actually use and only for the days you use it. It works like a credit card backed by gold, but without the card—highly flexible and usage-based.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interest and total cost</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A standard gold loan charges interest on the full disbursed amount from day one, so your total cost depends on the rate and the tenure you choose. A gold overdraft charges interest only on drawn funds, which can cut costs if your usage is intermittent or short-term. If you expect to keep the balance high for most of the tenure, the overdraft’s flexibility won’t save much, and the cost may resemble a regular loan.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Repayment experience</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With a gold loan, EMIs bring discipline and certainty. You know exactly what leaves your account each month and when the loan will end. With a gold overdraft, there is no fixed EMI unless you set one up; you can repay partially or fully any time. That flexibility is useful for uneven cash flows but demands self-control so the balance doesn’t linger and rack up interest.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Best-fit situations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Choose a gold loan when you have a clear, one-time need—a medical bill, a vehicle repair, or a planned home expense—and you’re comfortable with EMIs. Choose a gold overdraft when your needs are uncertain or recurring—working capital top-ups, periodic school fees, or seasonal cash gaps—and you want to pay only for what you actually use.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fees, LTV and fine print</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both products may come with processing fees, valuation charges, renewal fees (for overdrafts), and penal interest on delays. The loan-to-value (LTV) determines how much you can borrow against your gold, and lenders may revalue or ask for top-ups if gold prices fall. Tenure matters too: loans have a fixed end date, while overdrafts typically run for a shorter validity and can be renewed. Always check foreclosure, part-prepayment, and auction clauses so you know exactly how you’ll get your gold back—or what happens if you miss payments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A quick rule of thumb</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you need most of the money immediately and will hold it for months, a gold loan with EMIs is usually the smarter, calmer choice. If you’ll dip in and out, keeping low balances and repaying fast, a gold overdraft often wins on interest saved.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A simple example</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Imagine you need up to Rs 3 lakh across the next six months but only in bursts—Rs 1 lakh for two weeks, nothing for a month, then Rs 50,000 for 10 days. A gold overdraft lets you draw just those amounts and pay interest only for those days. If instead you know you need Rs 3 lakh today for a renovation and will take a year to repay, an EMI-based gold loan offers predictable payments and an automatic finish line.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bottom lineThink of your gold as collateral powering a tool. Pick the tool that matches your cash-flow pattern. For one-shot needs and certainty, take the gold loan. For intermittent needs and control over daily interest, pick the gold overdraft—and use the flexibility wisely.</span></p></span></div></div>",
