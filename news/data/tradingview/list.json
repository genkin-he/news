            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Standard Chartered (SCBFY) just delivered the kind of quarter investors pay attention to. Adjusted pretax profit hit $1.99 billion, ahead of the $1.79 billion analysts had penciled in, powered by standout performances in wealth management and global banking. CFO Diego de Giorgi said the bank could now meet its 2026 return-on-tangible-equity goala year earlyafter what he called a strong quarter of progress. With income from global banking up 24% to $588 million and wealth income jumping 28%, management has raised its 2025 income outlook to the upper end of the 5%7% range. Shares climbed 3.1% in London, extending a 53% rise this year and leaving the FTSE 100's 19% gain far behind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The improvement comes as the bank's Fit for Growth restructuring enters its second yeara sweeping program of cost cuts and efficiency drives across hundreds of initiatives. Standard Chartered took a $138 million charge tied to the overhaul this quarter but said savings should accelerate through 2025. The bank is doubling down on wealth, too. A $1.5 billion expansion plan aims to attract $200 billion in new assets by 2029. In the third quarter alone, it added $13 billion in net inflows and 67,000 new affluent clients, underscoring the momentum building in its Asian wealth franchise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The results landed against a calmer geopolitical backdrop after US President Donald Trump's summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping produced what Trump called an amazing meeting. The US agreed to halve fentanyl-related tariffs, while China paused new rare-earth export curbsa detente that could ease business anxiety worldwide. De Giorgi said the move improves confidence for investors and businesses alike, a backdrop that could work in the bank's favor as global trade stabilizes. Credit impairments rose slightly to $195 million, while private-credit exposure remained contained below $3 billion, suggesting the bank's risk profile remains under control as it pushes for stronger, earlier returns.</span></p></span></div></div>",

The Company added 85 new service stations across its network in the first nine months of the year, bringing its total network size to 977. A majority of these new stations are in Saudi Arabia, where ADNOC Distribution added 72 new service stations. This brings the Company’s total network in the Kingdom to 172, a 150% YoY increase.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Having exceeded its network expansion goals ahead of schedule, the Company has raised its year-end target to 90–100 new stations by the end of 2025, up from previous full-year expansion guidance of 60–70. This revised guidance includes 80–90 stations in Saudi Arabia alone.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the recent inaugural Investor Majlis event hosted by ADNOC Group in Abu Dhabi, ADNOC Distribution announced upgraded network expansion guidance to 1,150 service stations by 2028 and announced a proposed extension of its dividend policy to 2030, subject to shareholder approval, with payouts to now occur on a quarterly basis from Q1 2026. This renewed commitment reflects confidence in long-term growth, the Company’s resilient financial performance, and its robust balance sheet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bader Saeed Al Lamki, CEO of ADNOC Distribution, said: “ADNOC Distribution’s record performance this year is a testament to the progress we have achieved to date against our five-year growth strategy, furthering our transformation into a mobility and convenience retail leader. Our strongest quarterly EBITDA ever, combined with a rapidly expanding network, demonstrates the fundamental strength of our business and a firm belief in our long-term growth prospects. This confidence is reflected in our recently revised expansion targets and the extension of our class-leading dividend policy for an additional two years. By focusing on non-fuel retail, including through a refreshed ‘Oasis by ADNOC’ brand and our property network, we are building a flexible mobility and convenience platform responsive to evolving customer needs, while creating sustainable, long-term value for shareholders.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-fuel retail continued to deliver strong momentum in Q3 2025, with gross profit growing by 14.7% year-on-year. The Company achieved the highest number of non-fuel retail transactions in its history for the first nine months of the year at 39.6 million, representing a 10.2% YoY increase, as well as the highest 9M convenience store conversion rate since 2021 at 26.2%, marking a YoY increase of 65 basis points.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These results were achieved through robust performance across convenience stores, car services, and property management, reinforcing the success of ADNOC Distribution’s diversification strategy. Reflecting this, ADNOC Distribution recently introduced updated guidance anticipating a 100% increase to non-fuel retail transactions by 2030 compared to 2023. In Q3 2025, ADNOC Voyager, the UAE’s leading lubricant brand, also marked a major growth milestone by extending its footprint to 50 export markets worldwide.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The extension of ADNOC Distribution’s dividend policy to 2030, subject to shareholder approval, and the shift to quarterly payments will improve return visibility and are expected to offer upside from future earnings growth while rewarding shareholders more frequently. The announcement brings the Company’s total announced dividend commitments to a minimum of $4.9 billion between 2023 and 2030, at an annual payout of $700 million or a minimum of 75% of net profit, whichever is higher.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In Q3 2025, ADNOC Distribution reintroduced the UAE’s most popular convenience store with a fresh new identity - ‘Oasis by ADNOC’. With a bold new look and an ‘On the Gourmet’ promise, the refresh brings upgraded food and beverage offerings, including barista-crafted specialty coffee and a new selection of healthy options, all while keeping the classics customers love. By positioning Oasis by ADNOC as the UAE’s go-to destination for a gourmet experience on the move, ADNOC Distribution is elevating on-the-go dining into something truly special, reflecting a commitment to creating the industry’s best customer experiences.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ADNOC Distribution also advanced its position as a future-ready mobility provider, with its E2GO network reaching 368 fast and super-fast EV charging points by the end of September.

It has proven to be resilient to rising competition from more players in Thailand's lifestyle market, the analyst notes. The Thai company's competitive advantages remain with its in-house designs, fast product turnover, product differentiation and lower product prices. However, the brokerage cuts its earnings estimates for the company by 3% for 2025, 6% for 2026, 8% for 2027, and 9% for 2028 to reflect lower same-store-sales growth. It lowers the stock's target price to THB50.00 from THB55.00, with an unchanged buy rating. Shares are unchanged at THB35.00. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
