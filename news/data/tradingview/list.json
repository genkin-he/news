The press release reported second quarter 2025 adjusted earnings of approximately $5.50 per share, which was \"below . . . prior expectations\" due to \"medical cost pressures in all three lines of business.\" The Company also announced that it \"expects these medical cost pressures to continue into the second half of the year\" and cut guidance for expected adjusted earnings per share 10.2% at the midpoint, from \"at least $24.50 per share\" to a \"range of $21.50 to $22.50 per share.\" The press release revealed Molina was experiencing a \"short-term earnings pressure\" from a \"dislocation between premium rates and a medical cost trend which has recently accelerated.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On this news, Molina's stock price fell $6.97 per share, or 2.9%, to close at $232.61 per share on July 7, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then, on July 23, 2025, Molina issued a press release reporting its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025 and further slashing the Company's full-year 2025 earnings guidance.

Molina also cut its guidance for its full year 2025 GAAP net income 27% to $912 million. Molina attributed its results a full year outlook to a \"challenging medical cost trend environment,\" including mere \"utilization of behavioral health, pharmacy, and inpatient and outpatient services.\" The Company claimed that its guidance cut also reflected \"new information gained in the quarterly closing process.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On this news, Molina's stock price fell $32.03 per share, or 16.84%, to close at $158.22 per share on July 24, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

The Q3 work program consisted of sampling and additional geological mapping. The purpose of the exploration program was to validate the previous results and to aid in designing a drill program. Phase 1 and 2 results confirmed the accuracy of the historical Newmont results and, in some instances, exceeded the earlier results. Furthermore, geologic mapping shows that the previous drilling may not have been in the most optimal direction. Our geological team will determine a new drill direction.

The work was a continuation of the Phase 1 program summarized in the Company's news release dated September 18, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Phase 2 program focused on the Joramina and Randypata Zones. Several old mine workings were located and sampled in both exploration phases. A long, well-developed 157 metre drift trending with an azimuth of 120 degrees was located within the main Joramina area, yet it was never documented in any of the previous operator exploration programs. Thirty-one samples were taken from the drift in 5-meter composite chips. The best gold results show two consecutive samples returning 10 metres of 2.32 grams Au/tonne. The best silver result was a 5-metre composite returning 4.085 ounces Ag/tonne. The drift is within the area of the proposed drilling and is in excellent condition and may be used in the future for underground drill sites.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Additional surface sampling was conducted approximately 100 metres northeast of the drift confirming that the silver-gold mineralization is structurally controlled with several fractures and veinlets trending NE-SW dipping Northwest. One chip sample across 0.70 metres returned 17.41 grams Au/tonne and 13.94 ounces Ag/tonne. Galena (Lead Sulphide) and Sphalerite (Zinc Sulphide) are present in the veins but have not yet been assayed for these elements. The Company will assay some of the samples for lead and zinc when check assays are being performed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Phase 2 program also included a brief surface review of the Randypata Zone. Twenty-one samples were taken over the historic 2-kilometre Ag anomaly. This area is untested by drilling. The best result came from an area where a road cut exposed a strongly oxidized breccia, where a random composite grab sample returned 0.20 grams Au/tonne and 8.55 ounces Ag/tonne. Follow-up work is required in this area to determine the extent of the Ag mineralization.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Magma is pleased with the results of the first two phases of the initial exploration programs. The Company is now convinced the previous drill programs did not adequately test the Joramina zones. A drill program will be designed to test the gold-silver mineralized structures with the optimal drill direction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Seventy samples were collected during phase 2 and analyzed at the Independent Mining Lab Services based in Huancayo in south-central Peru.

Disappointment that the company still isn't immediately allowed to resume sales in China could be overshadowing huge spending on artificial-intelligence by major technology companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nvidia shares were down 0.2% at $206.63 in premarket trading. That would put only a tiny dent in 14% gains over the past five trading days as the chip maker has been buoyed by AI optimism.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors were hoping that President Donald Trump might give the stock another boost by announcing that Nvidia and other U.S. chip makers would be able to resume selling hardware to China after his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. However, Trump told reporters after the meeting that Nvidia's Blackwell chips weren't specifically discussed, according to multiple reports.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump said he told Xi that Beijing would have to negotiate with Nvidia directly but the U.S. was willing to be \"the arbitrator or the referee\", according to Reuters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nvidia has been targeted by Chinese authorities, who have discouraged the use of its AI processors by domestic customers. Nvidia is currently forecasting  no Chinese revenue for its current quarter, which implies a loss of between $2 billion and $5 billion in potential sales, according to the company's executives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, signs of U.S. spending are strong. Each of Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Google-parent Alphabet said in earnings reports on Wednesday that they will raise their capital expenditure, largely due to investment in AI data centers. That bodes well for future spending on semiconductors from Nvidia and its rivals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices was down 0.8% and Broadcom was rising 0.3% in premarket trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
