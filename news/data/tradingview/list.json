Group revenue and operating profit amounted to DKK 2.6 billion and DKK 2.2 billion, respectively. Several operational advancements were made across the company in 2025, not least the landmark outlicensing deal of the anti-obesity asset ABBV-295 (long-acting amylin analog) to AbbVie.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Markus Rohrwild, CEO of Gubra says:</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>“2025 was a defining year for Gubra — not only because of the record financial results, but because of the collective dedication with which we advanced our science, strengthened our platforms and portfolio, and positioned the company for sustainable long‑term growth”.</span></em></p><p class=\"\"></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Our Biotech AI platform is the engine</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the Biotech business, the progress during 2025 shows the value embedded into Gubra’s R&amp;D portfolio. The outlicensing deal of ABBV-295 to AbbVie with a total value of $2.2bn is just one validation of this. Gubra generates novel peptide drug development candidates through the proprietary AI-driven discovery platform streaMLine and develops them to a maximum early value inflection stage.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aside from ABBV-295, Gubra’s partner Boehringer-Ingelheim is advancing the first-in-class long-acting triple agonist for obesity into mid-stage development and together with Swedish Camurus, Gubra initiated a research collaboration to develop an extended-release therapy for hypoparathyroidism. In 2025, Gubra also showed compelling preclinical data from the not yet partnered GUB-UCN2 lead asset designed for healthy weight loss.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>“The progress in 2025 collectively shows the strength of our technology platform to generate novel peptides that are widely recognized by our partners. Technology remains at the heart of Gubra. With our streaMLine platform and advanced 3D-imaging and automation capabilities, we have created an integrated engine that accelerates therapeutic discovery across disease areas. The streaMLine platform now supports more programs in more therapeutic areas than ever before. Its rapid design-build-test cycle reinforces our fundamental belief: innovation in therapeutics increasingly depends on innovation in technology,”</span></em><span>Markus Rohrwild</span><span>says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>CRO set to grow</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gubra’s CRO business has seen revenue grow organically by almost 70% between 2022-2024. 2025 presented a slight revenue decline, driven by macroeconomic headwinds and constrained funding environments for small biotech companies, resulting in longer decision cycles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>“Encouragingly, we now see signs of improvement in the order pipeline. This underpins our confidence in continued robust growth and strong profitability within this business segment”, Markus Rohrwild continues.</span></em></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Stronger operating model for the future</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Starting in 2026, Gubra has strengthened the operating model and will operate through three synergistic business units – Biotech, CRO, and Ventures – all anchored in Gubra’s commitment to society and sustainability. While highly complementary, each unit has a distinct business model designed to maximize value creation. Furthermore, the leadership team is strengthened with the recruitment of Thomas Langenickel as Chief Medical and Development Officer, Grigo Gaurav as Chief Technology Officer and Zoë Johnson as Head of Gubra Ventures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gubra Ventures is Gubra’s new business unit. Ventures will incubate high-potential assets in a dedicated venture structure, attract external capital, specialized talent, and strategic partners without diluting the focus of Gubra Biotech. To support continued growth, Gubra is expanding their facilities in the DTU Science Park. With the new facilities, Gubra will increase its total laboratory and office space by 70%.</span></p><p class=\"\"></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Strong outlook for 2026</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is strong momentum for 2026. In the Biotech business, there are three potential multibillion obesity drugs (GUB-UCN2, ABBV-295 and the triple agonist) in Phase 1 or Phase 2 development with potential readouts for the partnered assets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The mega-program GUB-UCN2 for healthy weight loss will enter first-in-human</span><span>studies in H1 2026. The ambitious Phase 1/2a trial design with close to 200 participants sets the stage for exploring GUB-UCN2 across multiple indications and patient populations. The trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of GUB-UCN2, with a particular focus on muscle volume and muscle function endpoints – both as a standalone therapy and in combination with incretin-based therapy for obesity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the new business unit Ventures, Gubra is currently looking at interesting opportunities and expects to create the first venture in H2 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the CRO business, the orderbook is promising and we expect to see revenue growth of 5-15% compared with 2025 and sound profitability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>“I’m very excited about the time ahead for Gubra.

Gross profit stood at RM4.26 million compared to RM4.69 million previously, reflecting margin pressures within the bituminous division amid softer global bitumen prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notwithstanding this, the Group returned to profitability, </span><span>recording a profit before tax (\"PBT\") of RM1.78 million versus a loss before tax of RM1.55 million in Q2 FY2025. Profit after tax (\"PAT\") amounted to RM1.56 million, a significant turnaround from the RM2.53 million loss recorded a year earlier. The improved performance was primarily driven by stronger work volume at the Selinsing Gold Mine under the civil engineering segment, improved plant availability within the energy division, and the recognition of a one-off waiver of debts during the quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On a quarter-on-quarter basis, </span><span>revenue rose 12.6% from RM33.94 million in Q1 FY2026 to RM38.23 million. The civil engineering segment led growth, with revenue increasing to RM29.51 million from RM22.12 million in the preceding quarter, reflecting higher production volume at Selinsing Gold Mine project. However, the bituminous products segment recorded revenue of RM6.91 million, lower than RM9.66 million in Q1 FY2026 due to declining global bitumen prices which exerted downward pressure on selling prices. The energy segment registered revenue of RM1.66 million compared to RM2.10 million previously, mainly attributable to seasonal monsoon conditions affecting generation output.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite mixed segmental movements, the Group posted a PBT of RM1.78 million compared to a loss before tax of RM1.42 million in Q1 FY2026. The quarter also recorded positive adjusted EBITDA of approximately RM1.2 million, underscoring strengthening operational fundamentals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the cumulative six-month period ended 31 December 2025, the Group recorded revenue of RM72.17 million and a marginal loss after tax of RM0.31 million, reflecting a continued recovery trajectory compared to prior loss-making periods.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>En. Ahmad Rahizal Bin Dato' Ahmad Rasidi, Executive Director of AIZO</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>En. Ahmad Rahizal Bin Dato' Ahmad Rasidi, the Executive Director of AIZO commented, \"Q2 FY2026 marks an important inflection point for AIZO as we returned to profitability. The stronger civil engineering output and improved operational efficiency across our segments demonstrate that the restructuring and cost discipline measures implemented earlier are beginning to deliver measurable results. While certain divisions remain sensitive to commodity price movements and seasonal factors, our diversified structure is providing improved earnings stability.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking ahead, AIZO remains cautiously optimistic amid Malaysia's improving macroeconomic landscape, supported by steady GDP expansion, resilient private consumption and stable inflation. The Group will continue to prioritise operational efficiency, disciplined capital expenditure and progress acceleration across its civil works, bituminous manufacturing and renewable energy operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As at 31 December 2025, AIZO maintained total assets of RM181.30 million and total equity of RM82.98 million, with borrowings managed prudently.

However, a sustainable fall below the 4% handle isn't in sight, at least for now. \"We do remain, just about, within the longer-run range here,\" the senior research strategist says. Should the 10-year yield trade under 4.00% on a closing basis, that would give U.S. Treasury bulls some degree of control in the near term, he says. The 10-year Treasury yield was last trading at 3.997%, down 1.9 basis points, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
