This shift suggests the start of an impulsive wave, signaling potential strong upside momentum. Traders should watch for confirmation above key levels as the path for the next leg up begins to take shape.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Wave 3 In Motion: Preparing For A Strong Upside Move</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Charting an expected path for Ethereum on the 4-hour timeframe, Elliott Waves Academy has revealed a significant opportunity to ride a new bullish wave. The price appears to be preparing for a powerful upward surge following a successful breach of its corrective price channel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The technical structure indicates that Ethereum is likely forming Wave 3 of (3), with current projections showing the asset reaching a minimum 161.8% extension. However, the internal momentum suggests the potential for the move to extend further, signaling that a major impulsive rally is now officially underway.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From a strategic standpoint, any temporary bearish corrections would be viewed as high-probability opportunities for long re-entries. These minor pullbacks serve to reset local indicators while the primary trend remains firmly higher. Traders are currently eyeing the $2,624.14 level as a primary target, with the possibility of a move toward the 261.8% extension if the positive momentum remains sustained.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To validate and maintain this bullish scenario, it is critical to see a confirmed breakout and sustained trading above the previous price channel. Staying above this structural boundary will reinforce the upward outlook and provide the necessary support for the next leg of the rally. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Ethereum Sweeps Range High: Buyers Step In</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to Lennaert Snyder, Ethereum recently reached its all-time high and liquidity, setting the stage for a notable bounce after testing the extremes of its current range. This move reflects a strong recovery following aggressive price action and shows that buyers are actively defending key levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For traders looking at local setups, caution is advised. Given the recent massive displacement, it’s best to wait for clearer directional signals before entering positions, ensuring trades align with confirmed momentum rather than chasing volatility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That said, the liquidity captured during this sweep opens up opportunities for hedge strategies. For example, a short position on the opposite side could help mitigate risk while waiting for the market to stabilize. Specific levels, such as the 50% wick fill around $2,110, may present interesting shorting opportunities after a bearish MSB forms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Additionally, similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum left a significant Fair Value Gap (FVG) during the aggressive leg higher, with the 50% level of this gap near ~$1,970. Should the price retest this FVG, it could provide a favorable setup for long entries following a reversal, highlighting potential areas for strategic accumulation.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Charles Passy</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Executives say it's all about learning how to better run their businesses, but some corporate watchers question if this is just a PR move</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Elon Musk is just one of a number of chief executives and business leaders who sometimes connects directly with customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Have a complaint about a company? Or even a compliment to share? The chief executive is expecting your call.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At least that's how some businesses are handling customer-service matters these days. Tom Curtis, president of Burger King's U.S. and Canada operations (QSR), recently announced that he's inviting customers to reach out to him and offer feedback. He's even posted a phone number - (305) 874-0520 - for all to give him a ring.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There \"is a broader perception that large brands are not listening closely enough, and taking action based on feedback,\" Curtis said in a statement to MarketWatch. \"I see that as an opportunity. Listening to guests has always been part of how we operate, but this step makes that commitment more personal and visible.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Curtis is in good company these days. You'll find there are a number of prominent executives who often connect with customers. Elon Musk has been known to respond via social media to complaints regarding his Tesla (TSLA) vehicles. Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, has said he walks throughout Virgin planes \"asking for feedback from passengers and crew.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many corporate watchers expect the trend will continue, if not become bigger, as companies look for any way to appear more authentic and genuine - and grow their business as a result.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"CEOs are stepping in because they see an opportunity to break through ... by personally signaling a culture of commitment to customers' wants and needs,\" said G. Tomas M. Hult, a professor at Michigan State University and a business executive at the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Hult has also authored a Harvard Business Review paper looking at how CEOs respond to customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some question whether these eager-to-connect executives are truly invested in their customers, or if they're just making it appear that way for the sake of publicity. Others wonder if a CEO may do more harm than good by effectively overriding the usual customer-service channels and protocols.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And that's to say nothing of the obvious fact that a CEO simply doesn't have the time to deal with every customer complaint - or even more than a handful of them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It \"is not a scalable business model,\" Hult said. \"The real infrastructure of customer satisfaction depends on front-line customer service, sales and customer experience management personnel who are trained to handle these matters at volume.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'CEOs are stepping in because they see an opportunity to break through.'G. Tomas M. Hult, professor at Michigan State University and business executive at the American Customer Satisfaction Index</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Burger King's Curtis and other executives who spoke with MarketWatch say they're well aware that their efforts constitute just a drop in the proverbial bucket in terms of dealing with customer issues. But they also say these interactions can be critical to their business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Not every [customer] suggestion can or should be implemented, but identifying consistent patterns is incredibly valuable,\" said Curtis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Executives are quick to cite instances when their findings from customer exchanges led to action.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Carina Radonich, co-owner and CEO of the Magic Moment Resort &amp; Kids Club in the Orlando, Fla., area, says it was during her regular conversations with guests that she learned people were frustrated with the limited schedule of the theme-park shuttle service. She also found that guests were disappointed that the resort's breakfast menu didn't vary from day to day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So Radonich made changes, adding more shuttle trips and switching up the morning food offerings, adding things like breakfast burritos and stuffed croissants.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Small operational shifts like these drive higher guest satisfaction and repeat bookings,\" she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sweetwater CEO Mike Clem adds a note to every shipment that goes out to customers. He also makes his email contact information readily available.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Not all such interactions with customers are tied to complaints. Mike Clem, the CEO of Sweetwater, a leading retailer of musical instruments, says about 80% of the comments he receives are positive. And Clem receives hundreds of comments a year, because he makes his email contact information readily available.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The responses include Sweetwater customers sending Clem photos of their home studios. \"They send them to me like it's pictures of their kids,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even if a customer has a complaint, Clem says it's all about building a personal connection - and he insists it's those connections that have helped the 47-year-old business reach nearly $2 billion in annual sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There may, however, be another motive for CEOs who offer customers a direct line. Earl Stewart, who owns a Toyota dealership in Lake Park, Fla., has red phones scattered throughout his busy operation - all of which enable customers to put in a call to him personally.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stewart says that when his employees see a customer reaching for one of the phones, they often step in to see if they can resolve the issue themselves. In effect, the phones keep his staff mindful of customers - and that's what Stewart believes has helped his business win accolades and awards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But Stewart doesn't deny that the phones also help from a brand standpoint, announcing that his dealership is customer-centric all the way up to the top guy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's big PR,\" said Stewart.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Time will tell if the Burger King exec's outreach is seen more as a publicity stunt, or if it's really about listening to customers and learning from them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jessica Kriegel, chief strategy partner at Culture Partners, a consulting firm that works with large organizations, says if an executive is truly trying to connect with customers, they don't necessarily have to announce it to the world.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I'm more impressed with the CEOs that don't have press releases,\" she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Charles Passy</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Heidi Mitchell</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most people know someone who's dated their boss. In fact, office romances, especially those with power imbalances, are so common that they barely register as scandal — more than 25% of U.S. workers have engaged in a romantic relationship with a colleague, 18% of which were with a superior, according to the Society for Human Resources Managers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But there has been little evidence on the financial impact of these relationships on the people involved.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now, new research offers just such evidence, and finds that the financial benefits and costs are substantial — especially for women.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Previous research on office romances \"focused on clearly unacceptable behavior, where the lines are pretty black and white,\" says Emily Nix, an associate professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business. \"But no one really looked at consensual relationships.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An earnings jump</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nix couldn't find good data sets in the U.S., but she did find it in Finland. She was able to examine heterosexual couples working in the same establishment, and where one partner is a manager and the other is not. She then compared them to workers with the same background who also date managers employed elsewhere. Nix then tracked the subordinates' earnings before and after relationships began and ended.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Her findings were clear: When a female subordinate enters a relationship with a male manager at the same workplace, the subordinate's earnings rise by about 6% over two years, on top of typical wage increases. \"Even in years three and four into the relationship, her gains are still larger than a similar woman who also dates a manager, but at a different workplace,\" Nix says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When men date a boss, the increase in wages is even more pronounced — more than twice what women experienced, she says. However, those situations are much rarer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then there is the downside: When these office relationships end, women subordinates see their earnings drop roughly 18% the year after the breakup — mainly because many of them end up leaving the company. And their salaries remain substantially lower than what they had been for at least four years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By contrast, Nix didn't find a significant income effect for men after breakups with their female managers. Again, the reason is primarily due to the fact that far fewer men end up leaving the company when a relationship ends.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nix points to two possible reasons why office relationships can be both beneficial and so costly. On the upside, there is obvious nepotism: Managers may favor their romantic partners when handing out raises, bonuses or promotions. Also, managers may mentor their partners, increasing their skills and productivity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For co-workers, she says, both reasons can hurt morale. The result is that when a manager--subordinate relationship begins, the retention rate among other workers at the same establishment falls by 6 percentage points. The churn is especially pronounced in small firms, where favoritism is hard to hide and easy to resent.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The HR dilemma</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rather than forbidding relationships, which is likely to be ineffective and unpopular, Nix suggests that firms can limit their impact by at minimum removing managers from making decisions about the pay, bonuses and promotions of romantic partners. That kind of firewall, she argues, can reduce perceptions of favoritism and protect subordinates (who are mostly women) if the relationship ends.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For employees, Nix suggests they first talk to their HR departments to see what protections are in place, so their career trajectories don't depend on the success of their in-office romance. \"They should also have a game plan for what they would do if the relationship were to end,\" Nix adds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dating at work isn't going away, but the impact can't be understated, she says. \"Dating the boss is a double-edged sword,\" she says. \"There may be some benefits to you personally, but there will always be a question mark around you and your success.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to reports@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Ben Levisohn</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran appears to have effectively closed the Strait of Hormuz in response to U.S. and Israeli attacks on the county. While that could cause oil prices to spike, it could be good news for shipping stocks, including Frontline and DHT Holdings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, has warned ships not to travel through the Strait of Hormuz, a major shipping corridor, especially for the transportation of oil. According to OPIS' Energy Markets team, 26% of the crude oil trade and 23% of liquefied natural gas goes through the strait, and a prolonged closure could cause oil prices to surge even higher.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Major escalations have historically caused shipping rates to spike, according to Evercore analyst Jonathan Chappell. In a report published last year, he noted that \"very large crude carrier\" prices spiked more than 40% at the start of the first Gulf War in 1991, and by as much as 304% during the second Gulf War, though that was complicated by China's entry into the World Trade Organization.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tanker stocks, as a group, have already started to reflect the possibility of this outcome. Ardmore Shipping has gained 55% this year, while DHT Holdings has climbed 60%, Frontline has surged 74%, Nordic American Tanker Shipping has soared 67%, Scorpio Tankers has risen 56%, Teekay Tankers has advanced 47%, and TORM PLC. is up 54%. The S&amp;P 500 has risen just 0.5% in 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The higher rates have already shown up in earnings. Frontline, which reported results on Friday morning, has \"booked 92% of its 1Q26 VLCC spot days at an average rate of $107,100/day...[which] would represent the highest since the heydays of 2Q08,\" Chappell wrote after the release, while raising his price target to $42 from $31. \"Still, FRO is the alpha male of the crude tanker market and retains material exposure to a spot market that has been leaping to all-time highs of late. Consequently, our estimates for the near term are likely to remain conservative until the tanker spot market comes back to earth. Until that time, FRO is likely to retain upside equity appreciation potential.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Until it doesn't.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Ben Levisohn at ben.levisohn@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jurica Dujmovic</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A massive backlog of maintenance and software contracts will ensure recurring revenue</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor 4001 stealth fighter is silhouetted against the setting sun in this undated file photo. Saturday's strikes on Iran by the U.S. and Israel will likely shine an even bigger spotlight on defense stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wars end. Maintenance contracts do not.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Defense stocks have been treated as geopolitical barometer. When tensions rise and military conflict breaks out, shares climb. When headlines cool, the trade fades. It's a narrative built around procurement cycles and crisis-driven spending. The attack on Tehran on Saturday by Israel and the U.S. should repeat this pattern for defense stocks in coming days.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But something more structural and long-term has been unfolding, something that looks far less like a one-off weapons sale and more like a long-term service contract. Parts of the defense industry are beginning to resemble subscription businesses, recurring revenue layered on top of a growing installed base.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For investors focused on earnings durability rather than war headlines, that distinction matters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Weapons systems have evolved from disposable purchases to multi-decade ecosystems nowadays. Once a country fields a fleet of fighter jets, missile defense batteries, or naval destroyers, it commits to years or even decades of operating and support costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Government Accountability Office has repeatedly noted that operating and support costs can account for roughly 70% of a major weapon system's total life-cycle cost, according to recent GAO report. Upkeep includes spare parts, depot maintenance, training, software updates, systems integration and availability guarantees. Since national defense cannot tolerate downtime, readiness spending tends to persist even when procurement ebbs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In practical terms, the contractor that builds the platform often remains embedded in its upkeep. Every additional aircraft delivered expands the pool of long-term maintenance, logistics and modernization revenue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That dynamic increasingly resembles aerospace aftermarket economy (and, in some respects, enterprise software) where installed bases drive recurring cash flow. Three companies that stand to benefit: Lockheed Martin (LMT); RTX (RTX) and Northrop Grumman (NOC).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lockheed Martin: The ecosystem model: Lockheed Martin provides the clearest example of this shift. The F-35 program represented 26% of consolidated net sales in 2024, according to the company's latest Form 10-K. The filing explicitly states that F-35 revenue includes development, production, and maintenance, underscoring how support and logistics are embedded in the program's economy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Service sales increased in 2024, driven in part by higher volume on F-35 upkeep contracts, the company disclosed in that same annual report.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By the end of 2025, Lockheed Martin reported a record $194 billion backlog and strong free cash flow generation in its full-year earnings release. That backlog provides multi-year revenue visibility that many industrial companies lack.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Support performance is not immune from scrutiny; a Pentagon watchdog has recently criticized aspects of F-35 maintenance and aircraft availability. Recurring revenue in defense is contractual and performance-based, not automatic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even so, the installed-base effect is unmistakable: every aircraft delivered expands a long-term revenue stream tied to readiness and modernization.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>RTX: Installed base, diversified: RTX offers a different version of installed-base economy. The company has recently reported strong sales growth and highlighted a backlog approaching $268 billion, according to its latest earnings results.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the defense side, missile systems and air defense platforms require ongoing upgrades and upkeep. Collins Aerospace operates within a vast installed base of aircraft systems that generate recurring parts and maintenance demand, the approach the company emphasizes in its investor materials.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Commercial aftermarket revenue behaves in many ways like an annuity tied to flight hours, while defense modernization cycles add a second layer of durability. The combination smooths earnings compared to pure production-driven models.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Northrop Grumman and the long arc of modernization: Northrop Grumman's portfolio is heavily weighted toward advanced systems - stealth aircraft, space assets, sensors and mission technologies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Once fielded, those systems demand continuous upgrades and integration work as modern defense doctrine emphasizes ongoing modernization rather than static platforms. Sensors are refreshed. Software evolves. Networks expand. The company ended 2025 with backlog nearing $95.7 billion, according to its most recent annual report.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Northrop's strength in high-end systems integration positions it to benefit from that long modernization arc, although development-heavy programs can introduce project timing volatility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The software layer: Defense as ongoing service: The transformation is perhaps the most visible in defense's growing digital footprint. The U.S. Defense Department's Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability contract vehicle reflects a shift toward acquiring commercial cloud services across classification levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Software-native companies like Palantir Technologies (PLTR) operate directly in that layer, providing analytics and AI systems through multi-year government contracts. Recent analyst coverage has highlighted the company's expanding government engagements and recurring revenue profile.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While valuation and volatility differ from traditional primes, the software layer most closely resembles true subscription economy within defense budgets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The market may be behind the curve</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite these structural shifts, defense contractors are often valued like cyclical industrial companies. The implicit assumption is that earnings are driven primarily by procurement wins and geopolitical events.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If maintenance, modernization and software continue rising as a share of revenue, that assumption will grow increasingly incomplete. Recurring support contracts and installed-base monetization can dampen earnings swings and support steadier free cash flow.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, intellectual property and data rights in maintenance contracts is a critical issue that the U.S. Government Accountability Office examined in its recent review of IP and sustainment planning. Control over technical data can shape who captures margin over the life of a program.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Markets tend to reward predictability. Businesses with durable cash flows often command stronger valuation multiples than those dependent on episodic demand. If defense contractors continue migrating toward service-heavy revenue mixes, the sector's risk profile may increasingly resemble infrastructure rather than crisis trade.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Defense stocks will continue to react to geopolitical headlines, but beneath those swings lies a structural evolution in how revenue is generated and sustained. The companies that control large, technologically complex installed bases -aircraft fleets, missile systems, naval platforms, secure networks - are not merely selling equipment. They are managing ecosystems that require continuous funding to remain operational.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This shift reframes the opportunity. Defense may no longer be just a trade on conflict. Increasingly, it resembles a long-duration cash-flow business anchored in readiness, modernization and software-driven support.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The market may still be pricing yesterday's model. Wars end. Maintenance contracts do not.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read: Trump says 'massive' strike against Iran underway - bitcoin plunge offers a glimpse of how markets could react</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Jurica Dujmovic</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin posted a detailed technical roadmap on February 27 outlining how the network could handle up to 1,000 times its current transaction capacity — without pricing out the smaller node operators who keep the system decentralized.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The document, which Buterin informally calls the “Strawmap,” breaks the work into three problem areas: execution, data, and state.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Near-Term Upgrades Come First</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The closest item on the list is an upcoming protocol upgrade called “Glamsterdam.” According to reports, one of its key changes introduces block-level access lists — a technical adjustment that allows different parts of a block to be processed simultaneously rather than one after another.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reports also say the upgrade improves how efficiently each 12-second block slot is used, making it safer to pack more transactions into every block without destabilizing the network.</span></p><div class=\"container-n2KCMK3i\" data-qa-id=\"tweet-widget-container\"><blockquote class=\"blockquote-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"header-n2KCMK3i\"><span class=\"profile-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"avatar-n2KCMK3i\"></div><div class=\"name-n2KCMK3i\">vitalik.eth</div><div class=\"username-n2KCMK3i\">@VitalikButerin</div></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"logo-n2KCMK3i\" role=\"img\"><svg height=\"28\" viewbox=\"0 0 28 28\" width=\"28\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M19.75 5h3.07l-6.7 7.62L24 23h-6.17l-4.84-6.3L7.46 23H4.4l7.17-8.16L4 5h6.33l4.37 5.75L19.75 5Zm-1.24 16h1.7L9.54 7H7.7l10.8 14Z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path></svg></span></div><div class=\"description-n2KCMK3i\"><p class=\"\"><span>Now, scaling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are two buckets here: short-term and long-term.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Short term scaling I’ve written about elsewhere.

If real usage stays low, he suggested the full 1,000x push could be shelved in favor of other priorities entirely.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Zero-Knowledge Proofs Take Center Stage In Longer Plans</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The more ambitious part of the roadmap involves zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines, or ZK-EVMs. Rather than requiring every validator to re-run every transaction to confirm it is legitimate, ZK-EVMs allow validators to check cryptographic proofs instead — a far lighter task.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to reports, Buterin’s timeline calls for a small group of validators to begin using this method as early as 2026, with broader adoption potentially following in 2027. If that plays out, the network’s capacity ceiling could be raised significantly without forcing node operators to invest in more powerful hardware.State Growth Gets Its Own Fix </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reports say Buterin flagged state growth as a separate and underappreciated problem. Deploying a large smart contract adds data that every Ethereum node must store permanently — and that accumulated storage gradually raises the cost of running a node at all.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>His proposed fix tracks state creation gas independently, so it does not count against the regular transaction gas cap. Large contracts could still be deployed, but their pricing would reflect the real long-term storage cost.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The 1,000x figure is a long-term ceiling, not a promise for next year. Each phase of the plan depends on the one before it working as intended.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView</span></em></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>A federal judge in Manhattan has denied Binance's attempt to force arbitration in a class action alleging the exchange sold unregistered digital tokens to U.S. investors, according to a Thursday opinion from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr. found that Binance failed to properly notify users when it amended its Terms of Use in February 2019 to add an arbitration clause and class action waiver. The plaintiffs, residents of California, Nevada and Texas, all created their Binance accounts between September 2017 and April 2018, when no such provisions existed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The case traces back to a wave of class action lawsuits filed in April 2020 against major crypto exchanges and token issuers. It was initially dismissed in 2022 but revived by the Second Circuit in 2024, which held that U.S. securities laws applied to Binance even without a physical domestic headquarters. The Supreme Court declined to review that ruling in January 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Binance argued its 2019 terms should govern, but the court noted that simply posting updated terms on a website, without individualized notice, was insufficient. The original 2017 terms included a change-of-terms provision, but the court cited Ninth Circuit precedent holding that users have no obligation to periodically check whether the other side has unilaterally changed a contract.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even assuming the plaintiffs gained actual notice of the arbitration clause through the litigation itself, the court held the provision could not reach backward. Under California law, a unilateral modification silent on whether it applies to accrued claims is \"restricted based on the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The class action waiver also failed. While a heading in Binance's terms references a \"CLASS ACTION WAIVER,\" the body of the section never details the terms of such a waiver. The court called the language ambiguous and interpreted the adhesion contract against Binance as drafter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The plaintiffs had previously voluntarily dismissed claims arising after the February 2019 effective date, narrowing the case to pre-2019 conduct. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who pleaded guilty to federal crimes in 2023, was pardoned by President Trump in October 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The ruling comes as Binance's U.S. regulatory picture has shifted. The SEC moved to dismiss its own enforcement action against the exchange last May. But this private class action remains active, and Thursday's opinion clears a significant procedural hurdle for the plaintiffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

Trump's directive was issued shortly before the Pentagon's deadline for Anthropic to agree to broader military access to its systems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After that deadline passed, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he was designating Anthropic a supply chain risk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has refused to accede to Pentagon demands that would allow its AI tools to be used without the company's restrictions, particularly in scenarios involving lethal force, surveillance, or other high-stakes applications.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump said in a social media post that most federal agencies must immediately cease using Anthropic's technology, and they would have a six-month window to remove the systems where they are already embedded.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic has reportedly won a contract last summer that's worth up to $200 million from the Defense Department, The Wall Street Journal reported last month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic is a private company, so there is no publicly confirmed revenue figure for the firm. But Bloomberg has estimated that Anthropic's revenue run rate exceeded $9 billion at the end of 2025, which makes the loss of a $200 million contract trivial.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the impact of Friday's moves by the U.S. leaders goes well beyond government contracts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A \"supply-chain risk to national security,\" which Hegseth designated Anthropic, is typically applied to foreign companies. Rarely does the U.S. government label a major domestic company this way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the past, the Federal Communications Commission has named China's Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corporation as a national security risk to U.S. communications networks and supply chains.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Being designated a supply chain risk not only means no government contracts for Anthropic, defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman also can't use Anthropic technology.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Neither company immediately responded to a request for comment about their relationship with Anthropic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic,\" wrote Hegseth in the X post.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Traditional defense stocks might not react to the conflict.

It is responsible for implementing a lot of AI technology at the Pentagon and has collaborated with Anthropic recently.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Palantir didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Palantir stock was unfazed on Friday, rising 0.9% to $137.20, while the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% and 1.1%, respectively. Palantir shares were down 0.2% in after-hours trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Anthropic conflict could open the door for other AI labs — notably OpenAI, Google's Gemini, and Elon Musk's xAI — to gain additional business with the defense industry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last year, OpenAI was awarded a contract worth up to $200 million to \"develop prototype frontier AI\" tools for military and national security applications. xAI was recently acquired by SpaceX, which already does a lot of business with the U.S. military and NASA.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But they will face the same discussions over terms for classified use of their models.

The U.S and Israel attacks, which are continuing against what was described as hundreds of targets, were launched during daylight hours in Iran.

Through a comprehensive introduction of China's democratic practice, the article stresses that this approach fosters broad and continuous participation, ensuring that governance decisions reflect the collective will and evolving needs of society.</span></em></p><p class=\"\"><span>BEIJING, Feb. 28, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- A legislative outreach office in Shanghai's Changning District, established in 2015 in the Hongqiao Subdistrict by the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), has become a landmark in China's democratic progress.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Residents can offer suggestions and feedback on legislative work close to home. Through this office, the opinions of local residents gathered by legislators were relayed to higher levels and taken into consideration during the legislation process.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Shanghai neighborhood has come to epitomize the country's whole-process people's democracy following a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping in November 2019, when he coined the term for the first time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As of 2025, the Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC Standing Committee had established 54 such outreach offices across the country, and there were more than 7,800 such offices established by provincial or municipal legislatures. These platforms have served as vital bridges between residents and lawmakers, ensuring that democratic participation is embedded in the legislative process.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While Western democracies often equate democracy with elections, China's whole-process people's democracy ensures public participation throughout the entire process of governance, covering all aspects of the democratic process and all sectors of society. This approach fosters broad and continuous participation, ensuring that governance decisions reflect the collective will and evolving needs of society.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Extensive participation</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>China's whole-process people's democracy integrates democratic practices across all government levels and at every stage of policymaking – from election and consultation to decision-making, implementation and oversight.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is embodied in the Two Sessions – the annual meetings of China's top legislature, the NPC and the top political advisory body, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Thousands of NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members convene in Beijing to deliberate on and discuss major policies and governance matters, representing a broad cross-section of society.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Over the years, innovation and creativity in grassroots democracy across urban and rural areas nationwide have become more dynamic than ever, unleashing great vitality at the grassroots level. From \"courtyard meeting halls\" and \"bench meetings\" to offline \"roundtable meetings\" and online \"deliberation groups,\" these pragmatic democratic practices based on local characteristics have provided sustained momentum for the development of China's democracy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2025, various departments of the State Council handled a total of 8,754 suggestions from NPC deputies and 4,868 proposals from CPPCC National Committee members, accounting for 95.6 percent and 97.3 percent of the total number of suggestions and proposals, respectively, according to a press conference held by the State Council Information Office on Friday. In particular, these departments adopted more than 4,900 suggestions and proposals from deputies and members, and issued more than 2,200 related policies and measures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Pooling wisdom for 15th Five-Year Plan</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The drafting of China's 15th Five-Year Plan (2026–2030) for economic and social development provides another vivid example. Deliberations on the draft outline are among the most closely watched items on the agenda of this year's Two Sessions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Friday, a key leadership meeting was held to discuss a draft outline of the 15th Five-Year Plan and a draft government work report to be submitted by the State Council to the upcoming annual session of the national legislature for review.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan has been a process of practicing whole-process people's democracy. From May 20 to June 20 last year, China launched an online public consultation to gather opinions for its next five-year plan. The initiative drew over 3.11 million valid submissions, yielding more than 1,500 constructive suggestions across 27 topics.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A summary of these findings was reviewed by Xi and submitted to the Party leadership, ensuring that citizens' voices were heard at the highest level. By September, a total of 2,112 suggestions had been collected from various regions, departments and sectors, resulting in 218 revisions to the document.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This broad-based participation demonstrates that national development strategies are rooted in public will, gathering strong momentum for Chinese modernization.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This whole-process people's democracy China is carrying out aligns with the goal of putting the people at the center. It enables them to decide and feel that they are the protagonists of the historical process that is taking place in China and the beneficiaries of the transformations that are happening,\" said Argentine sociologist Marcelo Rodriguez, director of the Hector P.
