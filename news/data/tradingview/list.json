            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><span>RNS Number : 5396F  Unilever PLC  30 October 2025  Â </span><p class=\"\"><span>Unilever PLC</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Statement regarding AGM Vote on Directors' Remuneration Report</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As announced following the Annual General Meeting (\"AGM\") held on 30 April 2025, 72.29% of votes were cast in favour of the resolution to receive and adopt the Directors' Remuneration Report (Resolution 2).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the Board was pleased that the resolution received majority support, Unilever PLC (the \"Company\") recognises the importance of understanding the reasons behind votes against. Following the AGM, the Company contacted its largest shareholders - representing 46.3% of the share register - as well as other shareholders that voted against the Directors' Remuneration Report and several proxy agencies. In total, we held 22 meetings to gain deeper insight into shareholder views and concerns regarding Directors' remuneration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shareholders who opposed the Directors' Remuneration Report consistently cited two key concerns. Firstly, the disapplication of time pro-ration on three outstanding long-term incentive awards for the former CEO, Alan Jope, and the former CFO, Graeme Pitkethly, who retired from the Company in 2022 and 2023 respectively. Secondly, the approach taken to setting fixed pay for Fernando Fernandez on his appointment as CEO.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company acknowledges that the disapplication of time pro-ration on three awards for the former CEO and former CFO were exceptional decisions taken in order to mitigate the impact of the disruption to the business at a time of significant change and uncertainty. The Company has publicly confirmed that it will apply time pro-ration to outstanding awards for future Director exits, in accordance with market practice and the remuneration policy. This was demonstrated by the recent treatment of outstanding long-term incentive awards for the former CEO, Hein Schumacher, where time pro-ration was applied to all unvested awards when Hein left the Company in March 2025. In dialogue with shareholders and proxies, it has been understood and recognised that the non-pro-ration of awards to former Directors is a legacy decision and not an ongoing issue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the approach to setting pay on appointment, the Company understands that some shareholders prefer to see phased progression over time as opposed to a more significant salary uplift from the outset. The Board took this feedback into account when determining fixed pay for Srinivas Phatak on his appointment as CFO in September 2025. His salary has been set at a lower level than the previous CFO's salary, and the Company intends to gradually move pay to the appropriate position relative to the market over the next 2-3 years, subject to performance and the wider external and internal context.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We would like to thank all of the shareholders and proxy agencies who spent time engaging with us recently and those who continue to engage with us over the coming months. The Company will continue to meet with shareholders regularly on remuneration related matters and their perspectives are critical inputs into the Board's discussions and decision making.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company is publishing this statement as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code in response to the votes received against the Directors' Remuneration Report resolution at its AGM held on 30 April 2025. A final summary will be provided in the Company's next Annual Report and Accounts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-End-</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For further information, please contact:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investor Relations: Investor.Relations@unilever.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unilever Press Office: Press-Office.London@unilever.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cautionary Statement</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This announcement may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws of certain jurisdictions, including 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Because these forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, a number of which may be beyond the Group's control, there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Among other risks and uncertainties, the material or principal factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements expressed in this announcement are: Unilever's global brands not meeting consumer preferences; Unilever's ability to innovate and remain competitive; Unilever's investment choices in its portfolio management; the effect of climate change on Unilever's business; Unilever's ability to find sustainable solutions to its plastic packaging; significant changes or deterioration in customer relationships; the recruitment and retention of talented employees; disruptions in Unilever's supply chain and distribution; increases or volatility in the cost of raw materials and commodities; the production of safe and high-quality products; secure and reliable IT infrastructure; execution of acquisitions, divestitures and business transformation projects, including the proposed separation of our Ice Cream business and the proposed consolidation of our share capital in connection with the demerger; economic, social and political risks and natural disasters; financial risks; failure to meet high and ethical standards; and managing regulatory, tax and legal matters and practices with regard to the interpretation and application thereof and emerging and developing ESG reporting standards including differences in implementation of climate and sustainability policies in the regions where the Group operates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future performance, taking into account all information currently available to us.

New risks and uncertainties arise over time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us.

The trio of technology titans disclosed on Wednesday that they had spent another $63 billion in the latest quarter developing large-language models.

ChatGPT maker OpenAI said on Tuesday that it would buy an additional $250 billion of storage and related services from Microsoft as part of a broader restructuring in their relationship.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are reasons to worry about Microsoft's machine-learning outlays. Capital expenditures during the third quarter swelled 30% to $19 billion, a figure that understates the total because many data centers depend on long-term leases. The company's focus on business customers, however, who are often reluctant to switch suppliers and pay recurring subscription fees, provides an extra degree of security. Nadella also will dial back investment in case of trouble and put extra computing capacity to work internally.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:535.7746478873239px;max-width:1200px;aspect-ratio:2.2397476340694005\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3WB0HA-69ed299e6805e49aa4483f37cd4fdd10-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Multiple bar charts showing Capex and capitalized leases as a proportion of cash generated from operations for Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3WB0HA-69ed299e6805e49aa4483f37cd4fdd10-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#eeeae6\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-S5VA5POt\"><span class=\"copyright-S5VA5POt\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-S5VA5POt\">AI investment is chewing up more tech cash</span></figcaption></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Googleâs web-search dominance faces the most immediate threat from AI.

After the first three quarters of the year, Stockholm Arlanda Airport currently ranks as Europeâs most punctual major airport, according to Eurocontrol. This measurement relates to the first nine months of the year and represents a clear improvement compared with the corresponding period in 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In September, Arlandaâs Marketplace was named âCommercial Space of the Yearâ at the prestigious NCSC (Nordic Commercial Spaces &amp; Communities) Nordic Awards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The airportsâ commercial spaces have been contracted out through competitive tenders, significantly improving commercial revenue per passenger. This revenue is an important part of Swedaviaâs business model and makes a significant contribution to Swedaviaâs ability to offer competitive airport charges.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The development of the Arlanda of the future continues. The Passenger boarding bridges and stands project is progressing according to plan. This is an important part of ensuring a continued high level of operational capability and a smooth passenger experience.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Norwegian is continuing its ongoing expansion and Ryanair has also announced new investments at Swediaviaâs airports in general and Arlanda in particular. Several other airlines are also growing by double-digit percentages at Arlanda right now. Both the abolition of the aviation tax and Swedaviaâs earlier investments to further improve the competitiveness of our airports have contributed to this development. At the same time, connectivity in the form of direct intercontinental connections in particular requires further improvement. The change in strategy of SAS, moving its long-haul routes to Copenhagen, increases the need to attract incoming airlines to Arlanda. Swedaviaâs competitive charges and a strong corporate market provide good conditions for the company. Together with the business community and politicians, challenges in the form of the weaker domestic market, insufficient aircraft capacity globally and inadequate efforts to proactively market Sweden as a tourist destination are being actively addressed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The consultation period for the governmentâs infrastructure review in relation to Arlanda recently ended. Swedavia looks forward to seeing some concrete decisions and activities. At the same time, a review is under way of the future shape of Swedenâs national basic infrastructure. From this perspective, it is important to achieve as broad a political consensus as possible.
