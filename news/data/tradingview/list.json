            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Giulia Petroni</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here's a look at what happened in oil markets in the week of Oct. 27-31 and what the focus will be in the days to come.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OVERVIEW: Crude benchmarks are on track for weekly losses of more than 2% on a stronger U.S. dollar and as concerns over rising global supply outweigh the impact of U.S. sanctions on Russian oil exports. Brent crude trades around $64 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate is above $60 a barrel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MACRO: The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point earlier this week, but Chair Jerome Powell said further cuts in December are far from certain. The U.S. government shutdown has paused economic data releases, complicating the path ahead.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Traders scaled back their bets and now see a 65% chance that the U.S. bank will lower rates at its December meeting, according to the FedWatch tool.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>GEOPOLITICAL RISKS: President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping reached a trade agreement following a summit in South Korea, de-escalating a conflict that threatens to impact global economic growth and demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deal includes a reduction in stiff U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for China's commitment to crack down on the trade in the chemicals used to produce fentanyl. China also agreed to delay the introduction of its latest round of export controls on rare earths, though many underlying issues between the two superpowers haven't been addressed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The U.S.-China trade deal failed to tackle purchases of Russian oil,\" analysts at ANZ Research said. \"There has been no indication on the Chinese side as to whether they will stop buying.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, traders are closely monitoring Russian oil exports after the U.S. imposed sanctions on the country's largest oil companies, with Rystad Energy estimating that between 500,000-600,000 bpd of Russian oil production is currently at risk of being curtailed in the next two months. However, oil's reaction suggests that the market isn't convinced a significant amount of Russian supply will be lost, according to market watchers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SUPPLY AND DEMAND: The latest data from the Energy Information Administration showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 6.9 million barrels last week, against expectations of a 200,000-barrel decline. Gasoline inventories dropped by 5.9 million barrels, sending positive signals about demand in the world's largest oil consumer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies are expected to opt for another modest output increase for December at their upcoming meeting this week. \"The uncertainty surrounding sanctions on Russia also supports this increase,\" analysts at ING said. \"The move will only reinforce the bearish outlook for the market, adding to the substantial surplus expected through 2026.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WHAT'S AHEAD: Key members of the OPEC+ alliance are scheduled to meet virtually on Sunday to discuss their production plans. Most market watchers expect the group to approve an increase of 137,000 barrels a day, consistent with October and November levels. \"Only a larger increase would lead to a negative price reaction,\" said Carsten Fritsch from Commerzbank Research.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the macroeconomic front, markets are awaiting speeches from Federal Reserve officials next week to gauge the future direction of U.S. monetary policy. Meanwhile, Trump urged Senate Republicans to end the filibuster--the longstanding rule requiring 60 votes to advance most legislation--in a bid to reopen the government without Democratic support.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Giulia Petroni at giulia.petroni@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "title": "Treasury Is About to Reveal Its Borrowing Plans. Why That's Important. — Barrons.com",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Randall W. Forsyth</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Federal Reserve's policy meeting this week sent shock waves through the markets, with Chair Jerome Powell's warning that a further interest-rate cut at its December gathering was far from assured, contrary to expectations that another quarter-percentage-point move was all but certain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By contrast, it's unlikely that a similar impact will be felt when the Treasury Department outlines its borrowing plans this coming week. Treasury plans typically don't get nearly the attention of central bank announcements. But its statement could affect bonds, and in turn other asset prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's because the mix of Uncle Sam's securities sales could affect yields just as Fed operations do. By continuing to lean heavily on short-term Treasury bill sales and not increasing issuance of lengthier notes and bonds, the government could lower the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note by a third of a percentage point over the medium term, according to one estimate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's no small matter to the Trump administration. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last February that he and President Donald Trump were focused on the 10-year Treasury, which importantly influences other borrowing costs, especially home mortgage rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The president further said in June that he wanted to refinance $9 trillion in maturing Treasuries with short-term debt, which would be replaced after Powell's term as Fed chair ends next May. \"Then we're gonna get somebody into the Fed who's going to be able to lower [the rates],\" he said in an interview with Fox Business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Boosting T-bills' portion of total Treasury financing, from around 20% of the total currently — while holding issuance of notes and bonds steady — would have the same effect as reducing the supply of 10-year notes by $1 trillion over the current fiscal year and next, according to a report this past week from BofA Securities' rate strategists led by Meghan Swiber. They estimate that would reduce the benchmark yield by between 31 and 34 basis points (or hundredths of a percentage point) over time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In effect, the BofA strategists write, increasing the T-bill share of federal financing amounts to \"backdoor QE,\" or quantitative easing. That's when the Fed purchases securities, which colloquially would be called \"printing money.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is no small irony in this. Last year, Bessent criticized the Treasury, then led by Janet Yellen, for leaning on short-term T-bills in order to hold down longer-term rates ahead of the 2024 election. But he has continued that Biden administration borrowing schedule.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bessent was joined in that criticism last year by Stephen Miran, who co-authored a paper with Nouriel Roubini. \"Activist Treasury issuance\" practices, they wrote, were \"dynamically managing financial conditions and through them, the economy, usurping core functions of the Federal Reserve.\" Miran, of course, is now a Fed governor while on leave from the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and this past week dissented for a second time in favor of more aggressive rate cuts by the central bank.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reducing the available supply of risk-free longer-term securities results in easier financial conditions, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke wrote in a Washington Post op-ed column in November 2010, as the central bank was undertaking another round of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, purchases. Conversely, the supply of longer-dated government paper can be kept low by the Treasury limiting their sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most analysts look for the Treasury to hold its longer-maturity issuance steady in the coming quarter. But a surprise cut in the 10-to-30-year range could prompt a yield decline of 10 basis points and as much as 20, according to a note this past week from Wells Fargo strategist Angelo Manolatos. More than the actual size of the reduction, the market will react to the signal sent by such a shift in financing plans, he added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Manolatos sees the Treasury continuing to ramp up its T-bill issues to 24% of the market by the end of 2027, from 21.5% as of September. J.P. Morgan fixed-income strategists led by Jay Barry estimate that T-bills' share could hit 27% by the end of 2028, if the Treasury solely used bills and didn't boost note and bond auctions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stepped-up bill issuance by the Treasury would jibe with the Fed's announced end of quantitative tightening, which was anticipated. In addition to no longer letting $5 billion a month of Treasury securities run off at maturity, it will reinvest principal payments on agency mortgage securities into T-bills. JPM's strategists estimate that the Fed will buy $15 billion a month in T-bills from MBS proceeds plus another $8 billion a month to offset bank reserve drains from currency demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another growing source of demand comes from stablecoins, which are mainly backed by T-bills. The largest is Tether's, which had $157 billion of its stablecoins outstanding at the end of the second quarter, backed by $105.5 billion of T-bills and $16.3 billion overnight repurchase agreements backed by Treasuries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That makes Tether one of the largest nonsovereign T-bill holders, with about 2% of total supply. (By comparison, the Fed held $195.5 billion of T-bills out of its $4.2 trillion Treasury portfolio as of Wednesday.) One recent paper estimates that a one-percentage-point increase in Tether's share of the T-bill market could reduce yields by 14 to 16 basis points.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One big question mark is the fate of tariffs imposed by the White House under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Supreme Court is considering the legality of the IEEPA tariffs and will hear oral arguments on Wednesday. If the tariffs are struck down, J.P. Morgan estimates $100 billion of tariff revenue could be eligible for refunds, though it expects actual refund payments would be less and a smaller drain of the Treasury's cash.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beyond influencing interest rates and the economy, Treasury's plans affect federal debt, which just passed $38 trillion, with red ink likely headed to $2 trillion annually over the coming decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Every basis point saved in financing costs counts. Interest on the national debt is headed to $1 trillion annually, the fiscal watchdog group adds, which exceeds defense expenditures. But leaning too heavily on T-bills can backfire if short-term rates would have to rise materially.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Randall W.

Still, recent gross domestic product data for August were weaker than expected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The latest rate cut will likely be the last one in the current cycle, but if the economy or labor market weakens more than expected the central bank could trim rates a little further, Oxford Economics' Tony Stillo and Michael Davenport said in a note.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Latin America</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Brazil's central bank announces a rate decision on Wednesday and is expected to leave rates unchanged at 15.00%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The gradual and steady re-anchoring process of inflation expectations and the current domestic slowdown are likely to continue improving the inflation outlook going forward,\" Citi analysts said in a note. They expect the central bank to begin gradually lowering rates in the first quarter of 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mexico's central bank is also set to announce a decision on Thursday, where it is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points in order to bolster the economy, taking the key interest rate down to 7.25%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Eurozone</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A quiet week in data follows the European Central Bank's policy meeting, where rates were left unchanged amid a relatively upbeat view on the eurozone's growth outlook.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Spanish, Italian, French, German and eurozone final manufacturing purchasing managers indexes for October are up for release on Monday, followed by services PMIs on Wednesday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Germany publishes manufacturing orders data for September on Wednesday and industrial output figures on Thursday.

ING analyst Francesco Pesole said in a note that solid Swedish economic growth argues against the Riksbank cutting interest rates again any time soon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Norges Bank is also expected to keep rates on hold at 4.0%, confirming it is in no hurry to increase rates further.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Denmark and Sweden will hold bond auctions on Wednesday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Poland</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Poland's central bank will announce a policy decision on Wednesday where another interest-rate cut is widely expected. Market pricing implies an 85% chance of another 25 basis points rate cut to 4.25%, LSEG data show.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the October meeting, the central bank unexpectedly cut rates by 25 basis. It marked the fourth cut this year and came after inflation held at 2.9% in September, coming in below expectations. Data Friday showed inflation eased to 2.8% in October, strengthening the case for further rate cuts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Czech Republic</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Czech National Bank announces its latest interest-rate decision on Thursday. Markets are pricing a 65% probability that the central bank will leave rates unchanged at 3.5% and a 35% chance of a 25 basis-point cut, LSEG data show.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While inflation eased to 2% in September, stronger-than-expected economic growth data argues that the central bank should be cautious about cutting rates, ING analyst Chris Turner said in a note.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The economy is growing at its fastest pace since the Covid rebound, and at the same time, wages are showing upside, which will keep core inflation higher,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Switzerland</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Switzerland releases consumer-price inflation data for October on Monday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Japan</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Wednesday, the Bank of Japan will release minutes from its September meeting that will shed light into the central bank's decision to hold rates steady. At that meeting, two board members proposed hiking the policy rate to 0.75%, a proposal that was ultimately defeated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Japan's finance ministry is set to auction about 2.6 trillion yen of 10-year Japanese Government bonds on Wednesday. The sale could draw strong demand from investors following BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda's recent comments after the central bank held rates steady again in October. He said he sees no risk of Japan falling behind the policy curve, suggesting the BOJ is in no rush to tighten policy settings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He also said the central bank wants to further assess wage growth momentum and review more economic data before considering rate increases.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Japanese markets will be closed on Monday for a national holiday. Auto sale figures for October, a gauge of consumer demand, are due Tuesday, while household spending data will be released Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Markets will focus on a fresh batch of economic data from China following the recent easing of U.S.-China trade tensions.

The RatingDog manufacturing PMI, due Monday, is likely to have edged down to 50.0 from 51.2 in September amid slowing export growth, Nomura analysts said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Capital Economics' Zichun Huang noted that while private PMI readings have been stronger than official data recently, \"the message is likely to be that growth momentum remains subdued, and we don't expect that to change in the coming quarters.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China is also set to release October trade data on Friday. Nomura analysts expect export growth to slow sharply to 3.0% on year from 8.3% in September and import growth to ease to 5.0% from 7.4%, marginally widening the trade surplus to $94 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ANZ's Raymond Yeung projects exports and imports growth of just 1.2% and 2.3%, respectively, in U.S. dollar terms, citing fewer working days during the month and a high base last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China's foreign-exchange reserves data is also scheduled for release during the week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Australia/New Zealand</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Reserve Bank of Australia will dominate the spotlight on Tuesday with a likely decision to leave interest rates unchanged at 3.60%, while signaling an extended period on the sidelines.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Third-quarter inflation came in well above expectations, effectively wiping out any near-term prospects for rate cuts. The RBA also faces surging house prices, which argue strongly against easing for now.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With core inflation back at the top of the RBA's target range, some economists are even speculating that the next move in rates will be upward--but not until 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The RBA has only cut rates three times in total and raised them less than many of its global peers, so a shallow easing cycle was always likely.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In New Zealand, third-quarter employment data due Wednesday are expected to show the jobless rate remaining above 5.0%. Despite significant rate cuts over the past year, New Zealand's economy remains weak and employment growth has yet to recover.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has said much of its policy easing has yet to reach households, many of which have fixed mortgage rates. With spare capacity still high, the RBNZ is expected to continue lowering rates over the coming months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Asia PMIs</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Monday sees a slew of PMI prints for Asia that will provide fresh signals on how tariff policies have affected manufacturing activity and sentiment in the region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The readings, capturing manufacturing trends in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and other Asian economies, will likely show continued divergence across the region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The prior round of purchasing managers surveys indicated an uptick in output at the end of the third quarter, but also weak spots in exports and subdued demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Markets will scrutinize October's data for signs of improving market conditions for Asia's manufacturers. Producers in export powerhouses like Japan and Taiwan have flagged deteriorating demand and sentiment toward the outlook for the months ahead has soured in some parts of the region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite fears that Asia's exports growth will fade in the second half of the year, figures from recent months do not reflect that, ANZ's research team said, highlighting particularly strong demand for electronic goods.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Malaysia</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bank Negara Malaysia is scheduled to announce its November policy decision Thursday afternoon. Given stronger-than-expected third-quarter GDP growth, there is \"little reason\" for the central bank to cut its policy rate in the near term, Barclays said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking ahead, GDP growth for 2026 is expected to remain firm at 4.5%, supported by new budget measures aimed at boosting private consumption and investment amid lingering external challenges and ongoing fiscal reforms, UOB economists Julia Goh and Loke Siew Ting said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This steady growth outlook should allow Bank Negara to keep the policy rate unchanged at 2.75% throughout the year, they added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Indonesia</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Indonesia will release September's trade and October inflation data Monday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Export growth likely rebounded due to favorable base effects and strong external demand, Barclays said. Looking ahead, Indonesia's trade ties with the U.S. could continue to weigh on the exports due to higher tariffs, while imports may benefit from reciprocal arrangements, UOB economists Enrico Tanuwidjaja and Vincentius Ming Shen said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Citi expects October inflation at 2.81% from 2.65% in September, driven by higher food prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Core inflation likely eased to 2.06% from 2.19% amid moderate demand, ANZ said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bank Indonesia's pro-growth stance suggests the easing cycle isn't over, with ANZ expecting two additional 25-basis-point cuts, bringing the policy rate down to 4.25% by the first quarter of next year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Indonesia's statistics bureau will release third-quarter GDP data Wednesday afternoon. Growth likely eased to 5.0% from 5.12% in the prior quarter, ANZ said. Indicators point to weaker consumer confidence, slower car sales, moderated loan growth, softer capital goods imports and budget disbursement delays, it said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net exports likely provided some support, while fourth-quarter stimulus measures worth 46 trillion rupiah, equivalent to 0.2% of GDP, should help boost private consumption, ANZ added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>South Korea</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>South Korea is due to release its October inflation data Tuesday. Headline inflation likely picked up marginally, according to a Wall Street Journal survey.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The median forecast from a WSJ poll of seven economists calls for a 2.2% on-year rise in the benchmark consumer-price index, following a 2.1% gain in September. On a monthly basis, the index likely edged up 0.1% after September's 0.5% increase.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Citigroup economist Jin-Wook Kim said inflationary pressure from higher agricultural products during the early-October Chuseok holiday may have eased somewhat, while Shinyoung Securities economist Cho Yong-gu said higher prices for industrial goods and utility likely kept overall inflation elevated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Taiwan</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Taiwan reports trade data on Friday, which will show if the island's run of exports growth continued at the start of the fourth quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Frontloading of shipments to get ahead of U.S. tariffs, plus booming demand for the chips and electronics, have powered Taiwan's exports through the year, lifting the outlook for the broader economy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some economists have expected that momentum to correct somewhat in the second half of the year. DBS's economics team thinks exports growth likely slowed but stayed solid at about 30% on year as the delay in U.S. semiconductor tariffs encouraged frontloading and AI-related demand remained strong.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The trade data will be preceded by inflation figures for October that will likely show an uptick in price growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Economists at HSBC point out the pullback in September was down to tax cuts, and the timing of the Mid-Autumn festival. The holiday, which fell later this year, will likely push inflation higher in October. A temporary hike in household electricity fees likely also drove up inflation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Philippines</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors will focus on the Philippines' inflation and GDP data for signs of how policy easing and fiscal spending are filtering through the economy. Rice prices likely rose slightly in October, driving headline inflation higher, Barclays said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Third-quarter GDP growth likely slowed sharply due to a significant decline in government spending, ING said, citing corruption scandals associated with flood-control projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Business sentiment also weakened, with tariff uncertainties adding further drag, ING added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thailand</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thailand will release its October inflation data during the week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consumer prices likely turned more negative, ANZ said, following government measures to cut retail diesel and gasoline prices and lower raw material costs amid favorable weather conditions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While prices of some items may have risen, HSBC economists expect price pressures to remain soft, with consumer demand still cooling on the back of high household debt and subdued confidence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Any references to days are in local times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Jessica Fleetham at jessica.fleetham@wsj.com and Jihye Lee at jihye.lee@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
