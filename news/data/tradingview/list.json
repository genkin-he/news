Asian importers other than China have imported between 8 million and 10 million tons annually in recent years, according to U.S. Census Bureau trade data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The most-active soybean contract on the Chicago Board of Trade </span><span> reversed losses and closed 1.2% higher at a 15-month high of $11.07-3/4 per bushel. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. soybean export prices jumped by $20 to $30 per metric ton this week as exporters anticipated the Trump-Xi meeting would spark fresh demand. Three soy cargoes, or about 180,000 tons, were sold to Chinese state-owned importer COFCO on the eve of the summit. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"These (Chinese purchase agreements) are not numbers that are unattainable, but they're also not numbers that are really supporting the idea of expansion for our U.S. soybean export program,\" said Ted Seifried, chief market strategist for Zaner Ag Hedge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>RELIEF IN THE U.S. FARM BELT</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. farm groups cheered the agreements after Trump's bruising trade war eroded soy exports valued at $24.5 billion last year. Growers have nearly finished harvesting what is expected to be the fifth-largest U.S. crop on record.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The lack of Chinese demand has squeezed U.S. farm incomes as crop prices hovered near multi-year lows for months amid rising costs for fertilizer, seeds, labour and equipment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is a meaningful step forward to reestablishing a stable, long-term trading relationship that delivers results for farm families and future generations,\" said American Soybean Association President and Kentucky farmer Caleb Ragland.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The agreement with China came after Trump secured agricultural trade deals or framework agreements with other Asian nations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Expanding markets and restoring purchases by China will provide some certainty for farmers who are struggling just to hold on,\" said American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CHINA DIVERSIFYING SOYBEAN PURCHASES</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump wrote in a social media post overnight after his meeting with Xi that the Chinese leader had authorized China to begin the purchase of massive amounts of soybeans, sorghum and other farm products.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins applauded Trump's comments on soybeans and sorghum in a post on X.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But Even Rogers Pay, director at Beijing-based Trivium China, said the agreement effectively constituted a return to business as usual in terms of U.S. soybean exports to China. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It targets a level of trade that has been pretty consistent with the past few years,\" she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Johnny Xiang, founder of Beijing-based AgRadar Consulting, said commercial buyers were still awaiting details such as whether China would reduce the tariff on U.S. soybeans from 20% to 10%, or remove it entirely.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If the tariff is not completely lifted, commercial buyers will have little incentive to purchase U.S. soybeans,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China, the world's biggest soybean buyer and the top market for U.S. farmers, had turned its vast appetite for U.S. crops into a powerful trade war bargaining chip.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Facing import duties of 23% on soybeans after rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs, Chinese buyers largely shunned the U.S. autumn harvest, turning instead to South American supplies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since the trade war of the first Trump administration, China has diversified its sources of soybean imports. In 2024, China bought roughly 20% of its soybeans from the United States, down from 41% in 2016, customs data shows.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Sean McLain</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon.com reported rising revenue and profit for the third quarter, propelled by strong retail sales as well as continued growth in its cloud-computing and artificial intelligence business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The e-commerce giant said sales for the period rose 13%, to $180 billion. Net profit rose 39% to $21.2 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Revenue from Amazon Web Services, the source of much of the company's profits, climbed 20% in the three-month period. Rivals Alphabet and Microsoft said Wednesday that their cloud-computing businesses grew 40% and 34%, respectively.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon said it expected sales for the fourth quarter to be between $206 billion to $213 billion and operating profit of between $21 billion and $26 billion, as the company enters the busy holiday shopping season.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon said one-time charges from a legal settlement and a workforce restructuring weighed on earnings for the period. In September, the company agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle a lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission over its Prime subscription policies. This week, the company announced it was cutting 14,000 white-collar jobs, which Amazon expects to cost $1.8 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon shares gained around 10% in after-hours trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon is a giant in the cloud-computing business, hosting websites, apps and services for an array of companies and clients. Its importance was underlined earlier this month when a problem in one of its East Coast data centers knocked out access to websites and apps for millions of Americans.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But much of Amazon's future growth relies on next-generation offerings in AI. The company has said that demand for Amazon cloud and AI products have outpaced its ability to bring new data centers online. While Amazon has the biggest cloud business by revenue, the perception that the tech giant is falling behind nimbler competitors has weighed on the company's stock price.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are early signs that Amazon's capacity constraints are starting to loosen. On Wednesday, Amazon said one of its largest AI data center investments, Project Rainier, was now fully operational.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We continue to see strong momentum and growth across Amazon as AI drives meaningful improvements in every corner of our business,\" said Amazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy in a news release.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tepid investor response to Amazon's results come despite strong gains in the e-commerce giant's retail sales growth. The company continues to benefit from strong U.S. consumer spending, despite rising fears about the economy and job losses. Amazon has managed so far to weather President Trump's trade war, with sales continuing to rise despite the reliance of many Amazon sellers on China for materials and manufacturing. The company has said it hadn't detected \"meaningful\" price increases on Amazon.com, indicating that sellers may be absorbing some of the tariff costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon is seeking to consolidate its grip on American wallets by investing in faster and cheaper deliveries. The company says whenever it provides those services, people buy more things from Amazon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is investing in new robots and AI tools designed to make warehouses smaller and more efficient. The hope is that more compact storage spaces can be placed closer to customer's homes and AI can better predict what people want to buy. Shorter delivery times drive down logistics costs, analysts say.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Sean McLain at sean.mclain@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

Datasembly said Halloween discounts on all candy brands started earlier this year, were deeper and covered more items than in the past. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These include products from Mondelez </span><span>, which makes Sour Patch Kids sweets, and Mars, home of M&amp;M's and Skittles, as well as Hershey, famous for Kisses and KitKat bars. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Hershey spokesperson said that its seasonal candy - like pumpkin-shaped Reese's - had significantly fewer discounts this year than last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hershey told retailers in July it would be implementing a double-digit price increase on average on its candy, and media reports said this would be about 10%. The spokesperson said Halloween candy was not included in that price hike, and the company has not significantly changed its spending on Halloween discounts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Halloween candy shopping continues throughout October, and the data cited by Jeffries covered all Hershey products which include salty snacks. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Overall, chocolate candy sales per unit were flat in the 12 weeks ended October 5, but prices rose 8%, according to Circana, a market research firm. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>HALLOWEEN IS 'MAKE OR BREAK' FOR CANDY COMPANIES </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hershey CEO Kirk Tanner said on Thursday that Halloween sales were \"somewhat soft,\" and he cited warmer weather and the timing of the holiday later in the week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After peaking in late 2024, the price of cocoa — the key ingredient in chocolate — has moderated but remains historically high at about triple its pre-2022 level.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Retail candy prices still do not cover that historic rise so manufacturers are trying to pass on costs to consumers in an effort to restore profit margins.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Halloween and seasonal occasions like Easter and Valentine's Day are especially important for confectioners because consumers budget for holiday treats. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It’s make or break for our seasonal business,\" said Chantal Butler, Mondelez president of North American confectionery.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hershey is among 31 food makers tracked by investment bank Jeffries that had the biggest increase in volume of goods sold with a discount in the four weeks ended October 4, according to a Jeffries research note that cited Nielsen data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consumers love holiday treats but right now want they want \"the best bang for their buck and are waiting for promotions. They won't opt out of the holiday,\" said Katie Thomas, the lead of the Kearney Consumer Institute.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thomas added that consumers are increasingly aware of package sizes as companies shrink them to keep prices stable, a tactic known as \"shrinkflation.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's not just the price, it's the value,\" she said. \"Not only do I not want to pay $30 (for a bag of candy), I don't want to pay $30 for really small pieces of candy.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Tuesday, Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put said some of its promotions in recent months have not been effective, adding consumers are \"very concerned in general about the economy.\"</span></p></span></div></div>",
