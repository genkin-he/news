            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Paul Vieira</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OTTAWA--Anger over President Trump's trade policy has fueled a notable increase in Canadian spending on domestic products and local tourism, according to research from the Bank of Canada.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The central bank's analysis, published Thursday, also suggests that momentum behind buying Canadian remains solid with no sign of ebbing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Should Canadian consumers continue to prefer domestic products over U.S. goods and services, this spending shift could not only affect the composition of Canada's gross domestic product but also have an impact on inflationary pressures,\" the report said. The research was conducted by the central bank's analysts and produced independently from the Bank of Canada's governing council, which decides on rate policy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump's protectionist trade policy, along with musings from Trump about using economic force to annex Canada as a 51st state, triggered a Buy Canadian movement in the country. People vowed not to travel to the U.S., and Statistics Canada data bear this out. Grocers continue to prominently mark certain products in aisles as made-in-Canada.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Overall, trade-policy uncertainty has cast a pall over the Canadian economy, as companies curb investment plans and hiring until the future of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade treaty, or USMCA, is settled. Senior Bank of Canada officials have called the pending U.S.-led review of USMCA later this year as an important risk to the economic outlook.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Statistics Canada data earlier this week indicated trips by Canadians to the U.S. fell by 25% in 2025 — or the largest year-over-year decline ever recorded excluding the Covid-19 pandemic period. The Bank of Canada report indicates that Canadians, instead, took 4% more trips domestically between the first and third quarters of last year, and spent 10% more on travel and tourism during that same timeframe.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As for the purchasing of goods, the Bank of Canada analysts used detailed, transaction-level data from NielsenIQ. The data indicate that since March, 2025, households have shifted food spending away from U.S. products and toward Canadian ones. \"The shift is modest but clearly visible,\" the report said. The central bank said the shift was more pronounced in categories such as coffee and fruit juice.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Outside of food, where Canadian substitutes are often harder to find, we see no comparable shift in spending patterns,\" the central bank research said. The report added that retaliatory tariffs imposed by Canada on certain goods might have also prompted a shift away from U.S. products — although Prime Minister Mark Carney dropped most of those duties in late August.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most Canadian exports arriving in the U.S. are free of tariffs, because they comply with the terms under USMCA. The White House also provided an exemption for Canada and Mexico from Trump's new global tariff of 15%, revealed about a week ago after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling invalidating his original levies. It's unclear whether that exemption will remain as part of the U.S. review of USMCA.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

It's about who's going to be the winners? How do these firms keep competitive advantages? There's a lot of upstream and downstream impact that the market is really having trouble sorting out.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Several heavyweight technology companies traded lower on Wall Street. Alphabet </span><span> was down 2.5%, Apple </span><span> fell 1%, Amazon </span><span> lost 2%, Oracle </span><span> shed 0.3% and Tesla </span><span> traded lower by 3%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I always go back to the curse of high expectations, where with Nvidia, everything has to be perfect in order for it continue to thrive and to appreciate. And I think right now they maybe didn't reassure investors enough that the line of sight was clear,\" St. Aubin said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Salesforce </span><span>, which reported quarterly revenue higher than analyst estimates after markets closed on Wednesday, was up 2.2%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>London Stock Exchange Group's shares </span><span> jumped 9% in London after it announced a $4.1 billion buyback under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management, which recently built a stake in the data provider.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>NUCLEAR TALKS</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors are eyeing indirect talks between the United States and Iran over their long-running nuclear dispute. Oil prices rose in a volatile session as markets awaited the outcome of the talks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Brent crude futures </span><span> were up 2%, at $72.27 a barrel. U.S. crude futures </span><span> rose 1.7% to $66.53.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Treasury bond prices in the U.S. and Europe edged higher on the back of safe-haven bids as investors grew nervous about tensions involving Iran.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes </span><span> fell 2.3 basis points to 4.025%. The 2-year note (US2YT=RR) yield fell 1.8 basis points to 3.453%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     In Europe, the yield on the benchmark German 10-year Bunds (DE10YT=RR) lost 0.4 basis point to 2.694%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     Safe-haven gold rose, with spot gold </span><span> adding 0.17% to $5,179.23 an ounce.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     In currency markets, the dollar rose against major currencies, including the euro and Swiss franc.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     The euro </span><span> was down 0.25% at $1.178 against the dollar.
