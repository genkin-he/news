Is it time to take some profits?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The S&amp;P 500 is coming off its best midyear stretch since the 1950s. Now it's a question of taking some profits or holding for a rally at year-end.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With the S&amp;P 500 on pace for a 16% yearly gain already, investors find themselves at a familiar crossroads: lock in profits while they are hot, or stay greedy and bet on a typical year-end rally that could push stocks to new highs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The S&amp;P 500 SPX just defied one of Wall Street's most entrenched seasonal clichés - \"sell in May and go away\" - with its strongest May-through-October stretch since 1950. Historically, this six-month stretch is the worst seasonal period for stocks, with an average gain of only 2.1%, according to data compiled by LPL Financials. But this time, the S&amp;P 500 advanced 22.9% during the period, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was up nearly 17% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP surged 36%, according to FactSet data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>History also shows that when stocks resist the \"sell in May\" slump with double-digit summer gains, the rally often has more room to run.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 12% from November through April in such cases, outpacing the market's usual 7% return during its most favorable six-month window, said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial (see chart below).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SOURCE: LPL Research, Bloomberg</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As October drew to a close, investors turned their attentions to the final two months of the year - a period that's historically bullish - while wondering whether a year-end rally is already underway.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>History suggests that the S&amp;P 500 has shined the brightest in November and December, averaging a 3.1% gain during those two-month periods since 1945, while logging positive returns 76% of the time, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To be sure, seasonal trends do not always translate into reality and should always be viewed in the context of current market conditions. Seasonality simply reflects the broader market climate rather than the immediate setup on Wall Street - meaning stock performance through year-end doesn't have to follow any seasonal script, LPL's Turnquist noted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After all, \"economic conditions, earnings, geopolitics, along with fiscal, monetary and trade policy, are much bigger drivers of price action\" in the stock market this year, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stovall told MarketWatch that macro forces also support the case for a year-end rally. His CFRA team continues to see stock prices advancing through the end of 2025 on \"an improvement in earnings-growth expectations\" combined with potentially another interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve in December.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We're still looking for two Fed rate cuts in 2026, so that could also help to shore up stock prices, at least through the end of April,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See: Will the Fed cut interest rates in December? Here's what experts are saying.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. central bank last week voted to lower the target range for the federal-funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 3.75% and 4%, and officially announced its plan to stop shrinking its portfolio of assets beginning Dec. 1. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned investors against assuming another rate reduction will follow in December, saying it's \"not a foregone conclusion\".</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a result, investors have scaled back expectations for a December rate cut, with fed-funds futures traders on Friday only pricing in a 69% chance of a rate reduction at the end of the year, down from 90% before the October policy meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See: Here's what a government shutdown means for markets - and your wallet</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Of course, investors can't ignore the political storm clouds gathering in Washington. The ongoing government shutdown - now stretching into its second month - is beginning to ripple through the economy and straining American households.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The longer the government shutdown lasts, the bigger of a potential drag it could have on consumer confidence, said Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at SimCorp. \"So far, we haven't seen the impact, but I've got to imagine that eventually we are going to see the impact, as people are not getting paid or [receiving] food benefits,\" she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. stocks finished higher on Friday, while also scoring weekly and monthly gains. The S&amp;P 500 advanced 2.3% in October, while the Dow was up 2.5% and the Nasdaq surged 4.7% for the month, according to FactSet data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Joy Wiltermuth contributed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Isabel Wang</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

It culminates efforts New Mexico has made to expand access to free child care since the governor and state legislature created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department in 2019. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The launch comes as other Democratic-run states, cities and counties eye a step popular among working families. Connecticut recently passed a bill making child care free for those families earning under $100,000 per year and no more than 7% of income for those earning more. New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has proposed no-cost universal child care.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>BIG SAVINGS FOR FAMILIES</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Taos special education teacher Allyson O'Brien expects to save around $12,000 a year in child care bills for her son Otis, who is nearly 2-1/2. She and her husband Shawn O'Kelly, a truck driver, earn a fraction above New Mexico's previous income cap for free child care, which was about $129,000 per year for their family of four.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We'll be able to go on vacation, we won't have to decide what bills we're going to pay, like, are we going to do propane or the mortgage?\" O'Brien said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To achieve a fully universal system, New Mexico must create nearly 14,000 more child care slots and recruit 5,000 educators, according to its Democratic-run government. The state is establishing a $12.7 million low-interest loan fund to construct and expand child care facilities. It is also increasing reimbursement rates to providers that pay entry-level staff a minimum of $18 per hour, above the state's $12 hourly minimum wage, and offer full-time care.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alison McPartlon, director of the University of New Mexico-Taos Kids' Campus child care center, said her waiting list is so long some children do not get in before they start kindergarten. She said higher reimbursement rates will help her retain and recruit educators.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There will be more centers coming up,\" said McPartlon, describing the shift to universal child care as \"incredible.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ADDRESSING POVERTY</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham told reporters child care was \"the backbone of creating a system of support for families that allows them to work, to go to college, to do all the things they need to do to continue to lift New Mexico out of poverty.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nearly 18% of New Mexicans live below the poverty line, according to the U.S. Census, making it one of the poorest states. Slightly larger in area than the United Kingdom, with only 2.1 million people, New Mexico is paying for universal child care primarily through funds generated by its oil and gas sector, the second-biggest of any state.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Research shows quality child care lifts education outcomes, especially among low-income families, according to Philip Fisher, a professor of early childhood learning at Stanford University.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reading levels of New Mexican students fall far below the national average when children are first tested around age 8 or 9, according to studies by Neal Halfon, professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Los Angeles. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Annie E. Casey Foundation has, for years, ranked New Mexico last among states in both education and child well-being. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     New Mexico joins countries such as Norway and Belgium that offer free universal child care for children under 3, and Bulgaria, where early childhood education is free for all children until elementary school. New Mexico is going further by offering no-cost child care for children up to age 13. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Critics such as New Mexico State Representative Rebecca Dow, a Republican, say it makes no sense to give wealthier families free child care when they could receive federal tax breaks for child care included this year in President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dow, the founder of a daycare center, said research showed the best place for a young child was at home and the state should give families tax credits for \"mom to stay home\" with the kids.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There is no capacity, people are going to be disappointed,\" she said of the state's push for universal free day care.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Mark A. Jamison</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About the author: Mark A. Jamison is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and the director and Gunter Professor of the Public Utility Research Center at the University of Florida's Warrington College of Business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI looks like a circular money machine. Microsoft owns a major stake in OpenAI, which in turn invests in AMD. Nvidia puts billions of dollars into OpenAI and holds equity in CoreWeave, one of Microsoft's cloud suppliers. The same dollars are simply bouncing between balance sheets, rather than creating new economic activity. Equity markets are soaring, paying little mind to this web of financing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So alarmists say. But the evidence suggests something different, a powerful technological transformation that remains grounded in fundamentals. There is little reason to panic about an AI bubble — at least not yet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A bubble requires euphoric overvaluation and a disconnect between price and performance. Today's AI boom shows neither. The market is concentrated in highly profitable incumbents with real earnings, strong cash flows, and global-scale innovation. There is plenty of excitement, but that is different from irrational exuberance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is true that AI-related companies, specifically those in the Magnificent Seven, account for roughly three-quarters of S&amp;P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth, and 90% of capital-spending growth since late 2022. No wonder more than half of fund managers surveyed by Bank of America called AI stocks a bubble and ranked an AI-driven equity bubble as the biggest risk facing markets. This seems doubly alarming given the financial links between these firms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet these links are more likely just signs of evolving corporate strategies and risk management. AI is still sorting out its business models. Partial equity stakes allow companies to share risks and profits as they figure out how to leverage layers of the AI stack — chips, data, software, or applications — to deliver the most value. Antitrust regulators likely would have blocked full mergers, so looser forms of vertical integration may be the only practical way for these firms to innovate across corporate boundaries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Global spending on AI is expected to top $375 billion this year. Spending on data centers alone could hit $3-4 trillion annually by 2030. Some see echoes of the late-1990s telecom and internet boom, when fiber-optic firms were valued by the number of cities they promised to serve, not the profits they actually earned.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI companies are different. Most AI-related capital spending is financed through free cash flow, not debt. The Mag 7 have strong balance sheets, post average returns on equity near 46%, and trade at roughly half the earnings multiples of dot-com era darlings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>James Pethokoukis, my colleague at AEI, has noted that today's valuations reflect solid profits, \"fortress-like balance sheets,\" and disciplined forecasts, not blind exuberance. The AI capital expenditure boom looks more like a race than a bubble — one fueled by genuine technological advances and intense global competition, particularly with China.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unlike the internet bubble, where clicks stood in for cash, AI is already producing measurable economic gains. Small businesses using AI see productivity gains approaching 40%. AI systems have long powered Amazon's logistics, Netflix's content suggestions, and Meta's advertising efficiency. Generative tools are cutting costs in design and coding. And large-language-model users are beginning to bypass traditional search engines entirely, creating new advertising markets for AI companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, investors and policymakers should keep an eye on a few pressure points. First, profitability. Some firms experimenting with AI are falling short. Many by now are familiar with the MIT study that found 95% of organizations report earning zero return on investment on their AI projects, largely from their failure to make meaningful change.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Power is another problem. Data centers are already straining U.S. electric grids. Their power needs are expected to triple by 2028. Yet some utilities hesitate to expand capacity without support of federal regulators, who are worried about impacts on rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Third, regulation: Europe is trying to stymie U.S. AI companies with a regime of fines, and China is a politically risky market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The real test for AI will be in how firms respond to disruption — whether by shrinking from it, as the MIT study found, or by embracing it, as Amazon and Goldman Sachs have done.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For now though, what we are witnessing doesn't look like a bubble. It looks, to me, more like the early stage of a decades-long technological supercycle. The challenge isn't unrealistic dreams, but too little electricity to power them and too much regulation that squelches them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's newsroom.

Now Western investors are trying to get a piece of the action.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Foreign investment in Ukrainian drone makers and other defense technology has risen this year, founders and investors say, driven by the prospect of the battle-tested technology winning a slice of rising military spending.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In Ukraine, the added financial firepower is helping professionalize outfits that began in garages and military units — giving them a chance to compete abroad with Western players. The Ukrainian startups also offer the U.S. possible solutions for its shortcomings in drone technology.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Are they scrappy? Yes. Are they all working in bombed-out buildings with pliers found on the side of the road? No,\" said Justin Zeefe, a founding partner at Los Angeles- and Kyiv-based Green Flag Ventures. \"They know what they are doing.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Green Flag was set up in 2023 to invest in Ukrainian companies, and the venture-capital firm says that in recent months there has been growing interest in its inaugural $20 million fund.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Western investors see Ukrainian drone makers as less risky after many companies generated a couple of years of revenue, secured customers outside their home country and added governance controls, Zeefe said. Kyiv has also recently said it would allow defense companies to export for the first time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ukraine has been at the forefront of drone warfare since Russia's 2022 invasion, with the war serving as a testing ground for new technology. Most of the unmanned aerial vehicles in action are made by local startups, whose products are often considered more effective than those of their U.S. and European counterparts. Their UAVs also cost a fraction of the price of those made in the West.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kyiv-based Swarmer in September raised $15 million in a funding round — including U.S. investors — that the startup said was the single-largest investment in a Ukrainian defense-tech business since the start of the war.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company, which started out of a garage in 2023, makes artificial-intelligence software that has been used by Ukraine to coordinate drone swarm attacks on Russian positions. It plans to use the fresh funds to open offices in Warsaw and Austin, Texas, as well as to develop new software.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While investments are small compared with the riches flowing into American defense-tech companies and other hot sectors such as AI, the number of deals is increasing rapidly and Ukraine-focused funds are raising more money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ondas Capital, an American fund, said recently that it expected to invest at least $150 million in combat-proven technology, mostly in Ukraine. Four European venture-capital firms said at a September defense-technology conference in Ukraine that they plan to invest a combined $100 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The conference attracted 5,000 investors and executives, its organizers said, up from 1,000 the year before.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Much of the money arriving in Ukraine so far is European. That is partly because the startups are too small for mammoth American funds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investing in Ukrainian drones also comes with risks. The country has a history of corruption, the UAV market is crowded, and simply visiting to scout deals is arduous and potentially dangerous.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There is a business opportunity here, and that is why people are jumping in,\" said Eveline Buchatskiy, managing partner of D3, referring to the potential for these companies to capitalize on increased European military spending. The fund, which counts former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt among its backers, was established at the start of the war to invest in Ukrainian defense technology.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Attracting venture capital in the first two years of the war was \"almost impossible,\" according to Yevhen Zhebko, co-founder of Teletactica, which makes drone communication systems. \"Everyone tried to understand, will we survive?\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In July, Teletactica raised $1.5 million from investors including Green Flag. The funding has helped the company scale up production for the front lines. It is also expanding in Latvia and Estonia, where officials have requested small batches of the firm's technology, Zhebko said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Foreign money is already shaking up the sector. U.S. investment firm MITS Capital recently consolidated four Ukrainian defense businesses into one larger company, called MITS Industries. The new entity is to be based in Denmark to address investor concerns about Ukrainian governance and capitalize on Scandinavian demand for equipment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Western companies are also investing. Germany's Quantum Systems in July agreed to acquire a 10% stake in Frontline, a Kyiv-based drone maker, and said it would help scale up manufacturing in Ukraine. Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The investment comes just two years after Frontline began in an unheated, abandoned building. Now it has more than 100 employees and is rapidly boosting production. One key selling point: At $3,000 a piece, its flagship drone costs less than a sixth of the price of what the company sees as its nearest Western competitor.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In \"Europe and the U.S. there are [comparable] companies but they offer the same capability for a much higher cost,\" said Mykyta Rozhkov, Frontline's chief marketing officer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lower production costs are encouraging Western governments to look to Ukraine too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Pentagon has already awarded a small number of contracts to Ukrainian startups for technology including long-range drones and counterdrone systems. Now, the U.S. and Ukraine are negotiating a deal under which Ukrainian companies would share their drone technology in exchange for royalties or other forms of compensation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.K. and Denmark have signed their own deals with Kyiv, aimed at getting Ukrainian drone makers to manufacture in their countries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To be sure, the sector is crowded. Ukraine already has more than 300 drone makers, according to the Ukrainian Council of Gunsmiths, a trade organization. Hundreds more are springing up across Europe and the U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Industry executives predict a shakeout when the war ends.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Employees of Plural, a venture-capital firm whose investments include German defense startup Helsing, recently attended a defense conference where Ukrainian startups pitched investors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The vast majority won't make it,\" said Khaled Helioui, a partner at the London-based firm. But, he added, as long as some of the startups make it, \"you have winners.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Alistair MacDonald at Alistair.Macdonald@wsj.com and Heather Somerville at heather.somerville@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Vivien Lou Chen</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors only focused on interest-rate cuts may miss another important move right on the horizon</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank plans to bring a pandemic-era program to an end on Dec. 1.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors focused on the Federal Reserve's midweek policy decision to cut interest rates by a quarter point - and on the chances of no further rate reduction in December - may be overlooking another critical development set to occur in the final month of this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The central bank said it will soon end its efforts to shrink its now roughly $6.6 trillion balance sheet under a program known as quantitative tightening, or QT, which began in 2022 as a way to supplement inflation-driven interest-rate hikes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This announcement came as a bit of a surprise to some market participants, even though Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated just over two weeks ago that the program might end in the \"coming months.\" As recently as early September, large banks and other market participants had expected January to April 2026 to be the end date for the central bank's balance-sheet reduction effort.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ending the program as of Dec. 1 is just another way for Fed officials to ease financial conditions, albeit through different channels than a rate cut would. Changes to the Fed's balance sheet impact the plumbing of the financial system in a way that most investors aren't likely to notice unless something breaks down.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The decision to bring the program to an end came ahead of the Treasury Department's quarterly refunding announcement next week. That matters to investors for a number of reasons.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One reason is that it could prompt market participants to shift into areas of the financial market such as stocks and short-term funding markets, helping to ease liquidity strains in the latter, according to FHN Financial macro strategist Will Compernolle in Chicago. Another reason is that it gives the U.S. Treasury a greater ability to build up the cash balance in its general account and to fund operations, he noted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All that ideally helps the federal government and the plumbing of the financial system run more smoothly, without throwing a wrench in markets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With the Fed no longer reducing its aggregate securities holdings as of Dec. 1, it stops draining liquidity from the financial system and instead reinvests proceeds from maturing securities, effectively injecting them back into the market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Of note, the central bank said on Wednesday that it would be reinvesting all principal payments from its holdings of agency securities into Treasury bills, as well as rolling over at auction all principal payments from its holdings of Treasurys.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fed buying bills</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"When the Fed's balance-sheet shrinkage is happening, securities are maturing that need to be absorbed by the private market. When the Fed stops that process, the market doesn't have to absorb securities at the same pace, and private-market investments can go to other areas such as risk assets and short-term overnight funding markets,\" Compernolle said via phone on Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wrapped up in all of this is the Treasury's quarterly refunding announcement next week. \"The Treasury forms estimates for how much cash it wants in its general account, and it now has more wiggle room to build up its cash balance since it will no longer be competing with the Fed for investors' funds as of the end of the year, especially in Treasury bills,\" the strategist said. In addition, the Fed is going to become a \"willing buyer, soaking up some of the demand for T-bills.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Fed's balance sheet grew to a nearly $9 trillion pandemic-era peak as of mid-2022, after the central bank bought big chunks of long-duration mortgage-backed securities and Treasurys to help lower long-term interest rates, make it cheaper to borrow and stimulate demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The central bank then began shrinking its gargantuan balance sheet in June 2022 through a process known as quantitative tightening to combat high inflation and tighten financial conditions. The Fed's QT efforts were a significant factor that contributed to a decline in U.S. stock prices that year and significant losses in the bond market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While 2022 was a historically bad year for both stocks and bonds, this year is different, with the U.S. equity market repeatedly reaching fresh record highs and Treasury-market volatility falling to the lowest levels since late 2021. The end of QT in December should theoretically create an environment that supports equities, by improving overall market liquidity and lowering long-term Treasury yields.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"For every dollar of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities that the Fed rolled off its balance sheet, that was a dollar of government-backed bonds that private investors would have had to purchase,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist of Comerica Bank in Dallas. \"So now that the Fed is no longer reducing its bond holdings, more of that private investment flow will go into assets that fuel the economy.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The end of QT could \"translate into more liquidity for financial markets and more private investment funds going into risky assets over a period of time,\" Adams added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yields are rising, not falling</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, long-term Treasury yields keep climbing despite the Fed's quarter-point rate cut on Wednesday, after Powell pointed to \"strongly differing views\" among policymakers about what they will do in December. That may not be music to the ears of the White House, which has been vocal about wanting to see lower mortgage rates to help boost the stalled housing market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Related: This long-shot move could get the 30-year mortgage rate to 5% next year, says BofA Global</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Equity markets ended October's final trading session on a solid note, with investors appearing to be encouraged by the latest corporate earnings results. All three major stock indexes DJIA SPX COMP closed higher for the day, the week and the month. Treasury yields finished little changed on Friday; for the week, however, 10-year BX:TMUBMUSD10Y and 30-year Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD30Y rose by 10.4 basis points and 8.3 basis points, respectively, to three-week highs of 4.1% and almost 4.7%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>De facto rate cut?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even if the Fed skips a December rate cut, the end of QT ahead of 2026 could give investors what is essentially the equivalent of a quarter-point rate cut anyway, according to John Luke Tyner, a portfolio manager at Alabama-based Aptus Capital Advisors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It certainly should help alleviate some of the plumbing pressures with bank reserves, as well as continue to manage the supply and, more importantly, the duration of the Treasury issuance,\" Tyner said in an email to MarketWatch.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Not everyone agrees with such a direct comparison, however. Economist Derek Tang of Monetary Policy Analytics in Washington sees things differently.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The end of QT compounds the impact of any rate cut by \"reinforcing a lot of the risk appetite in equities,\" Tang said via phone. \"Now that the end of QT is guaranteed, we have certainty.\" But he regards the Fed's decision as more of an \"incremental change\" in the Fed's balance-sheet policy, since it simply moved the plan forward by about three to six months, relative to what market participants had expected in September.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, the end of QT will likely have an impact on the Treasury Department's Nov. 5 quarterly refunding announcement because it could influence how much the government thinks it can issue in short-term T-bills.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tang said the Treasury \"will probably take into account what the Fed is thinking and start asking questions like, 'Can we issue more bills because the Fed is willing to absorb more of them?'\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Separately, T-bill-hungry money-market funds reached a record $7.42 trillion in assets for the week that ended on Wednesday, according to the Investment Company Institute. This record is a reflection of the demand that exists for Treasury bills, and supports the idea that the Treasury Department has more \"wiggle room\" to build up its cash balance by borrowing from investors, Compernolle said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Vivien Lou Chen</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>In July, I laid out the case for why Interactive Brokers </span><span> stood apart by focusing on fewer, richer clients. Since then, the thesis has held up operationally. Interactive Brokers has continued to add accounts, grow assets and widen its margins. It was added to the S&amp;P 500 in August, and Q3 results showed another solid quarter of high-quality growth. But the stock's performance has lagged more speculative names. Robinhood </span><span> has more than tripled year to date, while Interactive Brokers is up closer to 50%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In this article, I'll update my thesis in light of the company's Q3 2025 performance. I'll break down its business model and competitive edge, assess the health of client growth, review the latest product and client trends, and assess its valuation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Business Model</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interactive Brokers is a global leader in electronic trading, known for its technology-driven, ultra-low-cost platform spanning stocks, options, futures, forex, bonds, and more. Unlike flashy apps that gamify trading, Interactive Brokers has historically targeted a more professional investor base: active traders, hedge funds, financial advisors, and institutions. This focus on sophisticated, specialized clientele shows in its numbers. With just over 4 million accounts, Interactive Brokers oversees a massive $757.5 billion in customer equity. The firm's international reach (customers in 200+ countries) and breadth of offerings (everything from US stocks to European options to Asian futures) attract serious investors and institutions that want a one-stop platform.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In my view, Interactive Brokers is one of the top platforms for professionals. In recent years, management has also shifted focus toward the retail segment. Over the past few years, Interactive Brokers has offered IBKR Lite, which offers zero-commission trading but generally retains a larger spread on client cash. The goal is to blend the high-value professional cohort with a growing retail crowd.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company launched ForecastEx, a CFTC-regulated prediction-market venue that lets clients trade yes-or-no contracts on macro data, central bank decisions, and climate outcomes. All for a transparent one-cent fee. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By Q3, Interactive Brokers offered over 8,200 forecast contracts (up 27% from last quarter) on its platform, and volumes traded in these grew 165% in Q3 (versus Q2). They also extended trading hours for forecast contracts to nearly 24/7. These contracts let clients bet on things like where an index will be at week's end, or the outcome of an event, in a regulated way. It's a niche but growing segment, appealing to the same folks who might trade futures or options for speculation. Even Robinhood has partnered with Interactive Brokers' ForecastEx to offer these event contracts to its users.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other retail-focused product innovations include Investment Themes, an AI-driven discovery tool that helps investors turn market trends into actionable ideas, and the 24-hour U.S. stock session, which allows trading outside regular hours. However, one area where the company continues to face difficulty is crypto adoption.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interactive Brokers allows clients to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a handful of major coins through regulated partners, with commissions well below those of typical crypto exchanges. It even added Solana to the crypto lineup and introduced recurring crypto buy orders (dollar-cost averaging feature). Some Interactive Brokers' clients are embracing digital assets now that they can do so on the same platform as stocks and futures. Still, crypto remains a negligible portion of Interactive Brokers' revenue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company was late to the party, and because of that, many investors have their crypto portfolio elsewhere. One challenge is persuading new customers to bring their crypto holdings onto the platform. The U.S. still doesn't allow in-kind crypto transfers between brokers. As a result, investors looking to move their crypto holdings to Interactive Brokers typically must liquidate their positions elsewhere, triggering taxable events. This friction discourages switching and limits inflows from seasoned crypto investors. New legislation, such as the GENIUS Act, aims to create a framework for direct crypto access within brokerage accounts.

Evidence for this is seen in the discrepancy between client account growth and trading activity. Client accounts grew substantially, surpassing the 4 million mark to reach 4.127 million, this represented a 32% increase YoY. Daily Average Revenue Trades (DARTs) surged even faster, hitting 3.616 million, up 34% YoY. Even more notably, customer equity grew 40% to over $750 billion. This was driven by a combination of net inflows and asset appreciation, as clients added new capital and benefited from rising markets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the impressive growth rates for the quarter, in my opinion, the market wasn't impressed. While DART growth remains strong, it peaked in Q4 2024 and has trended lower since. However, this acceleration in DARTs relative to account growth confirms the focus on the highest quality clientele.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:888.1889763779528px;aspect-ratio:1.4803149606299213\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/gurufocus:efe218068094b-1c23629c147b0b7df90dc37cdf518d3f-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"1979956296547475456.png\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/gurufocus:efe218068094b-1c23629c147b0b7df90dc37cdf518d3f-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f4f5f7\"/></picture></div></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Source: Author</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These metrics fed directly into the two main pillars of revenue: commissions and net interest income (NII).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Commission reached $537 million, up 23% YoY, driven mainly by customer trading volume in stocks and options. The spike in equities volume partly reflects higher trading in low-priced stocks (possibly with more retail increasing interest and risk). To further boost client engagement, the average commission per trade fell to $2.70, helped by rebate capture and the removal of SEC fees. But volume strength more than offset the lower take per trade. Despite the challenges in attracting crypto assets that I mentioned above, Interactive Brokers' crypto trade volume rose 87% from last quarter and is up more than 5x YoY. While this is compared to a very small base, it is a sign of the growing strength of its offering.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>NII reached a quarterly record of $967 million, representing a 21% increase YoY. This growth occurred despite lower benchmark rates in most major currencies, driven by higher balances and savvy positioning. Customer margin loan balances jumped 39% YoY to $77.3 billion as clients leveraged up into the rising market. Customer cash balances rose 33% to $154.8 billion. In other words, even at slightly lower rates, Interactive Brokers earned interest on a much bigger pool of cash and loans. Additionally, securities lending revenue boomed. Interactive Brokers lends out client-owned stocks to short sellers and shares half the profit with clients. The CFO highlighted a significant rise in the notional value of securities loaned, with strong short demand and more specials (hard-to-borrow stocks) this quarter. This is a quiet engine of profit for Interactive Brokers though. Finally, Interactive Brokers kept its own investment portfolio at less than 30 days duration to benefit from the yield curve inversion. This flexibility added to NII.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>NII will likely be pressured by Fed policy. The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points in September and is expected to cut another 50 basis points by year-end. Management has been very transparent about this potential cyclical risk. A 25 basis point decrease in the Fed funds rate is estimated to result in a $77 million reduction in annual net interest for Interactive Brokers. With trailing twelve-month NII around $3.4 billion, the projected $150 million impact would reduce annual income by about 5%. While rate cuts are a headwind and will impact the NII growth rate, the impact is systematically diluted by the continuous growth in interest-earning assets. Moreover, Rate cuts could also be perceived as positive for equities, potentially lifting client activity and boosting commission revenue.</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><span>Metric</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>Q3 2025 Value</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>YoY Growth (%)</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><span>Total Client Accounts</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>4.127 Million</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>+32%</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><span>Daily Average Revenue Trades (DARTs)</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>3.616 Million</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>+34%</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><span>Ending Client Equity</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>$757.5 Billion</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>+40%</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><span>Ending Client Margin Loans</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>$77.3 Billion</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>+39%</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><span>Net Interest Income (NII)</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>$967 Million</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>+21%</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><span>Commission Revenue</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>$537 Million</span></td><td colspan=\"1\"><span>+23%</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><span>Source: Author</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the bottom line, GAAP diluted EPS was $0.59, up $0.14 from a year ago. Net income (including noncontrolling interests) totaled $1.2 billion for the quarter, but due to Interactive Brokers' unique ownership structure, only $263 million of that net income was attributable to the publicly traded common stock. This still represented solid growth, achieving a 16% net margin.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company split its shares in a 4-for-1 stock split in June. Whether related or not, the stock is up over 25% since then. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Valuation</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The market is valuing Interactive Brokers as a category leader, but not, in my view, irrationally.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Source: Author</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At a $112.6 billion market cap, Interactive Brokers trades at 32x trailing earnings (P/E), 29x forward P/E, and carries a PEG ratio of 1.8x, based on consensus revenue growth of 16% next year and 11% over two. I would argue that revenue growth will exceed those forecasts. Its 5.8x price-to-book is rich by industry standards, but far from alone. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, it's not alone in wearing a premium. Robinhood, which generated just a fraction of Interactive Brokers' revenue last year, trades at an even loftier $115.5 billion valuation. It carries a forward price-to-sales ratio of 23.6x, a forward P/E above 56x, and a price-to-book over 14, a tech-stock valuation built on 44% revenue growth expectations next year. Charles Schwab </span><span>, by contrast, looks conservative on earnings at 17x forward but elevated on sales at 6.7x forward revenue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the more telling comparison is through unit economics (what the market is paying per client or per dollar of assets).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Source: Author</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is where the distinction between a wealth manager and a brokerage utility becomes clear. With $11.59 trillion in assets, Schwab leads on scale, averaging over $253,000 per account. Its strategy as a financial services giant focuses on capturing and retaining large wealth pools, including retirement and advisory assets above all, segments that typically generate lower trading volume per account.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interactive Brokers' clients average over $183,000 per account, validating its focus on high-net-worth professionals and institutions trading globally. Robinhood, with just over $11,000 in average assets, sits firmly at the retail, entry-level end of the spectrum.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The gap in customer quality is reflected in how the market values each account. Interactive Brokers commands an implied market value per client that is six to seven times higher than Schwab or Robinhood. At $27,280 per customer, the market is signaling that Interactive Brokers' clients are far more valuable, and the market recognises that. It confirms that the market views Interactive Brokers as attracting sophisticated clientele, highly active traders who generate superior, high-margin revenue through complex products, high trading velocity, and significant margin utilization. Even in a down market, these clients are more likely to stay engaged, given their expertise and investment range.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In contrast, Schwab's low $3,740 value per account reflects its scale and mature model, while Robinhood's slightly higher figure of $4,320 is tied to a growth premium. The market is betting on long-term monetization from a younger, low-asset customer base.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the second quarter, Interactive Brokers once again drew attention from top-tier investors. Paul Tudor Jones (Trades, Portfolio) and Ray Dalio (Trades, Portfolio) both exited their positions. In Dalio's case, it was surprising. He closed out his stake just one quarter after initiating it, a stake that had made him one of Interactive Brokers' largest guru shareholders. Meanwhile, other prominent investors, including Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio), Ron Baron (Trades, Portfolio), and George Soros (Trades, Portfolio), increased their holdings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Key Risks and Challenges</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>While Interactive Brokers continues to fire on all cylinders, it isn't immune to external pressures that could test the durability of its growth story. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of the more tangible headwinds is China's tightening regulatory stance. Mainland authorities have imposed new restrictions on foreign brokers onboarding domestic clients, forcing Interactive Brokers to require offshore residency verification and to remove its app from major Chinese platforms. Management says this hasn't materially affected account growth, but China has historically been a rich source of new, high-value clients. If restrictions intensify or formal bans emerge, Interactive Brokers could see its Asian growth trajectory slow, particularly in light of the company's heavy emphasis on international expansion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A second, more cyclical risk stems from market activity and investor sentiment. A large portion of Interactive Brokers' top-line growth still depends on trading volume and margin lending. The model is structurally strong, but it doesn't escape market corrections. In the third quarter, margin loan balances hit $77 billion, not just because markets were rising, but because clients actively increased their risk exposure to chase upside. That works well in a bull market. But leverage amplifies everything. If markets turn, those same accounts could unwind rapidly, cutting into interest income and increasing risk management costs if clients liquidate at a loss. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>My Final Take</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interactive Brokers' Q3 2025 results reinforce why I've remained bullish on its fewer, richer clients model. The firm is executing across the board, driven by a strategy focused on serious investors, global reach, and technology that actually compounds margin. In the span of a few years, Interactive Brokers has transformed from a niche electronic broker into a financial powerhouse, now even a member of the S&amp;P 500. And that transformation looks far from over.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I continue to see Interactive Brokers as a long-term compounder. Its edge, from technology, cost efficiency, global reach, to high-value clients, remains intact. The valuation isn't cheap, but it isn't stretched either, especially if the market is underestimating the growth runway ahead.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The market is pricing in 16% and 11% revenue growth for the next two years, but I think those projections underestimate the company's momentum. Analyst estimates have already been revised upward over the past 90 days, and I expect that trend to continue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:804.5649072753209px;aspect-ratio:1.340941512125535\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/gurufocus:efe218068094b-fde7c71899349a40d9cc292c45d0a96e-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"1979956302172037120.png\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/gurufocus:efe218068094b-fde7c71899349a40d9cc292c45d0a96e-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f7f7f7\"/></picture></div></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Source: Gurufocus</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a result, I'm slightly more bullish here and would consider adding on dips or periods of volatility, which this sector never fails to deliver.</span></p></span></div></div>",
