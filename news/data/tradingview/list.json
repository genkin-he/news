The temporary suspension of underground operations at Freeport Indonesia following the mid-2025 landslide has disrupted gold supply in Indonesia, the analyst notes. Freeport Indonesia has an agreement to supply gold to Aneka Tambang. However, the underground operations are expected to resume in 2H 2026, says the analyst, who expects Aneka Tambamg's gold sales volumes to recover then. The brokerage maintains its buy rating on Aneka Tambang, citing the company's gold proxy positioning, upside from persistently high gold prices and solid long-term outlook. Shares last closed at IDR3,120.00. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

Labor unions in Japan are expected to set 2026 wage negotiation targets around November-December, the senior economists says. The Japanese Trade Union Confederation, also known as Rengo, has already signaled a 5% wage increase target for 2026, the same as this year, she says. Also, the likelihood of a BOJ rate hike in December may increase if the Fed holds off on a rate cut at its December meeting, giving the BOJ a window to act that month, the economist adds.

She expects average daily trading value to stay above MYR3 billion in 2026-2027, supported by easing macro risks and a stronger ringgit. Lower interest rates and renewed foreign participation are also likely to sustain market liquidity, she says. Tan raises Bursa's 2026 and 2027 earnings forecasts by 7.8% and 11.5%, respectively, to factor in a more bullish market outlook. CIMB upgrades Bursa Malaysia's rating to buy from hold, and raises the target price to MYR8.86 from MYR7.40. Shares are 2.9% lower at MYR8.09.(yingxian.wong@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

A trade deal between the two economies should stabilize relations, though underlying tensions remain unresolved, they say. Recent mine supply disruptions have weighed on Chinese smelters competing over shrinking supply flow, which prompts an industry association to urge Beijing to curb new capacity with stricter controls on projects, they note. Meanwhile, a stronger U.S. dollar weighs on investor appetite after Fed chair Powell warned investors need to rein in expectations for a December rate cut. The three-month LME copper contract climbs 0.4% to $10,958.00 a ton. (jason.chau@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

Here is what you need to know:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>NET PROFIT: Maruti Suzuki's net profit is expected to have risen 20% from a year earlier to 36.95 billion rupees, equivalent to $416.9 million, for the three months ended September on an unconsolidated basis, according to a poll of analysts by Visible Alpha. Net profit was 30.69 billion rupees in the year-earlier period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>REVENUE: Second-quarter revenue is estimated to have increased 11% to 411.12 billion rupees on an unconsolidated basis, according to Visible Alpha.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The stock has risen 49% this year through Thursday, driven by hopes for strong electric-vehicle sales and increasing exports. It gained 5.5% in 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WHAT TO WATCH:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>First-quarter exports jumped 37% to 96,972 vehicles despite a decline in domestic sales. Investors will be closely watching the pace of export growth and the automaker's overseas expansion strategy.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>First-quarter net profit margin deteriorated to 10.1% from 10.8% a year earlier due partly to higher commodity prices and promotion expenses. Investors will be focusing on margin trends, as automakers globally are dealing with relatively high inflation.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Maruti Suzuki began shipping its first battery EV, E Vitara, to Europe in August. Sales of the E Vitara in Japan are expected to begin in January. Investors will be paying attention to any updates on Maruti Suzuki's EV-related initiatives.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Kosaku Narioka at kosaku.narioka@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The 21-member economic club aims to encourage cooperation and reduce trade and investment barriers, though decisions made at meetings are non-binding and consensus has been increasingly difficult.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    \"As the free trade order undergoes dramatic changes, global economic uncertainty is deepening and trade and investment are losing momentum,\" South Korean President Lee Jae Myung     told     the gathered leaders at the opening session on Friday.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stood in for the absent Trump.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>XI MEETS JAPAN'S NEW HAWKISH LEADER </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With the leader of the world's biggest economy absent, attention turns to Xi, who is expected to hold his first talks with Japan's newly elected leader Sanae Takaichi.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While relations between the historic rivals have been on a sounder footing in recent years, Takaichi's surprise elevation to become Japan's first female leader may strain ties due to her nationalistic views and hawkish security policies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of her first acts since taking office last week was to accelerate a military build-up aimed at deterring the territorial ambitions of an increasingly assertive China in East Asia. Japan also hosts the biggest concentration of U.S. military abroad. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The detention of Japanese nationals in China and Beijing's import restrictions on Japanese beef, seafood and agricultural products are also likely to be among sensitive issues on the agenda.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CANADA SEEKS TO RESTART CHINA ENGAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will meet Xi at 4:00 p.m. (0700 GMT), his office said, aiming to restart broad engagement with China after years of poor relations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Embroiled in a bitter trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States, Canada is aiming to wean itself off that overwhelming dependence and seek new markets. China is Canada's second-biggest trading partner.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the leadership of Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau, Canadians were detained and executed by the Chinese government and Canada's security authorities concluded that China interfered in at least two federal elections. Xi also publicly scolded Trudeau, alleging he leaked their discussions to the press.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China announced preliminary anti-dumping duties on Canadian canola imports in August, a year after Canada said it would levy a 100% tariff on imports of Chinese electric vehicles. Senior officials from both sides met to discuss those issues earlier this month, but gave no indication of any looming breakthrough. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul is also due to meet Xi in the afternoon, Bangkok said, fresh from signing an enhanced ceasefire deal with neighbouring Cambodia on Sunday overseen by Trump.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. president has repeatedly touted himself as a global peace broker. Xi told Trump on Thursday that China also played a major role in advocating for dialogue and reconciliation on various pressing matters. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SOUTH KOREA HOPEFUL OF RARE JOINT STATEMENT</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said on Thursday that negotiations were still taking place on a joint statement even for the ministerial meeting itself, but added that he was hopeful it would be adopted together with a leaders' declaration when the summit concludes on Saturday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We are very close,\" he told a briefing. Two APEC member nation diplomats privately expressed scepticism that any statement would be particularly substantive given fractures in global politics. APEC failed to adopt a joint declaration in 2018 and 2019, during Trump's first presidency.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang will be speaking this afternoon to a gathering of executives running parallel to the APEC Summit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Huang has had a whirlwind week, with Nvidia </span><span> becoming the first company to surpass a $5 trillion valuation but the issue of the U.S. chipmaker's sale of advanced AI chips in China was seemingly left out of Thursday's Xi-Trump summit.</span></p></span></div></div>",
