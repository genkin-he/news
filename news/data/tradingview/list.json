The presence of a Cu-Mo mineralized felsic porphyry stock so far from the MEPS Discovery provides further strong evidence for the presence of a giant porphyry copper system at the Soo Copper Project, located off the Trans-Canada Highway only 70km north of Sault Ste Marie and 20 km from rail and deep-water access.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Highlights</span></strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Drillhole SC-26-01 was designed to test a ZTEM resistivity low geophysical target in proximity to bornite and chalcopyrite exposures in outcrop and as a large step-out to the MEPS Discovery (Figure 1 and 2).</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>At approximately 530m vertical depth, a thick zone of altered mafic volcanics transitioned sharply into a coarse-grained felsic porphyry, interpreted as part of a stock-like intrusive body, which was then drilled for over 400m currently continuing at approximately 1000m depth. The porphyry stock contains widespread, overall weak to moderate, but locally strong development of copper sulphides as fine chalcopyrite and bornite disseminations in the groundmass and as coarser grains within veins and is closely associated with potassic feldspar alteration. Molybdenite is also commonly present within quartz veins with or without chalcopyrite (see Figure 3, 4 and 5).</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>While assays are not expected for some time, the evidence from this hole suggests this is not the core of the mineralized stock but a peripheral part of a larger copper zone. However, it does confirm that there is a large porphyry stock complex associated with the surface copper showings identified across this 7km x 3km copper corridor of surface showings and drill holes that represent the upper expression of the overall giant footprint of this porphyry copper system.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>The next hole is planned to drill-test the western edge of the same ZTEM anomaly in search of the shoulders of the stock and a possible associated zone of larger, higher grade porphyry copper mineralization.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>A similar ZTEM resistivity anomaly has also been identified beneath the MEPS Discovery area which is also a focus for drill-testing in this winter program (Figure 1).</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Neil O'Brien, Chief Geologist of Sterling Metals, comments, \"The discovery of a source porphyry stock that hosts widespread potassic alteration and copper mineralization, including bornite, so quickly into the winter program is an incredible early result. It validates both our contention of there being a giant porphyry copper complex underlying a significant area of the Soo Project but also that our exploration targeting approach is right and will lead us to where there is the greatest potential for large concentrations of copper.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Based upon visual core logging, the stock is so far principally composed of a granite porphyry to quartz monzonite porphyry intrusive, compositions that are common to many major porphyry copper systems worldwide. The porphyry contains abundant phenocrysts of feldspar (plagioclase and orthoclase) and quartz with common but lesser mafic phenocrysts (hornblende and biotite). The common presence of both primary igneous hornblende and biotite (Figure 4), both hydrous minerals, in this felsic porphyry is indicative of a 'wet' hydrous source magma that is critical to the late-stage development of abundant, metal-rich, hydrothermal fluids that are ultimately responsible for the mineralization of copper and other metals in porphyry copper systems typically as sulphides within veins crossing the stock and intruded country rocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The granite porphyry hosts widespread but patchy potassic feldspar alteration with lesser local zones of epidote alteration and weak to moderate development of porphyry style veining, including early biotite veins and a variety of quartz-sulphide A-veins. Copper is present as very fine disseminations of chalcopyrite throughout much the groundmass of the porphyry, and as larger grains within veins and partly replacing mafic phenocrysts (Figure 3 and 4). Bornite locally replaces chalcopyrite, especially within mafic mineral grains but also within irregularly shaped pegmatitic zones of very coarse grained quartz and potassic feldspar. Molybdenite is present as medium to coarse grains within later, thicker quartz veins with or without chalcopyrite (Figure 4).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is also strong evidence that other intrusive porphyry phases help comprise the intrusive stock complex, including an early-stage felsic porphyry with a fine grained groundmass reminiscent of the GFP felsic porphyry dykes found at MEPS, that is strongly potassic (biotite) altered and hosts a greater concentration of veins than the granite porphyry (Figure 5). The discovery of this Cu-Mo mineralized, potassic altered and veined granite porphyry stock at 1.5km from the MEPS Discovery supports the Company's contention that the widespread surface copper showings and copper-in-soil anomalies are indicative of the presence of a giant porphyry copper complex that offers tremendous exploration discovery potential.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Figure 1: Plan map illustrating 8km copper corridor, as defined by copper in surface showings and drill holes, associated with underlying resistivity lows along 800m depth slice</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Figure 2: Cross Section illustrating ZTEM resistivity target and main rock units intercepted in drill hole; transition from basalt to porphyry stock at approximately 530m vertical depth</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Figure 3: Example in SC-26-01 of porphyry stock 740m downhole with close up illustrating early biotite (dark) veining and quartz-sulphide (light) A-veining</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Figure 4: Examples within SC-26-01 of different types of Cu-Mo veining and disseminated chalcopyrite within porphyry stock</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Figure 5: Example in SC-26-01 of clasts of potassic-altered, fine-grained felsic porphyry (dark), reminiscent of bornite-related GFP porphyry dykes at MEPS Discovery, hosted by coarser grained granite porphyry and crosscut by significant density of porphyry style A-veins</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sterling will be attending PDAC 2026 at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre (MTCC) from Sunday, March 1 to Monday, March 2, 2026, participating in Core Shack - Session A, Booth 3113A.

Copper Equivalent (CuEq) for drill intersections is calculated based on a three-year trailing average for each commodity (2023, 2024 and 2025) which equates to US$ 4.18/lb Cu, US$ 2,600/oz Au, US$ 30.54/oz Ag and US$ 21.46/lb Mo, with 80% metallurgical recoveries assumed for all metals. The formula is: CuEq % = Cu % + (0.907 x Au g/t) + (0.0107 x Ag g/t) + (0.00051 x Mo ppm).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sampling Procedures - Quality Assurance/Quality Control</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Analytical services were provided by Actlabs, which is an independent, CALA- and SCC-accredited analytical services firm registered to ISO 17025 and ISO 9001 standard. Drill core samples were logged and split in half with a diamond core saw. Half-core samples were securely stored at the core logging facility until being delivered to Actlabs Thunder Bay lab by commercial transport. Samples were crushed (&lt; 7 kg) up to 90% passing 2mm (10 mesh), riffle split to 250 g and pulverized by mild steel to 95% passing 105μm (150 mesh). Samples splits underwent a 4-acid near total digestion followed by a multi-element analysis, including base metals, using an ICP method for 35 elements. Selected sample pulps were then analyzed for gold using a 30 g aliquot mixed with fire assay fluxes and Ag as a collector, placed in a fire clay crucible, gradually heated to 1060ºC for 60 min, and followed with an AA finish.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Laboratory QA/QC for the ICP analysis was 14% for each batch, including 5 method reagent blanks, 10 in-house controls, 10 samples duplicates, and 8 certified reference materials. An additional 13% QA/QC was performed as part of the instrumental analysis to ensure quality in the areas of instrumental drift. Laboratory quality control for the gold fire assay included two blanks per 42 samples, three sample duplicates and 2 certified reference materials, one high and one low (QC 7 out of 42 samples).

It comes after January's surprisingly robust report, with an increase of 130,000 jobs and the unemployment rate falling to 4.3%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The January report allayed worries about a weakening labor market, but \"the concern is that January is a one-off,\" said Paul Nolte, senior wealth adviser and market strategist at Murphy &amp; Sylvest Wealth Management.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We saw a good January jobs report, but we also have seen a really weak 2025 for the job market,\" Hooper said. \"And so the question becomes, where do we go from here?\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors will also seek clues from the report about when the Federal Reserve may next cut interest rates.

Investors generally associate lower interest rates with higher prices for stocks and other assets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>BNY's Velis said the market's reaction to the jobs data will be telling for which factors are prominent for equity investors.

In an interview with Reuters this week, outgoing Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the U.S. may be entering a period of structurally higher unemployment as firms deploy AI tools to save labor.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Major technological shifts provoke both excitement and anxiety,\" Keith Lerner, chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, said in a research note on Thursday. \"More recently... optimism has begun to give way to heightened anxiety and increasingly bleak narratives about AI’s impact on work, productivity, and economic outcomes.\"</span></p></span></div></div>",

Erin Koegel, co-chair of the House Commerce Finance and Policy Committee, aims to prohibit the virtual currency kiosks across the state. The state currently has about 350 licensed kiosks operated by eight to 10 companies, according to the Department of Commerce. The bill was introduced on Monday and discussed on Thursday to prevent the rising scams against the elderly of the state. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Police told lawmakers on Thursday that scammers tell victims to put cash into these machines.

Refunds averaged only 16% of total losses. While the discussions are ongoing, the House Commerce Committee has not yet voted on the bill. On Thursday, lawmakers said they may add it to a larger commerce bill later in the session.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Blockchain security firm PeckShield Alert reported that 15 crypto-related hacks were recorded in February alone, totaling about $26.5 million, with funds moving quickly across wallets, making recovery difficult. The top five hacks pointed out were YieldBlox at $10 million, IoTeX Bridge at $8.8 million, CrossCurveFi at $3 million, FOOMCASH at $2.26 million, and Moonwell at $1.8 million.

For instance, CoinFlip general counsel Larry Lipka told lawmakers, “It is inappropriate to ban a legal product because fraud is happening. Not our fault.” He added that machines should not be illegal, since scammers are responsible for the crimes, not the kiosk operators. He said he supports stricter rules and better enforcement instead of a full statewide ban. </span></p></span></div></div>",
