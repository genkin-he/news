Marcus, chief executive officer of Marcus Corporation. \"At Marcus Theatres, while several films performed well during the quarter, the absence of a breakout blockbuster hit movie and fewer family films resulted in a weaker box office. Looking ahead, the remainder of the year features several highly anticipated films, and the 2026 film slate is franchise heavy, including more family films. Our continued confidence in the underlying strength of both businesses resulted in spending $9 million to repurchase 0.6 million shares during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, with our Board of Directors authorizing the repurchase of up to 4.0 million additional shares.

Moreover, the absence of high-performing tentpole films during the quarter resulted in a difficult comparison to the prior year period, which featured several blockbuster movies and was a record for Marcus Theatres,\" said Mark A. Gramz, president of Marcus Theatres. \"We expect these dynamics to be short-lived, with presales of Wicked: For Good trending over three times ahead of pre-sales for last year's Wicked, which was a major box office success. With several other highly anticipated films on the way, including family-friendly titles that tend to play well in our markets, the holiday season is warming up to bring plenty of cheer to a wide range of audiences.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Several films have contributed to early fiscal 2025 fourth quarter results, including Black Phone 2, One Battle After Another, and Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl, with a strong film slate scheduled for the remainder of the year, including Predator: Badlands, The Running Man, Now You See Me: Now You Don't, Wicked: For Good, Zootopia 2, Five Nights at Freddy's 2, The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants, and Avatar: Fire and Ash. While film schedule changes may occur, new films planned to be released during fiscal 2026 that have the potential to perform very well include: The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, The Mandalorian and Grogu, Toy Story 5, Supergirl, Minions 3, Moana, Spider-Man: Brand New Day, The Odyssey, Jumanji 3, Avengers: Doomsday, and Dune Messiah.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Marcus(R) Hotels &amp; Resorts</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Marcus Hotels &amp; Resorts reported total revenues before cost reimbursements of $80.3 million, a 1.7% increase over the third quarter of fiscal 2024, due to growth in food and beverage revenues driven by strong group business and increased occupancy at six out of seven owned hotels. Division operating income of $16.4 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased $0.7 million and was negatively impacted by an increase in depreciation expense of $0.5 million due to hotel renovations completed during fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025.

We also continue to see stable leisure travel demand in our markets, and we believe our upper upscale properties remain well positioned to outperform within the markets in which they compete.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In September, Marcus Hotels &amp; Resorts announced that the west wing of Hilton Milwaukee will reopen in early 2026 as The Marc Hotel, an independent 175-room hotel.

Since resuming share repurchases in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company has repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock, or 5.3% of the shares outstanding, for $25.9 million in cash.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Marcus Corporation's Board of Directors announced today that it has authorized the repurchase of up to 4.0 million additional shares of the Company's common stock, subject to certain market and other conditions. The new authorization adds to the Company's existing share repurchase program that had approximately 0.7 million shares remaining under prior authorizations as of September 30, 2025, resulting in 4.7 million shares remaining available for repurchase under Board of Directors repurchase authorizations. As of September 30, 2025, the Company had 23.7 million shares of common stock outstanding and 7.0 million shares of Class B common stock outstanding.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We continue to believe that repurchasing our shares is a good investment for the company. With our strong balance sheet and cash flow, we believe that when timing and market conditions are appropriate, we will be able to repurchase shares to enhance shareholder value while at the same time continuing to invest in our businesses to facilitate our long-term growth,\" said Chad Paris, chief financial officer and treasurer of Marcus Corporation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The new authorization does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular number of shares of common stock. The pace of the company's repurchase activity will depend on factors such as current stock price, market conditions, liquidity, other capital uses and other factors. The company's share repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time and has no set expiration date. The shares repurchased would be retained as treasury stock and used for employee benefit plans or other general corporate purposes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fiscal Year Change</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beginning December 27, 2024, the Company's fiscal year changed from a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Thursday of each year to a fiscal year ending on December 31 of each year.

The company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) attributable to The Marcus Corporation before investment income or loss, interest expense, other expense, gain or loss on disposition of property, equipment and other assets, equity earnings or losses from unconsolidated joint ventures, net earnings or losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and non-cash share-based compensation expense, adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the company does not consider indicative of its core operating performance. A reconciliation of this measure to the equivalent measure under GAAP, along with reconciliations of this measure for each of our operating segments, are set forth in the attached table.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management and the company's board of directors to assess the company's financial performance and enterprise value. The company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure, as it eliminates certain expenses and gains that are not indicative of the company's core operating performance and facilitates a comparison of the company's core operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period. The company also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a basis to determine certain annual cash bonuses and long-term incentive awards, to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and to compare its performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by analysts, investors and other interested parties as a performance measure to evaluate industry competitors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of the company's financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings (loss) as a measure of financial performance, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and it should not be construed as an inference that the company's future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or free cash flow for management's discretionary use. In addition, this non-GAAP measure excludes certain non-recurring and other charges and has its limitations as an analytical tool. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the company will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the items eliminated in the adjustments made to determine Adjusted EBITDA, such as acquisition expenses, preopening expenses, accelerated depreciation, impairment charges and other adjustments. The company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that the company's future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Definitions and calculations of Adjusted EBITDA differ among companies in our industries, and therefore Adjusted EBITDA disclosed by the company may not be comparable to the measures disclosed by other companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About The Marcus Corporation</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Headquartered in Milwaukee, Marcus Corporation is a leader in the lodging and entertainment industries, with significant company-owned real estate assets.
