As the data drought continues, Fedspeak is likely to be closely monitored for hints on what lies ahead. Four Fed officials today expressed unease with interest rate cuts, worried about sticky inflation. Meanwhile, the Chicago Business Barometer rises more than expected, to 43.8, a number that still indicates contraction in the regional activity. The 10-year yield is down for the third consecutive month, falling 0.049 percentage point in October, to 4.100%. The two-year rises 0.003 p.p. to 3.605%.

The results showed strong demand but also reminded investors that insurance costs, incentives, and unit economics remain significant factors. For this quarter, management guided for gross bookings between $48.25 to $49.75 billion, suggesting volume growth remains steady through the second half.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The spotlight this time is on execution and margin discipline.

Lately, however, the approach hasn't delivered.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So far this year, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Quality ETF has returned 11.5%, far behind the broad market's 17% total return. Over the past five years, returns for quality stocks have lagged behind by about one percentage point a year, on average.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are plenty of theories about why quality has struggled. One is that the runaway performance of top tech names has made it difficult for any investing strategy that doesn't lean directly into artificial intelligence to keep up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another is gloomy consumer sentiment. Concern about people's willingness to spend, as well as shoppers actually tightening their belts, has weighed on blue-chip consumer stocks like Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca-Cola and Colgate-Palmolive. All three are otherwise known as reliable performers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a note Friday, Trivariate Research offered another theory. It argues that the underperformance results from new market dynamics tied to volatility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It has long been known that a big part of nearly every stock's returns is driven by the broad market's own ups and downs. The change Trivariate flagged is that the number of high-volatility stocks, which tend to move more dramatically than the market on any given day, has surged. At the same time, so has the number of stocks exhibiting below-average volatility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That leaves relatively few stocks in the middle, with average amounts of volatility, Trivariate says. While the dynamic hasn't necessarily hurt quality stocks, it has made it difficult for their strong fundamentals to shine through because so much of investors' recent returns have been driven by the market's overall direction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Quality matters less in the current market environment,\" writes Trivariate founder Adam S. Parker.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So should investors give up on the strategy? Not necessarily.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Quality's travails have been frustratingly persistent, stretching back to around 2020. But most investors' timelines are measured in decades, not years. The academic research that touts the so-called quality factor is also built on decades of returns, not just the past few years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What is more, there is no telling how long the current stock market dynamics will persist. While the S&amp;P 500 has been hovering near record levels, plenty of investors are worried the market looks overpriced and seems disconnected from the rest of the economy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If things were to shift, blue chips with strong earnings and balance sheets could start to look awfully good.

OPEC+ is widely expected to agree at the weekend to unwind another 137,000 barrels a day of output cuts in December, and analysts see additional OPEC barrels likely covering any loss of supply from U.S. sanctions against Russian oil companies. Reports that the U.S. is considering strikes against military targets in Venezuela gave prices a lift to end of the week, with WTI settling up 0.7% at $60.98 a barrel, and Brent up 0.1% at $65.07.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Audi's latest earnings call carried a sharper tone than usual. The Volkswagen AG subsidiary, home to the Audi, Lamborghini, Bentley, and Ducati brands, trimmed its full-year operating margin forecast to between 4% and 6%, down from as high as 7%. Chief Financial Officer Jurgen Rittersberger said tariffs alone could cost the group about 1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) this year, a figure that captures the dual strain of slowing global demand and rising trade friction. The move also follows Porsche's decision to scale back its EV pushsignaling that Volkswagen's luxury arm is bracing for a more defensive phase in its transition strategy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rittersberger called the environment very demanding, pointing to an uneven recovery across markets and persistent supply constraints. Audi's third-quarter operating margin stood at 2%, generating 280 million in profit, up from a small loss a year earlier tied to the Brussels factory closure. But headwinds remain: tariffs in the US, weaker momentum in China, and renewed pressure from semiconductor shortages, particularly after disruptions at Dutch chipmaker Nexperianow caught in geopolitical crossfire. Management said securing chip supplies and cutting costs will be critical to keeping its model rollout on track.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The tension is playing out across the broader EV sector. BYD's (BYDDF) earnings slump, Tesla </span><span>'s string of recalls, and Rivian's delayed financing all highlight how fragile profitability can be in a capital-intensive cycle. Audi is exploring production in the US to offset tariff exposure, with a final decision expected before year-end. For investors, the message is cautious but clear: this isn't about chasing volume anymoreit's about preserving margin, protecting brand equity, and surviving a high-stakes reset in the global luxury EV race.</span></p></span></div></div>",
