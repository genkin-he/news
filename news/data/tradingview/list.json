That would put only a tiny dent in 14% gains over the past five trading days as the chip maker has been buoyed by AI optimism.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors were hoping that President Donald Trump might give the stock another boost by announcing that Nvidia and other U.S. chip makers would be able to resume selling hardware to China after his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. However, Trump told reporters after the meeting that Nvidia's Blackwell chips weren't specifically discussed, according to multiple reports.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump said he told Xi that Beijing would have to negotiate with Nvidia directly but the U.S. was willing to be \"the arbitrator or the referee\", according to Reuters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nvidia has been targeted by Chinese authorities, who have discouraged the use of its AI processors by domestic customers. Nvidia is currently forecasting  no Chinese revenue for its current quarter, which implies a loss of between $2 billion and $5 billion in potential sales, according to the company's executives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, signs of U.S. spending are strong. Each of Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Google-parent Alphabet said in earnings reports on Wednesday that they will raise their capital expenditure, largely due to investment in AI data centers. That bodes well for future spending on semiconductors from Nvidia and its rivals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices was down 0.8% and Broadcom was rising 0.3% in premarket trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping struck a relatively positive tone Thursday after their first meeting in six years, agreeing to another truce without addressing the core issues at the heart of their intensifying rivalry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The two agreed the U.S. would cut the 20% fentanyl-related tariffs it implemented early this year in half as China agreed to do more to curb the flow of fentanyl precursors. That would bring tariffs levied this year on China down to 47% from 57%. It also extended by a year a pause on an increase in the reciprocal tariff that was set to go into effect Nov. 10.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beijing also agreed to buy soybeans — 12 million metric tons through January and then a minimum 25 million metric tons a year for the next three years, easing pressure on American farmers who had been reeling as China turned to Argentina and Brazil for its purchases.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most important, the leaders said they would hit pause on measures that fueled the latest flare-up. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business that the U.S. would suspend for a year a change in its Affiliate Rule that significantly expanded the number of Chinese companies on its so-called entity list by including subsidiaries of those already on the blacklist. Beijing said it would delay new rare earth controls that could restrict critical inputs for autos, semiconductors and military equipment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The de-escalation took a worst-case scenario off the table for markets and gave them the benefit of lowered tariffs for now. The general positive tone out of the 100-minute meeting — with Trump rating it a 12/10 — and both leaders stressing that the stability of the relationship is good for investors, could mean investors have more muted reactions to future flare-ups in the relationship, says Vivian Lin Thurston, portfolio manager for William Blair's Emerging Markets Growth fund.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The discussions could also be a near-term positive for companies like Nvidia that have been caught in the middle of the escalation as U.S. restrictions on China's access to advanced technology has hit the Chinese sales of chipmakers like Nvidia. One of Xi's priorities in recent years has been to get the U.S. to loosen its expanding web of export controls.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Thursday, the U.S. signaled it would ease some of its restrictions, but a White House official said the two sides didn't discuss Nvidia's more advanced Blackwell chip.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After initially banning the sale of advanced chips, like Nvidia's H20, to China, Trump eased the restrictions. However, Beijing has been pushing its companies to not buy them and instead use domestic alternatives as it tries to reduce its self-reliance. Trump said Thursday that Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang would be talking with Chinese officials.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Much of what was agreed upon between the leaders has yet to be finalized. Bessent said the agreement trade negotiators hashed out in Malaysia ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting could be signed as soon as next week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But analysts stress that this detente, like the others this year, are still fragile, with the details often contributing to recent flare-ups. \"This does look like a standstill, with both sides agreeing to pause some of the more effective technology export controls but there are still a lot of issues unresolved,\" says Everett Eissenstat, partner at Squire Patton Boggs, who was formerly deputy director of the National Economic Council in the first Trump administration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the list of issues the two discussed, including the suspension of port fees and a finalization for Chinese company ByteDance to divest TikTok coming in the coming weeks and months, analysts taking a step back stressed the fragility of the situation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deal is largely a return to the fragile truce of earlier in the year — with many of the potential irritants in the intensifying relationship still looming.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is all just walking back from the ledge on few areas where we were walking toward it. Compare now to six months ago, it's worse — with a lot of collateral damage, most notably with the billions of dollars U.S. agriculture has lost,\" says Philip Luck, director of the CSIS Economics Program who previously served as deputy chief economist at the State Department in the Biden administration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump said he plans a state visit to China in April, with Xi expected to visit the U.S. after, with those meetings serving as anchors for more progress in the relationship and potentially an eventual deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But that also leaves time for continued volatility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The most important takeaway: Both countries have found levers that work to bring the other side to the table, if they need to,\" says Owen Tedford, analyst at Beacon Policy Advisors. \"It would not surprise me when the relationship inevitably slips back again to see these floated again or reimposed.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Reshma Kapadia at reshma.kapadia@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
