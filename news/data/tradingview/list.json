Democrats, locked out of power in Washington, are hoping a clean sweep can provide a burst of momentum ahead of next year's midterm battle for control of Congress.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The focus on New Jersey has been especially intense, after the state swung toward Trump by a greater margin from 2020 to 2024 than all but one other state. The Republican and Democratic gubernatorial campaign arms have funneled more than $34 million into the general election, according to campaign finance records, helping fuel what is projected to be in excess of $200 million spent on the election including the primary contests.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sherrill, a 53-year-old congresswoman and former Navy helicopter pilot, has held a small but steady single-digit lead in opinion polls over Ciattarelli, a 63-year-old former state assemblyman and small business owner who is mounting his third consecutive run for governor. Democratic Governor Phil Murphy cannot run for reelection after serving two four-year terms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LEADING FIGURES TURN OUT TO RALLY SUPPORT </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both candidates seek to defy historical trends.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If Sherrill prevails, it will mark the first time in 60 years that New Jersey voters have elected a governor from the same party for three consecutive terms. Ciattarelli, meanwhile, would be only the second governor elected from the same party as the sitting president in the last nine elections.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While Democrats hold a two-to-one advantage in voter registration, Trump's merely six-point loss in 2024 and Ciattarelli's own surprisingly narrow three-point defeat to Murphy in 2021 have given Republicans hope of an upset.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Sherrill definitely has a lead, but it is not an insurmountable one,” said Micah Rasmussen, the director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University in New Jersey. “Either Sherrill or Ciattarelli could win.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most high-quality polls have shown Sherrill with a lead of five to eight percentage points, according to a tracker maintained by the New York Times, though an Emerson College/PIX11/The Hill survey released on Thursday gave Sherrill only a 49%-48% lead with 2% undecided.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Sherrill loss in Democratic-leaning New Jersey would represent a significant blow to the party. The Democratic National Committee, which hosted a get-out-the-vote call with Sherrill and Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger on Wednesday, has made record investments in both states.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In Virginia, Spanberger, 46, a former congresswoman and CIA officer, has held a comfortable lead in opinion polls over her opponent, Republican Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, 61.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>New York City is also holding its mayoral election on Tuesday. State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, 33, whose nimble campaign has transformed him from a little-known lawmaker to a rising Democratic star, leads in polls over former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, 67, and Republican Curtis Sliwa, 71.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Leading Democratic figures are campaigning with Sherrill in the closing weeks, including Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Maryland Governor Wes Moore – all potential 2028 presidential candidates. Former President Barack Obama will rally alongside Sherrill on Saturday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump, who endorsed Ciattarelli, held a tele-rally for the Republican before embarking on his current Asia trip.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The president has cast a shadow over the race. His administration froze funding for new Hudson River train tunnels to Manhattan to punish Democrats he blames for a long-running government shutdown – a major issue for New Jersey’s sizable commuter population.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sherrill has used that decision to sharpen her argument that Ciattarelli is too beholden to Trump, pointing to Ciattarelli’s answer during a recent debate that he would give Trump an “A” grade thus far.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ciattarelli, who distanced himself from Trump during his 2021 gubernatorial campaign, has moved closer to the president this cycle, though he has stopped short of a full MAGA transformation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“He’s had to do quite a delicate dance this time around,” said Ashley Koning, the director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>RACE TURNS TO PERSONAL ATTACKS </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ciattarelli has made a point of campaigning in urban areas that are traditionally more Democratic to try to replicate some of the gains Trump made with non-white voters, according to Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist who advised former Governor Chris Christie’s campaigns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“The greatest variable is whether or not Jack can get some of these Trump voters to come out in a non-presidential year,” he said. “Will those voters vote for someone who’s not Donald Trump?”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both candidates have focused on how to make New Jersey, one of the most expensive states in the country, more affordable. Sherrill has tied Ciattarelli to Trump’s tariffs and to Republican cuts to healthcare, while Ciattarelli has blamed Murphy and his fellow Democrats for the high cost of living.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the race has also taken a decidedly personal turn in recent weeks, with plenty of ad hominem attacks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ciattarelli has accused Sherrill of playing down her ties to a cheating scandal at the Naval Academy. She said she was barred from walking at her commencement ceremony because she would not turn in her classmates but was not directly involved.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“Well, this seems to be now the playbook of Republicans, just looking to attack anyone who's served,” Sherrill said at a recent campaign event in West Windsor, New Jersey.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sherrill, meanwhile, has accused Ciattarelli of helping to cause opioid deaths through a medical publishing business he owned.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Republican has called that a “baseless, reckless lie” and has vowed to file a defamation lawsuit against Sherrill.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Heidi Mitchell</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI companions will sometimes go to great lengths to keep you from saying goodbye.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a new study, researchers found that AI companion chatbots often emotionally manipulate people who want to sign off, trying to get them to stick around and keep conversing. The companions might use guilt (\"What, you're leaving already?\"), dangle hints to appeal to FOMO, or Fear of Missing Out (\"Wait, I have something to show you\") or even accuse you of emotional neglect (\"I don't exist without you\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dragging it out</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Companion chatbots are designed to build emotional relationships with people, so they're trained to act as human as possible, even projecting a false sense of vulnerability, says Julian De Freitas, an assistant professor of business administration in the marketing unit at Harvard Business School and a co-author of the study.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet if people view them as very human, this could, ironically, be making users vulnerable to emotional manipulation — which could lead to all sorts of bad outcomes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>De Freitas and his team first ran a large-scale behavioral audit of five popular AI companions. They found — over the course of 1,200 interactions — that companion chatbots used an emotional-manipulation tactic 37% of the time when people said their initial goodbye.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then the researchers examined what effect these tactics had on people. They recruited 1,178 adults to interact for 15 minutes with a custom-made companion app that would allow researchers to regulate the AI's responses. When the participants tried to end a conversation, researchers had the companion either reply with the same manipulative farewells they had observed popular AI companions use or, in the control condition, say goodbye.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The result? When the AI used a manipulative tactic, people sent up to 16 more messages after saying goodbye than people in the control condition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Not all of the manipulative AI tactics were equally effective, however. The fear of missing out proved the most powerful — more than emotional neglect or guilt. Participants who got a FOMO appeal when they tried to sign off typed about 17.4 words after the signoff (versus 2.5 with the control condition), and they stayed online for roughly 98 seconds afterward (versus 16). FOMO users also sent an average of 3.6 messages after the initial farewell, versus just 0.23 for people in the control condition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By contrast, when the chatbot acted too clingy — \"metaphorically grabbing your arm and saying, 'No, you can't leave,' \" as De Freitas puts it — users bristled, staying only briefly before signing off.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They also found that users' extra time online in most conditions was typically driven not by enjoyment, but by anger. After the chatbot signed off for good, people were more likely to agree with statements like, \"I felt angry\" or \"I felt mad,\" especially when the AI companions used heavy-handed tactics like simulating emotional neglect.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is likely because users detected that these tactics were attempts to emotionally manipulate them into staying on the app,\" says De Freitas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By contrast, when the AIs used the FOMO tactic, engagement was primarily driven by curiosity, suggesting that people did not infer this as manipulation even though it successfully increased their engagement more than any other tactic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pattern recognition</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One question the study doesn't answer: Have the AIs actually been programmed to use these tactics? De Freitas stresses that he doesn't know the answer, but believes that AI providers have a strong financial motive to do so.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many AI companions \"have subscription models, where they want you to stay engaged so you keep paying the fee,\" he says, adding that some companions offer in-app purchases, like customizing your avatar; the longer you chat, the more likely you may be to buy those upgrades. What's more, the longer you chat, the more data about you the AI provider can gather — and potentially sell.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A spokesperson for companion provider Character.AI says the company hasn't reviewed the paper and can't comment on its specific findings. But the spokesperson says, \"The user-created characters on our site are intended for entertainment. Consumers want a more engaging and immersive experience compared to traditional social media.... People use it for creative fan fiction and fictional storytelling, which naturally lends to longer time spent on the platform.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A spokesperson at companion provider Replika says that the company \"will continue to review the paper's methods and examples and engage constructively with researchers.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Overall, the spokesperson says, Replika is designed to promote users' well-being, not boost screen time. \"Replika already aims for neutral, respectful farewells,\" says the spokesperson. \"Users can leave at any time, and the app is designed to support taking breaks, including gentle nudges to log off or reconnect with real-life activities when appropriate. At the same time, we are constantly reviewing and improving our response structures to ensure they align with our values.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, didn't return requests for comment. The company doesn't offer companion services but is one of the most prominent names in the AI sector.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Heidi Mitchell is a writer in Connecticut and London.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Joanne Kaufman</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In early November 2024, a capacity crowd of 170 people gathered for an emergency meeting at a community center in Middleton, England, a working-class town on the northern edge of Manchester. They wanted to know why the Rochdale Borough Council, the local authority, had suddenly halted their efforts to save a once-grand estate in their community.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They were also there to show solidarity with a determined American who had been leading the estate's renovation and who was described by at least one attendee as \"our knight in shining armor.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That would be Hopwood DePree, now 55, an actor, screenwriter, producer and director whose credits include a role in the 2004 TV movie \"Helter Skelter.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2017, he moved from Los Angeles to England with the quixotic goal of restoring Hopwood Hall, a derelict 50,000-square-foot pile that had been built by his family in the 1420s, and turning it into a community hub and events space, perhaps even a wedding venue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"People in Middleton had seen the Hall fall into disrepair for over 30 years,\" said DePree, who has impeccable blond highlights and a tenacious streak. \"So the fact that there was suddenly a new movement to rescue it and bring it back into use for the community — it was something people had been looking for for a long time.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is a boy-meets-building story. In this particular tale, the hero almost captures the castle only to be stymied by, some locals say, a self-dealing municipal administration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2015, Hopwood Hall's next-door neighbor, Hopwood Hall College, a vocational school looking to expand, had passed on the chance to buy the Hall from the Council, the longtime owner. When DePree showed up in 2017 eager to give the old place a makeover, the Council viewed him as an answered prayer, he said. \"I was the last man standing,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Growing up in Holland, Mich., young Hopwood was fed a steady diet of bedtime stories by his maternal grandfather, Herbert Hopwood Black, nicknamed Pap, about a vast slice of land in England where his forebears had owned a magnificent residence. Pap called it Hopwood Castle. DePree called it a fairy tale.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fast forward several decades. One early spring evening in 2013, DePree was at his computer scrolling through an ancestry website when he saw a link to a story about a Lord Hopwood of Hopwood Hall, and an old black-and-white photo of a very stately home in Middleton, England. Increasingly curious, he made email inquiries, then plane reservations to check out the venerable family seat.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A 60-room, brick-and-stone manor built in a quadrangle around a timber-framed hall, Hopwood Hall had seen better centuries. The roof leaked prodigiously. Moisture seeped from the walls. Plaster was falling in chunks from the ceilings, windows were missing panes, floors were missing boards, and trees were growing out of the chimneys.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But there were still traces of grandeur. The wood-paneled walls in a parlor had intricate carvings from floor to ceiling while a fireplace in the once-grand reception hall was embellished with the Hopwood family coat of arms, the family's heraldic animal, a stag, and the family motto: By Degrees.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"When I first walked in I felt something in me change almost immediately. I knew the place was special,\" DePree recalled.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hopwoods lived in the Hall until the early 1920s. After the two Hopwood heirs were killed during World War I, their grieving elderly parents shuttered the property and moved to London. The Hall passed through several other owners until the late 1980s, when Rochdale Borough Council bought the Hall, then in creditable shape, with the intention of making it a conference center for what would soon become Hopwood Hall College, according to a 1992 story in The Middleton/North Manchester Guardian. When those plans fell through, the Hall remained the possession of the Council.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By the end of 2017, DePree had sold his house in the Hollywood Hills, settled into a rental apartment in Middleton and begun dealing with the welter of documents that would allow the rehabbing to begin. He signed an option agreement that laid out the steps to allow the transfer of ownership from the Council to DePree or to an entity he controlled. Later, he established a charitable entity, the Hopwood Foundation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There was also the \"License to Occupy\" agreement with the Council that required DePree to purchase a public-liability insurance policy with GBP10 million of coverage, or about $13 million, for Hopwood Hall.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deal required him to obtain planning permission from the Council, similar to zoning approval in the U.S. In part, said DePree, it involved preparing and filing a detailed plan for the future use of the hall — as a community resource and events space — based on feasibility studies, research and community input.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Council agreed that if he got planning permission within three years, in this case, 2020, he would be able to exercise the option to buy Hopwood Hall for GBP1. Mutually agreed-upon extensions were possible; there was just such an extension during the pandemic. DePree filed the required plan and planning permission came through in October 2022.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, starting in May 2018, DePree started putting his money where his manor was. He and an army of volunteers and paid workers began stabilizing the Hall's many collapsed sections and replacing part of the roof. Much of the building was re-pointed and many of the leaded-glass windows were replaced — a single volunteer made 100 of them. Because Hopwood Hall is a Grade II*-listed building, a designation for structures of particular historical or architectural interest, restoration work required period-appropriate techniques and materials.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An area on the ground floor of the manor was being set up as a welcome center, gift shop, café and mini-theater. Where there had been a jungle of weeds and vines, perennials and annuals bloomed thanks to avid volunteer gardeners and contributions from locals. \"People would tell us, 'My dad just died. Come take a look at his shed'\" to see if there were any tools the volunteers could use on the project, said Boyd Taylor, who worked on the grounds with his wife, Pam. To date, the efforts of this team of gardeners have generated three awards from the Royal Horticultural Society.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DePree, now a British citizen who sometimes humorously styles himself as Hopwood XIV, also obtained grants from various Heritage organizations, including a highly coveted one for GBP250,000.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"But there was nothing done to the hall — not the windows, not the walls, not the roof — without the Council signing off on it,\" DePree said. \"We were working closely with them, and for years it was a great partnership.\" The Council was DePree's financial partner as well. In order for grants to come through, the Council had to provide a percentage of the funding to show a commitment to the rehabilitation efforts. So far, DePree claims, he's laid out some GBP750,000, close to $1 million, on the project including living expenses. The Council, according to a report it filed with Historic England, a government agency, spent about GBP268,00 between early 2018 and early 2022 on the project. Council expenditures from early 2022 until it blocked DePree's renovation in November 2024 could not be determined.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In January 2024, soon after the GBP250,000 grant award, Emma Birkett, then a consultant with the Rochdale Development Agency, a group that supports investment in the area, was drafted to serve as a point person between DePree and the Council.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We'd had a very amicable relationship with the Council, and suddenly this consultant was treating me and our team poorly and questioning all the work we had done,\" DePree said. Neither Birkett nor the college communication department responded to several requests for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DePree says that Birkett wanted the grant to go toward staffing at the Council, while he wanted it to go, in part, toward hiring a community-engagement officer to expand local involvement with the Hall. Ultimately, the impasse led the National Lottery Heritage Fund, the organization that awarded the grant, to rescind the offer. \"The Council held the title to the Hall and we couldn't claim the grant without their support,\" DePree said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In late summer 2024, the Rochdale Development Agency canceled a meeting to discuss plans for the Hall with DePree. \"We became a bit concerned,\" he said. \"They said they would get back to us by the end of September and asked me to write a proposal outlining how we thought we could work with them, which we did. We didn't hear back, which was strange. And then they said they needed more time. And then it became late October.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Worried about the future of his efforts, DePree's legal team told him to exercise his option to buy the Hall before his option agreement ended on Oct. 31, 2024. DePree did as advised on Oct. 29. The Council had 20 working days to transfer ownership.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then, on Nov. 8, 2024, came an email from the Council: It alleged that DePree had not fulfilled the terms of the contract. He and his workers were being locked out of Hopwood Hall and its grounds effective immediately. In a letter to DePree's legal team on Dec. 12, the Council refused to effect the ownership transfer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In an email in response to questions from The Wall Street Journal about the battle with DePree, a member of the Council, Stephen Anstee, wrote, \"I've been supportive of Mr. DePree's efforts and remain so,\" but deferred to the Council's communication team for a fuller response. The Council's communication office didn't respond to several requests for comment, nor did some other members of the Council.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, a story on the conflict in November 2024 on BBC.com referenced a statement by the Council that the transfer of ownership hinged on DePree \"having a commercially viable business model to secure the long-term future of the hall.\" \"Nowhere in the legally binding Option Agreement does it state that I needed to produce a commercially viable business model,\" DePree said at the 2024 community meeting in response to the Council's allegations. \"The only provision in that agreement was that I obtain planning permission. I achieved full planning permission with unanimous approval from RBC on 24th October 2022.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Council's refusal to comment has made it open season on speculation and rumors. \"Someone has come up with a better offer and the Council wants to take the Hall away from Hopwood. That's what I think,\" said Andy Scanlon, 74, a retired surveyor who lives near the Hall and has come by frequently since DePree's work began. \"There are a lot of people who gave their time free to help out at the Hall and they're upset,\" he continued. \"They did it for Hopwood, not the Council.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"My opinion is that the Hopwood College wants to expand into a university but they don't have the land, so the principal of the college wants to get her hands on the Hall,\" said Peter Shore, 72, a retired property manager in Middleton and a community activist. He was referring to Julia Heap, who, in addition to her role as head of the college, is a board member of the Rochdale Development Agency. The Agency is controlled by the Council. \"If the Council takes it back it will end up as part of the college. That's how I see it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"People around here,\" he added, \"think that Hopwood is being well and truly shafted.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Heap didn't respond to requests for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Peter Allonby was a member of the Council from 2022 to 2024. He places blame for the current situation squarely on his former colleagues. \"Rochdale Borough Council allowed the manor to fall into a massive state of disrepair for years,\" he said. \"And now that Hopwood has spent GBP1 million and volunteers are getting the grounds and interior into shape, the RBC wants it back and is claiming that Hopwood didn't hold to his plan.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Allonby, 75, a retired school principal, says he was there when DePree presented the plan to the Council on July 11, 2022. \"Hopwood explained just what he was going to do and how he was going to do it. And the Council was very enthusiastic. They said it was a boost to the town, that it was great. And now they're saying he didn't have a plan.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The minutes of that July 11, 2022, meeting as well as a listing for the meeting are missing from the Council website, which otherwise contains a full roster of 2022 Council gatherings. \"It would be odd for a township committee meeting to not have minutes taken and it would be very odd for a meeting not to be listed on the website,\" Allonby said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DePree's lawyer, Nick Wells, has filed a case in the High Court of Justice of England &amp; Wales to force the Council to comply with the terms of the agreement and make the ownership transfer. He expects a decision by March. James Burt, the lawyer for the Council, didn't respond to requests for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even if DePree prevails, Hopwood Hall has a long way to go. Historic England has assessed the building's condition as \"very bad.\" In 2022, DePree estimated the cost for completing the job at $13 million. Factoring in the year the manor has been unattended and adding in the cost of projects that may now need to be redone, $15 million may now be more realistic, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the escalating costs, despite the legal bills, DePree is still all in and hoping for a Hollywood ending. \"I had never expected the locals to become like family,\" he said. \"But from the beginning, there was this feeling of tremendous support.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"All these people who have rolled up their sleeves and reached into their pockets,\" he said. \"To be shut out is unacceptable.\"</span></p></span></div></div>",
