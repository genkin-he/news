The company's fourth-quarter revenue reached $1.57 billion, growing 110% year over year and exceeding the $1.55 billion FactSet consensus. The company posted a net loss of $452 million, far steeper than the $342 million anticipated by analysts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"2025 was a defining year for CoreWeave as we became the fastest cloud in history to reach $5 billion in annual revenue,\" chair and CEO Michael Intrator said in the press release.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Demand for CoreWeave's products is strong. The company's backlog grew to $66.8 billion in the fourth quarter - quadrupling from the beginning of 2025 - and CoreWeave is building aggressively to turn the backlog into revenue. The company added 260 megawatts of active power capacity in the fourth quarter alone, bringing its total to over 850 megawatts.

Net interest expense for the fourth quarter was $388 million, a 160% year-over-year increase. For 2025, net interest expense came out to $1.23 billion, a 240% year-over-year increase.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CoreWeave reported a full-year net loss of $1.17 billion, compared with a loss of $863 million the previous year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read: Here's what CoreWeave's earnings need to show for the stock to soar further</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Christine Ji</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Coles said it took an additional A$165 million post-tax provision to cover worker-remediation costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Revenue rose by 2.5% to A$23.69 billion, led by supermarket sales growth of 3.6% while liquor revenue was down by 3.2%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On an underlying basis, which excludes significant items, Coles's half-year profit totaled A$676 million. That was up 13% on year, and was broadly in line with a consensus analyst forecast of A$674.4 million collated by Visible Alpha.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Directors of the company declared an interim dividend of 41 Australian cents a share, up from 37 cents a year ago.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interest in Coles's result intensified after chief Australian rival Woolworths this week beat market expectations for its own earnings and outlook. Woolworths said trading since the start of January has been strong in Australian food, building on first-half sales growth of 3.6% in its biggest division. That prompted investment bank Jefferies to suggest the company has regained its sales leadership over Coles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Coles also provided a trading update alongside its result on Friday. It said supermarket sales revenue rose by 3.7% in the first seven weeks of its fiscal third quarter, with growth higher at 5.3% when tobacco is excluded. Liquor sales fell by 2.5% in the same period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors were alert to Coles choosing to step up promotional activity to beat back competition from Woolworths and watching for new signs that consumers are trading down to cheaper produce or shopping at discount food retailers to save money at a time when rising interest rates are rekindling cost-of-living concerns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Customers remain value oriented and are responding well to our expanded range of everyday value products and loyalty offers,\" Coles said in its outlook commentary. \"We expect the market to remain highly competitive.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to David Winning at david.winning@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
