            "title": "Apple Expects Big December Quarter on iPhone Upgrades — WSJ",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Rolfe Winkler</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple reported record sales and said it expects a big December quarter as customers race to upgrade to the new iPhone 17.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company expects total company revenue to increase 10% to 12% in the holiday quarter, Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh said, well ahead of Wall Street analyst expectations for 6%. Powering the jump is an expected \"double-digit\" increase in iPhone sales compared with the prior year period, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>IPhone sales of $49 billion came in slightly behind expectations in the September quarter. Parekh said that the company suffered supply constraints on several models. On Apple's earnings conference call, Chief Executive Tim Cook said the constraints were because of very strong demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple shares rose around 3% in after-hours trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After years of sluggish growth, this is the second consecutive quarter in which iPhone revenue increased compared with the same period last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company said it is increasing investments in artificial intelligence, noting that as a reason why operating expenses in the December period are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion higher than analysts' forecasts. Such spending remains a fraction of rivals' AI investments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total revenue came in at $102.5 billion for the quarter, about 8% higher than the year-ago period and slightly above Wall Street's expectation of $102.2 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before Apple's earnings report, early data pointed to success for the iPhone 17, which customers rushed to buy as soon as it was released last month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a third-party analyst firm, said it observed \"great interest in the Pro and Pro Max models, while the new iPhone 17 Air model showed virtually no sign of traction.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cook declined to answer a question on the earnings call about how the Air is selling relative to other iPhone 17 models. Parekh said that supply constraints in the September quarter affected iPhone 16 and 17 models.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One disappointment from the September quarter was sales in China, which fell compared with the prior year period. Apple has struggled in the region in recent years as rivals have grabbed market share. Cook said the company expects to return to growth in China in the holiday quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple also reached a milestone for its services business, surpassing $100 billion in revenue for the fiscal year that ended in September, the first time it has crossed that mark. Services generate higher profit margins than device sales. They include fees from sales of apps, payments from Google to be the search provider in Apple's Safari browser and various subscriptions including Apple Music and Apple TV.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company dodged a potential threat to its bottom line when a judge ruled that Alphabet's Google could continue paying to have search results displayed in Apple's Safari browser. Google pays Apple more than $20 billion under their contract, nearly all of which falls to Apple's bottom line, meaning the payments account for a fifth of Apple's operating profit, analysts estimate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Services revenue, which includes the Google payments, jumped 15% compared with last year's September quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earlier Thursday, Apple got another bit of good news when President Trump declared that he was halving the 20% fentanyl-related tariffs on China as part of a preliminary trade deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That tariff is the only one Apple pays on products it imports to the U.S., after Trump previously exempted the company from other levies in exchange for its commitment to invest more domestically.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company said it paid $1.1 billion in costs related to tariffs in the September quarter and projected $1.4 billion in such costs in the December quarter, though the projection doesn't take account of Trump's reduced tariffs announced earlier Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Should Trump make the preliminary deal official with an executive order, it could lead to substantial tariff savings on iPhones imported from China, where the company still makes many of its higher-end late model iPhones like the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. Final assembly of lower-end and older iPhones imported to the U.S. has shifted to India, where Apple isn't subject to tariffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Rolfe Winkler at Rolfe.Winkler@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

It drew strong opposition from Beijing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This pause may give Chinese entities sufficient time to reorganize corporate structures and holdings to circumvent any re-imposition of the (rule),\" said Nazak Nikakhtar, who served at the Commerce Department during Trump's first term.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Chinese companies have, over the years, become very adept at circumventing U.S. laws,\" she added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    The rule was suspended as part of the summit between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, in exchange for China delaying its restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Yes, we are going to be suspending that for a year in return for the suspension ...on the rare earth licensing regime,\" he told Fox Business Network.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    The measure, which had long been sought by China hawks in Washington, hit 20,000 additional Chinese firms with U.S. export restrictions, vastly expanding the universe of blacklisted China-linked parties from the previous 1,300, according to a recent report from WireScreen.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    \"(The delay) could significantly limit the national security benefits that proponents of the rule were hoping for,\" said Saif Khan, who served as director of Technology and National Security at the White House National Security Council under former President Joe Biden.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Trade lawyer Dan Fisher-Owens cautioned, however, that U.S. companies may still be wary of resuming shipments to Chinese firms affected by the affiliates rule.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This heightened awareness, and the potential for re-imposition if negotiations sour, may prevent a return to business as usual with affected affiliates,\" he said.</span></p></span></div></div>",

In September, the company agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle a lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission over its Prime subscription policies.

The company has said that demand for Amazon cloud and AI products have outpaced its ability to bring new data centers online.

The company continues to benefit from strong U.S. consumer spending, despite rising fears about the economy and job losses. Amazon has managed so far to weather President Trump's trade war, with sales continuing to rise despite the reliance of many Amazon sellers on China for materials and manufacturing. The company has said it hadn't detected \"meaningful\" price increases on Amazon.com, indicating that sellers may be absorbing some of the tariff costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon is seeking to consolidate its grip on American wallets by investing in faster and cheaper deliveries. The company says whenever it provides those services, people buy more things from Amazon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is investing in new robots and AI tools designed to make warehouses smaller and more efficient. The hope is that more compact storage spaces can be placed closer to customer's homes and AI can better predict what people want to buy.
