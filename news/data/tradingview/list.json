If the units are purchased or sold on the TSX, investors may pay more than the current net asset value when buying units of the investment fund and may receive less than the current net asset value when selling them. There are ongoing fees and expenses associated with owning units of an investment fund. Investment funds are not guaranteed, their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated. Distributions are paid to you in cash unless you request, pursuant to your participation in a distribution reinvestment plan, that they be reinvested into Class A units of the Fund. If the Fund earns less than the amounts distributed, the difference is a return of capital. An investment fund must prepare disclosure documents that contain key information about the investment fund. You can find more detailed information about the investment fund in these documents.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260226211030/en/</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CONTACT:    For Additional Information:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Website: https://harvestetfs.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>E-mail: info@harvestetfs.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Toll free: 1-866-998-8298</span></p></span></div></div>",

The FTSE 100 returned almost 26% over the year, outperforming both U.S. and global equity markets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aberdeen Investments said the bottom 10% of the UK Main Market by market value generated an average dividend yield of 3.4% in January, above the roughly 3% yield on large-cap peers. That comes as investors reassess the appeal of smaller companies, whose valuations remain heavily discounted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Abby Glennie, manager of the Aberdeen UK Smaller Companies funds, said small caps are now exhibiting many of the same characteristics that supported large-cap outperformance in 2025. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Valuations appear attractive, income is improving and the quality of businesses is sometimes overlooked,\" she said, adding that around half of revenues for UK small caps come from overseas, offering diversification beyond the domestic cycle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The broader macro backdrop has also shifted, inflation has eased, unemployment remains low and sterling is firm, supporting foreign currency earnings. Meanwhile, capital discipline, which is a key driver of the FTSE 100's surge last year is becoming more visible in the mid-cap space, with roughly 100 FTSE 250 companies running share buybacks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Small caps still trade at a near 25% discount to large caps, wide by historical standards. Analysts say that if domestic outflows stabilize, the segment could benefit from renewed demand as investors look beyond last year’s narrow global market leadership.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Tech stocks are leading the way lower, resulting in a slump by the Nasdaq.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Currently, the Nasdaq is off its lows of the session but still 354.17 points or 1.5 percent at 22,797.90. The S&amp;P 500 is also down 55.96 points or 0.8 percent at 6,890.17, while the narrower Dow is up 48.85 points or 0.1 percent at 49,531.00.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The weakness on Wall Street comes amid a negative reaction to earnings news from Nvidia (NVDA), with the artificial intelligence chipmaker tumbling by 4.7 percent.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shares of Nvidia are pulling back off their best closing level in over three months even though the company reported better than expected fiscal fourth quarter results and provided upbeat guidance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'It says a lot when a stock market darling beating revenue forecasts by billions of dollars can no longer muster a positive share price reaction,' said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell. 'The mood music is changing on Nvidia, and it represents a significant shift in investor sentiment.'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He added, 'The focus has now shifted to growing competition, concerns about excessive levels of investment across the AI space either being unsustainable or unnecessary, and whether the party will end in tears.'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nvidia is helping to lead the semiconductor sector lower, as reflected by the 3.7 percent plunge by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. The index ended the previous session at a record closing high.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Networking stocks have also shown a significant move to the downside, dragging the NYSE Arca Networking Index down by 2.1 percent.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Biotechnology, computer hardware and steel stocks are also seeing considerable weakness, while airline stocks have moved sharply higher, resulting in a 2.6 percent surge by the NYSE Arca Airline Index.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The uptick by the Dow partly reflects a surge by shares of Salesforce (CRM), with the customer service software maker jumping by 4.1 percent after reporting better than expected fourth quarter results.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the U.S. economic front, a report released by the Labor Department showed a modest increase in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week ended February 21st.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Labor Department said initial jobless claims rose to 212,000, an increase of 4,000 from the previous week's revised level of 208,000.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Economists had expected jobless claims to climb to 215,000 from the 206,000 originally reported for the previous week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance on Thursday.
