            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>XRP’s liquidity structure on higher timeframes is in a situation where the path of least resistance could extend to the $4 level. The remark came from crypto analyst Bird in response to hourly and daily liquidity heatmaps shared by Cryptoinsightuk, which show a clear contrast between short-term and higher-timeframe liquidity positioning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $1.45, still below the large liquidity clusters visible above the current price. According to Bird, that imbalance may not stay unresolved for long.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Hourly Liquidity Cleared, Short-Term Volatility Reduced</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>XRP’s liquidity heatmap on the hourly candlestick chart shows that much of the nearby liquidity below the current price has already been swept. The visible clusters around the $1.30-$1.50 range have all been cleared, meaning that the short-term stop hunts and liquidation pools have largely been cleared out.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to Bird, this trend shows that hourly XRP liquidity is basically gone. This means there is less immediate incentive for XRP to stay around current levels on lower timeframes. When short-term liquidity dries up like this, the outlook is that the price will gravitate to areas where larger pools are untouched.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since the nearby liquidity has already been taken, the next logical target is now where there are larger concentrations of resting orders. As noted by the analyst, these resting orders are stacked all the way up past $4. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>XRP Hourly Liquidity. Source: @Cryptoinsightuk on X</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Daily Liquidity Stacked Above $4</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Liquidity on the daily heatmap appears layered and dense above the current price, stretching through multiple resistance bands and extending above the $4 price level. The upper regions show heavy trading activity and visible liquidity clusters between $2.50 and $4.00, which is a reflection of a thick concentration of stop orders and resting interest.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In liquidity-based trading theory, price action is often drawn to areas where there are large position orders, especially when those zones have not yet been tapped. Bird described this higher-timeframe liquidity as stacked all the way up past $4, with the notion that the higher-timeframe liquidity is sitting there like a magnet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>XRP Daily Liquidity. Source: @Cryptoinsightuk on X</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bird also referenced a five-month breakdown in Bitcoin dominance. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin dominance is at 57.9%, down from 58.2% last week. This means Bitcoin has been steadily losing dominance. A decline in dominance is always due to capital rotation into altcoins. If that trend continues, XRP could easily become one of the best beneficiaries, particularly given its visible higher-timeframe liquidity targets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The analyst also noted that sentiment has not yet reached extreme lows. XRP, in particular, has maintained a relatively positive positioning among investors compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. That combination of declining dominance and neutral-to-cautious sentiment can create conditions for XRP’s projected rally above $4.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Frontier met with investors, partners, and industry professionals. Discussions emphasized that critical minerals are now viewed as a national security issue, with access to capital being the main challenge rather than geology. The U.S. Government signaled openness to investing in global projects supporting American supply chains. Lithium sentiment was positive, driven by demand for energy storage and concerns over reliance on Chinese supply.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Frontier Lithium was also pleased to participate in the recent Canadian Critical Minerals Investment Forum hosted by Natural Resources Canada and Invest in Canada.  Engagements were held across Rome, Munich, and Paris joining Canadian critical mineral mining peers to showcase our projects and to strengthen collaboration with European governments, investors and industrial partners. In all engagements, discussions advanced cooperation under bilateral critical minerals frameworks and the G7 Alliance on the Production of Critical Minerals, reinforcing a shared commitment to standards-based markets and responsible development and explore new partnerships across strategic sectors. Across all forums, Frontier showcased its investment-ready lithium assets and reaffirmed its commitment to safe, sustainable and long-term development in support of resilient North American and European battery supply chains.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition, Frontier will be attending the Prospectors &amp; Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) 2026 Convention, taking place between March 1 — 4, 2026, at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre (MTCC) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the world's premier mineral exploration and mining event bringing together global industry leaders, investors, governments and service providers. Frontier will be exhibiting at Booth No. 3236 in the Investors Exchange and scheduled to deliver a corporate presentation as part of PDAC's \"Electric Materials 2\" session on Tuesday, March 3, 2026, from 3:30 p.m. in Room 801B at the MTCC, highlighting its project developments and investment story to an audience of investors and industry participants</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company also reports the filing of its interim financial results for the third quarter ended December 31, 2025. Frontier closed the quarter with $12 million in cash and cash equivalents, supporting continued project advancement and corporate activities. The quarter and subsequent period reflect continued execution across key workstreams, including consultation activities under Ontario's One Project, One Process (1P1P) framework and strengthened engagement with local First Nations, culminating in the execution of formal process agreements in January 2026 with Deer Lake and Sandy Lake First Nations to advance collaborative permitting for the Company's PAK Project (the \"PAK Project\" or \"Project). Earlier in the quarter, the PAK Project was selected as Ontario's first lithium project under the 1P1P framework, helping streamline the provincial permitting pathway. Frontier also continued advancing refinery pre-definitive feasibility study work with its engineering partner, including value engineering initiatives across the mine and mill flowsheet, and released an independent socioeconomic impact study highlighting the Project's significant economic, employment and regional benefits. Most recently, the Company welcomed the announcement of the start of construction of the Berens Bridge and Road Project by Ministry of Northern Economic Development and Growth. Collectively, these milestones demonstrate measurable progress toward de-risking and advancing the PAK Project.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Frontier's condensed interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying management's discussion and analysis for the three month period ended December 31, 2025 have been filed on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and can be viewed under the company's website at https://www.frontierlithium.com/.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trevor Walker</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About Frontier Lithium</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Frontier Lithium Inc. is a pre-production mining company with an objective to become a strategic and integrated supplier of premium spodumene concentrates as well as battery-grade lithium salts to the growing electric vehicle, and energy storage markets in North America.

The Company would like to clarify that the MOU is non-binding, is for a term of 12 months beginning on September 23, 2025 but subject to mutually agreeable extensions, and that either party has the right to terminate the MOU upon 30 days' written notice. The primary purpose of the partnership is to allow Uniserve to integrate Railtown's AI frameworks, tools and solutions into Uniserve's offerings, thereby enabling Uniserve's internal sales team to promote and sell AI capabilities to Uniserve's customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Each of Railtown and Uniserve has certain defined obligations under the MOU, pursuant to which the parties have agreed to negotiate and execute separate commercial agreements, statements of work or service orders, as the case may be, in connection with, among other things, customer engagements, revenue sharing and pricing.

In addition, each party had the ability to terminate the SPLA prior to the completion of the term by providing 30 days' written notice to the other party, with certain support obligations of Railtown continuing for a transition period of four (4) months following the effective date of termination.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The SLPA required the Company to provide a license to the technology and related support services to Quisitive at no cost, and the primary purpose of the agreement was to confirm the viability of the technology for use and integration with Quisitive's products and services, and to test the technology with up to 10 customers of Quisitive. Despite the expiry of the SPLA and the acquisition of Quisitive by H.I.G. Capital in early 2025, the testing is ongoing and Quisitive continues to offer the technology to its customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Although Railtown has not generated any revenue from Quisitive or its customers to date, the Company anticipates entering into a revenue sharing agreement with Quisitive upon the adoption of any Quisitive technology that includes a version of the company's platform.

The Company would like to clarify that, under the partnership agreement governing the relationship between the parties, Railtown paid Mila the sum of $10,000 plus applicable taxes - Mila's standard fee for new partners - in exchange for certain privileges typically provided to Mila's partners including having the Company's name or logo appear on Mila's website and certain promotional documents, and the ability to access and use certain of Mila's resources, including research, talent and intellectual property (such as, for example, Mila's expertise on advanced computing technologies, Mila's students for internship purposes, and a presence for Railtown in Mila's artificial intelligence \"hub\"). </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The partnership agreement was for a term of 12 months and automatically terminated on June 19, 2025; however, the Company continues to engage with Mila and anticipates partnering again with Mila in the future.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>July 23, 2024 News Release</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In this news release, the Company announce that it had entered into a co-development agreement with the Alberta Machine Learning Institute (\"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Amii</span></strong><span>\") pursuant to which the parties agreed to partner on a specific project and build related to Railtown's core technology. The Company would like to clarify that the relationship was governed by Amii's customary services contract and an accompanying statement of work (\"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>SOW</span></strong><span>\"), and that the term of the relationship was the longer of 14 months or one (1) month following the final day of employment of the Amii machine learning resident dedicated to the project (the \"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>ML Resident</span></strong><span>\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In consideration for the services of both Amii and the ML Resident under the program covered by the agreement and SOW, Railtown paid Amii an aggregate of $100,000 plus GST, being Amii's standard fee for programs of this nature.

(\"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>ESGAI</span></strong><span>\") to co-develop an advanced suite of intelligent ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) software agents. The Company would like to clarify that the partnership is structured as a MOU between the parties that anticipates the execution and delivery of a formal license agreement (the \"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>License Agreement</span></strong><span>\") whereby ESGAI will license certain software technology owned and developed by Railtown in connection with the development of the agents.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The effective date of the MOU is June 6, 2025, and it automatically terminates upon the earlier of (a) the execution of the License Agreement, (b) the mutual written agreement of the parties, and (c) 180 days from the effective date. The Company complied with each of its obligations under the MOU; however, the parties were unable to negotiate the terms of the License Agreement prior to the automatic termination of the MOU on December 3, 2025, largely because such terms were predicated on ESGAI establishing a market for the agents first.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Regardless, Railtown remains committed to developing the ESG agent suite with ESGAI as circumstances allow. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>July 28, 2025 News Release</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In this news release, Railtown announced a strategic joint partnership with Braiyt AI Inc. (\"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Braiyt</span></strong><span>\") to deliver AI technologies to Dubai and the broader Middle East region. The Company would like to retract the overly promotional disclosure in the news release and confirm that the partnership is structured as a MOU between Braiyt, Railtown and AIP, pursuant to which Braiyt agreed, for a term of three years, to promote the products and services of each of the Company, AIP and any affiliates of AIP in the Middle East as opportunities arise. In exchange, Braiyt is entitled to enter into a finder's fee arrangement with the relevant selling party on terms to be negotiated between the parties.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>General</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In certain of Railtown's previously filed continuous disclosure documents, the Company has used phrases such as \"</span><em><span>selling its AI services and solutions</span></em><span>\" that the BCSC believes may potentially be misleading given the lack of revenue reflected in the Company's financial statements at the time. While the Company acknowledges that the language may have been less than perfect and that a phrase such as \"</span><em><span>the AI services and solutions are available for sale</span></em><span>\" may technically have been more accurate, the Company would like to clarify that it has in fact generated nominal (i.e., non-material) sales revenue from paying customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition, the BCSC has expressed its concern over the accuracy of phrases such as \"</span><em><span>the platform is fully trained on clients' applications</span></em><span>\" (from Railtown's news release dated December 6, 2023), and that the system \"</span><em><span>continually trains on a client's application</span></em><span>\" and \"</span><em><span>automates a wide range of tasks associated with the client's application</span></em><span>\" (from Railtown's management discussion and analysis for the period ended June 30, 2025), because the Company either had no customers or a limited number of customers at the relevant time. The Company would like to clarify that it was using the word \"client\" in a general sense in this disclosure - that is, as a substitute for \"user\" and not in relation to a specific customer - and that the language was intended to convey how the Company's technology works once a customer downloads and connects to the platform. More specifically, once a customer downloads the Company's Railtracks agentic framework and connects to Conductr, the platform runs on the customer's own cloud infrastructure or on the customer's local computers or servers, with the result that the AI agent is able to access to the customer's data stored in those locations and learn by ingesting the data in real time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Finally, Railtown would like to take this opportunity to confirm that the Company's primary focus for 2026 will be the building out of its Canadian agent development and deployment ecosystem with the Company's Canadian partners.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Railtown</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Railtown AI Technologies Inc. builds AI developer tools and agentic frameworks that power the next generation of intelligent applications.

There can be no assurance that the necessary approvals will be obtained that would allow the Company to recommence sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260227076859/en/</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CONTACT:    Investor Contact:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Harrison Breaud</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vice President, Finance &amp; Investor Relations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>IR@sableoffshore.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>713-579-8111</span></p></span></div></div>",
