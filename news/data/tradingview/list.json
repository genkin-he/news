It's the first time that threshold has been passed since July 2024.

That may become a big factor influencing how CBOT soybeans trade, more so than promises made during this week's meetings between the U.S. and China. \"Amid a massive liquidation of their hog herd, [we doubt] that China wants to import greater tonnages of soybeans in 2025/26,\" AgResource said in a note. The firm also adds that Brazilian prices remain more competitive, making the U.S. a less-favored alternative until margins ease.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Delayed Reaction: Aid payments that have been directed to farmers in the wake of U.S. trading disputes with numerous partners may be slowing down what would otherwise be a necessary change in the input costs for farmers to plant every spring. In a report this week, analysts with Rabobank said payments coming from the Trump Administration may be creating this delay.

OPEC+ is widely expected to agree at the weekend to unwind another 137,000 barrels of output cuts in December. Reports that Russia may push back against further increases as the country faces U.S. sanctions is something to consider, says Rebecca Babin of CIBC Private Wealth US. \"I see the 137,000 coming, but I'm not saying there's no chance you'll see a pause,\" she says. WTI and Brent settle up 0.1% at $60.57 and $65.00 a barrel, respectively. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
