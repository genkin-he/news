The Standard Chartered </span><span> CEO went into 2025 with the goal of inching the $46 billion lender’s slowly improving return on tangible equity up to 13% by the end of 2026. In the six months to the end of June it rocketed to an annualised rate of 18.7%. If sustainable, that would warrant the bank trading at close to 2 times tangible book value, far above its current multiple. Shareholders, though, have paid more attention to Winters’ words than his deeds. StanChart’s third-quarter earnings released on Thursday justify their caution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bank’s net income came in at $1.3 billion, above consensus estimates but 25% lower than the bumper showing in the preceding three months. The one-quarter revenue drop in global markets accounted for much of that. But it’s hardly a disaster: diminishing trade tensions reduce volatility and thus clients’ desire to hedge, taking the top line back to a similar level as last year’s third quarter. Meanwhile there was other good news. Revenue in the wealth business, which Winters has earmarked for expansion, hit a record. Moreover Winters and finance chief Diego De Giorgi are keeping costs under control.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The robust performance comes after years of underperformance – and has done wonders for the stock. Standard Chartered shares are up 66% over the past 12 months and almost 130% since the start of 2024, outstripping rivals HSBC </span><span>, DBS </span><span> and Citigroup </span><span> in both instances.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:862.3481781376519px;aspect-ratio:1.4372469635627532\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3WC029-aa41b423a66d70a4c14603aec0af21e4-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"StanChart shares outperform global peers\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3WC029-aa41b423a66d70a4c14603aec0af21e4-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f7f7f7\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-S5VA5POt\"><span class=\"copyright-S5VA5POt\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-S5VA5POt\">Standard Chartered shares have outpaced rivals</span></figcaption></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That, though, leaves it trading at around 1.2 times tangible book value, which is roughly in line with Winters’ returns target. That multiple would have started to look stingy if the bank had cranked out another stellar quarter. Instead, StanChart’s more even-paced performance means that, barring a major blow-up, Winters should easily hit his target early. He’s now forecasting a return of around 13% for 2025. Hitting that number on the nose requires earning just $250 million in the fourth quarter, Breakingviews calculates, which suggests Winters could well end up doing better. For now, shareholders will be breathing a sigh of relief that they have been following what Winters said, not what he did.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Follow Antony Currie on Bluesky and LinkedIn.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CONTEXT NEWS</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Standard Chartered on October 30 reported third-quarter earnings of $1.3 billion, or 44.5 cents a share. That compares to the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts provided by the bank of 39 cents a share, per data collected by LSEG. Revenue for the period was $5.1 billion, compared to an estimated $5 billion. Return on tangible equity was 10.5% and 13.4% on an underlying earnings basis, which strips out one-off factors.</span></p></span></div></div>",
