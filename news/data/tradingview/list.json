            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Oyin Adedoyin</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Upbeat earnings from technology giants and a flurry of artificial-intelligence deals powered the Nasdaq composite higher for a seventh consecutive month, its longest stretch of monthly gains since 2018.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It was quite a week for big tech. Nvidia became the world's first $5 trillion company. Apple and Microsoft topped $4 trillion. And despite occasional disappointments, a spate of earnings from the so-called Magnificent Seven — which also includes Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Tesla — helped the Nasdaq finish October 4.7% higher.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The latest boost came from Amazon, which on Friday surged 9.6% to its first new all-time high since February after the e-commerce giant reported faster-than-expected increases in AI-related revenue and aggressive plans to grow data-center capacity. Amazon closed at a record market capitalization of $2.61 trillion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The group's market capitalization now makes up roughly 38% of the entire S&amp;P 500, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Their climb has helped carry stocks to record after record in the months since April's tariff-fueled market meltdown. And as tech companies continue to pump money into artificial intelligence, investors parse their reports for signs the rally can keep going.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Technology is just all this market seems to care about right now,\" said Liz Thomas, head of investment strategy at SoFi. \"I've lost count of how many new all-time highs we've hit this year in the S&amp;P.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other indexes are doing well, too. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on a six-month streak of gains, its longest in seven years. So far this year, the Nasdaq and S&amp;P have had 36 record closes and the Dow has had 15.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Not all tech stocks outperformed this week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple is betting that consumers will line up to buy the latest iPhone 17. The company expects revenue to increase 10% to 12% over the holidays, above Wall Street analyst expectations. Apple also plans to increase investments in AI, adding a major bump in spending. Microsoft also reported a $4.1 billion hit on its investment in OpenAI, up 490% from a year earlier.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some companies reported weakened spending from younger and lower-income consumers. Chipotle Mexican Grill's shares plunged on Thursday after it said customers were pulling back on spending, particularly younger consumers. The fast-casual restaurant chain was down 2.6% on Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We're really seeing a bifurcation in the market,\" said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon.com announced Tuesday that it was laying off thousands of workers, kick-starting a plan to cut up to 30,000 jobs. This followed Meta Platforms, which recently cut 600 jobs in its AI division. UPS, Target, and General Motors also announced large-scale job cuts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As companies continue to pump money into AI and shed workers, investors have looked to earnings reports to give them the confidence to continue participating in the market. \"When you look at the earnings growth that technology is going to pump out in the third quarter and for the full year, it's still the best-performing sector from an earnings standpoint, \" Thomas said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Federal Reserve cut rates by a quarter-point this week, but investors grew weary after Chair Jerome Powell cast doubts about whether there would be another rate cut in December. Powell said that central bankers have \"strongly differing views\" on what to do next. The decision has been complicated by a data blackout caused by the government shutdown.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Fed approved the rate cut on a 10-2 vote. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted against the decision because he favored no change in rates, while Fed governor Stephen Miran dissented in favor of a larger, half-point cut.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Economists and investment analysts anticipate that once more jobs data becomes available, it may reveal a more sobering picture of the labor market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If you enter a period where you've got net job losses, eventually it's going to hit the economy and it's going to hit equity markets,\" Tilley said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Oyin Adedoyin at oyin.adedoyin@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the Fund's distribution to shareholders may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that a shareholder invested in a Fund is paid back to them. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\" The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV to shareholders for the calendar year that will describe how to report the Fund's distributions for federal income tax purposes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The determination of the actual source of distributions can only be made at year-end. The actual source amounts of all Fund distributions will be included in the Fund's annual or semi-annual reports. In addition, the tax treatment may differ from the accounting treatment used to calculate the source of the Fund's distributions as shown on shareholders' statements. Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after December 31, 2025 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV early in 2026. Since each shareholder's tax situation is unique, it may be advisable to consult a tax advisor as to the appropriate treatment of Fund distributions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Effective on January 1, 2024, Saba Capital Management, L.P. replaced Franklin Templeton Advisers, Inc. as the investment adviser to Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund II (formerly known as the Templeton Global Income Fund).

Annual NAV Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund's NAV over a year, assuming reinvestment of distributions paid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(2) The Annualized Distribution Rate is the dollar value of distributions for the current fiscal period November 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025 annualized as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of September 30, 2025. The level of distribution amount shown is not guaranteed and special dividends may or may not be paid in the future. Further, no conclusions should be drawn about the Fund's investment performance from the amount or rate of distribution shown.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(3) Cumulative Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund's NAV from October 31, 2024 through September 30, 2025, assuming reinvestment of distributions paid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(4) The Cumulative Fiscal Year-To-Date Distribution Rate is the dollar value of distributions for the current fiscal period November 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025 as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of September 30, 2025. The level of distribution amount shown is not guaranteed and special dividends may or may not be paid in the future. Further, no conclusions should be drawn about the Fund's investment performance from the amount or rate of distribution shown.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Managed Distribution Plan. The above distribution was declared in accordance with the Fund's currently effective managed distribution plan (the \"Plan\"), whereby the Fund will make monthly distributions to shareholders at a fixed amount of $0.058 per share. Thus, the distribution amount shown excludes special dividends (which are not paid pursuant to the plan). The Fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund's Plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund's common shares, but there is no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the Plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. As a result, long-term capital gains and/or return of capital may be a material source of any distribution. No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's distributions or from the terms of the Fund's Plan. The Board of Trustees (the \"Board\") may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to Fund shareholders. No level of distribution can be guaranteed. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's common shares. The Plan is subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the annual minimum fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Past Performance is No Assurance of Future Results. Investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investors should consider the investment objective, risks and expenses carefully. You can obtain the Fund's most recent periodic reports and filings by visiting https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=828803&amp;owner=exclude.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other Information and Certain Risk Factors: The Fund's investment objective is to provide investors with high current income, with a secondary goal of capital appreciation. There can be no assurance that the Fund will meet its investment objective. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing globally in debt and equity securities of public and private companies, which includes, among other things, investments in closed--end funds, special purpose acquisition companies (\"SPACs\"), reinsurance, and public and private debt instruments. The Fund also may utilize derivatives including but not limited to total return swaps, credit default swaps, options and futures, in seeking to enhance returns and/or to reduce portfolio risk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The value of the Fund's investments in equity securities of public and private, listed and unlisted companies and equity derivatives generally varies with the performance of the issuer and movements in the equity markets more generally. As a result, the Fund may suffer losses if it invests in equity instruments of issuers whose performance diverges from the Fund's investment manager's expectations or if equity markets generally move in a single direction and the Fund has not hedged against such a general move. The Fund invests in closed-end funds and SPACs, which are subject to additional risks and considerations. The performance of reinsurance-related securities and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various triggering events, including but not limited to weather, natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.), non-natural large catastrophes and other specified events causing physical and/or economic loss. To the extent the Fund invests in reinsurance-related securities for which a triggering event occurs, losses associated with such event could result in losses to the Fund's investment, and a series of major triggering events affecting a large portion of the reinsurance- related securities held by the Fund could result in substantial losses to the Fund's investment. The Fund may invest in high yield securities, which are speculative in nature and are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default, illiquidity of the security, and changes in value based on changes in interest rates. Changes in short-term market interest rates may directly affect the yield on the Fund's common shares. If such rates fall, the Fund's yield may also fall. If interest rate spreads on bonds and loans owned by the Fund decline in general, the yield on the bonds and loans will likely fall and the value of such bonds and loans may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short-term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on bonds and loans in the Fund's portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for certain bonds and loans, the Fund's ability to sell such securities in a timely fashion and/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new bonds and loans acquired by the Fund, and it may also increase the price of bonds and loans purchased by the Fund in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the price of bonds and loans in the Fund's portfolio, which would cause the Fund's net asset value to decrease. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including but not limited to potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Fund may engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge, as closely as practicable, all of the economic impact to the Fund arising from foreign currency fluctuations. Other risks include, but are not limited to, the use of derivatives, the potential lack of diversification in the Fund's portfolio, and the fact that the Fund's portfolio may be concentrated in a small group of industries or industry sectors from time to time. Investors should consult the Fund's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the materials on the Fund's website for a more detailed discussion of these or other risk factors that affect the Fund.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund II.

The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the Fund's distribution to shareholders may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that a shareholder invested in a Fund is paid back to them. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\" The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV to shareholders for the calendar year that will describe how to report the Fund's distributions for federal income tax purposes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The determination of the actual source of distributions can only be made at year-end. The actual source amounts of all Fund distributions will be included in the Fund's annual or semi-annual reports. In addition, the tax treatment may differ from the accounting treatment used to calculate the source of the Fund's distributions as shown on shareholders' statements. Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after December 31, 2025 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV early in 2026. Since each shareholder's tax situation is unique, it may be advisable to consult a tax advisor as to the appropriate treatment of Fund distributions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Effective after the close of business on June 4, 2021, Saba Capital Management, L.P. replaced Voya Financial as the investment adviser to Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund (formerly known as the Voya Prime Rate Trust).

Annual NAV Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund's NAV over a year, assuming reinvestment of distributions paid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(2) The Annualized Distribution Rate is the dollar value of distributions for the current fiscal period November 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025 annualized as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of September 30, 2025. The level of distribution amount shown is not guaranteed and special dividends may or may not be paid in the future. Further, no conclusions should be drawn about the Fund's investment performance from the amount or rate of distribution shown.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(3) Cumulative Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund's NAV from October 31, 2024 through September 30, 2025, assuming reinvestment of distributions paid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(4) The Cumulative Fiscal Year-To-Date Distribution Rate is the dollar value of distributions for the current fiscal period November 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025 as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of September 30, 2025. The level of distribution amount shown is not guaranteed and special dividends may or may not be paid in the future. Further, no conclusions should be drawn about the Fund's investment performance from the amount or rate of distribution shown.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Managed Distribution Plan. The above distribution was declared in accordance with the Fund's currently effective managed distribution plan (the \"Plan\"), whereby the Fund will make monthly distributions to shareholders at a fixed amount of $0.085 per share. Thus, the distribution amount shown excludes special dividends (which are not paid pursuant to the plan). The Fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund's Plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund's common shares, but there is no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the Plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. As a result, long-term capital gains and/or return of capital may be a material source of any distribution. No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's distributions or from the terms of the Fund's Plan. The Board of Trustees (the \"Board\") may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to Fund shareholders. No level of distribution can be guaranteed. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's common shares. The Plan is subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the annual minimum fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Past Performance is No Assurance of Future Results. Investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investors should consider the investment objective, risks and expenses carefully. You can obtain the Fund's most recent periodic reports and filings by visiting https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=826020&amp;owner=exclude.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other Information and Certain Risk Factors: The Fund's investment objective is to provide investors with a high level of current income, with a secondary goal of capital appreciation. There can be no assurance that the Fund will meet its investment objective. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing globally in debt and equity securities of public and private companies, which includes, among other things, investments in closed--end funds, special purpose acquisition companies (\"SPACs\"), reinsurance, and public and private debt instruments. The Fund also may utilize derivatives including but not limited to total return swaps, credit default swaps, options and futures, in seeking to enhance returns and/or to reduce portfolio risk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The value of the Fund's investments in equity securities of public and private, listed and unlisted companies and equity derivatives generally varies with the performance of the issuer and movements in the equity markets more generally. As a result, the Fund may suffer losses if it invests in equity instruments of issuers whose performance diverges from the Fund's investment manager's expectations or if equity markets generally move in a single direction and the Fund has not hedged against such a general move. The Fund invests in closed-end funds and SPACs, which are subject to additional risks and considerations. The performance of reinsurance-related securities and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various triggering events, including but not limited to weather, natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.), non-natural large catastrophes and other specified events causing physical and/or economic loss. To the extent the Fund invests in reinsurance-related securities for which a triggering event occurs, losses associated with such event could result in losses to the Fund's investment, and a series of major triggering events affecting a large portion of the reinsurance- related securities held by the Fund could result in substantial losses to the Fund's investment. The Fund may invest in high yield securities, which are speculative in nature and are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default, illiquidity of the security, and changes in value based on changes in interest rates. Changes in short-term market interest rates may directly affect the yield on the Fund's common shares. If such rates fall, the Fund's yield may also fall. If interest rate spreads on bonds and loans owned by the Fund decline in general, the yield on the bonds and loans will likely fall and the value of such bonds and loans may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short-term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on bonds and loans in the Fund's portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for certain bonds and loans, the Fund's ability to sell such securities in a timely fashion and/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new bonds and loans acquired by the Fund, and it may also increase the price of bonds and loans purchased by the Fund in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the price of bonds and loans in the Fund's portfolio, which would cause the Fund's net asset value to decrease. The Fund's use of leverage, if any, through borrowings or issuance of preferred shares can adversely affect the yield on the Fund's common shares. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including but not limited to potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Fund may engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge, as closely as practicable, all of the economic impact to the Fund arising from foreign currency fluctuations. Other risks include, but are not limited to, the use of derivatives, the potential lack of diversification in the Fund's portfolio, and the fact that the Fund's portfolio may be concentrated in a small group of industries or industry sectors from time to time. Investors should consult the Fund's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the materials on the Fund's website for a more detailed discussion of these or other risk factors that affect the Fund.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund.
