Prices have been under pressure this week amid weak demand and rising output. High inventories in Malaysia and substitution impact from soybean oil are also weighing, Guangzhou Futures says in commentary. Prices might see a mild rebound in the fourth quarter as Malaysia's production reduction cycle begins, but a rally like last year's isn't likely, they note. The Bursa Malaysia Derivatives contract for January delivery fell 55 ringgit to 4,205 ringgit a ton. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>What to Know:</span></strong><span> Pump.fun and Virtuals Protocol have both seen sharp declines, losing nearly 20% and 15% respectively amid the latest sell-off.  Despite the dip, charts suggest both tokens are merely consolidating, with their long-term bullishness still firmly intact.  For investors seeking early opportunities, the best crypto presales like $BEST, $PEPENODE, and $RTX could offer explosive growth. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The sell-off triggered by the latest Federal Reserve rate cut – primarily due to Powell remarking that a December rate cut is far from likely – has now well and truly seeped into hype-driven tokens, which are often the biggest losers whenever such a sell-off happens.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The most notable ones are Pump.fun ($PUMP) and Virtuals Protocol ($VIRTUAL). Pump.fun, for instance, has lost nearly 20% in the last 48 hours alone, whereas Virtuals Protocol is down 15% since its latest swing high of around $1.68.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It’s worth noting that these are not isolated instances. Even the biggest meme coins in the industry, like $PENGU, $SPX, and $APE, have each lost between 10-15% in just the last week, hinting at a broader, industry-wide downturn. But before you spiral downward and sell all of your crypto holdings, it’s worth taking a good, long look at the charts, which suggest that the current downturn is most likely just a pause before the longer-term bullish momentum resumes. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>$PUMP, for instance, is currently retesting the $0.0044 level, which it broke out from after overcoming resistance around the same zone with a 55% rally just a couple of weeks ago.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:825.147347740668px;aspect-ratio:1.37524557956778\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:1b9baf0bd094b-52ebb93304a9398ab1f2d09354226ef3-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"$PUMP daily chart on TradingView.\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:1b9baf0bd094b-52ebb93304a9398ab1f2d09354226ef3-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f7f8f8\"/></picture></div></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>$VIRTUAL, on the other hand, looks even more positive.

So, how do you go about building a crypto portfolio in such a market? The obvious answer is the best crypto presales. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These are low-cap tokens, meaning they’re still under the radar and carry a lot of explosive potential.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Plus, they’re currently in ‘pre’-sale, meaning they’re not yet listed on exchanges, which gives them the unique ability to ward off noise from current market conditions while also positioning you ahead of the next big wave.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here are our top three suggestions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Viral Presale Token Powering the Best Wallet Ecosystem</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Best Wallet Token ($BEST)</span></strong><span> has the potential to revolutionize how people buy into crypto presales. Right now, </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Best Wallet</span></strong><span> is the only crypto wallet that lets you purchase new projects directly within the app.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other wallets, by contrast, require you to visit external presale websites, connect your wallet there, and then return to authorize the transaction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Best Wallet’s ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section lists all these early-stage moonshot opportunities in one place, saving you the trouble of digging around to find the best investment options. Even better, the internal Best Wallet team vets every single new meme coin before making it available for purchase, adding a crucial extra layer of security that can save you from rug pulls and phishing websites. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Speaking of security, Best Wallet uses state-of-the-art encryption technology and robust two-factor authentication, including biometric login.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It’s also a completely non-custodial crypto wallet, meaning only you have access to your private keys.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1141.304347826087px;aspect-ratio:1.9021739130434783\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:1b9baf0bd094b-0491219072a8e383c843e4aa015d360a-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Best Wallet key features.\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:1b9baf0bd094b-0491219072a8e383c843e4aa015d360a-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#c9e0f1\"/></picture></div></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On top of that, you have the option to set up multiple Ethereum wallets, giving you the freedom to organize your crypto endeavors however you like – perhaps one wallet for HODLing, one for staking, and another for active trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to Best Wallet’s roadmap, it aims to capture 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That’s why buying $BEST, which has already pulled in over $16.75M in its ongoing presale, could be a smart move.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Also, based on our $BEST price prediction, it could soar 170% by the end of 2030, reaching a potential high of $0.07.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ride Best Wallet’s growth – buy $BEST today for just $0.025875.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Making Crypto Mining More Accessible &amp; Fun</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Right now, crypto mining is not only largely inaccessible to the general public due to its high costs and technical know-how, but it’s also extremely boring because of its tedious and repetitive nature.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That needs to change, and </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>PEPENODE ($PEPENODE)</span></strong><span> is bringing that change by offering a never-before-seen gamified virtual crypto mining ecosystem that removes the barriers currently surrounding crypto mining while also offering lucrative rewards in return.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When you become a $PEPENODE holder, you get access to an empty virtual server room. The next step is to go shopping and grab some meme nodes, and this is where things get exciting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Every node is unique in terms of its characteristics, mining quality, and compatibility with other nodes, meaning you’ll need to experiment and fine-tune to build the perfect mining setup for yourself.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:948.0812641083521px;aspect-ratio:1.5801354401805867\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:1b9baf0bd094b-679a22c370ab161144bcafb1ecfdbe14-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"How PEPENODE works.\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:1b9baf0bd094b-679a22c370ab161144bcafb1ecfdbe14-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#2d3025\"/></picture></div></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Furthermore, PEPENODE ranks its miners on a leaderboard, which ultimately determines the rewards they receive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These rewards include free $PEPENODE, $PEPE, and $FARTCOIN tokens, all of which are strong and explosive meme coins in their own right. Here’s our step-by-step guide on how to buy PEPENODE for just $0.0011272 and stake it for a chunky 642% APY. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All you have to do is make sure your mining setup outperforms the rest, and then wait for the completion of PEPENODE’s TGE (Token Generation Event) – that’s when the rewards go live and are distributed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A $100 investment into PEPENODE today could turn into $700 by the end of 2026 – according to our PEPENODE price prediction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Join the biggest crypto mining revolution yet – grab your $PEPENODE tokens today!</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>3. Remittix ($RTX) – Unique PayFi Solution Bridging Crypto and Fiat</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>There’s a reason Remittix ($RTX) has been able to attract over $27.76M from investors in its ongoing presale.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After all, its mission is to transform the cross-border payments market by creating the perfect synergy between cryptocurrency and fiat.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Remittix allows you to send crypto directly to fiat-based bank accounts around the world. The receiving party gets the funds in fiat currency, completely unaware that the transaction originated as crypto.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By doing so, Remittix hits two targets with one arrow. It lets the receiver, who might be in a crypto-unfriendly region, safely receive fiat currency, while allowing the sender to comfortably pay using cryptocurrency.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On top of that, Remittix charges zero forex fees and offers same-day transaction processing, solving two of the biggest issues that plague the current banking system.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Buy $RTX today for just $0.1166 – and be part of a game-changing new cryptocurrency project.</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Recap</span></strong><span>: With hype-driven tokens proving remarkably resilient amid a broader market downturn, the future for emerging low-cap presale gems like </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Best Wallet Token ($BEST)</span></strong><span>, </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>PEPENODE ($PEPENODE)</span></strong><span>, and Remittix ($RTX) look overarchingly bright. </span></p><p class=\"\"><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: Invest in crypto only after doing your own research.
