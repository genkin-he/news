The Company would like to clarify that the MOU is non-binding, is for a term of 12 months beginning on September 23, 2025 but subject to mutually agreeable extensions, and that either party has the right to terminate the MOU upon 30 days' written notice. The primary purpose of the partnership is to allow Uniserve to integrate Railtown's AI frameworks, tools and solutions into Uniserve's offerings, thereby enabling Uniserve's internal sales team to promote and sell AI capabilities to Uniserve's customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Each of Railtown and Uniserve has certain defined obligations under the MOU, pursuant to which the parties have agreed to negotiate and execute separate commercial agreements, statements of work or service orders, as the case may be, in connection with, among other things, customer engagements, revenue sharing and pricing. Neither party is required to pay any fees to the other under the MOU, and Company and Uniserve are currently in the process of modelling their revenue sharing strategy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Railtown is capable of readily deploying its technologies to Uniserve's customers, and expects to conclude one or more definitive agreements with Uniserve in the coming months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>September 23, 2022 News Release</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In this news release, Railtown announced that it had entered into a service provider license agreement (the \"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>SPLA</span></strong><span>\") with Quisitive Technology Solutions Inc. (\"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Quisitive</span></strong><span>\") pursuant to which the Company agreed to provide a white-label version of its technology to Quisitive to be branded and sold as Velocity Insights. The Company would like to clarify that the SPLA was technically an interim agreement with a term of six (6) months and was intended to be superseded by a longer-term definitive license agreement that has yet to be negotiated. In addition, each party had the ability to terminate the SPLA prior to the completion of the term by providing 30 days' written notice to the other party, with certain support obligations of Railtown continuing for a transition period of four (4) months following the effective date of termination.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The SLPA required the Company to provide a license to the technology and related support services to Quisitive at no cost, and the primary purpose of the agreement was to confirm the viability of the technology for use and integration with Quisitive's products and services, and to test the technology with up to 10 customers of Quisitive. Despite the expiry of the SPLA and the acquisition of Quisitive by H.I.G. Capital in early 2025, the testing is ongoing and Quisitive continues to offer the technology to its customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Although Railtown has not generated any revenue from Quisitive or its customers to date, the Company anticipates entering into a revenue sharing agreement with Quisitive upon the adoption of any Quisitive technology that includes a version of the company's platform. In the meantime, the Velocity Insights product suite remains available for purchase on a stand-alone basis on Microsoft Marketplace.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>June 28, 2024 News Release</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In this news release, Railtown announced a strategic partnership with Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute (\"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Mila</span></strong><span>\"). The Company would like to clarify that, under the partnership agreement governing the relationship between the parties, Railtown paid Mila the sum of $10,000 plus applicable taxes - Mila's standard fee for new partners - in exchange for certain privileges typically provided to Mila's partners including having the Company's name or logo appear on Mila's website and certain promotional documents, and the ability to access and use certain of Mila's resources, including research, talent and intellectual property (such as, for example, Mila's expertise on advanced computing technologies, Mila's students for internship purposes, and a presence for Railtown in Mila's artificial intelligence \"hub\"). </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The partnership agreement was for a term of 12 months and automatically terminated on June 19, 2025; however, the Company continues to engage with Mila and anticipates partnering again with Mila in the future.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>July 23, 2024 News Release</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In this news release, the Company announce that it had entered into a co-development agreement with the Alberta Machine Learning Institute (\"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Amii</span></strong><span>\") pursuant to which the parties agreed to partner on a specific project and build related to Railtown's core technology. The Company would like to clarify that the relationship was governed by Amii's customary services contract and an accompanying statement of work (\"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>SOW</span></strong><span>\"), and that the term of the relationship was the longer of 14 months or one (1) month following the final day of employment of the Amii machine learning resident dedicated to the project (the \"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>ML Resident</span></strong><span>\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In consideration for the services of both Amii and the ML Resident under the program covered by the agreement and SOW, Railtown paid Amii an aggregate of $100,000 plus GST, being Amii's standard fee for programs of this nature. Although the Company no longer has access to Amii's resources following the automatic termination of the relationship in July 2025, the ML Resident was hired by Railtown following the completion of the program and is currently a full time employee.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>June 9, 2025 News Release</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In this news release, the Company announced a strategic partnership with ESGAI Technologies Inc. (\"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>ESGAI</span></strong><span>\") to co-develop an advanced suite of intelligent ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) software agents. The Company would like to clarify that the partnership is structured as a MOU between the parties that anticipates the execution and delivery of a formal license agreement (the \"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>License Agreement</span></strong><span>\") whereby ESGAI will license certain software technology owned and developed by Railtown in connection with the development of the agents.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The effective date of the MOU is June 6, 2025, and it automatically terminates upon the earlier of (a) the execution of the License Agreement, (b) the mutual written agreement of the parties, and (c) 180 days from the effective date. The Company complied with each of its obligations under the MOU; however, the parties were unable to negotiate the terms of the License Agreement prior to the automatic termination of the MOU on December 3, 2025, largely because such terms were predicated on ESGAI establishing a market for the agents first.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Regardless, Railtown remains committed to developing the ESG agent suite with ESGAI as circumstances allow. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>July 28, 2025 News Release</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In this news release, Railtown announced a strategic joint partnership with Braiyt AI Inc. (\"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Braiyt</span></strong><span>\") to deliver AI technologies to Dubai and the broader Middle East region. The Company would like to retract the overly promotional disclosure in the news release and confirm that the partnership is structured as a MOU between Braiyt, Railtown and AIP, pursuant to which Braiyt agreed, for a term of three years, to promote the products and services of each of the Company, AIP and any affiliates of AIP in the Middle East as opportunities arise. In exchange, Braiyt is entitled to enter into a finder's fee arrangement with the relevant selling party on terms to be negotiated between the parties.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>General</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In certain of Railtown's previously filed continuous disclosure documents, the Company has used phrases such as \"</span><em><span>selling its AI services and solutions</span></em><span>\" that the BCSC believes may potentially be misleading given the lack of revenue reflected in the Company's financial statements at the time. While the Company acknowledges that the language may have been less than perfect and that a phrase such as \"</span><em><span>the AI services and solutions are available for sale</span></em><span>\" may technically have been more accurate, the Company would like to clarify that it has in fact generated nominal (i.e., non-material) sales revenue from paying customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition, the BCSC has expressed its concern over the accuracy of phrases such as \"</span><em><span>the platform is fully trained on clients' applications</span></em><span>\" (from Railtown's news release dated December 6, 2023), and that the system \"</span><em><span>continually trains on a client's application</span></em><span>\" and \"</span><em><span>automates a wide range of tasks associated with the client's application</span></em><span>\" (from Railtown's management discussion and analysis for the period ended June 30, 2025), because the Company either had no customers or a limited number of customers at the relevant time. The Company would like to clarify that it was using the word \"client\" in a general sense in this disclosure - that is, as a substitute for \"user\" and not in relation to a specific customer - and that the language was intended to convey how the Company's technology works once a customer downloads and connects to the platform. More specifically, once a customer downloads the Company's Railtracks agentic framework and connects to Conductr, the platform runs on the customer's own cloud infrastructure or on the customer's local computers or servers, with the result that the AI agent is able to access to the customer's data stored in those locations and learn by ingesting the data in real time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Finally, Railtown would like to take this opportunity to confirm that the Company's primary focus for 2026 will be the building out of its Canadian agent development and deployment ecosystem with the Company's Canadian partners.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Railtown</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Railtown AI Technologies Inc. builds AI developer tools and agentic frameworks that power the next generation of intelligent applications. Its Platform - including real-time ingestion (Railengine), agent development frameworks (Railtracks ADK), and advanced observability (Conductr) - helps teams build, deploy, and operate AI agents with confidence and at scale.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For more information, visit </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/jNY0DHOLGV\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">www.railtown.ai</a><span>.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Follow us on social media</span></strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>LinkedIn: </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/vEzGBTojL1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/railtown-ai/</a><span> </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>SUBSCRIBE FOR INVESTOR NEWS</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/JkYOjC7OXn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a><span> to receive our latest investor news alerts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Cory Brandolini\" </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cory Brandolini, Chief Executive Officer</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>INVESTOR CONTACT</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rebecca Kerswell</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investor Relations Contact</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Email: investors@railtown.ai </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Phone: 1-604-417-4440</span></p><p class=\"\"><section class=\"variant-secondary-aHOVUrmQ disclaimer-fdvjGD1u\"><b class=\"heading-wrapper-aHOVUrmQ\"><span class=\"heading-aHOVUrmQ\">Disclaimer</span></b><div class=\"content-aHOVUrmQ link-with-underline-aHOVUrmQ\"><p class=\"\"><em><span>This news release contains forward-looking statements relating to the future operations of the Company and other statements that are not historical facts.

(\"Sable,\" or the \"Company\")</span><span> today announced its full year 2025 operational and financial results.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2025 Operational and Financial Highlights</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On May 19, 2025, we announced that (i) as of May 15, 2025, we had   restarted production at the Santa Ynez Unit and begun flowing oil   production to Las Flores Canyon and (ii) we completed our anomaly repair   program on Pipeline Segments 324 and 325 of the Santa Ynez Pipeline   System as specified by the Consent Decree. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On May 23, 2025, we closed an upsized underwritten public offering of   10,000,000 shares of Common Stock at a public offering price of $29.50   per share. The gross proceeds from the offering, before deducting   discounts and commissions and estimated expenses, were approximately   $295.0 million. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On May 28, 2025, we announced that we successfully completed hydrotests   of all segments of the Santa Ynez Pipeline System, satisfying the final   operational condition to resume petroleum transportation through Pipeline   Segments 324 and 325 as outlined in the Consent Decree. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>As an alternative to the Santa Ynez Pipeline System, we announced that   we are also pursuing an OS&amp;T strategy to provide access to domestic and   global markets via shuttle tankers for federal crude oil produced from   the Santa Ynez Unit in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf Area. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On November 10, 2025, we entered into subscription agreements to issue   45,454,546 shares of Common Stock in a private placement to institutional   investors at a purchase price of $5.50 per share, raising $250.0 million   in gross proceeds. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On November 24, 2025, we satisfied all conditions to effectiveness of   the Second Amendment to the Senior Secured Term Loan, thereby extending   the maturity date of the Senior Secured Term Loan to the earlier of (i)   March 31, 2027 or (ii) the date falling 90 days after first sales of   hydrocarbons. The Second Amendment increased the interest rate from ten   percent (10%) per annum to fifteen percent (15%) per annum, compounded   annually. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On December 17, 2025, PHMSA notified us that it concurred with our   determination that the Santa Ynez Pipeline System is an interstate   pipeline facility under the Pipeline Safety Act, pursuant to which PHMSA   is vested with exclusive regulatory authority over interstate pipelines.   In its notification, PHMSA additionally states that it considers the   Santa Ynez Pipeline System to be an \"active\" pipeline according to PHMSA   regulations. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On December 23, 2025, PHMSA issued an emergency special permit for   segments of the interstate Santa Ynez Pipeline System (specifically   Pipeline Segments 324 and 325), related to cathodic protection and seam   weld corrosion along Pipeline Segments 324 and 325. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>We reported a net loss of $410.2 million, primarily attributable to   production restart related operating expenses, general &amp; administrative   expenses, and non-cash interest expense, partially offset by a non-cash   change in fair value of warrant liabilities. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>We ended the year with short-term outstanding debt of $921.6 million,   inclusive of paid-in-kind interest, and a cash and cash equivalents   balance of $97.7 million. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>About Sable</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sable Offshore Corp. is an independent oil and gas company, headquartered in Houston, Texas, focused on responsibly developing the Santa Ynez Unit in federal waters offshore California.

When used in this press release, the words \"could,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"may,\" \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"continue,\" \"plan,\" \"forecast,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"future,\" \"outlook,\" and \"target,\" the negative of such terms and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward- looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements will contain such identifying words. These statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of Sable's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause Sable's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements include: the ability to recommence sales of oil from the Santa Ynez Unit assets, including the potential implementation of an Offshore Storage and Treating Vessel (\"OS&amp;T\") strategy, the cost and time required therefor, and production levels once recommenced; availability of future financing; global economic conditions and inflation; increased operating costs; lack of availability of drilling and production equipment, supplies, services and qualified personnel; geographical concentration of operations; environmental and weather risks; regulatory changes and uncertainties; litigation, complaints and/or adverse publicity; privacy and data protection laws, privacy or data breaches, or loss of data; our ability to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business; and other one-time events and other factors that can be found in Sable's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, and any subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K, which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are available on Sable's website (www.sableoffshore.com) and on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website (www.sec.gov).

Sable has not sold commercial quantities of hydrocarbons since acquisition of the Santa Ynez Unit. The Santa Ynez Unit was shut in during June of 2015 when the only onshore pipeline transporting hydrocarbons produced from the Santa Ynez Unit to market ceased transportation. Since the May 2025 production restart, the oil produced has been transported via pipeline to storage tanks onshore at Sable's Las Flores Canyon processing facility where it is being stored pending resumed petroleum transportation through the Santa Ynez Pipeline System or an OS&amp;T vessel. There can be no assurance that the necessary approvals will be obtained that would allow the Company to recommence sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260227076859/en/</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CONTACT:    Investor Contact:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Harrison Breaud</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vice President, Finance &amp; Investor Relations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>IR@sableoffshore.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>713-579-8111</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Hannah Erin Lang</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors have been betting for years that artificial intelligence would change everything. They got some proof of it this month — and then they started selling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq fell in February, each suffering its worst month since tariff turmoil started to crop up in markets last spring. Among the hardest-hit: software businesses, tech companies and the financial firms invested in, or threatened by, the rapid evolution of AI technology.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Those losses intensified Friday, as sliding bank and tech shares weighed on the Dow industrials and the S&amp;P 500. Bank stocks suffered their worst day since April, plagued by worries about AI and problems in the private-credit market. A hotter-than-expected wholesale inflation reading also dimmed hopes of another rate cut from the Federal Reserve.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.4% on Friday, or 0.9% over the course of the month. The Dow industrials fell 1.1% on Friday, shrinking monthly gains to 0.2%. The blue-chip benchmark is still on its longest monthly winning streak since 2018.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The main story is still tech and AI uncertainty,\" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird. \"It is making investors question the fundamental underpinning of the profitability of a lot of industries.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Those worries have triggered several nauseating stock swings in recent weeks, some with relatively innocuous catalysts — an incremental update to a particular AI tool, a 7,000-word hypothetical essay on Substack or a news release from a former karaoke company. On Friday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%, bringing its monthly losses to 3.4%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In each case, investors indiscriminately dumped shares in a style that was described again and again as \"sell first, ask questions later.\" The underlying concern: AI could soon upend the business models for companies from wealth management to trucking. Not even another strong earnings report from industry bellwether Nvidia was enough to quell the market jitters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"AI was considered this very large potential revenue source,\" said Adrian Helfert, chief investment officer at Dallas-based Westwood Holdings Group. \"Now it is considered to be a potential threat to corporate businesses.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Five weeks ago, after a Friday night glass of whiskey, Helfert sat down to try his hand at \"this vibe-coding thing,\" as the investor described it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By 4 a.m. the next morning, he had used AI to build a software program that could manage the logistics of his son's travel soccer team — previously an extracurricular activity that took up chunks of time on his nights and weekends. That same day, he sent a note to his investment team with one message: The AI revolution was probably coming a lot faster than anyone expected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When the \"SaS-pocalypse\" arrived a few weeks later — a massive selloff in software-as-a-service companies in early February that erased some $300 billion in market value — Helfert said he was less surprised than others.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The capability for building new tools and innovations is occurring at a much faster rate than we ever thought possible,\" Helfert said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The potentially disruptive impact of AI was evident again on Friday, after payments company Block — led by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey — said it would shed 40% of its staff in preparation for the AI age.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The large-cap tech trade has been losing steam since late last year, when investors first started to look beyond megacap market leaders such as Meta, Microsoft and Amazon in favor of a broader swath of blue-chip, small-cap and even international stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That kind of market broadening is often viewed as a bullish signal — but the rotation turned violent in February, with muted moves in broader indexes sometimes masking sharper moves beneath the surface.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the new AI narrative that has taken hold, the economy is still resilient — indicating that the idiosyncratic moves of the past few weeks could smooth out at some point, said Kevin Gordon, head of macro research and strategy at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The ex-tech market has been holding up relatively well,\" he said. \"That still suggests to me that we're in the middle of an uncomfortable rotation.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gordon pointed to the fact that investors haven't moved completely into risk-off mode: Stock sectors such as industrials and real estate, typically susceptible to ebbs and flows in economic growth, were among the S&amp;P 500's best-performing in February.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But traders are still flocking to some classic defensive plays. Gold futures rose roughly 11% in February, the biggest monthly increase for the precious metal since January 2012. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields dropped to 3.961% on Friday, their largest one-month decline in a year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As tech fears rattle U.S. markets, foreign markets have left domestic benchmarks in the dust. Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed 10% in February, while Korea's Kospi surged roughly 20%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And though he's skeptical of a doomsday scenario, Mayfield is hesitant to believe the new wave of AI anxiety will disappear soon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I don't think the market is going to get the clarity it wants, because it's not an easily answerable question and it's not one that can be answered in the near term,\" he said. \"This is more of an existential worry.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Hannah Erin Lang at hannaherin.lang@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

He also said a final decision on whether to attack Iran had not yet been made.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The president's \"sometimes you have to\" bombshell lit the fuse for oil on Friday, said Manish Raj, managing director at Velandera Energy Partners.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oil prices settled at their highest levels in about seven months Friday. U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery (CL.1) (CLJ26) finished at $67.02 a barrel, up 2.8% for the month, while global benchmark Brent crude for April delivery (BRNJ26), which expired at the end of Friday's session, tallied a monthly rise of 2.5%, to $72.48.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Prices rose on fears that this weekend could \"flip the switch from talk to tomahawk,\" said Raj. Traders are \"baking in a fat $10 risk premium,\" or the extra price per barrel of oil beyond \"fair value\" based on supply and demand dynamics. \"This is pure geopolitical nitro, leaving bulls high-fiving over the chokepoint drama,\" he noted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are several \"chokepoints\" to worry about when it comes to oil infrastructure and the flow of crude in and around Iran. The country has been among the world's biggest oil producers, with a 4% share of the world's oil output in 2023.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here's what matters in terms of the oil infrastructure in surrounding Iran.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran's \"last-resort weapon\" has always been a threatened closure of the Strait of Hormuz, according to a report this week from Oxford Analytica. The waterway is a crucial maritime passage for crude transport that connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Seas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From the archives: Strait of Hormuz, the world's biggest oil chokepoint, in focus as U.S.-Iran tensions flare</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A closure of the passageway might prove difficult, but significant disruption and heightened risks would have a major impact on regional trade as well as international oil prices, the Oxford Analytica report said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Iranians don't appear to be making concessions, so \"we should expect U.S. military action,\" said Matt Smith, U.S. head analyst at Kpler. There's a \"near 80% probability\" of some form of U.S. military action against Iran, he added - noting that Trump last week gave a deadline of 10 to 15 days to make a deal with Iran, leaving this weekend as a possibility for a U.S. strike.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's particularly important as Iran has ramped up exports in recent weeks, according to Smith. It's a signal that Iran is \"preparing for some type of military incursion and is trying to get out as much crude as possible ahead of such an event,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran's crude-oil exports climbed significantly in February from a month earlier, data from Kpler show.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last week, Iran exported 26 million barrels, according to Smith, who pointed out that it typically exports less than half that amount. This lifted February crude exports from Iran to the highest monthly pace since July 2018, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But it's not a U.S. strike on Iran itself that would be the key concern, said Velandera Energy's Raj.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The biggest \"oil-market nightmare\" would be Iran \"flipping the Strait of Hormuz switch,\" he told MarketWatch - disrupting maritime passage through the narrow chokepoint, which carries 20% of the world's global crude.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"One missile barrage, and we're staring at a $90 barrel moonshot and sending prices into orbit faster than a Texas wildcatter striking paydirt,\" said Raj.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet a weekend strike is far from guaranteed - especially after Badr Albusaidi, Oman's foreign minister, said \"significant progress\" was made during negotiations on Thursday, while signaling talks between the U.S. and Iran are set to continue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Trump's 'we'll see what happens' vibe screams 'keep negotiating or else,'\" Raj noted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Myra P.
