La Monica</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consumers may no longer have a hankering for burritos, chips, and guac, but they are apparently hungry for burgers, deep dish pizzas, and craft beer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>BJ's Restaurants, which owns a casual dining chain featuring a brewhouse menu, soared nearly 20% Friday after reporting earnings on Thursday that topped Wall Street's forecasts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Contrast that with Chipotle Mexican Grill, whose shares plunged nearly 20% Thursday due to a weaker-than-expected outlook. For some diners, Chipotle might look overpriced. BJ's, meanwhile, has a bargain offering helping it to attract more budget-conscious consumers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>BJ's touted the success of its Pizookie Meal Deal, which lets customers order one of eight entrees while also getting a deep-dish cookie (the namesake Pizookie) for $13. Analysts are optimistic the value offering will continue to bring in more customers, too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jefferies analyst Alexander Slagle said in a report Friday the Pizookie Meal Deal is showing encouraging momentum. Slagle added the deal also seems to be a hit across income and age groups. That's key at a time when persistent inflation is a concern for older and younger consumers regardless of how wealthy they are.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Slagle has a target of $50 on the stock, 47% higher than its current price. That makes him the most bullish analyst covering the shares. In fact, Wall Street is still skeptical that BJ's will be able to stand out in a crowded and competitive casual dining landscape. Slagle is one of only two analysts with a Buy recommendation on BJ's. Six rate it a Hold and one analyst dubs it an outright Sell.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But some of the skeptics are starting to succumb to the allure of the Pizookie. William Blair's Sharon Zackfia, who has a Market Perform rating (essentially a Hold) on the stock, said in a report Friday she was impressed \"traffic accelerated to 3.5% over the past six weeks, bucking the trends of the broader restaurant space on continued growth in the Pizookie Meal Deal.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Todd Brooks, an analyst with The Benchmark Company, also has a Buy rating for BJ's and said in a report the company has found success \"with a more digitally forward approach to brand marketing,\" including social media influencers and other word-of-mouth campaigns. Brooks has a $44 price target on the stock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And it looks like the Pizookie Meal Deal isn't the only bargain associated with BJ's. The stock is trading for less than 15 times 2026 earnings estimates, a discount to rivals such as Olive Garden owner Darden Restaurants, Texas Roadhouse, CAVA Group, and Wingstop — not to mention Chipotle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So who needs a quesadilla with beans and rice when you can have a burger and Pizookie instead? Shares of BJ's Restaurants could get a further boost from its signature value deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Paul R.

Seamus Mac Gorain, who heads rates at the $3.4 trillion fund, said the tide is changing after years of oversupply in government debt. With debt offices cutting back on longer maturities and central banks dialing down their balance-sheet roll-offs, the firm believes the recent decline in 30-year yields could run further. JPMorgan's positioning favors longer-dated British and Australian bonds, while also expecting Japan's yield curve to flatten as the long end outperforms. Mac Gorain noted that officials are proactively realigning supply, aware that investor appetite for long-term paper has thinned.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since early September, yields on 30-year Treasuries have dropped more than 30 basis points, with similar declines across major marketsU.K. gilts down 55 basis points and Japanese long yields off 30 basis points from their October peak. Behind the shift is a wave of coordinated policy moves: the U.K. and Japan have tilted issuance toward shorter maturities, the U.S. Treasury has restarted buybacks, and the Fed will halt its $5 billion-a-month Treasury runoff starting December 1. That slower pace of quantitative tightening, mirrored by the Bank of England and Bank of Canada, could be helping stabilize long-end sentiment. It helps that central banks are shifting away from QT now, Mac Gorain said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the U.S., easing bank capital rules and the Trump administration's push to advance stablecoins may further support Treasuries, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggesting the measures could lower yields by several dozen basis points. Yet, the broader backdrop still looks demandinggovernments are under pressure to fund defense and green projects, while pension funds are rotating into riskier assets to chase returns. Mac Gorain sees inflation as the main swing factor that could disrupt the trend but believes policymakers will intervene if long yields spike again. They're not going to stand idly by while you have very high long-term yields, he said.</span></p></span></div></div>",

But volatility picked up, and some big-name stocks got punished as investors questioned their earnings reports.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tech came close to spoiling the party as the industry signaled much more spending on artificial intelligence. Meta Platforms' margins dropped in the third quarter as it aggressively ramped up outlays, including on AI, sending its stock down 11% after reporting earnings. Microsoft also announced hefty capital investment plans for AI, pressuring its stock despite strong quarterly results.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon.com was a standout, bucking the downturn after beating estimates across all segments. Apple, spending less on AI, also soothed nerves with better-than-expected earnings and an aggressive growth forecast for the fourth quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A slowdown in AI-related spending will come, but the big spenders — Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle — say they're still planning double-digit percentage increases in the near term. They'll report their fourth quarters in late January and early February, providing a reprieve about bubble concerns at least until then.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If there is trouble ahead, it's \"probably more quarters than months\" away, says AllianceBernstein economist Eric Winograd.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tech companies aren't the only ones spooking the market. Chipotle Mexican Grill dropped 18% after cutting its full-year forecast for same-store sales. Also hit hard were health insurer Cigna and financial-technology company Fiserv, the latter losing more than 40% of its market value after issuing a drastically reduced outlook.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Part of the problem may simply be market fatigue after a stellar bull run. Steep expectations for earnings beats create a setup for disappointment if companies fall even slightly short.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even good deeds aren't going unpunished: Consumer discretionary companies' earnings have beaten expectations by 14% on average, but their stocks still dropped 2% the trading day after reporting, according to Evercore ISI. Energy is similarly under pressure, down 2% in October even though companies beat earnings estimates by 11% on average, according to Fundstrat.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another pressing risk is the Federal Reserve's plans for interest rate cuts. The rate of inflation, at around 3%, remains above the Fed's target. Chair Jerome Powell indicated in his Wednesday news conference that a December cut isn't a shoo-in, partly because of a lack of economic data during the government shutdown.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Powell emphasized that the Fed will operate cautiously. But the market would almost certainly slump if the Fed doesn't cut in December, leaving rates higher than expected next year and putting the economy at greater risk of a recession.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If we start seeing layoffs throughout the economy, that will signal a recession is possible, maybe even probable,\" says Winograd.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Expect modest gains for the rest of the year — or a selloff if the Fed doesn't come through in December. The S&amp;P 500 is trading 13% above its 200-day moving average, a technical sign that it's overextended. The market traded 9% above that average in early 2022 when it peaked — and then dropped 25% — as the Fed surprised the market with rate hikes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The market is entirely too complacent about downside risks,\" writes Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BTIG.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Jacob Sonenshine at jacob.sonenshine@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
