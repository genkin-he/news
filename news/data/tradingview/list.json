            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Brett Arends</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano sold his Fiserv shares for at least $500 million. The stock fell 44% on Wednesday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Frank Bisignano, in matching wardrobe, looks on as Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office in August.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The crisis swamping Fiserv should raise fresh questions about Donald Trump's Social Security commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who was running the payments company until just a few months ago.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fiserv's stock (FI) immediately collapsed by more than 40% early Wednesday as the company's new leaders shocked Wall Street with news of a plummeting financial outlook and past management errors and ended the day down 44%. CEO Mike Lyons, who took over from Bisignano in May, delivered before analysts and investors a brutal takedown of the Milwaukee-based company's failings under the leadership of the man now in charge of Social Security.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bisignano was the CEO of Fiserv for five years, from 2020 to this year, and chairman, as well, for the past three.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sales forecasts made in recent years \"would have been objectively difficult to achieve even with the right investment and strong execution,\" Lyons told analysts and investors Wednesday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Translation: Under Bisignano, the company made forecasts it could not plausibly have achieved.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Management made \"decisions to defer certain investments and cut certain costs [which] improved margins in the short term but are now limiting our ability to serve clients in a world-class way, execute product launches to our standards and grow revenue to our full potential.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Translation: Bisignano relied on short-term cost cutting, to the detriment of the company's long-term health.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And, in recent years, quarterly earnings results \"increasingly relied on short-term initiatives,\" said Lyons, who joined Fiserv as CEO-in-waiting in January from PNC, where he'd been president since 2024. Those initiatives, Lyons said, placed \"too much emphasis on pursuing in-quarter results as opposed to building long-term relationships by prioritizing business that both meets our clients' needs and comes with high recurring revenue.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Translation: Bisignano was chasing short-term quarterly results, not building the business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oh, and Lyons pointedly promised the Street that Fiserv was now \"on our way back to the highest standards.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Translation? You got it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's not unusual for a new boss to blame the old boss for lingering problems. But in the case of Firserv, the stock is now down 64% in 2025, and Lyons became CEO five months in. Something was obviously wrong at the company before he took over. The stock is changing hands for less today than what it was worth when Bisignano became CEO in 2000.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The revelations, especially on costs, may cause America's seniors some unease. Trump put Bisignano in charge of the Social Security Administration in May, tasking him with \"turning it around.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This guy's amazing,\" Trump said of Bisignano in August during an Oval Office press conference. \"It's sort of what he does. He takes troubled entities and turns them around.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The president added, \"He did some of the biggest messes in the world.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Those now nursing massive losses on Fiserv's stock may ruefully agree, although the president presumably meant listeners to understand Bisignano as having fixed messes rather than having created them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Don't miss: Social Security chief tapped to oversee another struggling agency: the IRS</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While investors and analysts will debate the current situation at Fiserv and may not agree on whom to blame, crises of this scale rarely come out of nowhere.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before leaving the company in May to join the administration, as recently as February, Bisignano was bragging to Wall Street investors about the company's stellar performance and its great outlook. The stock price back then was $230.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now? $70.60.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They say it's better to be lucky than to be smart, and cynics may now wonder which word is a better fit for Bisignano.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The latest: Fiserv attracted hot money ahead of 44% stock-price nosedive</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He didn't just get out of Fiserv before the collapse. He also sold all of his stock before the price plunged. And he was able to use a government loophole that has allowed him to avoid capital-gains tax on those stock sales, potentially forever.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lucky? Smart? You make the call.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Joining the administration legally required (or, a cynic might say, enabled) Bisignano - seconded just this month to a newly created CEO post at the IRS - to dump all of his stock quickly to comply with ethics rules and without alarming the Street.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As of Feb. 28 of this year, Bisignano owned in total 3,176,650 shares, according to securities filings. He sold between mid-May and early July, his government ethics filings show. During that time the price ranged between $157.57 and $177.36, according to MarketWach data. That means that Bisignano, a Trump campaign backer, sold the shares for at least $500 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Today, at a share price below $71, they'd be worth $225 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The difference (that is, the avoided loss of value): at least $275 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to the company's proxy statement, Bisignano also held nearly 400,000 \"unvested stock units,\" potentially worth up to $70 million more at the May and June stock prices, though it is unclear which, if any, he received before leaving the company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Government ethics filings don't show exactly how much appointees raise when they sell their stocks. Instead they give ranges. The filings show 22 separate transactions between May 16 and July 1, with a range of between $240 million and $610 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ordinarily when you sell stock for millions, let alone hundreds of millions, you are expected to pay capital-gains tax on the profits at a rate of up to 20% for long-term holdings (with short-term holdings taxed at ordinary marginal income-tax rates). A $500 million sale of long-term holdings would result in a tax bill of up to $100 million, depending on how much you paid for the stock in the first place.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But under a law signed by the first President George Bush, executives who join an administration and who are required to sell their stock to avoid conflicts of interest get a freebie. They can sell their stock and defer capital-gains tax, potentially forever, so long as they use the proceeds to invest in a diversified portfolio or buy Treasury securities. Section 1043 of the Internal Revenue Code makes perfect sense if you consider that the executive branch may want to recruit top leaders from business, and it will hardly help attract them if they are billed vast sums in needless capital-gains tax in order to join the government.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the rule also means that some people can sidestep huge tax bills with a job in the executive branch, even if they serve only briefly. Which means it is also wide open to exploitation by people who are either smart or lucky.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Social Security Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Brett Arends</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
