            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Shiba Inu’s effort to grow beyond being a meme coin is struggling. Its blockchain network, Shibarium, was created to bring real use and value to the project, but it has not gained much attention or activity. Developer interest and user engagement are very low, and the network’s overall growth has slowed down sharply.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Recent network issues, including technical troubles and security problems, have made things worse. Many users have left, and new projects are not joining. As a result, Shibarium now shows very little activity, leading many in the crypto community to call it a “ghost chain.” </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Shiba Inu’s Struggle To Evolve Beyond A Meme Coin</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shiba Inu tried to change its image from a simple meme coin into a real blockchain project capable of competing with other networks. The team launched Shibarium, a layer-2 blockchain, in 2023 to help make this move. However, this plan has not worked as expected, with Shibarium failing to attract developers, projects, or users and gaining no market share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to data from DeFi Llama, Shibarium has only 18 developers since it began. It is a much lower number than on other blockchains, which have hundreds or even thousands of active developers. The total value locked (TVL) on the network, which shows how much money people have invested in it, has fallen to just $878,000. </span></p><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1200px;aspect-ratio:2\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:0dcb0a1bb094b-d353c469c7b47cba865c3003b77d83d8-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Shiba Inu Shibarium\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:0dcb0a1bb094b-d353c469c7b47cba865c3003b77d83d8-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#12161a\"/></picture></div></figure></span><p class=\"\"><span>Shibarium has also failed to attract any stablecoins, which are among the most widely used tokens in decentralized finance. Not a single stablecoin project has deployed on the network, reflecting Shibarium’s lack of presence in one of the most critical areas of the crypto world. Other newer and more active layer-2 networks like Base, Arbitrum, Plasma, and Linea have already moved far ahead, leaving Shibarium behind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Hacks And The Decline Of Shibarium Network Activity</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Things got worse for the network when ShibaSwap, the most popular decentralized app (dApp) on the Shibarium network, was recently compromised. The attack eroded user confidence and forced developers to pause a key bridge connecting Shibarium to other networks. Even with the bridge now active, most of the network’s activity stopped. Many users could not move their tokens or use apps, making the network almost entirely silent.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Because of this drop in network activity, Shibarium is no longer helping burn SHIB tokens. Typically, a portion of network transaction fees goes toward buying and burning Shiba Inu tokens, helping reduce supply and support the token’s price. But now, with very few transactions, the burn process has slowed down significantly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The decline in users, developers, and activity are indicators that Shibarium’s dream of becoming a strong, useful blockchain has not come to fruition. Instead of growing into a central crypto platform, it has become what some would call the real ghost chain. </span></p></span></div></div>",

The CFO noted that beef prices have been at all-time highs, with year-to-date prices up in the high teens versus last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are a number of reasons for this. U.S. cattle and calves inventory has been at historically low levels, according to data from the U.S. Agriculture Department - fueled by factors such as drought, labor shortages and rising costs for land and feed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a result, beef prices have skyrocketed: The U.S. city average retail price for a pound of 100% ground beef was $6.32 in August and September, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics - the highest level on record, based on available data going back to 1984. September's price was also 11.5% higher than the price in September 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Companies have been taking action to tackle the rise in beef prices. Hormel, which is best known as the parent of the Spam and Planters brands, recently cut its profit outlook amid higher-than-expected costs for meat, as well as nuts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shake Shack, which reported third-quarter results Thursday, increased its \"In Shack\" menu price by approximately 2% during the quarter to help offset cost pressures from the beef market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is not just the U.S. where beef costs are rising. When McDonald's recently reported its third-quarter results, Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski noted that beef prices are up around 20% in Europe, primarily as a result of a supply issue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But there could be some light at the end of the tunnel, as Restaurant Brands believes the impact of beef prices on its overall costs is temporary.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The increase is largely tied to the cyclical nature of U.S. herd rebuilding, and we're optimistic prices will normalize over time,\" said Siddiqui. \"In fact, you've already seen cattle futures come down in the last week or so, and we continue to monitor movements in that market.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cattle futures (LC00) (FC00) were recently knocked from their record highs amid the Trump administration's plan to tackle beef prices, which includes importing more beef from Argentina to the U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There's been optimism around some trade deals. Whether it's been with Argentina, whether it's been with Mexico, whether it's been with Brazil, we're sensing more optimism that there could be some relief on beef costs,\" said Siddiqui. The CFO also described the beef-related margin pressures on Burger King in the U.S. as \"short term.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While a challenge for the companies involved, investors are clearly shrugging off the impact of beef prices. Restaurant Brands shares were up 2.3% Thursday, lifted by the company's better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings, as well as comparable sales that topped the FactSet analyst consensus estimate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shares of Shake Shack, which also topped analysts' expectations for revenue, adjusted earnings and comparable sales, were up 1.6%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>McDonald's shares were down 0.2%, while Hormel's stock was down 0.7%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Myra Saefong, Victor Reklaitis, and Steve Gelsi contributed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-James Rogers</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

NASA tapped SpaceX in 2021 to use Starship for the first two Artemis     moon landing missions    , with Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin later winning an award for other Artemis missions.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     But the U.S. space agency this year has been entangled in political chaos over concerns that its moon landing contractors are not moving quickly enough, the Trump administration's plans to reduce the agency's workforce and NASA's vacancy of a permanent administrator.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     That role is currently held on     a temporary basis by Sean Duffy    , also head of the Transportation Department. Last week, Duffy said in TV remarks that SpaceX was lagging in Starship development and that the agency would     open up the company's Artemis contract     to rival companies who can pitch a faster plan to land humans on the lunar surface.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     SpaceX, in its blog post, said it has accomplished dozens of milestones associated with its Starship moon lander contract and that it plans to execute key future milestones next year, including a long-duration flight test.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     SpaceX has launched 11 Starship tests so far in its test-to-failure development campaign.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     Another key milestone SpaceX expects in 2026 is executing a complex in-space refueling demonstration, a tricky process that has never been done before but is required for Starship to have enough fuel to reach the lunar surface. Multiple Starship \"tanker\" flights will take place to fill up the moon-bound Starship in space, per the architecture.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     NASA had been expecting such a demonstration to occur as early as 2024, but SpaceX's whirlwind development and test-launches of Starship have hit snags. Later this year or early next year, the company plans to begin launching an upgraded Starship prototype outfitted with features designed for in-space refueling.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     SpaceX said the timing of the in-space refueling test \"will be driven by how upcoming flight tests debuting the new Starship V3 architecture progress, but both of these tests are targeted to take place in 2026.\"  </span></p></span></div></div>",

Today we highlight a trio of potential new methods for treating or preventing dangerous antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and viruses, including one in which viruses are used against deadly bacteria. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Viruses may help treat deadly bacterial infections</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tiny viruses that only infect and kill bacteria can help treat deadly antibiotic-resistant bloodstream infections with Staphylococcus aureus, results from a mid-stage trial suggest.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Researchers tested the approach in 42 patients with S. aureus bacteremia that had spread from the blood into the tissues, which they called “one of the most serious and difficult-to-treat bacterial infections.”  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Two-thirds were treated intravenously with a “cocktail” of such viruses, known as bacteriophages, being developed by Armata Pharmaceuticals </span><span>. The others received a placebo. Everyone in the trial also received the best available antibiotic therapy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At multiple time points, patients receiving the bacteriophage cocktail along with antibiotics had higher clinical success than those receiving only the antibiotics.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At day 12, for example, response rates were 88% with the virus treatment and 58% for the placebo group. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The treatment group also had lower non-response and relapse rates, shorter times to negative blood culture and to resolution of signs and symptoms, and less time in the intensive care unit and in the hospital, the researchers reported at a meeting of infectious disease doctors in Atlanta known as IDWeek 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“These findings provide strong rationale for a Phase 3 study and signal a potential paradigm shift in how we treat antibiotic-resistant infections,” study leader Dr. Loren Miller of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center said in a statement. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“High-purity, phage-based therapeutics like (this one) may one day become a new standard of care for patients facing this life-threatening condition.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>New paths for fighting yellow fever and tick-borne viruses</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Experimental decoy molecules may be able to keep two types of deadly viruses from infecting human cells, researchers reported in two separate papers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Their discovery of how these viruses enter cells, and the subsequent development of the decoys, potentially sets the stage for new strategies to prevent and treat tick-borne encephalitis viruses, which infect the central nervous system, and the yellow fever virus, which in severe cases can cause liver failure, bleeding, and shock, the researchers said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“There are no treatments for these viral infections, so there is an urgent need for new strategies to prevent and treat these infections, which continue to cause severe disease and death in far too many cases,” Dr. Michael Diamond of WashU Medicine in St. Louis, the senior author of both papers, said in a statement. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The researchers used genetic techniques, including CRISPR gene editing technology, to determine that the viruses use a family of proteins on human cell surfaces called low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) as their main route of entry. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These proteins were already known to be entry routes for other types of viruses. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The yellow fever virus latches onto LDLRs called LRP1, LRP4 and VLDLR, the researchers reported in Nature. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tick-borne encephalitis viruses enter cells via a different receptor, LRP8, they reported in PNAS. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Removing these receptor proteins from the surfaces of cells blocked the viruses from infecting those cells, the researchers said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For both types of viruses, the researchers also designed “decoy” molecules. Carrying a small piece of the entry-receptor proteins, the decoys trick the viruses into latching on, thereby protecting cells from infection. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The decoy molecules prevented infection in human and mouse cells in test tubes. In mice, the decoys protected against a lethal dose of yellow fever virus and also prevented the liver damage typically caused by the virus. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“Our studies showing how these viruses get into cells creates opportunities to disrupt those routes, stopping viral infections from jumping animal species — both wild and domesticated — and spreading through populations of people,” Diamond said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Working toward prevention of antibiotic-resistant biofilms</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A new discovery shows how Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria manage to colonize into hard-to-destroy communities, a finding that may help pave the way to new treatments, researchers say.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pseudomonas bacteria are notorious for their ability to form antibiotic-resistant biofilms that protect them from environmental stresses and help them survive for long periods. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The World Health Organization lists Pseudomonas among the antibiotic-resistant bacteria presenting the biggest threat to human health. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The new study revealed that each Pseudomonas bacterium detects and binds to specific sugars left behind by others from its species that arrived earlier. The bacterium senses these sugar trails using proteins on its body and identifies the sugars using hairlike appendages called pili, according to a report in Nature Microbiology. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All of this information is translated into chemical signals inside the cell that guide the operation of other bacterial machinery, such as the controlled secretion of more sugars to make biofilms, the researchers said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“People have thought of pili mostly as appendages for moving around. It turns out they also act as sensors that translate force into chemical signals within bacteria, which they use to identify sugars,” senior author Gerard Wong of UCLA said in a statement. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“We’re seeing how sensory information is encoded in bacteria by their appendages for the first time.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The researchers say they can envision building on these results to influence the bacteria’s behavior. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“We might be able to turn the cells into more antibiotic-susceptible versions of themselves that are easier to treat,” study co-leader William Schmidt of UCLA said in a statement. </span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jurica Dujmovic</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Everyone's asking the wrong question about an AI bubble. Here are the stocks to buy - and when.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This isn't the dot-com collapse all over again. It's far more interesting and far more profitable if you know where to look.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I've been watching the AI bubble inflate for months now - the unsustainable burn rates, the pilot projects that went nowhere, the startups that couldn't explain their unit economics. So when industry insiders finally started ringing alarm bells, I couldn't resist diving deeper into what's really happening.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What I found surprised me. Yes, there's an AI bubble. But the viral claim that it's 17-times larger than the dot-com crash is misleading. MacroStrategy Partnership's headline-grabbing analysis measured total capital misallocation across all asset classes, not AI specifically. It seems to me that the math behind the analysis was designed to terrify, not inform.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>More importantly, everyone's asking the wrong question.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The debate shouldn't be whether the AI bubble will pop - that's already happening. Not in some dramatic, market-crushing way that will dominate headlines, but through a slow-motion deflation that's quietly reshaping the entire landscape. The casualties are already piling up: startup shutdowns surged in 2024; in 2025, 95% of enterprise AI pilots failed to deliver measurable P&amp;L impact within six months of launch; and down rounds this year hit a decade high at 15.9% of all venture deals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many companies that scream the loudest about the bubble are either exaggerating the threat or fundamentally misunderstanding what's actually unfolding. This isn't the 2000 dot-com collapse all over again. It's far more interesting and far more profitable if you know where to look. I've identified three distinct market tiers facing radically different fates:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tier 1: The hyperscalers (Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), Amazon.com (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL)) are essentially unassailable. Their estimated $320 billion to $340 billion in 2025 capex spending - largely for AI and cloud infrastructure - comes from operating cash flow generated by their core businesses. They can weather extended periods of disappointing AI returns because their core businesses print money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tier 2: The unicorns in limbo (OpenAI, Anthropic, Scale AI) command massive valuations but face existential questions. Can they achieve returns that justify stratospheric valuations? Can they compete against both hyperscalers with infinite resources and substantially cheaper models coming in from overseas? The next 18 to 24 months will separate the winners and losers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tier 3: Mass casualties are showing up in the numbers. We're seeing more shutdowns (up 26% year over year in 2024), decade-high down rounds in 2025, thinner deal counts and smaller checks, plus enterprises scrapping a big chunk of AI work and failing to get a return on investment (ROI) from pilots.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Expectations are being managed to engineer an orderly deflation rather than a violent crash that could seriously harm AI's credibility for years to come.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When Sam Altman openly admits that investors as a whole are overexcited about AI at the same time his OpenAI reaches a valuation of $500 billion, he's not confessing failure - he's managing expectations to engineer an orderly deflation, rather than a violent crash that could seriously harm AI's credibility for years to come.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This creates a rare market asymmetry: The public sees \"bubble\" and flees everything AI-related, while sophisticated capital is making precise bets on deflation survivors. Here are three investment strategies to put you on the winning side of any correction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1. Buy Tier 1 hyperscalers after the 15% to 20% correction</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When the next correction hits the hyperscalers, treat it as an entry window, not a reason to flee.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Microsoft: Microsoft's AI business is already at a $13 billion annual run rate, up 175% year over year, but most of its money still comes from core products including Azure, Office and Windows. With about $72 billion in annual free cash flow, Microsoft can easily fund its AI buildout without stretching its balance sheet. A pullback in the stock to $400 to $420 would bring the valuation back to around 30-times earnings - right at historical norms and a strong long-term entry point.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon.com: Amazon's cloud unit Amazon Web Services (AWS) is growing about 17.5% year over year, hitting a $123 billion annual run rate. The bulk of Amazon's revenue still comes from retail and e-commerce, giving the company the cash flow and scale to invest heavily in AI infrastructure without jeopardizing its core business. If the shares pulled back 15%, the valuation would drop into the 27- to 30-times-earnings range, offering a potentially compelling entry point.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alphabet: Internet-search advertising still accounts for roughly 56% of revenue, and for the second quarter of 2025, the company posted an operating margin of 32.4%. Estimated capital expenditures for 2025 are roughly $85?billion, much of which is going into AI and data-center infrastructure, yet Alphabet maintains a strong balance sheet to absorb variable returns. A correction of 15% to 20% would lower the valuation to about 22- to 23-times earnings, potentially offering the best entry within the hyperscaler group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DeepSeek's January 2025 reveal triggered a brief panic across AI stocks; hyperscalers slipped 2% to 5%, while AI chip and infrastructure names plunged 15% to 30% before rebounding within days. The takeaway for investors is clear: When the next 15% to 20% correction hits the hyperscalers, treat it as an entry window, not a reason to flee - the long-term infrastructure buildout remains intact.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read: Believe the hype: AI is coming for your job. Plan now.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2. Invest in data centers before power constraints are a given</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Data-center REITs provide diversified exposure without taking single-name AI risk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gartner's November 2024 forecast warns that 40% of AI data centers could face power-availability constraints by 2027, underscoring the physical limits of AI expansion. The firm projects that AI computing workloads alone could consume around 500 terawatt-hours of electricity annually by 2027 - more than two-and-a-half times the 195 TWh used in 2023.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dominion Energy (D) is ground zero for the AI power crunch. In Virginia - the world's most populous area for data centers - data-center capacity demand has nearly doubled in just five months, jumping from 21 gigawatts under contract to more than 40. These servers already consume a quarter of the state's electricity, and Dominion expects demand to double again by 2039.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To keep up, Dominion is spending $50 billion over the next five years on new electric-transmission projects and infrastructure upgrades -including an offshore wind project, a solar and battery storage project, and five small modular reactors planned for the 2030s. The stock throws off a 4% to 5% dividend yield, but what really matters is positioning: Dominion isn't just a utility anymore - it's becoming the backbone of the AI era's grid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vistra (VST): Vistra signed a 20-year deal to supply 1,200 megawatts (MW) of nuclear power from its Comanche Peak facility to an investment-grade buyer. It's also adding 860 MW of new gas capacity at its Permian Basin site (boosting it to 1,185 MW) and has outlined up to 2,000 MW of Texas gas additions by 2028 to meet surging data-center and industrial load.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition, data-center REITs provide diversified exposure without taking single-name AI risk. These include:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Digital Realty Trust (DLR): Operates more than 300 data centers globally and has a long record of annual dividend increases. The stock's current dividend yield runs close to 3%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Equinix (EQIX) operates more than 270 data centers serving in excess of 10,000 customers. Last year, the company marked 85 consecutive quarters of top-line growth and said announced projects were more than 85% leased and preleased as of the first quarter of 2025, underscoring demand from hyperscalers and large enterprises.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vertiv (VRT): Nvidia (NVDA) last year partnered with Vertiv for AI data-center builds, and Vertiv's stock has soared. The company's valuation is high, but the stock is riding a market that Goldman Sachs sees jumping to $10.6 billion next year, from $4.1 billion in 2023, as liquid cooling reaches 57% of AI servers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Schneider Electric (FR:SU) (SBGSY): This French multinational is a steadier way to play the data-center theme, with a 24% exposure to data-center end markets and 25% fourth-quarter growth in North American energy management on surging AI demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Conservative investors should build positions in companies poised to profit from the coming power crunch. As AI data centers push grid capacity to its limits, these firms stand to benefit from the multiyear investment cycle required to expand power generation, cooling and infrastructure. With the 2027 constraint window approaching, the next year offers a favorable entry period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>3. Buy what the market has mispriced</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The stock market is committing a cardinal error: indiscriminately punishing profitable companies with documented ROI along with speculative AI startups with no path to profitability. This creates two distinct opportunities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>First, look at companies that solve unglamorous back-office problems through automation. These include:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>UiPath (PATH): UiPath boasts 83% gross margins and its solid client base includes giants such as Orange Spain (FR:ORA) (ORANY) and Travis Perkins (UK:TPK) (TPRKY), yet the stock trades at about four-times sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>BlackLine (BL): Third-party studies show triple-digit ROI from BlackLine's close automation - 234% ROI at Creditsafe (12.4-month payback) and 379% ROI at Red Wing (Nucleus Research). BlackLine returned to GAAP profitability in 2024 and authorized a $200 million share repurchase (later increased by another $200 million).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Waystar (WAY): This platform processes more than $6 billion in healthcare payment transactions a year, reaching 50% of U.S. patients. With 42% margins, you'd expect a richer valuation, but Waystar trades at about seven-times sales - a far cry from bubble territory.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Next, look at the enterprise SaaS (software-as-a-service) leaders where AI genuinely enhances products, rather than cannibalizing core businesses:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Atlassian (TEAM): Atlassian's growth remains solid - fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter revenue rose 22% year over year to $1.38 billion - and the company is leaning into AI as a core pillar. Its centerpiece is Atlassian Rovo, an AI \"teammate\" introduced in May 2024 that layers search, chat and AI agents across Jira, Confluence and other tools to help teams find information, summarize work and automate workflows. With a base of more than 300,000 customers, deeply embedded products (Jira, Confluence) and a potent AI layer, Atlassian is one of the purer enterprise SaaS AI plays.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DocuSign (DOCU): Shares of DocuSign tumbled at the end of September after headlines framed OpenAI's new \"DocuGPT\" as a competitive threat. In reality, DocuGPT was presented as an internal OpenAI agent that converts contracts into structured, searchable data - not an e-signature platform or commercial DocuSign replacement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The selloff overlooked DocuSign's real strength: its entrenched legal-compliance infrastructure, enterprise integrations and a growing Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) platform that uses AI to analyze and manage contracts end to end. These capabilities are deeply embedded across regulated industries and supported by the company's roughly $900 million in annual free cash flow, allowing continued investment and share repurchases. With AI enhancing - not replacing - its core workflow moat, DocuSign remains one of the most undervalued enterprise automation plays amid AI-driven market confusion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adobe (ADBE): Adobe reported $6 billion in revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, up roughly 11% year over year, with non-GAAP EPS of $5.31. The company also noted that its AI-influenced annual recurring revenue surpassed $5 billion, and its generative-AI-model family (Adobe Firefly) has already produced more than 24 billion pieces of content. Despite this, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of just 21 - well below its historical 10-year average of 50.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The thesis is brutally simple: These companies boast loyal users, documented time- and cost-savings tools, and deep integration that customers keep paying for regardless of headline volatility. They aren't betting on the farm on AI; they're using it to widen existing competitive moats and improve unit economics.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Your bubble-management playbook</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>42% of companies abandoned AI initiatives in 2025, up from 17% in 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The timeline for maximum disruption in AI runs from the beginning of 2026 until the third quarter of 2027. This is the point when both the AI pilot launches that haven't produced a return on investment and the 2021-2023 AI startups run out of capital. S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence reports that 42% of companies abandoned AI initiatives in 2025, up from 17% in 2024, with the average organization scrapping 46% of AI proof of concepts before production.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This creates the framework for a slow-motion AI-bubble deflation, rather than a catastrophic burst:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Tier 1 hyperscalers with diversified revenue will weather disappointing AI returns.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Tier 2 unicorns face valuation compression or acquisition.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Tier 3 experiences mass casualties, with a small cohort of survivors demonstrating actual unit economics.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>The three plays outlined above position investors for this selective deflation: buying Tier 1 quality on 15% to 20% corrections; positioning in data-center infrastructure ahead of verified 2027 constraints; and accumulating profitable companies - whether routine automation or mispriced SaaS - being unfairly sold off alongside failing startups.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The AI bubble is deflating on schedule - but the infrastructure buildout and automation revolution remain genuine opportunities for investors who can distinguish between speculative AI startups burning cash and profitable enterprises solving real problems with measurable returns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>More: These stocks are the real deal for investors in AI - Wall Street is just chasing bubbles</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Also read: Here's one question about the AI bubble that even ChatGPT can't answer</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Jurica Dujmovic</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

For now, investors want to know what it could mean for defense stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The short answer is not much — though they might want to brush up on America's nuclear capabilities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For starters, America and Russia have the largest nuclear stockpiles with an estimated 5,400 and 5,300 warheads, respectively, according to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. China is number three at 600 warheads, and six more countries have nuclear weapons.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the U.S., government agencies design and build nuclear warheads.
