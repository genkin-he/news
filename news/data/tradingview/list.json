The Chinese automaker finished 2025 with vehicle sales of 1.3 million units, up 7% on year, but underperformed China's passenger vehicle growth of 9%, he says. The company's vehicle margin faces challenges as competition is leading to heavy price discounts, he says. Morningstar maintains a cautious view on the company's profitability and expect depressed vehicle margins to remain, given the competition in the domestic market, he adds. The vehicle volume growth will continue to underperform due to a lack of new model launches. That said, Geely remains Morningstar's top pick in the China auto sector on its long-term value.(jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy_jiahuihuang)</span></p></span></div></div>",

Demand from international investors to hedge their U.S. assets against the risk of a dollar decline still \"plays a significant role,\" says BNY's Bob Savage in a note. U.S. producer price data for January will be watched at 1330 GMT. The DXY dollar index falls 0.2% to 97.63, although it remains within its recent tight trading range.

(NIO) shares slipped about 2% in Hong Kong trading as the EV maker outlined plans for a third-generation entry SUV by 2027, even as demand weakens for some of its current models.</span></p><p class=\"\"><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://stocktwits.com/symbol/NIO\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.-listed shares of Nio</a><span> declined for a second straight session on Thursday, falling nearly 2% to $5.09.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Third-Gen Entry SUV In Focus</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nio’s co-founder and President Qin Lihong said the company is preparing to launch the third generation of its entry-level SUV in the third quarter of 2027, according to a report by EV.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After weaker-than-expected sedan demand through 2024 and 2025, Nio is leaning more heavily into SUVs. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Currently, the entry lineup includes the ET5 sedan, ET5 Touring wagon, and the ES6 and EC6 SUVs. Lihong said the revamped ES6 is expected to become a core model in the new generation, citing its broad appeal as a mid-size SUV. He also noted that some customers prefer smaller vehicles, with feedback suggesting the flagship ES8 may feel too large for certain buyers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, a new five-seat ES7 is expected in the third quarter, while a larger ES9 that will replace the ES8 as flagship is set to debut in April with deliveries beginning June 1.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Softening Demand Hits ES6, ET9 Sales</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The refresh comes as demand for some existing models has softened. ES6 deliveries fell to 982 units last month out of Nio’s total 27,186 deliveries, marking the model’s lowest result in more than a year. The ET9 sedan also recorded its weakest monthly sales since launch in January.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lihong had previously acknowledged that recently updated models had not met expectations in the short term.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>ES8 Anchors Premium Segment</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In contrast, the flagship ES8 continues to see strong demand. Nio is nearing delivery of its 70,000th third-generation ES8 less than a month after crossing 60,000 units in early February. The SUV has become a key contributor to deliveries and profitability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since deliveries began in September 2025, the ES8 reached 10,000 deliveries in just 41 days and crossed 40,000 units within 100 days, making it the fastest model priced above 400,000 yuan to hit that milestone across all energy types. It has now surpassed 70,000 deliveries despite the Spring Festival holiday period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Demand has remained steady despite a new shortage of signal-processing chips affecting the audio system. Units entering final assembly from March 2 will use a temporary workaround that keeps core functions intact but removes a sound mode.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wait times have shortened from eight to nine weeks to six to seven weeks, suggesting stable demand. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Strong ES8 performance has supported expectations of a potential first-ever quarterly profit in the fourth quarter of 2025. Alongside vehicle demand, Nio’s battery swap ecosystem continues to expand. During the 2026 Spring Festival travel period, the company completed more than 2 million battery swaps across its network.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Nio Partners With Bosch On Smart EV Tech</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Separately, Nio announced a strategic partnership with Germany’s Bosch Group during Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s recent visit to China. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The collaboration will cover all three of Nio’s brands, including Nio, Onvo and Firefly, and focus on core smart EV technologies, including steer-by-wire chassis, battery management systems, powertrain systems, and autonomous driving perception modules.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>How Did Stocktwits Users React?</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Stocktwits, retail sentiment for NIO was ‘bullish’ amid ‘high’ message volume.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One user </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://stocktwits.com/stanikol/message/646069211\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">said</a><span> Nio “has the best EVs EVER made!

Sell and leave if you don’t believe in Nio.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>https://stocktwits.com/stanikol/message/646069211</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another user said, “March 10 will be $10. Buy now. Happy days are just a few days away,” referring to the EV maker’s upcoming fourth-quarter results.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>https://stocktwits.com/NIOconversationArp2023/message/646063146</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S.-listed shares of Nio have declined 0.2% year-to-date.</span></p></span></div></div>",
