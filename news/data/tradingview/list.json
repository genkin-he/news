Although volumes for tropical oils could rise on year in 4Q, Nomura expects crush margins to weaken, which could impact profitability.

Both, the company says, are pure fiction. It has publicly clarified that Tendulkar has no association with RRP and no land allotment has been received.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another narrative suggested government-linked chip orders under Indiaâs semiconductor mission and exports worth Rs 6.15 crore. That too has been shot down. In a rare admission, the company conceded that its fundamentals do not justify a rise from Rs 10 to near Rs 10,000 a share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adding to the drama, nearly 99 percent of the stock is locked up until March 31, 2026 â leaving just about four thousand shares actually available for trading. The wafer-thin float has created a playground ripe for speculation, and the company alleges âunethicalâ manipulation is at work. Legal action is being initiated against those spreading falsehoods and exploiting both the companyâs name and Tendulkarâs reputation, the company added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Quiet Corner Office, Now a Headline Name</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>RRP Semiconductor operates out of an unassuming industrial address in Navi Mumbai. According to its annual report, Chodankar was appointed a non-executive additional director and had extended up to Rs 8 crore in loans to the firm in FY25 at eight percent interest.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In May 2024, shareholders cleared a plan to issue over one crore shares to him at Rs 12 each â effectively handing him 74.5 percent of the expanded equity. Of this, Rs 6 crore was adjusted against existing loans, with the remainder paid in cash. That low-cost allotment has since turned into one of the most sensational paper gains the Indian market has ever seen.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From Niche Trader to Chip Dreamer</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Until recently, the company was known as G D Trading &amp; Agencies, modestly dealing in electronic components. But with Indiaâs semiconductor ambitions gathering pace, the firm rebranded and reset its mission to ride the national chip wave. Its filings cite the countryâs surging electronics demand, policy support and production-linked incentives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, it openly acknowledges the realities of the semiconductor business â volatile supply chains, global tensions, rapid tech cycles and significant research and development costs that have tripped even global titans.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Strip away the stock-market spectacle and the numbers tell a calmer story. Revenue jumped to Rs 31.6 crore in FY25 from Rs 38 lakh a year earlier, while net profit swung to Rs 8.47 crore from a minor loss of Rs 1.7 lakh. But momentum has wavered: the June 2025 quarter recorded no revenue at all, compared with Rs 6 crore in the March period, though losses narrowed to Rs 29 lakh from Rs 1.6 crore.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The temporary suspension of underground operations at Freeport Indonesia following the mid-2025 landslide has disrupted gold supply in Indonesia, the analyst notes. Freeport Indonesia has an agreement to supply gold to Aneka Tambang. However, the underground operations are expected to resume in 2H 2026, says the analyst, who expects Aneka Tambamg's gold sales volumes to recover then. The brokerage maintains its buy rating on Aneka Tambang, citing the company's gold proxy positioning, upside from persistently high gold prices and solid long-term outlook.
