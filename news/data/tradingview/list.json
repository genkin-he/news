However, it also offers the potential for high rewards if the asset gains traction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, rather than adopting XRP, Tom Zschach, Chief Innovation Officer at Swift, threw a jab at the coin. He compared using a private token as a \"bridge currency\" to using a fax machine and calling it the internet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Regardless, XRP has continued to gain traction, especially amid recent institutional interest and acceptance on the exchange-traded fund (ETF) market.</span></p></span></div></div>",
