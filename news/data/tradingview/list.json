Since that time, the company has verified gold assay data relating to historical drilling (see press release dated October 22st, 2025) and has identified numerous gold prospects located within the property and proximal to old gold mine workings.

The mineralized zone consists of a series of high-grade lenses developed within a broad zone of lower grade material measuring 80 m X 3m X 100 m and dipping north-east at an estimated 60 degrees. The zone has been intersected by at least 46 drill holes during three drilling campaigns by previous workers (Trueclaim Exploration Inc. between 2009 - 2011; Northern Sphere Mining, 2017; and MacDonald Mines Exploration Ltd, 2019 - 2025).

A minimum of 15 holes within the zone are planned for this phase, all designed to provide fill-in information for areas not previously tested by drilling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Two additional near surface zones of gold mineralization are currently recognized in close proximity to Zone 1, and will be tested by drilling after the current program is completed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This drilling program is designed to provide infill data around two closely related gold zones which have previously been identified and confirmed beside the historical North Pit gold mine workings.

This will feed into the</span><br/><span>pre-feasibility study, which is planned as a joint study for Madsen</span><br/><span>and Rowan.

Zoom’s federated architecture expands to include NVIDIA Nemotron open technologies to support AI Companion 3.0 across industries such as finance, healthcare, and government. This framework is expanding to a next-generation hybrid language model approach, a breakthrough AI architecture that can intelligently route queries between Zoom’s proprietary Small Language Models (SLMs), optimized for low latency and quality for a particular skill or tasks, and a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) for complex reasoning. The new hybrid model will accelerate enterprise productivity and collaboration experiences with optimized cost efficiency, quality, and latency.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Zoom’s AI framework uses a federated architecture to intelligently select the best AI model for each task. Through this approach, Zoom AI Companion can leverage NVIDIA’s advanced AI infrastructure, services, and software, alongside other models, delivering enhanced capabilities while optimizing cost for customers. This includes Zoom’s new 49-billion-parameter LLM, based on NVIDIA Nemotron and developed with NVIDIA NeMo tools to achieve the optimal balance of speed, cost, and accuracy. This innovative architecture allows enterprise customers and government organizations to benefit from both open and closed model innovation, delivering greater cost efficiency, faster AI workflows, deeper reasoning capabilities, and more efficient collaboration within AI Companion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Accelerated AI innovation and interoperability</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>This initiative is set to power the next evolution of Zoom’s federated AI architecture, which dynamically incorporates optimal models, including the Llama Nemotron Super-based reasoning model, to deliver the ideal balance of accuracy, performance, and cost.

This new approach extends Zoom’s exceptional performance with the NVIDIA open model innovations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“We’ve increased our speed and enhanced lower-cost model decision making using NVIDIA GPUs and AI software stack, helping to optimize AI Companion’s core capabilities and enable faster go‑to‑market timelines,” said X.D. Huang, chief technology officer at Zoom. “With the help of NVIDIA Nemotron open technologies, we’re accelerating the development of our enterprise retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities, allowing AI Companion to work seamlessly with Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Google Workspace, Slack, Salesforce, and ServiceNow. This partnership allows us to deliver powerful, security-focused, and scalable AI experiences to our customers at rapid speed.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Through this work, NVIDIA and Zoom are further accelerating AI innovation and enterprise readiness.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“The integration of NVIDIA Nemotron into Zoom AI Companion allows enterprises like NVIDIA to experience a private, powerful, and personalized work environment for enhanced productivity,\" said Kari Briski, vice president of generative AI software at NVIDIA. \"Our collaboration with Zoom to bring smart and efficient AI reasoning to customers is just beginning.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>A responsible AI foundation</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Zoom is committed to expanding the AI frontier responsibly and plans to utilize NVIDIA Nemotron reasoning models to enhance decision-making and manage multistep tasks across meetings, chat, documents, and more.
