Bitcoin slipped 3.8% to $110,063, while Ethereum dropped 3.6% to $3,853, and XRP fell 4.1% to $2.51. The pullback reflects a clear risk-off sentiment, as investors step back amid growing uncertainty over global policy decisions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Why Crypto is Crashing?</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Traders are in panic mode after Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the recent 25-basis-point rate cut could be the last one for 2025. He warned that the Fed might “wait a cycle” before introducing further easing, dashing hopes for faster monetary relief.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The comments hit risk assets across the board, with the Dow Jones slipping 0.2% and the S&amp;P 500 remaining flat, as markets began pricing in a longer stretch of tight financial conditions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adding to the pressure, the much-hyped Trump–Xi meeting delivered little clarity. While both sides described it as “productive,” traders viewed it as a temporary truce rather than a real breakthrough. The lack of concrete progress has kept nerves high, especially as global markets brace for potential ripple effects from renewed trade disputes and tariff tensions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Institutional Players Still Buying</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the price decline, institutional demand for crypto remains robust. Bitcoin ETFs recorded $202.48 million in net inflows on October 28, led by BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark &amp; 21Shares, pushing total inflows past $62 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ethereum ETFs also gained traction, attracting more than $246 million in net inflows.

His trading indicators now point to instability, suggesting that the April lows might only mark the beginning of a deeper decline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For now, Bitcoin remains above $108,000, but fear is spreading fast.

It highlights the need for 2,000 new beds in the western zone, 1,500 in the east and south, and approximately 4,000 in long-term care facilities to support an ageing population and sustained population growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“The population growth will result in demand for outpatient and inpatient facilities alike,” said Dr. Gireesh Kumar, Associate Partner – Healthcare Advisory, MENA at Knight Frank. “However, with the current and planned investment in the sector, investment opportunities need to be carefully evaluated, with the catchment area becoming increasingly important.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He added that investors are actively monitoring “outpatient and ambulatory care facilities, long-term care and post-acute care facilities, centres of excellence – Ophthalmology, Dental and Aesthetics – and inpatient facilities in the mid and value segments.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Private sector leads expansion</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Private healthcare providers have been rapidly scaling to meet demand. Currently, private providers deliver 70 percent of outpatient services in Riyadh, up sharply in recent years, driven by growing insurance coverage that now exceeds half the city’s population.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kumar explained, “Broader insurance coverage, greater accessibility, specialised care, and more efficient service delivery have shifted patient demand to the private sector. Outpatient and inpatient volumes grew by 2.5X and 3.1X, respectively, in 2023 compared to the public sector.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While Riyadh remains a major investment hub, Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province is also experiencing rapid healthcare expansion. Almoosa Health Company, an integrated healthcare provider, has been actively investing in the region to meet rising demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“Given the strong outlook and growing demand for quality healthcare in Saudi Arabia, particularly in the Eastern Province, we believe this is the right time to invest in the growth and expansion of our business, to meet the needs of the region, while inviting new shareholders to be a part of our compelling growth story,” CEO Malek Almoosa told Zawya Projects in an interview last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company successfully completed its $449 million initial public offering (IPO) on the Saudi Exchange in December 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In August 2025, the company secured a Shariah-compliant 650 million Saudi riyal ($173 million) credit facility from Banque Saudi Fransi to support its expansion plans. Almoosa said the proceeds would be used to fund two new specialist hospitals in Al Khobar and Al Hofuf, which will collectively add 700 beds to the current network.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“Private healthcare providers are expected to play a key role in addressing these challenges,” he said in the 2024 interview, emphasising that expansion aligns with Vision 2030’s objectives to elevate private sector participation and expand healthcare accessibility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another key player in Saudi Arabia’s private healthcare landscape is Burjeel Holdings, which has been expanding its network of specialty services in the Kingdom.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In an August 2025 interview with Zawya Projects, CEO John Sunil highlighted the company’s focus on complex care areas, saying, “Saudi Arabia continues to be a key growth engine. We are scaling our PhysioTherabia network and preparing to launch day surgery platforms.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sunil explained in that interview that Burjeel’s strategy is anchored on building integrated care models that combine preventive, acute, and rehabilitative services. “With tools like AI-based diagnostics, we are gaining better visibility across the system and improving both clinical and operational performance,” he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Burjeel has also invested heavily in expanding specialty services such as oncology, surgical specialties, and women’s health.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Saudi Arabia’s growth story is mirrored across the broader Gulf region. According to JLL’s whitepaper </span><em><span>Navigating the GCC Healthcare Investment Landscape</span></em><span>, nearly 400 healthcare transactions were recorded across the GCC between 2021 and April 2025, with Saudi Arabia and the UAE accounting for 92 percent of the total.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>JLL data shows that early-stage funding and M&amp;A dominate the deal pipeline, with 28 percent of all transactions involving hospitals and clinics. The firm expects further consolidation as larger entities acquire successful startups to integrate innovative solutions into their existing healthcare offerings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Digital transformation and AI integration</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Digitalisation is playing a transformative role in Saudi healthcare. The Kingdom’s digital health market, valued at SAR 698 million in 2022, is projected to grow at a 25 percent compound annual rate through 2030, supported by the rollout of the Unified Electronic Health Record system and the NPHIES data exchange platform, according to the Ministry of Investment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kostas Deligiannis, Zone President for Eurasian &amp; African Growth Markets at GE HealthCare, said, “Through streamlined analytics and improved visibility under NPHIES, Saudi Arabia has revolutionised patient data management… Enhanced interoperability and patient-centered care support evidence-based decision-making, reducing the complexity and cost of managing multiple systems and improving efficiency and care quality.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He added that GE HealthCare’s “AI-enabled imaging and monitoring solutions align closely with the Kingdom’s vision of predictive and data-driven care. Telemedicine, remote monitoring, and AI-powered diagnostics are also expanding access, especially in remote areas.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Vision 2030 anchors confidence</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Kingdom’s Vision 2030 anchors investor confidence and provides a clear roadmap for healthcare sector growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Deligiannis noted that Vision 2030’s Health Sector Transformation Programme has “directly fuelled the Kingdom’s emergence as a leading destination for healthcare investment within the GCC,” with private sector participation projected to rise from 40 percent to 65 percent of total healthcare spending by 2030.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Saudi Arabia’s National Centre for Privatisation &amp; PPP (NCP) is actively promoting Public-Private Partnership (PPP) opportunities in the healthcare sector.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In October 2024, Altakassusi Alliance Medical (AAM), a joint venture between the Alliance Medical Group, King Faisal Specialist Hospital &amp; Research Centre, and Lifeline Medical, achieved financial close for their diagnostic imaging public-private partnership (PPP) project, the very-first privatisation and partnership project between the private sector and Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Health.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In July 2025, NCP and the Holy Makkah Municipality initiated tendering for a mixed-use project that included a 200-bed long-term care hospital and a 100-bed multi-specialty hospital.Knight Frank’s Kumar highlighted the potential for preventive and value-based care, saying, “As preventive care expands — through early disease detection, lifestyle management, and digital health interventions — it has the potential to accelerate healthy lifespan and reduce the burden of chronic diseases.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Developers and investors are already responding to rising demand. Approximately 3,575 new beds are planned through 2030 in Riyadh, with 63 percent concentrated in northern districts around King Abdullah Financial District and the Expo 2030 site.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Knight Frank’s zoning analysis recommends value-segment hospitals for the south, mid-segment hospitals for the east and west, and premium multispecialty clinics for central and northern districts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Saudi Arabia’s combination of regulatory clarity, private sector investment, and adoption of advanced technology positions Riyadh — and the Kingdom more broadly — at the center of the Gulf’s healthcare transformation. As Knight Frank concludes, “Riyadh is well-positioned to lead the next wave of healthcare advancement in the region.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(Reporting by SA Kader; Editing by Anoop Menon)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(anoop.menon@lseg.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Subscribe to our Projects' PULSE</span></strong><span> newsletter that brings you trustworthy news, updates and insights on project activities, developments, and partnerships across sectors in the Middle East and Africa.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

But at least some senators have indicated that a resolution is in sight. Although Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R., S.D.) adjourned the Senate on Thursday, seeing little progress in negotiations, on Wednesday he told MSNBC that bipartisan talks had \"ticked up significantly.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Jon Ossoff (D., Ga.), have said the pace of negotiations is quickening. Sen. Kevin Cramer (R., N.D.) on Thursday told reporters he is \"seeing some movement\" as the talks progress.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While there is no guarantee an agreement is reached, the talks are the closest lawmakers have come. For the past month, Democrats have insisted that they won't vote in favor of funding the government unless the bill includes an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire at the end of the year. Some Republicans say they want to consider extending the subsidies as well, but Thune has said he won't hold those talks while the government is closed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As of Saturday, the funding lapse will have lasted more than 31 days. It is almost certain to become the longest in history, beating the 35-day shutdown in 2018 and 2019 in President Donald Trump's first term.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A number of events are amping up the pressure for a deal. Saturday is the first day of open enrollment for ACA plans in most states, and the expiration of subsidies for next year means many enrollees will likely see premiums skyrocket.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The White House also says the government this weekend will run out of funding for benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps low-income families buy food. A judge on Friday said the government must keep distributing benefits. On Tuesday, voters in Virginia and New Jersey will choose their next governor, while California is voting on a redistricting measure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The shutdown's effects have already begun to bleed into ordinary Americans' lives. Airports across the country in the past week have had delays or ground stops due to staffing shortages in air-traffic control. Flight delays helped end the 2018-19 shutdown.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To break the logjam, centrist Democrats and Republicans are discussing not just a so-called continuing resolution that would fund the government in the short term but also long-term bipartisan spending bills to fund certain agencies. Thune in the past has said discussions on full-year bills, which would still need to be approved by the House of Representatives, shouldn't happen while the government is closed. But by reaching agreements on both at once, Democratic lawmakers could point to the bills as a partial victory.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The funding-bill discussions could also create confidence among Democrats that Republican lawmakers will hold healthcare talks when the government reopens, said Beacon Policy Advisors in a note on Friday. Rather than attaching the subsidies to the bill, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) may have to settle for a promise for a vote on the subsidies in coming weeks, or the creation of a healthcare working group, the analysts wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Analysts say that the best window for a deal is likely late next week, after the elections.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This doesn't end until enough pain points arrive,\" said Brian Gardner, Stifel's chief Washington policy strategist, predicting that it might take the kinds of air-traffic disruptions seen in 2019 to end the stalemate. \"We're closer to the end than the beginning.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Joe Light at joe.light@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

What was once limited to gyms and health supplements now includes meditation apps, temple retreats, sound healing, and traditional medicine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Digital meditation platforms, premium wellness products, and spiritual tourism are reshaping consumer spending as young Chinese prioritize emotional well-being over traditional status symbols,\" said analysts at consumer research publication Jing Daily. On Xiaohongshu, China's Instagram-like lifestyle platform, the most-searched wellness hashtags in the first half of 2025 were \"spiritual healing\" and \"temple tourism.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even China's retail scene has been transformed by this mood. Cafes and teahouses in Beijing and Chengdu now double as pseudo-temples, selling fortune charms, herbal infusions, and \"Stay-Up-Late Water\" tonics meant to balance urban overstimulation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jewelry sellers livestreaming on Taobao report surging sales of crystal bracelets and talismans, products that blend fashion with mysticism. One online category tracker estimated more than a million units of such items sold in January alone, totaling roughly 100 million yuan ($14 million) in revenue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"China is at the starting point of the era of spiritual consumption, with diverse core consumption motivations for trendy products,\" analysts at ZheShang Securities said in a research note.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Temple tourism, once a niche pursuit, has become a social phenomenon. Travel platform Qunar shows visits to temple scenic areas up more than 300% year-over-year in early 2025, with about half the visitors born after 1990.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Popular sites such as Hangzhou's Lingyin Temple or Chongqing's Huayan Temple now rank alongside theme parks in online popularity metrics. Many of these young pilgrims aren't strictly religious. They are seeking something else: order, symbolism, and a sense of calm in an increasingly unpredictable environment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This change in mind-set fits within a broader cultural arc that includes the \"Buddha-like\" attitude and the \"lying flat\" movement — rejections of relentless competition in favor of detachment. When the external ladder feels shaky, many turn inward or sideways, experimenting with astrology, breathwork, or incense-lit rituals that blur the line between spirituality and self-care.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Brands have noticed. Global and domestic companies are layering ritual and authenticity into their marketing. Some luxury labels have quietly joined with wellness retreats, while Chinese lifestyle companies are launching product lines inspired by temple aesthetics or traditional medicine heritage. The appeal isn't necessarily faith but grounding — a sense that consumption can be linked to reflection rather than ambition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet the trend carries risks. The Chinese government remains officially atheist and keeps tight control over organized religion. Commercialization of spiritual themes walks a fine line, and companies that lean too heavily on superstition may face scrutiny. Analysts also caution that the trend may prove cyclical — an emotional coping mechanism tied to the current downturn rather than a permanent shift in values.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For investors, the new landscape offers both opportunity and caution. Listed wellness and lifestyle platforms, tourism firms with temple-town exposure, and consumer brands tied to traditional medicine could benefit from this wave of emotional and spiritual consumption. But the winners will be those who understand the deeper motivation: the search for stability and identity in uncertain times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a country where \"consumption downgrade\" has become a buzzword, the rise of spiritual consumption represents not withdrawal but reorientation. It replaces conspicuous display with introspection, trading \"look what I own\" for \"look how I feel.\" As China's economic model evolves, so too does its consumer soul — and for the country's youth, meaning itself has become the most sought-after luxury.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to editors@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>How many traders close at the target?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Answer to this simple question is not too many. If I were to look at my own history, a lot of my trades have been closed at a point that was not the desired target. This is important to the context of “Slow and Spread”.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before we come to that let me share a market scenario. Imagine indices have been trading with a tight range of around 3% for over 3 months. Right after coming out of that range, we expect the index to blow past the previous highs. When that does not happen, one would like to re-think. This reminds us of the times we are in right now.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now, to take care of this scenario, one would like to take it slow. With slow we mean less aggressive. With lack of aggression comes inherent reduction in risk. Reduced risk automatically makes us more efficient. The logic behind being more efficient is you either win more or lose less. With lack of aggression, we definitely lose less and thereby become more efficient.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We are talking about lowering the aggression or slowing down by using Option Spreads. This is a topic that has been touched upon often but like Table Salt it has a million use cases. This is one of the sweetest. Let us understand and analyse.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Option Spread means a combination trade where one Buys an Option and Sells an Option simultaneously. There are many kinds of Option Spreads. The one that we are talking about is the Vertical Spreads.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vertical Debit Spreads are the spreads that has both options of the same type and expiry date. Also, the debit element of spreads indicate we have to pay premium to get into the trade. Higher Strike Calls and lower Strike Puts are relatively less expensive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vertical Debit Spreads will involve Buying a Call/Put and Selling a Higher Strike Call/ Lower Strike Put. This will make us have a premium outflow.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Example: With a stock trading at 1500</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bullish Spread = Buy 1500 Call &amp; Sell 1540 Call</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bearish Spread = Buy 1500 Put &amp; Sell 1460 Put</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Let us do a Comparative Analysis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1109.9337748344371px;aspect-ratio:1.849889624724062\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/moneycontrol:5ff7a8182094b-6b806b45520c8350bbaaa6dde0eea442-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"sa\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/moneycontrol:5ff7a8182094b-6b806b45520c8350bbaaa6dde0eea442-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f7f7f6\"/></picture></div></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The example carries a stock at 1500 with over 30 days left for expiry. Grey line indicates what would be the profit or loss across the prices of the stock after 6 days, considering there is a weekend in between. We are assuming that the trade has 1480 Stop loss and 1540 Target.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Buy Call has 11951 likely profits at target against 5164 worth of loss if the trade hits a Stop-Loss. This converts into Reward/Risk = 2.3</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Call Spread has 5294 likely profits at target against 2358 worth of loss if the trade hits a Stop-Loss. The Reward/Risk = 2.25</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a nutshell, we have 2 trades with almost similar Reward/Risk, but Spread has a capacity to losing a lot less in the same trade than Buy Call.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This way we make Slower money but more efficiently. This is because with the same amount of money to lose now we can 2 trades and not one.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Only downside is that Spread has profits locked at 1540 (Sell Call Srike). But as discussed in the beginning, we don’t wait till target right?Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Adam McCarthy, a senior research analyst at digital market data provider Kaiko, observed that cryptocurrencies entered October tracking gold and stocks at near all-time highs. However, as uncertainty crept into the market, investors did not flow back into Bitcoin as anticipated. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition, October witnessed the largest liquidation event in cryptocurrency history, triggered by President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, alongside threats of export controls on crucial software.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>McCarthy commented on the impact of this liquidation, stating, “That washout on the 10th really reminded people that this asset class is very narrow.” He emphasized that even dominant cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum can experience sharp drawdowns, citing instances of 10% declines occurring in just 15 to 20 minutes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amid these developments, concerns have been raised by several figures regarding the high valuations in equity markets. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, recently warned of a heightened risk of a significant correction in the US stock market within the next six months to two years. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jake Ostrovskis, head of trading at Wintermute’s over-the-counter desk, noted that participants in the market remain hesitant as they grapple with the implications of the largest liquidation event on record.
