He succeeds the Rev. Dr. Liberato C.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jamie McGeever</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell surprised many market-watchers on Wednesday when he declared that another interest rate cut in December was not a slam dunk. Perhaps even more surprising was his apparent suggestion that if boosting the labor market is the goal, rate cuts might not be that useful. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the press conference after the central bank lowered its fed funds policy target range by 25 basis points, Powell cited several reasons why a similar move in December is \"far from\" a done deal. These included \"strongly different\" views among rate-setters, limited data visibility due to the government shutdown, above-target inflation, and doubts about how quickly the labor market is slowing. He also noted that policy may be close to neutral after 150 basis points of easing. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But perhaps the most telling reason was the most simple: cutting rates won't work. At least, doing so won't address the current problem, which is supporting the softening labor market. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alluding to this, Powell admitted that the job market is weakening primarily because of shrinking labor supply rather than cooling demand for workers. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But lower borrowing costs are designed to boost demand for workers. If the job market's problems are \"mostly\" a function of labor supply, as Powell said, then cutting interest rates is akin to pushing on a string.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"So the question then is what does our tool do, which supports demand? Some people argue that this is supply, and we really can't affect it much with our tools.

That's a result of the tighter immigration controls, increased deportations, and both young people and retirees leaving the labor force. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the last official monthly jobs report, which was for August, the unemployment rate climbed to a four-year high of 4.3%. But that's only one tenth of a percentage point up on the previous year, and is still ultra-low by historical standards. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Powell also said there's no evidence of a worrisome deterioration in the broader labor market, though the recent announcement of some high-profile corporate layoffs may suggest otherwise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, economic indicators such as business investment and retail sales still appear fairly healthy. Both are strongly linked to the booming stock market - big companies' rising share price and profits fund their capex, and the asset-owning top 10% continue to drive around half of all U.S. consumer spending. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What we appear to see taking shape is a so-called 'K-shaped' economy: the rich are getting richer from the asset price boom, while the rest are struggling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This curious balance is new for the Fed and a tricky one to navigate, especially with the government shutdown reducing visibility even further.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Just as the Fed's blunt interest rate tool doesn't fix supply-side issues in the jobs market, it may not do much to support lower-income households and individuals either, even though ensuring a stronger labor market is the \"best thing\" the Fed can do for the American people. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cheaper money is also likely to benefit the richest cohorts by inflating asset prices even more, which may also push already lofty valuations to unsustainable levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Six weeks is a long way off, but a third successive rate cut in December is suddenly in the balance. If the subtext of Powell's press conference is anything to go by, that may be for the best.    </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Enjoying this column?
