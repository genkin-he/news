While the market welcomes flash sales, today's notice isn't the one many traders were hoping to see. A sale of soybeans to China was rumored among market participants, which gave soybeans support this week. Most-active soybean futures are up 0.5%, while corn rises 0.5% and wheat inches up 0.2%.

That progression is also visible at </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Milano Cortina 2026</span></strong><span>, where French biathlete Lou Jeanmonnot, who competed at Lillehammer 2016, has since gone on to win Olympic gold.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Designed with the future in mind</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Among the most tangible legacies is the Youth Olympic Village.

Dream Day reached more than 17,500 school pupils, while Active Mind - Active Body encouraged daily physical activity.

A few examples help to illustrate that reach. Norway's Heidi Dyhre Traaserud and Canada's Abigail Strate took part in Lillehammer's international ski jumping camps and have since progressed to senior success, including major championship and Olympic appearances.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The pathway also extends beyond the field of play. Ludovica Sini, a participant in Lillehammer's Young Leaders programme, has since taken on a protocol coordination role for Milano Cortina 2026.
