            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Standard Chartered (SCBFY) just delivered the kind of quarter investors pay attention to. Adjusted pretax profit hit $1.99 billion, ahead of the $1.79 billion analysts had penciled in, powered by standout performances in wealth management and global banking. CFO Diego de Giorgi said the bank could now meet its 2026 return-on-tangible-equity goala year earlyafter what he called a strong quarter of progress. With income from global banking up 24% to $588 million and wealth income jumping 28%, management has raised its 2025 income outlook to the upper end of the 5%7% range. Shares climbed 3.1% in London, extending a 53% rise this year and leaving the FTSE 100's 19% gain far behind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The improvement comes as the bank's Fit for Growth restructuring enters its second yeara sweeping program of cost cuts and efficiency drives across hundreds of initiatives. Standard Chartered took a $138 million charge tied to the overhaul this quarter but said savings should accelerate through 2025. The bank is doubling down on wealth, too. A $1.5 billion expansion plan aims to attract $200 billion in new assets by 2029. In the third quarter alone, it added $13 billion in net inflows and 67,000 new affluent clients, underscoring the momentum building in its Asian wealth franchise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The results landed against a calmer geopolitical backdrop after US President Donald Trump's summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping produced what Trump called an amazing meeting. The US agreed to halve fentanyl-related tariffs, while China paused new rare-earth export curbsa detente that could ease business anxiety worldwide. De Giorgi said the move improves confidence for investors and businesses alike, a backdrop that could work in the bank's favor as global trade stabilizes. Credit impairments rose slightly to $195 million, while private-credit exposure remained contained below $3 billion, suggesting the bank's risk profile remains under control as it pushes for stronger, earlier returns.</span></p></span></div></div>",
