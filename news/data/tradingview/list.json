            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Ethereum’s scaling era is evolving, and Linea is emerging as one of its most important pillars. By enabling faster, cheaper transactions while maintaining full ETH security and composability, Linea is building the infrastructure for real economic activity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Why Ethereum Needs An Economic Backbone</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Linea is rapidly evolving into the Ethereum economic backbone. Crypto analyst Henry has revealed on X that Linea was built from first principles as a reinforcement layer for ETH’s future. The reason why Linea is catching serious attention is that over $1 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) and $130 million in stablecoins represent real liquidity inflow into the network, not inflated metrics. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Furthermore, Linea’s buyback and burn mechanism ties are built directly into protocol revenue. MetaMask’s deep integration and the seamless user experience (UX) are instant reach, and the developer-first architecture actually scales without breaking ETH’s security. The rumors of a MASK airdrop and upcoming institutional deployments only add fuel to the narrative. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While others are chasing hype, LineaBuild is constructing the infrastructure that powers real revenue. Henry concluded that every stat is screaming one thing, and adoption is real. “Nothing can defeat this, and Linea is ETH’s execution layer for the next cycle,” the expert added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto analyst BullifyX has also made a bold declaration that the next evolution of Web3 is unfolding right on LineaBuild. Linea isn’t just another Layer 2 blockchain, but it’s a new foundation for scalability, speed, and developer freedom. With zkEVM precision, ultra-low gas, and ETH-grade security, Linea bridges the gap between innovation and accessibility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Furthermore, LineaBuild is a frictionless playground for builders, while for users, it delivers pure performance. BullifyX emphasizes that Linea’s role is to transform complex blockchain experiences into smooth, scalable realities, powering applications, digital economies, and the immersive metaverses. “The future doesn’t wait. It scales on LineaBuild.” BullifyX noted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The First Public Company Just Proved Ethereum’s Real-World Use Case</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a monumental shift, the institutional adoption of Ethereum had just leveled up. According to Stacy Muur, the founder of GREENDOTS, the catalyst for this advancement is the deployment of an impressive $200 million in ETH on LineaBuild by SharpLink, a publicly traded company, powered by EigenLayer’s EigenCloud, ether_fi restaking, and Anchorage for secure, regulated custody.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Muur explained that this is the first fully verifiable, ETH-aligned institutional treasury activation. Meanwhile, a public company is now using EigenCloud as infrastructure for staking and verifiable on-chain treasury management. This suggests that the ETH restaking economy is robust enough to regulate capital.</span></p></span></div></div>",

(\"Savara\" or the \"Company\") </span><span> and certain officers.   The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and docketed under 25-cv-05147, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired Savara securities between March 7, 2024 and May 23, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants' violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired Savara securities during the Class Period, you have until November 7, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class.  A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com.   To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>[Click here for information about joining the class action]</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Savara is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on rare respiratory diseases. The Company's lead product candidate is MOLBREEVI (also referred to as \"molgramostim\"), an inhaled granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. MOLBREEVI is in a Phase 3 IMPALA-2 pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (\"aPAP\"), a chronic and debilitating rare lung disease characterized by the abnormal build-up of surfactant in the alveoli of the lungs. Savara has consistently represented that, based on investments in MOLBREEVI and its purported \"track record of strong fiscal discipline,\" the Company is \"sufficiently capitalized\" as early as through 2026 and as late as into the second half of 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In December 2024, Savara began a rolling submission of a Biologics License Application (\"BLA\")-</span><em><span>i.e.</span></em><span>, a submission requesting approval to distribute a biologic product across state lines-to the United States (\"U.S.\") Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") for MOLBREEVI for the potential treatment of aPAP (the \"MOLBREEVI BLA\"). In a press release announcing the submission, the Company touted that, \"[g]iven the positive results of the pivotal, Phase 3 IMPALA-2 trial, we believe MOLBREEVI demonstrates a favorable benefit-risk profile and could fundamentally change the way aPAP is treated,\" and that \"[i]nitiation of the [MOLBREEVI] BLA is an important milestone in potentially addressing the unmet need in aPAP, for which there are no approved medicines in the U.S. and Europe.\" Moreover, Savara represented that it \"expect[ed] to complete the submission of the rolling [MOLBREEVI] BLA by the end of [the first quarter of] 2025.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To obtain FDA approval of the MOLBREEVI BLA, Savara must submit, among other things, information regarding MOLBREEVI's chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (\"CMC\"). Specifically, the CMC section of a BLA must provide a detailed account of a product's manufacturing process-including process validation runs, stability testing, and analytical method validation-and detailed descriptions of facilities, equipment, and quality control procedures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the MOLBREEVI BLA lacked sufficient information regarding MOLBREEVI's chemistry, manufacturing, and/or controls; (ii) accordingly, the FDA was unlikely to approve the MOLBREEVI BLA in its current form; (iii) the foregoing made it unlikely that Savara would complete its submission of the MOLBREEVI BLA within the timeframe it had represented to investors; (iv) the delay in MOLBREEVI's regulatory approval increased the likelihood that the Company would need to raise additional capital; and (v) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On May 27, 2025, Savara issued a press release \"announc[ing] that the Company received [a refusal to file] letter from the FDA for the [MOLBREEVI BLA] as a therapy to treat patients with [aPap].\" Specifically, Savara revealed that \"[u]pon preliminary review, the FDA determined that the [MOLBREEVI BLA] was not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review and requested additional data related to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC).\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Market analysts were quick to comment on the Company's announcement. For example, on May 27, 2025, Guggenheim published a report (the \"Guggenheim Report\") revising its price target for Savara to $8.00, down from the previous $9.00. Guggenheim stated that it \"do[es] not expect Savara to be profitable on a continuing basis until 2028 and expect[s] the company may raise additional capital, potentially through a secondary stock offering that could dilute the holdings of current investors.\" In addition, the Guggenheim Report noted that the \"CMC Delay Could Lead to Change in Molbreevi Manufacturing Strategy,\" predicting a delayed market launch sometime in early 2027, a year later than initially expected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On this news, Savara's stock price fell $0.90 per share, or 31.69%, to close at $1.94 per share on May 27, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then, after the end of the Class Period, on August 13, 2025, Savara issued a press release announcing the Company's financial results for the second quarter of 2025. Among other things, the press release revealed that, contrary to the Company's prior representations that it would complete its rolling submission of the MOLBREEVI BLA in the first quarter of 2025, Savara now \"plan[s] to resubmit the [MOLBREEVI] BLA in December [2025].\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

(\"Koito\") (the \"Koito Acquisition\" or the \"Merger\") (as described below), Cepton was an electronics company focused on the deployment of high performance, mass-market light detection and ranging (\"lidar\") technologies to deliver safety and autonomy across the Automotive and Smart Infrastructure markets. The Company offered near-range lidars, long-range lidars and ultra-long-range lidars, automotive software and smart lidar systems that include its perception software.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As of July 2023, Koito, a Japanese manufacturer of automotive lighting equipment, had invested $200 million in Cepton in exchange for common and preferred stock amounting to 30.1% of Cepton's voting power on an as-converted basis and held two out of seven seats on the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\"). In October 2023, Koito requested that the Board form a special committee to negotiate a potential transaction with Koito.

Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Cepton had received a credible third-party bid valuing Cepton at more than double the Koito Acquisition; (ii) Cepton's Board of Directors failed to meaningfully explore the foregoing offer and failed to disclose its terms when recommending that Cepton's shareholders approve the Koito Acquisition; (iii) consequently, Cepton's shareholders were deprived of the opportunity to meaningfully consider whether to accept or reject the Koito Acquisition; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors began to learn the truth four months after the Merger closed when, in May 2025, former Cepton shareholders filed two verified class action complaints in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware against, among others, Cepton and certain of the Company's executive officers, in connection with the Koito Acquisition. In July 2025, the foregoing actions were consolidated and restyled as In re Cepton, Inc. Stockholder Litigation, Case No. 2025-0519-LWW (the \"Delaware Action\"). Then, in September 2025, a redacted version of an amended consolidated class action complaint (the \"Amended Complaint\") filed in the Delaware Action became publicly available. The Amended Complaint followed a review of books and records produced by Cepton in response to plaintiffs' demands made under 8 Del. C. § 220. The Amended Complaint alleges that Cepton's Board agreed to the Koito Acquisition \"at a price that was so unreasonable as to shock the conscience, and then pitched the grossly unfair deal to stockholders with a Proxy that concealed critical facts.\" Moreover, the Amended Complaint alleges that \"the Proxy failed to disclose Cepton's receipt of-and the Board's utter failure to explore-a credible third-party bid valuing Cepton at more than double\" the Koito Acquisition. The Amended Complaint further alleges that Cepton's Chief Executive Officer Defendant Jun Pei was subject to conflicts in his negotiations with Koito and encouraged the Board to recommend accepting the Koito Acquisition so as to protect his own personal economic interests at the expense of Cepton's stockholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

The Company's lead product candidate is MOLBREEVI (also referred to as \"molgramostim\"), an inhaled granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. MOLBREEVI is in a Phase 3 IMPALA-2 pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (\"aPAP\"), a chronic and debilitating rare lung disease characterized by the abnormal build-up of surfactant in the alveoli of the lungs. Savara has consistently represented that, based on investments in MOLBREEVI and its purported \"track record of strong fiscal discipline,\" the Company is \"sufficiently capitalized\" as early as through 2026 and as late as into the second half of 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In December 2024, Savara began a rolling submission of a Biologics License Application (\"BLA\")-</span><em><span>i.e.</span></em><span>, a submission requesting approval to distribute a biologic product across state lines-to the United States (\"U.S.\") Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") for MOLBREEVI for the potential treatment of aPAP (the \"MOLBREEVI BLA\"). In a press release announcing the submission, the Company touted that, \"[g]iven the positive results of the pivotal, Phase 3 IMPALA-2 trial, we believe MOLBREEVI demonstrates a favorable benefit-risk profile and could fundamentally change the way aPAP is treated,\" and that \"[i]nitiation of the [MOLBREEVI] BLA is an important milestone in potentially addressing the unmet need in aPAP, for which there are no approved medicines in the U.S. and Europe.\" Moreover, Savara represented that it \"expect[ed] to complete the submission of the rolling [MOLBREEVI] BLA by the end of [the first quarter of] 2025.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To obtain FDA approval of the MOLBREEVI BLA, Savara must submit, among other things, information regarding MOLBREEVI's chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (\"CMC\"). Specifically, the CMC section of a BLA must provide a detailed account of a product's manufacturing process-including process validation runs, stability testing, and analytical method validation-and detailed descriptions of facilities, equipment, and quality control procedures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the MOLBREEVI BLA lacked sufficient information regarding MOLBREEVI's chemistry, manufacturing, and/or controls; (ii) accordingly, the FDA was unlikely to approve the MOLBREEVI BLA in its current form; (iii) the foregoing made it unlikely that Savara would complete its submission of the MOLBREEVI BLA within the timeframe it had represented to investors; (iv) the delay in MOLBREEVI's regulatory approval increased the likelihood that the Company would need to raise additional capital; and (v) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On May 27, 2025, Savara issued a press release \"announc[ing] that the Company received [a refusal to file] letter from the FDA for the [MOLBREEVI BLA] as a therapy to treat patients with [aPap].\" Specifically, Savara revealed that \"[u]pon preliminary review, the FDA determined that the [MOLBREEVI BLA] was not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review and requested additional data related to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC).\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Market analysts were quick to comment on the Company's announcement. For example, on May 27, 2025, Guggenheim published a report (the \"Guggenheim Report\") revising its price target for Savara to $8.00, down from the previous $9.00. Guggenheim stated that it \"do[es] not expect Savara to be profitable on a continuing basis until 2028 and expect[s] the company may raise additional capital, potentially through a secondary stock offering that could dilute the holdings of current investors.\" In addition, the Guggenheim Report noted that the \"CMC Delay Could Lead to Change in Molbreevi Manufacturing Strategy,\" predicting a delayed market launch sometime in early 2027, a year later than initially expected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On this news, Savara's stock price fell $0.90 per share, or 31.69%, to close at $1.94 per share on May 27, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then, after the end of the Class Period, on August 13, 2025, Savara issued a press release announcing the Company's financial results for the second quarter of 2025. Among other things, the press release revealed that, contrary to the Company's prior representations that it would complete its rolling submission of the MOLBREEVI BLA in the first quarter of 2025, Savara now \"plan[s] to resubmit the [MOLBREEVI] BLA in December [2025].\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>[Click here for information about joining the class action]</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jasper, a clinical-stage biotechnology company, focuses on developing therapeutics targeting mast cell driven diseases such as Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (\"CSU\"), Chronic Inducible Urticaria (\"CIndU\"), and Asthma. The Company's lead product candidate is briquilimab, a monoclonal antibody designed to block stem cell factor (\"SCF\") from binding to and signaling through the CD117 (\"c-Kit\") receptor on mast and stem cells. According to Jasper, the \"SCF/c-Kit pathway is a survival signal for mast cells and [the Company] believe[s] that blocking this pathway may lead to depletion of these cells throughout the body, including in the lungs and in the skin, which could lead to significant clinical benefit for patients with mast-cell driven diseases such as asthma and chronic urticarias\" and \"[t]o that end, [Jasper is] focusing on advancing a portfolio of clinical programs in mast cell driven diseases.\" In 2024, to \"strengthen [its] balance sheet and support development of briquilimab,\" Jasper completed an oversubscribed $50 million financing \"with a syndicate of leading life science investors,\" purportedly \"extending [its] cash runway through the third quarter of 2025.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In November 2023, the Company commenced a Phase 1b/2a clinical study of subcutaneous briquilimab for the treatment of CSU (the \"BEACON Study\"). When announcing the first patient dosing in the BEACON Study, Jasper's Chief Executive Officer Defendant Ronald Martell stated, in relevant part, that he was \"confident in the ability of our clinical organization to continue to execute at a high level as we advance briquilimab into clinical trials in CIndU and other mast cell-driven diseases.\" In December 2024, the Company commenced a Phase 1b/2a clinical study evaluating briquilimab in allergic asthma (the \"ETESIAN Study\"). In addition, Jasper has attempted to develop briquilimab as a one-time conditioning therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency (\"SCID\") patients undergoing a second stem cell transplant.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act -a law enacted by Congress in 2013 designed to improve and ensure the safety of the U.S pharmaceutical supply chain-all prescription drugs must be labeled with a unique product identifier that includes, among other things, a \"lot number.\" Drug \"lots\" are batches of a product that are manufactured, processed, packaged, or stored under the same conditions. If a medication is compromised, pharmaceuticals companies can use lot numbers to trace the affected batches and alert healthcare providers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to the Company, \"[t]he manufacture of pharmaceuticals is subject to extensive [current Good Manufacturing Practices (\"cGMP\")] regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control.\" Because Jasper does not currently own or operate any manufacturing facility, the Company relies on third-party contract manufacturing organizations to produce its drug candidates in purported \"accordance with cGMP regulations for use in [its] clinical studies.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Jasper lacked the controls and procedures necessary to ensure that the third-party manufacturers on which it relied were manufacturing products in full accordance with cGMP regulations and otherwise suitable for use in clinical trials; (ii) the foregoing failure increased the risk that results of ongoing studies would be confounded, thereby negatively impacting the regulatory and commercial prospects of the Company's products, including briquilimab; (iii) the foregoing increased the likelihood of disruptive cost-reduction measures; (iv) accordingly, the Company's business and/or financial prospects, as well as briquilimab's clinical and/or commercial prospects, were overstated; and (v) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On July 7, 2025, Jasper issued a press release reporting updated data from the BEACON Study. The press release stated that \"[r]esults from the 240mg Q8W and the 240mg followed by 180mg Q8W dose cohorts appear to be confounded by an issue with one drug product lot used in those cohorts, with 10 of the 13 patients dosed with drug from the lot in question,\" that \"[t]he Company is investigating the drug product lot in question and expects to have the results of that investigation in the coming weeks,\" and that Jasper was \"taking steps to ensure that drug product from the lot in question is returned to the Company and that sites have drug product from other lots to continue dosing.\" Further, the press release revealed that the Company \"has also determined that the drug product lot in question was used to treat participants enrolled in the ETESIAN [Study]. As a result, and in order to focus resources on advancing briquilimab in CSU, the Company is halting the study and pausing development in asthma.\" Finally, the press release stated that \"the Company is halting development in SCID\" and, contrary to its prior representation of having a strong balance sheet and a cash runway extending \"through the third quarter of 2025,\" that Jasper \"will be implementing a number of other cost cutting measures including a potential restructuring, to extend runway and reduce expenses.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On this news, Jasper's stock price fell $3.73 per share, or 55.1%, to close at $3.04 per share on July 7, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Market analysts were quick to comment on the Company's announcement. For example, on July 7, 2025, BMO Capital Markets published a report downgrading Jasper to market perform and lowering its price target from $6.77 per share to $4.00 per share (the \"BMO Report\"). The BMO Report stated, in relevant part, that \"potential Briquilimab drug lot issues, coupled with existing uncertainty around dose-response [], will pressure the [Jasper] story moving forward\" given, among other things, Jasper's \"financing overhang\" and market competition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After the end of the Class Period, on July 9, 2025, the Company issued a press release entitled \"Jasper Therapeutics Announces Corporate Reorganization and Other Cost Cutting Measures to Extend Cash Runway.\" The press release revealed that Jasper was reducing its workforce by approximately 50%, that \"[i]n order to focus resources on the development of briquilimab in chronic urticaria, Jasper is halting its other clinical and preclinical programs,\" and that Defendant Edwin Tucker was departing his role as the Company's Chief Medical Officer effective August 1, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.
