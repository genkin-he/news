The reduction of the metal entitlement by the total expense ratio (which may be varied by the Issuer in certain circumstances with notice to securityholders) and the imposition of the fees on subscriptions and buy-backs may prove unattractive to investors who are interested solely in the price movement of precious metals and there can be no assurance that the performance of the Metal will be sufficient to offset the effect of the total expense ratio and such fees.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·      The Issuer may elect to redeem all the Securities of the Series early on giving not less than 10 calendar days' notice to securityholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·      VAT may become due on transfers of Metal to or by the Issuer in certain circumstances.
