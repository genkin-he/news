Revenue for the quarter reached $102.3 billion, higher than expectations of $99.9 billion, and up 16% on the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Analysts closely watch Alphabet's operating margin, which came in at 30.5% for the third quarter, below analyst estimates and down from 32.3% last year. Excluding a $3.5 billion European Commission fine, the operating margin would have been a healthier 33.9%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alphabet stock was up more than 5% to to $289.38 in early Thursday trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Google once again raised its guidance for 2025 spending on artificial-intelligence data centers for its Google Cloud segment. It now stands at $92 billion, up from the previous $85 billion projection. The company expects a \"significant increase\" in this spending next year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alphabet still gets around 85% of its revenue from high-margin advertising and services, but eyes remain on the cloud because of its fast growth and the extensive investments. Cloud sales growth reached 34% in the quarter. More importantly to some investors, operating profit margins improved to 24% from 17% last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Google's legacy ads and services may be ignored by some in favor of the cloud, but they are still the bulwark of Alphabet's income statement. Google had a standout quarter across these lines, with especially strong momentum in its Android-related businesses. The company continues to deliver double-digit sales growth for both Search and YouTube, Google's core ad properties</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These strong numbers were offset by the Google third-party ad network, where sales continue to decline, along with traffic on the open web. This segment is in danger of being divested in the ongoing antitrust case, U.S. v. Google.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is these legacy assets that mostly support the company's capital expenditures, with operational cash flow topping $150 billion in the last 12 months. But the rapid pace of capex is straining even that; free cash flow in the first nine months of 2025 was flat with last year, despite operational cash flows growing by 30%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Like other big AI spenders, Alphabet turned to debt markets this year, selling $12.5 billion in bonds in May. Alphabet came into the AI race with little debt, so it has a lot more room to borrow, on top of its $98 billion in cash and short-term investments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

As capacity comes online Microsoft should deliver even stronger results,\" he wrote. \"We like the setup for continued strong growth and recommend buying into any weakness.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Tuesday, Microsoft and OpenAI announced that the artificial-intelligence start-up will convert its for-profit subsidiary into a public-benefit corporation of which Microsoft will own 27%.

That's more than twice the pace of price growth for non-luxury homes, which rose 1.8% year-over-year to a median of $371,583. The typical luxury home price has climbed about 11% since September 2023, compared with roughly 6% growth for non-luxury homes. People buying at the top end aren't waiting for rates to drop or prices to fall, Redfin says. They have the cash, stock gains, and long-term confidence to act when they see a home they want. Some high-end buyers are using real estate as a safe place to park their money amid economic uncertainty. High-end buyers also tend to pay in cash or take smaller loans, Redfin says.

This will keep the associated debt off Meta's balance sheet and the capex off its cash flow statement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unlike the other big AI spenders, all of Meta's data center investments are for itself, not for renting out in the cloud as with Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Besides shifting the company in a more asset-heavy direction, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is also upending Meta's AI research and development. He aims to offer AI to the 3.5 billion average daily users who use at least one of Meta's apps. The company wants to provide new user experiences like the Meta AI chatbot, while increasing the effectiveness of ad targeting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's pretty early, but I think we're seeing the returns in the core business,\" Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. \"That's giving us a lot of confidence that we should should be investing a lot more, and we want to make sure that we're not underinvesting.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the development of Meta's AI language models that underpin this strategy has been halting. The company's Llama 4 models were released in April to poor reviews, leading Zuckerberg to rethink his AI teams. In June, he began offering the best AI researchers in the world large multiyear compensation packages, reportedly stretching to nine-figures. At the center of the effort was a deal to acquire 49% of start-up Scale AI at a $29 billion valuation; the primary goal of that deal was to hire its CEO, Alexandr Wang, to run Meta's AI research.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
