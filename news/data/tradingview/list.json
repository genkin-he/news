Photos of Huang sharing beers and fried chicken with Samsung Electronics (SSNLF) Chair Jay Y. Lee and Hyundai Motor Executive Chair Chung Euisun at Kkanbu Chicken went viral this week, setting off a speculative buying frenzy across South Korea's retail-heavy market. While Kkanbu itself isn't listed, investors rushed into anything that even smelled of chicken Kyochon F&amp;B soared as much as 20%, poultry processor Cherrybro hit its daily 30% limit with trading volumes nearly 200 times average, and robot maker Neuromeka jumped sharply. It's the latest reminder that in Korea, virality can move markets faster than fundamentals ever could.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But behind the viral moment sits a deeper play. Huang's trip to Seoul wasn't just about beer and banter it was about business. Nvidia has been pushing to expand its presence in South Korea, a crucial supply chain hub as the company faces tighter export restrictions in China. During his visit, Huang announced fresh AI chip deals with Samsung and Hyundai moves that could strengthen Nvidia's foothold in memory and automotive computing. For the Korean conglomerates, closer ties with Nvidia could mean a steadier supply of the high-end GPUs that power next-generation artificial intelligence systems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Huang's influence has become something of a phenomenon in its own right. Over the past year, several smaller AI firms have seen their shares surge after he casually name-dropped them in presentations. Now, his simple dinner outing has triggered a similar reaction only this time, it's a fried chicken rally. As Huang told reporters outside the Seoul restaurant, I love fried chicken and I love beer and I love fried chicken and beer with my friends. For investors watching the AI boom unfold, it could be another sign that Nvidia's reach cultural or commercial is still expanding.</span></p></span></div></div>",

For the krona, good Swedish growth should make up for sub-2% interest rates, he says. As a risk-sensitive currency, it should also benefit from improved liquidity conditions when the Federal Reserve cuts rates, he says. \"Our target for mid-2025 is 10.50 for euro-krona.\" The euro rises 0.1% to 10.9256 krona.

Futures on the London Metal Exchange are down 0.8% to $10,843 a metric ton after climbing above the $11,100 mark earlier this week. The U.S. dollar index--which measures the greenback against a basket of other major currencies--is up 0.3% to 99.81, making dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for international buyers. The pullback comes as traders assess the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone on December rate cuts and the U.S.-China trade agreement. Yet, copper is still headed for a weekly gain of more than 5%, supported by concerns over global supply following a series of disruptions at major mines this year.

Still, a 0.3% decline in August GDP \"certainly raises the odds of a technical recession,\" Davenport says. Oxford says it expects Canada's economy to struggle to grow in the coming months and remain vulnerable to further trade-related disruptions.

However, Reitzes says the surprise 0.3% drop in August does reinforce BMO's belief that the risks remain skewed to the downside. The firm believes another quarter-point cut, in early 2026, is possible due to softness in the labor market, which would take the BOC's policy rate to 2%. BMO notes the wholesaling sector was particularly weak, down 1.2% in August, while the trade-exposed factory sector declined 0.5%.

The more credible next month's budget ends up being, there will be a corresponding increase in headwinds for the U.K. economy as a result of fiscal tightening, he says. That, alongside recent lower-than-expected U.K. inflation data, suggests an increased volume of Bank of England interest rate cuts, he says. This \"more than offsets any impact of risk premia being priced out of the currency.\" Sterling falls to a six-and-a-half-month low of $1.3099, LSEG data show.

GDP on an industry basis surprisingly fell 0.3% in August, and the early estimate is for a 0.1% gain in September--which Figueiredo estimates puts 3Q GDP largely in line with the BOC forecast for 0.5% annualized growth. Only 43% of sectors tracked have posted positive growth over the past 3 months, or well below the historical average of about 60%, the economist says.

The advance estimate is that GDP inched up 0.1% on-month in September, which implies growth of 0.4% annualized for the third quarter. That is only trivially weaker than the Bank of Canada's 0.5% growth estimate, Brown says. But he says that does tilt the odds toward 4Q growth being weaker than the central bank's forecast of 1%. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0904 ET - Canadian output in August was much weaker than consensus, and the advance estimate for September indicates soft momentum at the end of 3Q.

Statistics Canada's early estimate for September is that GDPedged upward by 0.1%. That would translate into a 0.4% annualized 3Q gain, or slightly below the Bank of Canada's forecast for 0.5% jump. \"The lack of momentum towards the end of the quarter may spook policymakers somewhat,\" says CIBC economist Andrew Grantham.

A lower U.K. risk premia is likely to push gilt yields lower, Gkionakis says. \"Potential for reduced spending in the Autumn budget may cause yields to fall due to pricing out of risk premia.\" In addition, recent U.K. jobs, inflation and GDP data indicate that the economy is slowing, raising the possibility of the BOE cutting rates in the coming months, he says. Two-year gilt yields last trade at 3.762%. They fell to 3.744% on Tuesday, just shy of a 14-month low, Tradeweb data show. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0844 ET - Canadian GDP fell 0.3% on-month in August, a much weaker performance than the flat GDP economists expected. It comes after GDP expanded an upwardly revised 0.3% in July, the first growth in four months. The weakness in August was marked by a fifth contraction in goods-producing industries since the start of the year, including the first decline in mining and oil and gas extraction in three months and a slump in utilities activity thanks to worsening drought conditions. Services-producing industries also edged lower, the first decline in six months in part thanks to a flight attendants strike that weighed on air travel and the first fall in wholesale trade in four months. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0840 ET - Canada's economy tracking toward a modest recovery for 3Q. Industry-level GDP fell a sharper-than-expected 0.3% on-month in August following upwardly revised growth of 0.3% in July. Statistics Canada's advance estimate indicates GDP increased 0.1% in September. Based on that, the economy is headed for a 0.4% drop in GDP on an annualized basis for the 3Q after shrinking 0.7% on the same basis the prior quarter. More fulsome expenditure-based data will only be released late next month, but as it stands the economy tracking in line with the modest 0.5% growth the Bank of Canada forecast for 3Q.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jason Zweig</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tina is back.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tina stands for \"there is no alternative.\" Years ago, when interest rates were near zero and investors were acting as if stocks were the only choice, market strategist Jason Trennert of Strategas Research Partners popularized the term \"the Tina market.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The latest argument for Tina comes from a newly updated analysis by a team of researchers who find that retirement savers shouldn't own any bonds at all.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Instead, according to this line of reasoning, investors should keep one-third of their savings in U.S. stocks and two-thirds in international stocks. The researchers advocate that you should hold all stocks, all the time — not only when you're young and saving for retirement, but even after you retire, for as long as you live.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If only stocks were a sure thing. In financial markets, nothing ever is. You can't just take an analysis of the past, no matter how careful it is, and assume you can extrapolate it into the future.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To reach their conclusion, Scott Cederburg, a finance professor at the University of Arizona, and his colleagues Aizhan Anarkulova at Emory University and Michael O'Doherty of the University of Missouri, analyzed stock and bond returns from 39 countries from 1890 through 2023, taking the longest available period during which each was classified as a developed market. That's up to 134 years for such markets as the U.S. and the U.K., and as short as four years for Colombia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Their central finding, across the decades and around the globe: Bonds have historically tended to go up and down in sync with stocks over long periods, making them poor diversifiers — while offering low returns, to boot.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For that full sample, after inflation, Cederburg and his colleagues determined that bonds earned 0.95% annually — far below the 7.74% on U.S. stocks and 7.03% on international stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That means that most people who save for retirement in target-date funds that hold a gradually tapering mix of stocks, bonds and cash could come up short, Cederburg and his co-authors say.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This message comes at a time when investors are already taking Tina to the limit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the S&amp;P 500's record close of 6890.89 on Tuesday, U.S. stocks were valued at 40.5 times their long-term earnings, adjusted for inflation. According to data from Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Shiller of Yale University, that's the highest ratio in a quarter century — since the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"With valuations where they are, this may just be a tougher investment environment for current retirement savers,\" Cederburg tells me.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We're not trying to pretend that putting all your retirement money into stocks isn't risky,\" he adds. \"It's an incredibly risky proposition.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In fact, in earlier research, Cederburg and his colleagues looked at more than three dozen global markets back as far as 1841. Over all possible 30-year horizons, investors in those markets who held a domestic all-stock portfolio underperformed inflation 12% of the time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What about in the U.S.? Edward McQuarrie is an emeritus business professor at Santa Clara University who has studied long-term asset returns back to the 18th century. He found that U.S. stocks outperformed inflation in every 30-year period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, they did underperform bonds in 25% of all 30-year stretches, although many of those periods overlapped and most — but not all — were in the 19th century.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All this should point you toward an inescapable but often overlooked fact: Stocks are likely to be the best-performing asset, but even a high likelihood isn't the same thing as certainty. The odds are in your favor, but you will need luck on your side. We all will.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consider two hypothetical investors, each with $1 million invested in the S&amp;P 500. They both withdraw 4% a year, in equal monthly installments, for the next 20 years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One retires on Dec. 31, 1999, right before the bear market of 2000-02; the other on Dec. 31, 2002, shortly after that nightmare ended and a new bull market began.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The first investor would have a little more than $890,000 left after 20 years, calculates financial planner Allan Roth of Wealth Logic in Colorado Springs, Colo.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The second investor would have more than $4 million. (These hypothetical results don't count fees, taxes and inflation.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you happen to retire into a bull market, you could end up with more money every year even after you withdraw to support your spending. If you have the bad luck to retire into a bear market, you could end up running out of money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's why I still own some bonds ( in my case, inflation-protected Treasurys), and I think you should, too. The historical odds, and current government policy, are against them. But stocks also are far from a sure thing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tina feels friendly right now as stocks flirt with record highs. But over a lifetime, as I've written before, investing as if there is no alternative to stocks will demand that you have the patience of a tortoise and the emotions of a stone.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here's the ultimate trouble with Tina. Let's say the odds that stocks will outperform bonds in the future — if, but only if, the future resembles the past — are something like five out of six.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As investing author William Bernstein points out, \"That is also how often you win at Russian roulette.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Jason Zweig at intelligentinvestor@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
