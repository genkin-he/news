Together with the existing Preliminary Mining Permits for Cinovec Northwest and Cinovec-East (valid until 2028), this permit encompasses the entirety of the Cinovec ore reserve.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is a critical regulatory milestone which reinforces the strategic nature of Cinovec and underpins future steps toward full mining authorisation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CORPORATE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Change of Company Secretary</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the quarter end the Company announced the resignation of Henko Vos as Company Secretary and the appointment of Ms Sujana Karthik as Company Secretary, effective 14 July 2025.

(\"Geomet\") controls the mineral exploration licenses awarded by the Czech State over the Cinovec Lithium Project. Geomet has been granted a preliminary mining permit by the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Industry. The company is owned 49% by EMH and 51% by CEZ a.s. through its wholly owned subsidiary, SDAS. Cinovec hosts a globally significant hard rock lithium deposit with a total Measured Mineral Resource of 53.3Mt at 0.48% Li2O, Indicated Mineral Resource of 360.2Mt at 0.44% Li2O and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 294.7Mt at 0.39% Li2O containing a combined 7.39 million tonnes Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated 13 October 2021) (Resource Upgrade at Cinovec Lithium Project).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An initial Probable Ore Reserve of 34.5Mt at 0.65% Li2O reported 4 July 2017 (Cinovec Maiden Ore Reserve - Further Information) has been declared to cover the first 20 years mining at an output of 22,500tpa of lithium carbonate (refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated 11 July 2018) (Cinovec Production Modelled to Increase to 22,500tpa of Lithium Carbonate).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This makes Cinovec the largest hard rock lithium deposit in Europe and the fifth largest non-brine deposit in the world.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cinovec has been designated a Strategic Project by the European Union under the Critical Raw Materials Act. (refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated 26/25 March 2025) (Cinovec declared a Strategic Project under EU Critical Raw Materials Act) and a Strategic Deposit by the Czech Government (refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated 7 March 2025) (Cinovec declared Strategic Deposit by Czech Government).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deposit has previously had over 400,000 tonnes of ore mined as a trial sub-level open stope underground mining operation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On 19 January 2022, EMH provided an update to the 2019 PFS Update. It confirmed the deposit is amenable to bulk underground mining (refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM release dated 19 January 2022) (PFS Update delivers outstanding results). Metallurgical test-work has produced both battery-grade lithium hydroxide and battery-grade lithium carbonate at excellent recoveries. In February 2023 DRA Global Limited (\"DRA\") was appointed to complete the Definitive Feasibility Study (\"DFS\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cinovec is centrally located for European end-users and is well serviced by infrastructure, with a sealed road adjacent to the deposit, rail lines located 5 km north and 8 km south of the deposit, and an active 22 kV transmission line running to the historic mine. The deposit lies in an active mining region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Cinovec processing plant comprises of a Front-End Comminution and Beneficiation circuit (\"FECAB\") and Lithium Chemical Plant circuit (\"LCP\") in combination producing Lithium Hydroxide or Lithium Carbonate end products and will be located on the Prunéřov 1 Power Station site located approximately 59km by rail from the Cinovec mine site. (refer to the Company's ASX/ AIM releases dated 26 April 2024 (New Lithium Plant Site Expected to Improve Project Permitting and Economics) and 27 November 2024 (Cinovec Project Update)).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The economic viability of Cinovec has been enhanced by the recent push for supply security of critical raw materials for battery production, including the strong increase in demand for lithium globally, and within Europe specifically, as demonstrated by the European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act (\"CRMA\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON CEZ</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Headquartered in the Czech Republic, CEZ a.s. is one of the largest companies in the Czech Republic and a leading energy group operating in Western and Central Europe.

Grades of deposits are also expressed as lithium compounds in percentages, for example as a percent lithium oxide (Li2O) content or percent lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) content.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lithium carbonate equivalent (\"LCE\") is the industry standard terminology for, and is equivalent to, Li2CO3. Use of LCE is to provide data comparable with industry reports and is the total equivalent amount of lithium carbonate, assuming the lithium content in the deposit is converted to lithium carbonate, using the conversion rates in the table included below to get an equivalent Li2CO3 value in percent. Use of LCE assumes 100% recovery and no process losses in the extraction of Li2CO3 from the deposit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lithium resources and reserves are usually presented in tonnes of LCE

The China-focused REIT's revenue and net property income declined in 3Q, and rents were renewed at lower rates across retail, business-park and logistics-park assets, she notes. While the Singapore-listed REIT's manager could consider unit buybacks using the net proceeds from a recent divestment, Lim thinks the window of opportunity has narrowed due the REIT's unit-price recovery this year. OCBC raises its 2026 distribution-per-unit estimate by 2.4%, leading to a higher fair-value estimate of S$0.74 versus S$0.705 previously. The bank maintains its hold rating, citing a poor rent-renewal outlook and foreign-exchange headwinds. Units rise 1.3% to S$0.80. (megan.cheah@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
