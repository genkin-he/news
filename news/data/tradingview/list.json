            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Tara Isabella Burton</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On April 3, 2007, a Twitter user going by \"Vonster\" coined a term that has become commonplace in modern cultural life. \"Just now realized,\" Vonster posted, discussing his plans with another user , \"I ghosted Gedeon on our interview? Doh!\" Vonster's ghosting — a mere failure to appear where or when he said he would — would become a byword for all forms of social disappearance. \"Ghosting\" is used in particular to indicate one's absence from the digital realms where maintaining perpetual contact — by text, by email, by phone or direct message — is now both possible and expected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ghosting, as a phenomenon of the digital age, is a near-requisite part of the app-based dating experience (this writer has indeed been ghosted more than once). It is increasingly common, too, in the post-pandemic workplace. An employer might renege on a job offer; an employee might simply not turn up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Plenty of reasons have been presented to explain why this silent, sometimes mysterious way of ending a conversation or a relationship seems ubiquitous now: our weakening sense of social obligations; the decline of shared responsibility that makes simply vanishing a legitimate expression of one's disinterest. But Dominic Pettman's intriguing, if at times uneven, \"Ghosting\" provides us with a promising new framework through which to view what he treats as a historically rooted but technologically specific practice.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For Mr. Pettman, a professor of media studies and the humanities at the New School in New York City, ghosting is as much about presence — the way the digital revolution has allowed people to exist as avatars in our shared imaginative and linguistic spaces — as it is about absence. Ghosting can happen, in part, because we otherwise expect people to be available to us around the clock. The interstitial world of texts, emails and social-media photographs, neither fully part of the material world nor fully within our own minds, acts as a kind of exteriorized collective imagination.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We are,\" Mr. Pettman reminds us, \"surrounded by ghosts already, and we've invented new types of mediated haunting that are, oddly, more comforting than unnerving. We have introduced a new immaterial, spectral dimension into our affairs.\" The appeal of ghosting may be inseparable from the question of what — if anything — of us truly exists in the in-between spaces that information technology makes possible.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ghosting is uncanny not only because it deprives us of certain codified social rituals for disentangling our relationships. It's uncanny, Mr. Pettman claims, because the uncertainty about presence , in the digital age, is linked to our anxieties about death: the final disentangling of our informational and physical selves. At one point in \"Ghosting,\" Mr. Pettman cites Marcel Proust, who through his fiction became one of the most influential theorists of the interplay of imagination, memory and reality. The narrator of Proust's \"In Search of Lost Time\" (1913-27) hears his grandmother's voice on the then-novel telephone, and marvels that \"it is she, it is her voice that is speaking . . . but how remote it is! . . . a real presence indeed that voice so near . . . a premonition also of an eternal separation!\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet Mr. Pettman spends curiously little time on the experience of the ghoster of the digital age. Regardless of the ethical and interpersonal implications, how does it feel to opt out of this kind of always-on presence and choose such invisibility? Why might we hunger for, and fear, the very freedom that generations before us took for granted: to be visible only when others can directly see us?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Not all of \"Ghosting\" satisfies. Mr. Pettman's primary exploration is so intriguing — and tightly argued — that excursions into, say, family abandonment, or the author's own experience of being professionally ghosted by a university department, feel perfunctory: They fill out the page count but don't expand on the book's most interesting ideas. Mr. Pettman is at his best when he tightens his focus on what one might think of as the erotic: the interplay of real others with our imagined projections, an interplay that governs the vicissitudes of human desire.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The most chilling — and exciting — idea in \"Ghosting\" is the suggestion that nobody else was ever really present in the first place. It is in our imagination, after all, that our long-desired futures appear: marriage to a man with whom one has only had one date; happiness and success in a job one may never hold. Other people are already, in some sense, absent — existing only in our mental perception or, these days, in the numinous world of our extended digital consciousness. It can be tempting to wonder, at times: Am I the only living being in a world of ghosts?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The questions underlying this fundamental tension remain unanswered here. Nor does Mr. Pettman give us a detailed account of what we ought to do about it. When it comes to presence, what do we, in fact, owe to one another? Are we destined to be perpetual ghosts in someone else's life? \"No-one owes anyone their ongoing presence,\" the author tells us, almost in passing, but doesn't convince us of why.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mr. Pettman's conclusion is that the answer lies in \"striking the right balance and having the right instincts.\" Fair enough. But his analysis of the haunted nature of our world is compelling enough to make us hunger for an equally haunting conclusion.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Ms. Burton is the author of five books, including the novel \"Here in Avalon.\"</span></li></ul></span></div></div>",

            "title": "This Wine Collector's Friends Miss Him Dearly. His Cellar Offers Comfort and a Few Surprises. — WSJ",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Lettie Teague</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When my friend Jeff Joseph died late last year, he left behind many warm memories — and over 1,000 bottles of wine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Never mind that Jeff ( whom I've written about in this column before) had sold thousands of bottles from his collection over the years, including hundreds of blue-chip Burgundies in a 2011 auction. He kept buying wine. And now his wife, Pat Jones, had to figure out what to do with all the bottles he left behind. She asked Tim Kopec, a fine wine consultant and friend, to inventory and value the wines for estate planning and sale. But another friend, John Magazino, suggested Pat might first sell some wines to a small group of friends. That group included my husband and me.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kopec fully endorsed the idea: \"I thought, 'Wouldn't it be wonderful to have some bottles that he carefully selected, spread among his friends?' \" It took Kopec several days to catalog and price all the wines in the special temperature-controlled room Jeff created in his and Pat's apartment, as well as wines stored off-site. \"In a way, it was remembering the history of my relationship with Jeff. The cellar touched all those years,\" Kopec said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Among the great bottles of Burgundy and Barolo, Kopec also discovered wines from the Canary Islands, modestly priced Albariños and even a few Argentine Malbecs. I was surprised to hear there were so many relatively simple wines. What was Jeff, the discerning collector, doing with such bottles? \"Jeff was as interested in learning as he was in collecting,\" Kopec replied.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When Kopec finished noting and pricing the wines, Pat selected just 100 to keep herself. \"I'm not a collector,\" she explained. She thought it made more sense to share them, as Magazino had suggested.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pat emailed Kopec's spreadsheet, aka the Jeff List, to a small group of friends and arranged for the bottles to be sent to a storage facility in Westchester County, N.Y., for safe keeping. Seeing the room emptied of Jeff's bottles was one of the hardest moments, Pat recalled: \"It was all so very different.\" But she found consolation in knowing Jeff's carefully curated wines would be enjoyed by his friends.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When my husband, Roger, and I received the Jeff List, several other friends had already chosen which to buy. Kopec had purchased a lot of great wines, like the 2008 Dom Pérignon Champagne, the 2008 Pol Roger Cuvée Sir Winston Churchill Champagne and the 1985 Jean-Louis Chave Hermitage. Jeff's friend Doug Polaner, owner of wine import company Douglas Polaner Selections in Mount Kisco, N.Y, bought bottles of Bruno Giacosa Barbaresco and several Domaine Joseph Drouhin wines. The latter held special meaning for Jeff, a fan of the wines as well as a good friend of Laurent Drouhin, whose family owns the domaine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For his part, Magazino deliberately sought out wines without labels. \"I knew the provenance was good,\" he explained, even if the producer and/or vintage was unknown. The prices were certainly right: Wines without labels have limited auction value. A bottle listed simply as \"1997 Old Raveneau\" went for $120 — a fraction of the price of a labeled wine from Domaine Raveneau, one of the priciest and most celebrated producers of Chablis. The wine was terrific, Magazino said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Roger and I bought some white Burgundies, including the 2010 Domaine Joseph Drouhin Chassagne Montrachet Marquis de la Guiche Morgeot ($120) and the 2008 Billecart-Salmon Cuvée Elisabeth Rosé Champagne ($160), and bargain-priced magnums of the 2014 Clos de Roilette Fleurie Beaujolais ($52) and the 2017 Edmond Cornu Les Bressandes Corton Grand Cru ($100).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We opened the Champagne and the Chassagne Montrachet within two weeks, and both were fantastic. (Thanks, Jeff.) The Drouhin was a particular delight. When I mentioned this to winemaker Véronique Drouhin, she said, \"People seeking a great white who can't afford Montrachet will always have incredible pleasure with this premier cru.\" (She was right about both our inability to afford Montrachet and the pleasure the Morgeot delivered.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I looked forward to opening one bottle in particular, the 1995 Andrew Will Winery Sorella ($40), a Bordeaux-style blend from Washington state — the wine that could easily have ended my friendship with Jeff.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It was 2008, the year billionaire Bill Koch filed lawsuits against multiple wine auction houses, alleging that they'd sold him hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of fake wine. Given how easy it was to fool such a sophisticated collector, I'd decided to try making a fake of my own — and not just any old wine, but a fake 1982 Château Mouton Rothschild, the famed 100-point first growth Bordeaux.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>My co-conspirator in the stunt (which I wrote about in my then-column for Food &amp; Wine magazine) was Chris Camarda, founder and winemaker at Andrew Will Winery. He possessed both the winemaking skills and an appetite for devilry. We tasted the real Mouton, which I'd purchased and brought to his winery on Vashon Island, Wash. Then we experimented with blending a few wines before deciding his 1995 Sorella was close in character to the Mouton. So Camarda poured the Sorella into the Mouton bottle and recorked it for me to take home.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I flew back to New York with the fake Mouton and invited several friends, wine professionals and passionate amateurs to a special 1982 Mouton dinner. They showed up with great wines of their own. Jeff brought a bottle of the 1990 Trimbach Clos Ste. Hune Riesling from Alsace and a 1989 Château Clinet, another 100-point Bordeaux. When the dinner was over and I revealed the identity of my \"Mouton,\" some friends laughed; a couple were mad. But Jeff wasn't bothered. He said it was still his \"wine of the night.\" He also said: Don't ever do that again.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Holding that bottle of 1995 Andrew Will Sorella all these years later, I was thrilled that Jeff had actually been impressed enough with the wine to buy a bottle for himself.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Of course, the wine was now three decades old. The odds were long that it would be as good as when we'd tasted it together. My husband and I opened the bottle at dinner at a BYO restaurant with our friend Burt, who knew Jeff, too. I wish I could report that the 1995 Andrew Will Winery Sorella had the same beguiling character that had impressed Jeff so long ago. Alas, it was but a shadow of its former self.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I was disappointed, but only briefly. The magic was the memory that it brought, of Jeff the collector who was open to all wine — as long as it was good. Besides, I'd brought along a second wine. As Jeff had taught me: You always need to have a backup bottle on hand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lettie's Thanksgiving Wine Hotline is open.

Its blockchain network, Shibarium, was created to bring real use and value to the project, but it has not gained much attention or activity. Developer interest and user engagement are very low, and the network’s overall growth has slowed down sharply.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Recent network issues, including technical troubles and security problems, have made things worse. Many users have left, and new projects are not joining. As a result, Shibarium now shows very little activity, leading many in the crypto community to call it a “ghost chain.” </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Shiba Inu’s Struggle To Evolve Beyond A Meme Coin</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shiba Inu tried to change its image from a simple meme coin into a real blockchain project capable of competing with other networks. The team launched Shibarium, a layer-2 blockchain, in 2023 to help make this move. However, this plan has not worked as expected, with Shibarium failing to attract developers, projects, or users and gaining no market share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to data from DeFi Llama, Shibarium has only 18 developers since it began. It is a much lower number than on other blockchains, which have hundreds or even thousands of active developers. The total value locked (TVL) on the network, which shows how much money people have invested in it, has fallen to just $878,000. </span></p><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1200px;aspect-ratio:2\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:0dcb0a1bb094b-d353c469c7b47cba865c3003b77d83d8-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Shiba Inu Shibarium\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:0dcb0a1bb094b-d353c469c7b47cba865c3003b77d83d8-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#12161a\"/></picture></div></figure></span><p class=\"\"><span>Shibarium has also failed to attract any stablecoins, which are among the most widely used tokens in decentralized finance. Not a single stablecoin project has deployed on the network, reflecting Shibarium’s lack of presence in one of the most critical areas of the crypto world. Other newer and more active layer-2 networks like Base, Arbitrum, Plasma, and Linea have already moved far ahead, leaving Shibarium behind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Hacks And The Decline Of Shibarium Network Activity</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Things got worse for the network when ShibaSwap, the most popular decentralized app (dApp) on the Shibarium network, was recently compromised. The attack eroded user confidence and forced developers to pause a key bridge connecting Shibarium to other networks. Even with the bridge now active, most of the network’s activity stopped. Many users could not move their tokens or use apps, making the network almost entirely silent.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Because of this drop in network activity, Shibarium is no longer helping burn SHIB tokens. Typically, a portion of network transaction fees goes toward buying and burning Shiba Inu tokens, helping reduce supply and support the token’s price. But now, with very few transactions, the burn process has slowed down significantly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The decline in users, developers, and activity are indicators that Shibarium’s dream of becoming a strong, useful blockchain has not come to fruition. Instead of growing into a central crypto platform, it has become what some would call the real ghost chain. </span></p></span></div></div>",
