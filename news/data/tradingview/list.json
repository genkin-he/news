Stephen Walters, chief economist at Optimal Economics says pricing for March is around 20%. \"That seems too thin,\" he adds. Inflation remains above target and the forces driving it higher are numerous, he adds. Against this backdrop it's encouraging to see some emerging recognition in Canberra that a 40-year high in government spending as a percentage of GDP is not warranted when the economy is running at fully capacity, he says(james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)</span></p></span></div></div>",

In 2025, the company issued and sold shares of Class A common stock for gross proceeds of $1,327.6 million through its Q4 2025 and Q3 2025 ATM Programs.

The company is also subject to complex tax arrangements, including a Tax Receivable Agreement that could result in substantial payments, potentially exceeding actual tax benefits.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Regulatory and Reputational Risks:</span></strong><span> Regulatory risks are significant, as the company must obtain approvals in each country it operates, and changes in U.S. trade policy could affect costs and supply chain dynamics. The public perception of nuclear energy and potential accidents pose reputational risks, while the constrained supply base could impact production schedules and costs.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Management's Discussion and Analysis:</span></strong><span> Management acknowledges the challenges of scaling production and securing contracts for NPMs. The company is focused on refining its design and manufacturing processes to enhance competitiveness.

The potential loss of government incentives for nuclear power could also adversely affect market demand.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Market Risks:</span></strong><span> NuScale is exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in electricity prices and changes in regulatory environments. The company’s ability to compete in markets with low power prices is uncertain, and inflation could increase the cost of NPMs, affecting competitiveness. Additionally, cybersecurity risks are a concern, as breaches could impact operations and reputation.

Miller</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>J.M. Smucker struck an agreement with activist investor Elliott Investment Management and appointed two new members to its board as the jam-and-jelly maker struggles with core parts of its business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Following \"constructive engagement\" with Elliott, Smucker said Woo-Sung \"Bruce\" Chung and David Singer would join its board, effective April 15. Chief Executive Mark Smucker said that the company has met several times with Elliott and that the focus is on boosting Smucker's sales, restoring profit and disciplined capital allocation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The engagement with Elliott is recent and has actually been very constructive,\" said Smucker, speaking on the company's quarterly investor call.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Marc Steinberg, partner at Elliott, said that as one of Smucker's largest investors, the firm believes the new directors and other measures represent critical steps toward ensuring the Ohio-based company reaches its full potential.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Smucker shares closed about 9% higher Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Smucker on Thursday posted higher third-quarter sales, buoyed by price increases in its coffee division, but the company lowered its sales-growth forecast for the year because of a recent fire at one of its manufacturing facilities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company reported a loss of $724.2 million, compared with a loss of $662.3 million the year prior. Adjusted earnings were $2.38 a share, above the $2.27 anticipated among analysts polled by FactSet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net sales rose 7% to $2.34 billion, outpacing analysts' expectations. The sales growth included a 10-percentage-point increase from net price realization, primarily due to higher prices for coffee.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Coffee prices surged last year after adverse weather in top coffee-producing countries hurt supply and President Trump's tariffs increased the cost to import coffee beans. The company raised prices last year in response to those increased costs. It was planning an additional price increase this winter, but held off after the U.S. excluded raw coffee from tariffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sales have struggled for Smucker's Hostess business, acquired in 2023 through a $5 billion deal that added brands like Twinkies and Donettes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Smucker said Thursday comparable sales in its sweet-baked-goods unit, which includes Hostess, declined 11% for the latest quarter. Profit fell 78% and the company said it took two impairment charges tied to Hostess totaling nearly $1 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The path to stabilization is taking longer than we expected,\" said Smucker, the CEO.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Smucker said it has been working to reduce the number of Hostess products by 25%, to focus more on Cupcakes, Twinkies and Donettes. Closing an Indianapolis plant is expected to save $30 million annually, the CEO said, and promotions are being reduced until the end of the company's fiscal year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Smucker Chief Financial Officer Tucker Marshall said it is hard to predict where Hostess's sales will go in the next fiscal year. \"But we should begin to build back profitability because we're at such a low watermark,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company narrowed its forecast for fiscal-year net sales growth to 3.5% to 4%, compared with its previous forecast of 3.5% to 4.5%. It reiterated its adjusted earnings guidance of $8.75 to $9.25 a share. Analysts see adjusted earnings of $8.99 a share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The change in the net-sales guidance was because of a recent fire at the company's Emporia, Kan., manufacturing facility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Jesse Newman at jesse.newman@wsj.com and Nicholas G.
