We expanded our addressable markets and validated technologies that position us at the center of next-generation satellite and private wireless connectivity. Throughout the year, we have made significant progress with our satellite and ground station partners and are now poised to deploy not only the satellites to replenish our existing constellation but also extend our reach with our third-generation system.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dr. Jacobs continued, \"As we enter 2026, we believe the momentum we have built gives us a strong foundation to scale. With replacement 2nd generation satellites rolling off the line, continued progress on key regulatory and network infrastructure initiatives, the commercial rollout of two-way IoT capabilities, and traction for XCOM RAN, we are moving decisively from groundwork to growth. We believe Globalstar is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated connectivity solutions that combine satellite innovation, licensed spectrum, and proprietary wireless technology to meet the evolving needs of customers worldwide.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2025 OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Advanced Development of Extended MSS Network   </span><br/><span> -- Infrastructure Investment for Long-Term Growth: Progressed </span><br/><span> global ground station expansion, including new construction and   existing site expansion in Europe, Asia and North America,   strengthening capacity, redundancy, and readiness for   next-generation services.   </span><br/><span> -- Satellite Construction Milestone Progress: Completion of </span><br/><span> critical design review for next-generation C-3 satellites   completed by MDA Space.       </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Commercial IoT Market Expansion   </span><br/><span> -- Expanded Product and Solution Portfolio: Introduced two-way </span><br/><span> satellite IoT capabilities and advanced higher-value offerings   designed to support enterprise, government, and industrial   applications requiring reliable command and control.

The increase in total revenue was due primarily to performance bonuses earned during the fourth quarter of 2025, as well as higher wholesale capacity services revenue resulting from additional service fees associated with the reimbursement of network-related costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Revenue was also impacted favorably by (1) an increase in Commercial IoT related revenue due to higher average subscribers and device sales, which was offset partially by a decline in Duplex and SPOT driven revenue due to subscriber churn; and (2) revenue recognized under our service agreement with Parsons Corporation as we moved beyond the proof of concept phase during 2025, which was offset by a decrease in revenue from XCOM RAN sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Loss from Operations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Loss from operations was $0.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to a loss from operations of $4.2 million during the prior year's fourth quarter. This improvement was due to higher revenue (as discussed above) offset partially by an increase in operating expenses (as discussed below).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the fourth quarter of 2025, higher cost of services, marketing, general and administrative (\"MG&amp;A\") expenses and cost of subscriber equipment sales were offset partially by lower stock-based compensation expenses. Higher cost of services resulted primarily from network operating costs to support the build out of our next-generation satellite and ground network infrastructure, a significant portion of which are reimbursed to us, and this consideration is recognized as revenue. Additionally, costs increased to support the development of XCOM RAN technology and new MSS products. MG&amp;A expense was higher than the prior year's fourth quarter due primarily to legal and professional fees.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The cost of subscriber equipment sales increased during the fourth quarter of 2025 due to higher hardware sales as well as $1.1 million in expense related to tariffs on equipment imported and re-exported to foreign subsidiaries. These tariffs were previously recorded as recoverable duty drawbacks but are no longer deemed probable of being refunded.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net Loss</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net loss was $11.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to net loss of $50.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. This improvement was due primarily to a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the paydown of the 2023 13% Notes recorded during the fourth quarter of 2024. Favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the remeasurement of intercompany balances as well as a non-cash gain on the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment of our derivative asset gain were offset by higher interest expense resulting from our recognition of non-cash imputed interest related to the 2024 Prepayment Agreement (as defined in our periodic reports).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA increased to $32.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to $30.4 million for the same period in 2024. This 7% increase was due to an increase in revenue of $10.8 million offset partially by a $8.8 million increase in operating expenses (excluding adjustments for non-cash or non-recurring items).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to \"Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ANNUAL FINANCIAL REVIEW</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Revenue</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total revenue was $273.0 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, including $257.3 million of service revenue and $15.7 million of revenue generated from subscriber equipment sales. Total revenue increased 9% from 2024, reaching a record high for the fourth consecutive year. This increase was due to higher service revenue and higher revenue from subscriber equipment sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Service revenue increased $19.6 million, or 8%, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024 due to increases in wholesale capacity services. Revenue from subscriber equipment sales increased $3.0 million, or 24%, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024 due to a higher volume of Commercial IoT device sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Income (Loss) from Operations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Income from operations was $7.4 million during 2025 compared to loss from operations of $0.9 million during 2024 due to higher revenue (as discussed above) offset partially by higher operating expenses (as discussed below).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Higher cost of services, MG&amp;A expense and cost of subscriber equipment sales were offset partially by lower stock-based compensation expenses. A non-cash loss on disposal of assets during the first quarter of 2025 also increased operating expenses. The drivers of higher cost of services, MG&amp;A expense and cost of subscriber equipment sales for the full year 2025 compared to 2024 are generally consistent with the quarterly increases noted above. Costs incurred to enhance and develop our XCOM RAN product and service offerings were also impacted by our recognition of certain non-cash amortized costs beginning in May 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Operating expenses were partially offset by employee retention credits received in 2025 as a result of our eligibility under the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act for 2021. The total credits of $3.9 million reduced operating expenses during 2025, of which $2.7 million was allocated to cost of services and $1.2 million was allocated to MG&amp;A expense, based on the employee costs incurred during the eligible period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net Loss</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net loss was $8.7 million for 2025 compared to $63.2 million for 2024. This improvement was due primarily to higher revenue (discussed above), net foreign currency gains due to the remeasurement of intercompany balances and non-cash gains on the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment of our derivative asset. This improvement was also due to a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the paydown of the 2023 13% Notes recorded during the fourth quarter of 2024. These favorable items were offset partially by higher operating expenses (discussed above) as well as higher interest expense resulting from our recognition of non-cash imputed interest related to the 2024 Prepayment Agreement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA was $136.1 million in 2025, reaching a record high for the Company and representing a margin of 50%. This increase from 2024 was due to a $22.6 million increase in total revenue (for reasons previously discussed), offset partially by a $21.9 million increase in operating expenses (excluding adjustments for non-cash or non-recurring items) primarily due to investment in growth opportunities. Specifically, while we continue to enhance and develop our XCOM RAN product and service offerings, we incur costs, primarily for personnel, in advance of significant revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Cash and cash equivalents were also positively impacted by a $1.2 million change in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating cash flows during 2025 included $430.6 million received in connection with the Infrastructure Prepayment and other cash flows generated from the business. Capital expenditures were primarily associated with our commitments under the Updated Services Agreements related to the deployment of the replacement satellites and Extended MSS Network.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted free cash flow during 2025 was $171.5 million compared to $131.9 million during 2024. This increase primarily includes $45.0 million in accelerated service payments received during 2025 as well as higher service payments received pursuant to the Updated Services Agreements, offset partially by higher operating costs (as discussed above). Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Free Cash Flow\".</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The principal amount of our debt was $410.0 million at December 31, 2025, compared to $417.5 million at December 31, 2024. This decrease was due to scheduled recoupments of $34.6 million under the 2021 Funding Agreement, offset partially by the issuance of $27.1 million of debt under the 2023 Funding Agreement in August 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(Capitalized terms not defined in this release have the meanings ascribed to them in our periodic reports)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>FINANCIAL GUIDANCE</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our financial guidance for 2026 is as follows:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Total revenue between $280 million and $305 million   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 50% </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company will host a conference call to discuss its results at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on Friday, February 27, 2026.

These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words \"believe,\" \"project,\" \"might,\" \"could,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"strategy,\" \"plan,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"will be,\" \"will continue,\" \"will likely result,\" and similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause or contribute to such differences include, without limitation, those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as may be further updated by subsequent filings with the SEC. Further, new risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risk factors, nor can we accurately assess the ultimate impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to amounts reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements are provided in this press release. For forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA margin, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable effort because estimating such GAAP measures and providing a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and requires a level of precision that is unavailable for these future periods and the information needed to reconcile these measures is dependent upon future events, many of which are outside of our control as described above. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures are estimated consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions.</span></p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><span>

=======    =======    =======    ======= </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>(1)    EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, </span><br/><span>       amortization, accretion and derivative (gains)/losses. Adjusted EBITDA </span><br/><span>       excludes non-cash compensation expense, reduction in the value of </span><br/><span>       assets, foreign exchange (gains)/losses, and certain other non-cash or </span><br/><span>       non-recurring charges as applicable. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to </span><br/><span>       manage the Company's business and to compare its results more closely </span><br/><span>       to the results of its peers. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not </span><br/><span>       represent and should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP </span><br/><span>       measurements, such as net loss. These terms, as defined by us, may not </span><br/><span>       be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The </span><br/><span>       Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measurement of its </span><br/><span>       operating performance. The Company believes it best reflects changes </span><br/><span>       across time in the Company's performance, including the effects of </span><br/><span>       pricing, cost control and other operational decisions. The Company's </span><br/><span>       management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the </span><br/><span>       preparation of its annual operating budget. The Company believes that </span><br/><span>       Adjusted EBITDA also is useful to investors because it is frequently </span><br/><span>       used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in </span><br/><span>       their evaluation of companies in similar industries. As indicated, </span><br/><span>       Adjusted EBITDA does not include interest expense on borrowed money or </span><br/><span>       depreciation expense on our capital assets or the payment of income </span><br/><span>       taxes, which are necessary elements of the Company's operations. </span><br/><span>       Because Adjusted EBITDA does not account for these expenses, its </span><br/><span>       utility as a measure of the Company's operating performance has </span><br/><span>       material limitations.

Couloir Capital's Senior Mining analyst, Ron Wortel, MBA, P.Eng., QP, crafted a report titled \"Drilling targeting resource development and regional consolidation, driving interest in this Nevada explorer.\" </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Report excerpt: \"We are updating our coverage of North Peak Resources as it is systematically advancing its flagship Prospect Mountain project toward an initial, near-surface gold resource by expanding and linking mineralization northward between known high-grade trends. Recent results from the first six holes (807 m) of the Wabash/Industry Tunnel drill program demonstrate this strategy in action, with encouraging halo mineralization intersected between the Wabash and Williams lodes, including 42.67 m @ 0.82 g/t Gold and 99.06 m @ 0.56 g/t Gold and the discovery of a new gold-bearing zone along the Silver Connor fault. These results not only extend the mineralized envelope northward but also illustrate that the Company is expanding a continuous mineralized system with both depth and strike potential, rather than merely chasing isolated high-grade hits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beyond the northern area, North Peak has identified a second near-surface resource opportunity at Lower PME, located at the base of the mountain and interpreted to host the Hamburg/Dunderberg contact under cover. This structure corresponds to the same fault zone that McEwen Mining is actively advancing, targeting a resource in H1 2026. McEwen's regional consolidation, most recently involving Golden Lake Exploration, now places North Peak between McEwen and i-80 Gold, both of whom are investing heavily in delineation and development across the camp. Importantly, North Peak's Lower PME target represents a down-dip extension of the system that remains open at depth.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The report can be accessed through Couloir Capital's portal: </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/y4vJOHbZGX\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.couloircapital.com/research-portal</a><span>. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Couloir Capital Ltd.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Couloir Capital Ltd. is an investment research firm with a team of experienced investment professionals providing institutional-quality research coverage for small-cap equities.

Netflix could buy another asset or go for an NFL international package. It could also just spend more on content, \"but that is not an answer for tomorrow,\" Kurnos says.

Brazil and Paraguay are expected to follow soon, Von der Leyen said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, the agreement can only be fully concluded with consent from the European Parliament, the bloc's legislative arm.
