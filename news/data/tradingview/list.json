The agritech company is the first to successfully produce multiple cycles of top-grade saffron year-round, setting a benchmark in the agricultural sector. Saffron is renowned as the world's most expensive spice, often retailing for over $10,000 per kilogram due to its labor-intensive cultivation and limited geographic supply — primarily from Iran, which accounts for over 80% of global production. Each kilogram requires harvesting 150,000 Crocus sativus flowers by hand, making saffron supply volatile, seasonal, and costly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Per the terms of the agreement, BioHarvest and Saffron Tech will collaborate to develop and commercialize saffron-derived botanical compounds using BioHarvest's patented Botanical Synthesis platform, which enables consistent, scalable, and cost-effective production of plant-based molecules without growing the plant itself. The partnership will combine BioHarvest's bioreactor-based manufacturing scale and cell-growth expertise with Saffron Tech's specially cultivated Saffron specie as well as its initial saffron cell-culture research. The initiative covers both Stage 1 and Stage 2 of CDMO development, with solid-phase and liquid-phase work conducted simultaneously — an approach that could significantly shorten the time to market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the terms of the agreement, Saffron Tech will own 75% of the developed saffron compositions, ownership IP and commercial associated rights, and BioHarvest will hold the remaining 25%. Upon the completion of the development phases of the composition, BioHarvest intends to manufacture the compound at large scale and market the compound in its direct-to-consumer e-commerce business by developing a line of nutraceutical products leveraging saffron's functional benefits which include cognitive function, eye health, and antioxidant benefits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Management Commentary – Saffron CDMO Partnership</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dr. Zaki Rakib, Chairman and Head of BioHarvest's CDMO division commented: \"We will leverage our Botanical Synthesis platform technology to research and develop saffron's valuable bioactive compounds so that they can be produced consistently, economically, and sustainably — eliminating the need for large-scale cultivation, seasonal constraints, and geopolitical dependencies. This collaboration with Saffron Tech represents a perfect example of how our Botanical Synthesis platform can redefine the economics and accessibility of high-value botanicals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Saffron is both rare and scientifically compelling — used for centuries for its wellness benefits but constrained by extreme production costs and supply chain challenges. By executing both Stage 1 and Stage 2 simultaneously, and integrating Saffron Tech's existing cell-culture work, we are dramatically accelerating our path to market. Together, we will make saffron's health-promoting compounds available at industrial scale, with consistent quality and unmatched sustainability,\" concluded Rakib.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Michael Oster, CEO of Saffron Tech, added, \"Saffron Tech's mission has always been to harness technology to expand the global impact of saffron. Partnering with BioHarvest enables us to move from cultivation to cell-based production, an approach that can finally unlock saffron's true potential in health, nutrition, and wellness markets. The combination of solid-phase and liquid-phase development will fast-track innovation while building on our existing saffron cell lines. BioHarvest's world-class Botanical Synthesis platform and manufacturing scale make them the ideal partner to help us deliver consistent, cost-effective, and sustainable saffron compounds to the world.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Saffron has traditionally been cultivated in limited regions such as Iran, Spain, and Kashmir, where its production is vulnerable to climate change, political instability, and manual labor shortages. As global demand for saffron-based wellness and functional food products grows rapidly, a sustainable, controlled production alternative is urgently needed. Through Botanical Synthesis, BioHarvest and Saffron Tech aim to revolutionize saffron ingredient production — from a field-based crop to a cell-based, precision-controlled process — ensuring stable supply, reproducible quality, and reduced environmental footprint.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Third Quarter 2025 Preliminary Results &amp; Fourth Quarter 2025 Financial Guidance</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>BioHarvest is providing preliminary unaudited revenue guidance for the third quarter of 2025, expected to be approximately $9.1M, in line with management guidance with an expected unaudited adjusted EBITDA range of ($0.7M) to ($0.4M).

Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization adjusted for stock-based compensation, cost of financing, exchange rate, fair value adjustment of convertible loan and or warrants as well as issuance of warrants. The company believes this non-IFRS measure, when considered together with the corresponding IFRS measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. However, this non-IFRS measure has significant limitations in that it does not reflect all the costs and other items associated with the operation of the company's business as determined in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the company's non-IFRS measures may be calculated differently and are therefore not comparable to similar measures by other companies. Therefore, investors should consider non-IFRS measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance in accordance with IFRS. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, its corresponding IFRS measure, is reflected in BioHarvest's quarterly earnings press releases.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Forward-Looking Statements</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Information set forth in this news release might include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current estimates, beliefs, intentions, and expectations, and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

The Shuar people, who historically inhabited the Cutucu region, did not traditionally engage in gold mining before the arrival of the Spanish. Aurania initiated modern exploration in the area, including an airborne Mobile MagnetoTellurics (MobileMT) geophysical survey in 2021. The data from that survey was reprocessed using new techniques in 2024 and 2025, revealing highly prospective new anomalies at the Awacha target (see press release dated June 27, 2025). While the state of knowledge of these areas was very preliminary in nature in 2021, now, with the benefit of hindsight from the new data acquired utilizing new technologies, age-dating, geological mapping and sampling over the last four years, a much more coherent picture has emerged. In addition, much information has been released in the public filings of Lundin Gold and Solaris from the adjacent and contiguous Cordillera del Condor, immediately south of Aurania's block of concessions, providing further geological context for Aurania's target areas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Geological Context of Aurania's Cutucu Project</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Cordillera de Cutucu and the Cordillera del Condor are part of a Jurassic back-arc rift system which extends roughly north-south through the whole of Ecuador. In the two Cordilleras, the fault system which demarcated the Jurassic rift basins was later reactivated and reversed in the Tertiary, forming the height-of-land characteristic of the Cordilleras. The mineralizing systems were then unroofed by erosion and exposed. In the case of the Condor, the erosion and uplift have removed several kilometres of sedimentary cover, exposing many copper porphyry systems and generating large areas of placer gold mineralization where epithermal vein systems have been entirely eroded away. In the Cutucu, the sedimentary cover over the mineralizing systems remains largely intact, so that the very tops of epithermal systems comprising hotspring sinters and siliceous terraces are preserved; the main body of the epithermal systems, as well as likely porphyry systems, remain preserved at depth. Additionally, the Cutucu shows abundant evidence that the fault basins contained playa lakes that evaporated to dryness, depositing thick layers of salt and gypsum. Conditions became favourable for the mobilization of copper and silver in saline fluids from volcanic rocks into shales and sandstones. This combination of unique geological conditions deposited and preserved extensive sheets of copper-silver mineralization in sediments, akin to Kamoa-Kakula, Dzezkazgan, and the Kupferschiefer. To date, this type of sediment-hosted style copper mineralization remains untested by drilling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Blind Deposit Exploration</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the Cutucu, the porphyry and epithermal systems outcrop rather poorly or not at all. Their presence is not obvious but is revealed by geophysics and geochemistry. The world-class Fruta del Norte (FDN) gold-silver deposit, approximately 100 km to the south in the more deeply eroded Condor, was fortuitously preserved in a down-dropped graben block and covered by a Cretaceous sandstone which protected it from erosion. This was a \"blind discovery\" since there was very little gold on the surface. Its discovery by Aurania's predecessor company Aurelian Resources, founded by Dr. Barron, came through the application of geochemical sampling for pathfinder-type elements, i.e., other metals which occur in gold systems but are much more abundant and more easily detected than gold itself. Early application of this methodology in the Cutucu led Aurania to the discovery of Crunchy Hill, Kuri-Yawi and other epithermal prospects. Actively artisanal-mined gold alluvials at Patuca, just outside the Aurania concession block, were determined to be derived from eroded early Cretaceous paleoplacers; in other words, the placer gold accumulations were more or less coincident in time with the epithermal vein system formation some 230 million years ago. This suggests that at least some of the sinter systems spread out over 30 kilometres within the Aurania claims could host another bonanza-grade type FDN.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Prospective Graben Settings</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Intensive geological mapping has shown there are at least two, and possibly three, down-dropped grabens arrayed north-south through the Project. These became apparent after very careful reconnaissance mapping and reinterpretation of the biostratigraphy of the fossil endowment. Grabens form through extensional forces in the earth that pull apart the rocks horizontally. The central block will fall vertically into the space created and a deep canyon may result. The extensional spreading allows intrusion of porphyry-producing magmas, producing hot hydrothermal fluids that can pond in the dilatant zones: grabens are recognized as one of the most productive mineralizing environments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Aurania Among First Industry Users of MobileMT</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the time of the initial MobileMt survey, Electromagnetic (EM) data inversion was performed using a one-dimensional (1D) algorithm. In recent years, EM inversion technology has significantly improved, particularly for areas with rugged terrain. As a result, Aurania recommissioned Expert Geophysics Surveys Inc. to reprocess the 2021 MobileMT data using the latest 2D inversion technology. The 2.5D inversion code that was applied is more objective and comprehensive than the previous 1D technology, as it considers the actual topography of the area being investigated, yielding robust lateral and vertical resolution, resulting in more accurate mapping of the subsurface conductivity, which may be related to mineralization.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aurania was one of the very first companies worldwide to adopt MobileMT, but there were few publicly-available examples to demonstrate the expected geophysical signature of porphyry deposits using the MobileMT method. For a \"real world\" test and ground truthing, Aurania had the contractors fly over the known Panantza and San Carlos porphyry copper bodies outside of our concessions. These were proven deposits with extensive drilling. The MobileMT results generated outstanding signatures, with close spatial correlation of the ore bodies with strongly anomalously geophysical signatures. Based on this test study we flew large portions of our project using the MobileMT method, yielding several anomalies. The mineralized area of the Panantza/San Carlos test grid had only minor topographic relief, however, unlike our area in the much more rugged Cutucu. The primitive 1-D data inversion available at the time was unable to correct for the more rugged terrain, and we later drilled some targets that subsequently proved to be spurious. We have great confidence in the improved 2.5-D reprocessing of our data to produce reliable results: the new processing method accounts for the more significant terrain correction, and the new anomalies agree well with known geology, other geophysics and the porphyry copper exploration model.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Lost Cities Cutucu Project</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aurania's Lost Cities Cutucu Project was an outgrowth of historical research in the Archive of the Indies, Seville, and the Vatican Library, which suggested that the rich gold mines of Logroño de Los Caballeros and Sevilla del Oro, active circa 1565-1605 were in the Cutucu Cordillera. The Company used an extremely innovative approach with Metron Inc. of Reston, Virginia, a company that uses Bayesian Theory in geo-location of lost objects, including downed aircraft. Metron successfully located Logroño, which is a large alluvial plain along the Rio Santiago, just off our concession block. This was confirmed by the recovery of large amounts of alluvial gold by our geologists. We believe that this gold deposit was in part fed from our property. Attempts to partner with the construction company owning the gold alluvial area have to date been unsuccessful. Sevilla del Oro remains \"lost\" but it is believed to be in the drainage basin of the Pastaza River and outside our concessions. Aurania can find no evidence of past mining activity on the copper-silver, and lead-zinc-silver showings on our concessions. Dr. Barron's experience in Guatemala, Mexico and Colombia suggests that the Colonial Spanish would have sunk shafts and adits on any of these areas had they been known at that time. We believe that these are virgin areas. The road network detected on the concessions by LiDAR surveying is almost certainly pre-Colombian and could be many thousands of years old and related to the lost culture in the Upano Valley, north of Macas. It appears that the pre-Shuar inhabitants mined and transported salt along these roads.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Aurania's Target Areas in the Cutucu</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Awacha, Sunka, Kirus, Awacha Norte</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These prospect areas were initially revealed from a 400 metre-spaced airborne magnetometer and radiometric survey carried out in 2017. To date, Awacha has been the focus of our exploration efforts, but all prospects remain undrilled. Awacha and Awacha North appear to be in an area of uplift where early Jurassic rock is at surface. These prospects do not outcrop well, being covered by a thin stratum of mudstone, which in the ravines is eroded away sufficiently to expose porphyry intrusives. In addition, stream sediment sampling produced wide anomalous areas of several kilometres extent where copper and molybdenum were elevated. At both Awacha and Awacha North, zones of classic-type QSP (quartz-sericite-pyrite) alteration and \"D-type\" mineralized veinlets with molybdenite and chalcopyrite are present. D-type veins are very distinctive with a medial septum of sulphide, only seen in magmatic systems like porphyries. Awacha has been mapped in detail using the Anaconda mapping method. The recasting of the MobileMT survey has shown possible presence of six discrete porphyry bodies (see press release dated June 27, 2025). Awacha North has been cursorily mapped but not explored with MobileMT. We believe that Awacha and Awacha Norte represent multiple potential Cu-Mo porphyry bodies in a cluster, much like Solaris' Warintza area, located south of Aurania's concessions. Sunka and Kirus areas have yielded porphyry-style mineralization but have not been mapped in detail.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crunchy Hill, Kuri-Yawi, Apai, Kuripan etc.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This collection of targets has high potential for epithermal-type gold-silver veining. These targets were discovered fortuitously very early in Aurania's exploration efforts in the area, near the paved road where excellent access facilitated sampling. Apart from Crunchy Hill, all contain siliceous hotspring sinter on the surface, with evidence of reeds and other plants entombed in the splash zone of geysers. Very distinctive \"geyserite\" has also been found. This is a rock of solidified tiny spheres of quartz that represent sand grains on which silica nucleated as they were tumbled in the convecting hotspring. Hotspring-type rocks are located immediately above the ore zone at FDN, and Aurania staff were considerably encouraged by their discovery. Epithermal banded veins have been encountered by drilling, but fluid inclusion paleothermometry indicated that trapping temperatures were low, though salinities high. This means we were drilling on the periphery of the systems or not deep enough where the mineralizing fluids had already deposited their metals and were cooling. Only determined and persevering exploration with the drill will guarantee discovery. The results of an Induced Polarization (IP) Survey were ambivalent. Recasting of the MobileMT over Kuri-Yawi, however, strongly suggests two areas of potential sulphide flooding related to epithermal processes, as well as a deeper zone that bears the signature of a buried porphyry body. The Crunchy Hill area has not been covered by MobileMT. Crunchy Hill is a zone of disseminated sulphide with minor epithermal veining, which is enriched in the pathfinder elements Ag, As, Mn, Sb, Se, Tl, and Hg. Further geophysical surveys and a drilling campaign are required.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tsenken</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tsenken was a wholly unexpected target area. Early in the exploration, the field assistants returned from the field with specimens over half a metre in size and more than 50 kg weight of significant amounts of chalcocite (a copper-rich (80% Cu) sulphide mineral) in bedded shales and sandstones. This sediment-hosted style of high-grade copper-silver mineralization, common to the large and high-grade copper deposits of Central Africa and the Kupferschiefer, was previously unrecognized in Ecuador and represent a compelling new exploration target. Informed by our early version of the MobileMT over this area we drilled several targets that unfortunately turned out to be duds. The problem was a misinterpretation of the sedimentary stratigraphy in this area, which was only sorted out by Professor Gregor Borg and Consultant Cristian Vallejo after a number of holes had been drilled. These sorts of copper deposits occur in areas of maximum fluid flow where there are favourable and reactive host rocks. By initiating a serious study of analogues from Ivanhoe Mines' Kamoa-Kakula Deposit in the Central African Copper Belt, we were very excited to discover a large arcuate zone of high conductivity that parallels the surface trace of a major fault and subcropping Santiago Formation for 14 kilometres. The Santiago is a pyritic carbonaceous mudstone unit which could be an analogue to the chemically reactive pyritic diamictite that hosts most of the copper at Kamoa-Kakula. The coincidence of a strongly copper-mineralized rock indicating the presence of an effective mineralizing system, subsurface conductivity anomaly associated with a known fault/plumbing system and receptive host stratigraphy makes Tsenken highly prospective. This target remains undrilled.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tiria-Shimpia</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Tiria-Shimpia zone appears to be localized along the east side of a graben fault and is hosted by limestone. The mineralization consists of semi-massive and vein-hosted Zn-Pb-Ag-Ba-bearing minerals and could represent the distal expression of the Tsenken copper-silver system. Extending for over nine kilometres and only partly covered by the MobileMT survey, it has been explored with four drill holes, all of which encountered mineralization.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tatasham</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Tatasham target corresponds to a magnetic low lying within a major magnetic high anomaly. This magnetic low is interpreted as a classic de-magnetization of the rock by hydrothermal alteration related to the core of a porphyry system. The Anaconda mapping conducted in the area confirmed the presence of an intensive hydrothermal alteration, which justified a scout drilling campaign in 2023. The third drill hole intersected a thick silicified zone interpreted as the distal portion of an epithermal system at the same stratigraphic level as the sinter horizon. This indicates that we are in the upper level of the epithermal-porphyry system with the Tatasham prospect representing an epithermal target likely overlying a porphyry system at depth. Follow-up field verification confirmed the presence of sinters and extensive hydrothermal breccias. The thickness of the near-surface silicified system is comparable to that of Fruta del Norte and is situated within a small graben of similar age. Additional surface exploration is warranted to delineate the sinter zone and define targets for the next phase of drilling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Conclusion</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the last two years, Aurania has engaged with four major companies in discussions of potential collaboration. In each case, the due diligence phase has taken more than six months. Two field visits were made, and a third was cancelled due to the assassination of a political candidate in the lead-up to elections. In each case, Aurania was praised for choosing to keep the large landholding intact, maximizing the chances for discovery, and for the diligent exploration work and positive engagement with the Shuar stakeholder community in Ecuador. Though the exploration market appears to be improving due to rising metal prices, junior explorers, particularly in greenfield areas, still struggle to raise adequate project funding. Aurania's technical team are convinced that the Cutucu land package is one of the last areas left of significant mineral potential in the South American Cordillera that may have the potential to yield several new mines. Pioneering is not easy, nor does it yield the quick results preferred by investors and other stakeholders. It requires patience and perseverance, but the rewards can be spectacular.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Current Situation in Ecuador and Recently Imposed Mining Service Fee</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As announced in our press releases July 28, 2025 and June 11, 2025, the Company has been assessed a $24.1 million USD mining service fee (the \"TASA\") annually by the Government of Ecuador, ostensibly to fight illegal mining in the country. This is an industry-wide fee and is assessed by area under concessions. Aurania has no illegal mining on the concessions; nevertheless, the demand still stands. Comments have appeared in the Mining Journal, Bloomberg and Forbes regarding the potential damage the TASA would cause to the exploration industry in Ecuador and to date, we are aware of seven Constitutional Challenges that have been brought about, questioning its legality.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The recent initiatives presented by President Noboa have triggered conflict with the Court and widespread social unrest in Ecuador. This has resulted in clashes, nationwide protests, road closures, direct attacks on the President, and significant disruptions across multiple regions. Given the current circumstances, the Company has chosen to suspend all activity in Ecuador and take a \"wait and see\" attitude. In the meantime, the Company remains optimistic about its strategy to focus its efforts on projects for gold and strategic metals in Europe, along with potential opportunities elsewhere.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Qualified Persons:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The geological information contained in this news release has been verified and approved by Aurania's VP Exploration, Mr. Jean-Paul Pallier, MSc.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Balazs Koranyi</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    The euro zone economy grew a touch more quickly than expected in the third quarter, lifted by buoyant growth in France and Spain that more than offset faltering exports and persistent struggles in Germany's oversized industrial sector. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The economy of the 20 nations sharing the euro expanded by 0.2% in July to September, Eurostat data showed, beating expectations for 0.1% increase in a Reuters poll and confirming the bloc's resilience despite stagnation in Germany and Italy.     </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On an annualised basis, the economy grew by 1.3%, Thursday's data showed - ahead of expectations for 1.2% and a level economists consider to be around its natural rate of growth without stimulus. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>FRANCE AND SPAIN CARRY THE BLOC</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The mood about the economy seems decently optimistic at the moment, despite ample downside risks clearly weighing on the outlook,\" ING economist Bert Colijn said. \"We do expect a gradual acceleration of growth over the coming year but remain cautious about marking this as the start of a growth spurt.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Spain remained the best performer among the bloc's largest economies, growing 0.6% on the quarter, in line with forecasts, while France expanded by 0.5%, beating expectations for 0.2%. Germany and Italy both stagnated. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thursday's figures ease pressure on the ECB to cut interest rates any further in the near term as they confirm the central bank's longstanding view that the economy is proving resilient to this year's unusual spike in uncertainty.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Backing the resilience narrative, unemployment held at a near-record low 6.3% in September, separate Eurostat data showed. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>GERMANY IS STILL THE PROBLEM CHILD</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Germany, which has broadly stagnated for the past three years as its industry lost competitiveness, remains the bloc's problem child but a massive increase in government spending is likely to prop up growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     It may however take a few more months or even quarters before that spending starts to make its way into the economy, raising the risk of further growth weakness in the near term. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Leading indicators like the Ifo business climate survey and PMI indices are pointing to a beginning economic recovery in the fourth quarter, but its momentum will remain weak initially given ongoing geopolitical and trade-related uncertainty and negative media perceptions of the initial work of the new German government,\" Timo Klein at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence said.    </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While trade tensions, lingering uncertainty and Chinese dumping of surplus goods could still weigh on growth in the months ahead, economists remain relatively upbeat about the outlook and ECB projections suggest the third quarter may have been the worst for some time. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Growth could pick up as past interest rate cuts work their way through the economy, households sit on ample savings, Germany boosts spending, uncertainty over tariffs eases and inventories continue to run low. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Business activity, as measured by a key Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) survey, is already showing a pick-up, while sentiment in Germany, the bloc's biggest economy, is improving and business are becoming more optimistic, partly due to lower tariff uncertainty. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But any growth pick-up is likely to be modest as the rigid structure of the euro zone economy limits activity, say economists, who predict growth in the 1.2% to 1.5% range for years to come.</span></p></span></div></div>",
