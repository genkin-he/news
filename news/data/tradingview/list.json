Besides, risk-off vibes are clearly at play with Bunds outperforming eurozone government bond peers, while weaker tech stocks and rising oil prices also fit the picture, the rates strategists says. French, Spanish and German inflation data for February are due, while France and Spain will release details of their respective government bond auctions next week. On Thursday, the 10-year German Bund yield fell to an intraday low of 2.6840%, a three-month low. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

This week, the company signed a share sale agreement to dispose of its entire stake in Jupiter Hotels in the U.K., which have been classified as noncore owing to their non-prime locations, the analyst notes. Management assessed the carrying value of assets held for disposal against estimated net proceeds from a sale and recognized the difference as impairment loss in 4Q. The brokerage is positive on the disposal. It raises the stock's target price to THB3.00 from THB2.30 with an unchanged add rating. Shares are 5.5% higher at THB1.91.
