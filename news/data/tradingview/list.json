            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Randall W. Forsyth</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Federal Reserve's policy meeting this week sent shock waves through the markets, with Chair Jerome Powell's warning that a further interest-rate cut at its December gathering was far from assured, contrary to expectations that another quarter-percentage-point move was all but certain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By contrast, it's unlikely that a similar impact will be felt when the Treasury Department outlines its borrowing plans this coming week. Treasury plans typically don't get nearly the attention of central bank announcements. But its statement could affect bonds, and in turn other asset prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's because the mix of Uncle Sam's securities sales could affect yields just as Fed operations do. By continuing to lean heavily on short-term Treasury bill sales and not increasing issuance of lengthier notes and bonds, the government could lower the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note by a third of a percentage point over the medium term, according to one estimate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's no small matter to the Trump administration. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last February that he and President Donald Trump were focused on the 10-year Treasury, which importantly influences other borrowing costs, especially home mortgage rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The president further said in June that he wanted to refinance $9 trillion in maturing Treasuries with short-term debt, which would be replaced after Powell's term as Fed chair ends next May. \"Then we're gonna get somebody into the Fed who's going to be able to lower [the rates],\" he said in an interview with Fox Business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Boosting T-bills' portion of total Treasury financing, from around 20% of the total currently — while holding issuance of notes and bonds steady — would have the same effect as reducing the supply of 10-year notes by $1 trillion over the current fiscal year and next, according to a report this past week from BofA Securities' rate strategists led by Meghan Swiber. They estimate that would reduce the benchmark yield by between 31 and 34 basis points (or hundredths of a percentage point) over time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In effect, the BofA strategists write, increasing the T-bill share of federal financing amounts to \"backdoor QE,\" or quantitative easing. That's when the Fed purchases securities, which colloquially would be called \"printing money.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is no small irony in this. Last year, Bessent criticized the Treasury, then led by Janet Yellen, for leaning on short-term T-bills in order to hold down longer-term rates ahead of the 2024 election. But he has continued that Biden administration borrowing schedule.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bessent was joined in that criticism last year by Stephen Miran, who co-authored a paper with Nouriel Roubini. \"Activist Treasury issuance\" practices, they wrote, were \"dynamically managing financial conditions and through them, the economy, usurping core functions of the Federal Reserve.\" Miran, of course, is now a Fed governor while on leave from the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and this past week dissented for a second time in favor of more aggressive rate cuts by the central bank.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reducing the available supply of risk-free longer-term securities results in easier financial conditions, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke wrote in a Washington Post op-ed column in November 2010, as the central bank was undertaking another round of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, purchases. Conversely, the supply of longer-dated government paper can be kept low by the Treasury limiting their sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most analysts look for the Treasury to hold its longer-maturity issuance steady in the coming quarter. But a surprise cut in the 10-to-30-year range could prompt a yield decline of 10 basis points and as much as 20, according to a note this past week from Wells Fargo strategist Angelo Manolatos. More than the actual size of the reduction, the market will react to the signal sent by such a shift in financing plans, he added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Manolatos sees the Treasury continuing to ramp up its T-bill issues to 24% of the market by the end of 2027, from 21.5% as of September. J.P. Morgan fixed-income strategists led by Jay Barry estimate that T-bills' share could hit 27% by the end of 2028, if the Treasury solely used bills and didn't boost note and bond auctions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stepped-up bill issuance by the Treasury would jibe with the Fed's announced end of quantitative tightening, which was anticipated. In addition to no longer letting $5 billion a month of Treasury securities run off at maturity, it will reinvest principal payments on agency mortgage securities into T-bills. JPM's strategists estimate that the Fed will buy $15 billion a month in T-bills from MBS proceeds plus another $8 billion a month to offset bank reserve drains from currency demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another growing source of demand comes from stablecoins, which are mainly backed by T-bills. The largest is Tether's, which had $157 billion of its stablecoins outstanding at the end of the second quarter, backed by $105.5 billion of T-bills and $16.3 billion overnight repurchase agreements backed by Treasuries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That makes Tether one of the largest nonsovereign T-bill holders, with about 2% of total supply. (By comparison, the Fed held $195.5 billion of T-bills out of its $4.2 trillion Treasury portfolio as of Wednesday.) One recent paper estimates that a one-percentage-point increase in Tether's share of the T-bill market could reduce yields by 14 to 16 basis points.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One big question mark is the fate of tariffs imposed by the White House under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Supreme Court is considering the legality of the IEEPA tariffs and will hear oral arguments on Wednesday. If the tariffs are struck down, J.P. Morgan estimates $100 billion of tariff revenue could be eligible for refunds, though it expects actual refund payments would be less and a smaller drain of the Treasury's cash.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beyond influencing interest rates and the economy, Treasury's plans affect federal debt, which just passed $38 trillion, with red ink likely headed to $2 trillion annually over the coming decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Every basis point saved in financing costs counts. Interest on the national debt is headed to $1 trillion annually, the fiscal watchdog group adds, which exceeds defense expenditures. But leaning too heavily on T-bills can backfire if short-term rates would have to rise materially.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Randall W.

All eyes will also be on whether U.S. lawmakers can agree to end the government shutdown, which prevents the release of key economic data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Elsewhere, focus will center on central bank interest-rate decisions in the U.K. and Australia, as well as a number of other countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Sweden, Norway and Malaysia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In Asia, purchasing managers' surveys, including from China, will be closely watched as U.S. trade policy continues to set the tone for the region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Upcoming U.S. economic data will be scrutinized after the Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates by 25 basis points, as expected, but Chair Jerome Powell said a follow-up rate reduction in December wasn't a foregone conclusion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors will, therefore, be looking for any evidence of weakness in the labor market or evidence that inflation is slowing, which could increase prospects of a December rate cut. Investors are less sure about prospects for December's meeting after the latest Fed announcement, with money markets currently pricing in a 68% chance of another rate reduction then.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the U.S. government shutdown continues, however, this will mean official data, including key U.S. jobs figures, will still not be released.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors will, therefore, focus closely on private-sector data, notably the ISM surveys on manufacturing activity in October due on Monday and on services activity due on Wednesday, as well as ADP private payrolls figures on Wednesday and University of Michigan's preliminary consumer survey for November on Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These \"will be more closely watched than usual for indications on the health of the labour market and inflationary pressures,\" HSBC economists said in a note.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, markets will await any news when the government could be reopened.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Scheduled data which won't be released unless the government reopens include trade data and factory orders figures on Tuesday, weekly jobless claims figures Thursday and monthly jobs data on Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are no Treasury auctions but the quarterly refunding announcement is due on Wednesday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. Treasury is set to hold auction sizes steady for a seventh consecutive quarter at the November refunding announcement on Nov. 5, TD Securities' Gennadiy Goldberg and Jan Nevruzi said in a note.

Still, recent gross domestic product data for August were weaker than expected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The latest rate cut will likely be the last one in the current cycle, but if the economy or labor market weakens more than expected the central bank could trim rates a little further, Oxford Economics' Tony Stillo and Michael Davenport said in a note.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Latin America</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Brazil's central bank announces a rate decision on Wednesday and is expected to leave rates unchanged at 15.00%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The gradual and steady re-anchoring process of inflation expectations and the current domestic slowdown are likely to continue improving the inflation outlook going forward,\" Citi analysts said in a note. They expect the central bank to begin gradually lowering rates in the first quarter of 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mexico's central bank is also set to announce a decision on Thursday, where it is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points in order to bolster the economy, taking the key interest rate down to 7.25%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Eurozone</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A quiet week in data follows the European Central Bank's policy meeting, where rates were left unchanged amid a relatively upbeat view on the eurozone's growth outlook.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Spanish, Italian, French, German and eurozone final manufacturing purchasing managers indexes for October are up for release on Monday, followed by services PMIs on Wednesday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Germany publishes manufacturing orders data for September on Wednesday and industrial output figures on Thursday.

ING analyst Francesco Pesole said in a note that solid Swedish economic growth argues against the Riksbank cutting interest rates again any time soon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Norges Bank is also expected to keep rates on hold at 4.0%, confirming it is in no hurry to increase rates further.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Denmark and Sweden will hold bond auctions on Wednesday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Poland</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Poland's central bank will announce a policy decision on Wednesday where another interest-rate cut is widely expected. Market pricing implies an 85% chance of another 25 basis points rate cut to 4.25%, LSEG data show.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the October meeting, the central bank unexpectedly cut rates by 25 basis. It marked the fourth cut this year and came after inflation held at 2.9% in September, coming in below expectations. Data Friday showed inflation eased to 2.8% in October, strengthening the case for further rate cuts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Czech Republic</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Czech National Bank announces its latest interest-rate decision on Thursday. Markets are pricing a 65% probability that the central bank will leave rates unchanged at 3.5% and a 35% chance of a 25 basis-point cut, LSEG data show.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While inflation eased to 2% in September, stronger-than-expected economic growth data argues that the central bank should be cautious about cutting rates, ING analyst Chris Turner said in a note.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The economy is growing at its fastest pace since the Covid rebound, and at the same time, wages are showing upside, which will keep core inflation higher,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Switzerland</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Switzerland releases consumer-price inflation data for October on Monday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Japan</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Wednesday, the Bank of Japan will release minutes from its September meeting that will shed light into the central bank's decision to hold rates steady. At that meeting, two board members proposed hiking the policy rate to 0.75%, a proposal that was ultimately defeated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Japan's finance ministry is set to auction about 2.6 trillion yen of 10-year Japanese Government bonds on Wednesday. The sale could draw strong demand from investors following BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda's recent comments after the central bank held rates steady again in October. He said he sees no risk of Japan falling behind the policy curve, suggesting the BOJ is in no rush to tighten policy settings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He also said the central bank wants to further assess wage growth momentum and review more economic data before considering rate increases.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Japanese markets will be closed on Monday for a national holiday. Auto sale figures for October, a gauge of consumer demand, are due Tuesday, while household spending data will be released Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Markets will focus on a fresh batch of economic data from China following the recent easing of U.S.-China trade tensions. The two countries' leaders recently held their first face-to-face meeting in six years, agreeing to a temporary truce that included lowering tariffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A private gauge for factory activity for the month of October--compiled before the meeting-is expected to show a slowdown in momentum. The RatingDog manufacturing PMI, due Monday, is likely to have edged down to 50.0 from 51.2 in September amid slowing export growth, Nomura analysts said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Capital Economics' Zichun Huang noted that while private PMI readings have been stronger than official data recently, \"the message is likely to be that growth momentum remains subdued, and we don't expect that to change in the coming quarters.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China is also set to release October trade data on Friday. Nomura analysts expect export growth to slow sharply to 3.0% on year from 8.3% in September and import growth to ease to 5.0% from 7.4%, marginally widening the trade surplus to $94 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ANZ's Raymond Yeung projects exports and imports growth of just 1.2% and 2.3%, respectively, in U.S. dollar terms, citing fewer working days during the month and a high base last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China's foreign-exchange reserves data is also scheduled for release during the week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Australia/New Zealand</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Reserve Bank of Australia will dominate the spotlight on Tuesday with a likely decision to leave interest rates unchanged at 3.60%, while signaling an extended period on the sidelines.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Third-quarter inflation came in well above expectations, effectively wiping out any near-term prospects for rate cuts. The RBA also faces surging house prices, which argue strongly against easing for now.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With core inflation back at the top of the RBA's target range, some economists are even speculating that the next move in rates will be upward--but not until 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The RBA has only cut rates three times in total and raised them less than many of its global peers, so a shallow easing cycle was always likely.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In New Zealand, third-quarter employment data due Wednesday are expected to show the jobless rate remaining above 5.0%. Despite significant rate cuts over the past year, New Zealand's economy remains weak and employment growth has yet to recover.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has said much of its policy easing has yet to reach households, many of which have fixed mortgage rates. With spare capacity still high, the RBNZ is expected to continue lowering rates over the coming months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Asia PMIs</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Monday sees a slew of PMI prints for Asia that will provide fresh signals on how tariff policies have affected manufacturing activity and sentiment in the region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The readings, capturing manufacturing trends in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and other Asian economies, will likely show continued divergence across the region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The prior round of purchasing managers surveys indicated an uptick in output at the end of the third quarter, but also weak spots in exports and subdued demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Markets will scrutinize October's data for signs of improving market conditions for Asia's manufacturers. Producers in export powerhouses like Japan and Taiwan have flagged deteriorating demand and sentiment toward the outlook for the months ahead has soured in some parts of the region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite fears that Asia's exports growth will fade in the second half of the year, figures from recent months do not reflect that, ANZ's research team said, highlighting particularly strong demand for electronic goods.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Malaysia</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bank Negara Malaysia is scheduled to announce its November policy decision Thursday afternoon. Given stronger-than-expected third-quarter GDP growth, there is \"little reason\" for the central bank to cut its policy rate in the near term, Barclays said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking ahead, GDP growth for 2026 is expected to remain firm at 4.5%, supported by new budget measures aimed at boosting private consumption and investment amid lingering external challenges and ongoing fiscal reforms, UOB economists Julia Goh and Loke Siew Ting said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This steady growth outlook should allow Bank Negara to keep the policy rate unchanged at 2.75% throughout the year, they added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Indonesia</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Indonesia will release September's trade and October inflation data Monday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Export growth likely rebounded due to favorable base effects and strong external demand, Barclays said. Looking ahead, Indonesia's trade ties with the U.S. could continue to weigh on the exports due to higher tariffs, while imports may benefit from reciprocal arrangements, UOB economists Enrico Tanuwidjaja and Vincentius Ming Shen said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Citi expects October inflation at 2.81% from 2.65% in September, driven by higher food prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Core inflation likely eased to 2.06% from 2.19% amid moderate demand, ANZ said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bank Indonesia's pro-growth stance suggests the easing cycle isn't over, with ANZ expecting two additional 25-basis-point cuts, bringing the policy rate down to 4.25% by the first quarter of next year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Indonesia's statistics bureau will release third-quarter GDP data Wednesday afternoon. Growth likely eased to 5.0% from 5.12% in the prior quarter, ANZ said. Indicators point to weaker consumer confidence, slower car sales, moderated loan growth, softer capital goods imports and budget disbursement delays, it said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net exports likely provided some support, while fourth-quarter stimulus measures worth 46 trillion rupiah, equivalent to 0.2% of GDP, should help boost private consumption, ANZ added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>South Korea</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>South Korea is due to release its October inflation data Tuesday. Headline inflation likely picked up marginally, according to a Wall Street Journal survey.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The median forecast from a WSJ poll of seven economists calls for a 2.2% on-year rise in the benchmark consumer-price index, following a 2.1% gain in September.

DBS's economics team thinks exports growth likely slowed but stayed solid at about 30% on year as the delay in U.S. semiconductor tariffs encouraged frontloading and AI-related demand remained strong.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The trade data will be preceded by inflation figures for October that will likely show an uptick in price growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Economists at HSBC point out the pullback in September was down to tax cuts, and the timing of the Mid-Autumn festival.
