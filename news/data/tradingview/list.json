We launched a surgical collaboration pilot in Savonlinna and initiated the 65plus services in line with Kela’s freedom-of-choice pilot. We also began reforming our operating model, including related change negotiations. After the review period, the Wellbeing Services County of Pirkanmaa selected Pihlajalinna as the service provider for the outsourcing of services in Northern Pirkanmaa.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our profitability continued to strengthen. Adjusted EBITA increased to EUR 14.4 (13.5) million, with an adjusted EBITA margin of 9.7 per cent (8.2). Our financial position continued to strengthen, and the net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6. Revenue decreased as expected to EUR 148.7 (164.0) million due to the controlled transfer of outsourcing agreements to the Wellbeing Services Counties. Additionally, the divestments of residential care units also contributed to the decrease in revenue but partly increased earnings per share to EUR 0.51 (0.26).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Revenue from </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Private Healthcare Services segment</span></strong><span> increased to EUR 105.2 (103.7) million, with the adjusted EBITA margin remaining at 7 per cent, the same level as the comparison period. While our service offering remained strong during the summer months, demand was weaker than in the previous year. Public sector cost-saving pressures kept service voucher purchases and direct procurement volumes low. A temporary change in customer guidance by an insurance partner in the second quarter also affected the number of care pathways in the third quarter. Fixed-price occupational healthcare contracts continued to weigh on profitability, but our actions in them are progressing as planned. We continued to implement measures aimed at business growth and profitability, with results gradually becoming visible in Private Healthcare Services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Public Services segment</span></strong><span>, revenue decreased as expected to EUR 46.3 (62.9) million. The segment’s adjusted EBITA margin rose to 16.4 per cent (9.9 per cent). We continued the controlled transfer of outsourcing agreements’ services to the Wellbeing Services Counties. At the end of August operations of Jämsän Terveys and Jokilaakso hospital were transferred to the Wellbeing Services County of Central Finland. Similarly, the social services of Kuusiolinna Terveys were transferred to the Wellbeing Services County of South Ostrobothnia. The quarter also included the sale of two residential care units. Customer experience in Public Services improved to 80 (76). We have been able to deliver high-quality customer-oriented services in a changing operating environment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In September, a new model of public-private partnership was launched at Savonlinna hospital, leveraging our unique expertise developed at Jokilaakso Hospital. In collaboration with the Wellbeing Services County of South Savo, we primarily provide joint replacement surgeries. As part of the pilot, we also offer outpatient and surgical services to private and insurance customers. Together with our partner, we are reforming healthcare in a cost-effective and impactful way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Kela freedom-of-choice pilot for people aged 65 and over began, and Pihlajalinna’s 65plus services were successfully launched. The number of customers aligns with our market share, and customer satisfaction is excellent (NPS 98).

The estimated total value of the procurement over the five-year contract period is at least EUR 222 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In spring 2025, we renewed our strategy and are transitioning to a new operating model.

Iltalehti’s position as Finland’s largest news media outlet was reinforced, and new content concepts such as Kauppalehti’s technology section and the daily Talousaamu broadcasts were launched.

Validators propose new blocks, confirm transactions, and-most importantly-generate attestations, which are cryptographic votes on the validity of newly proposed blocks. These attestations are digital signatures submitted by validators to confirm both the block and its underlying transactions. This attestation mechanism forms the foundation for a wide range of general-purpose, on-chain use cases that are increasingly adopted by both public- and private-sector actors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since the attestation process will require the Company to hold and stake ETH under the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, the Company has established an ETH-denominated treasury. The Company records ETH as a core operational asset on its balance sheet and requires ETH to support validator activation and infrastructure growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Summary</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>To support the Company's primary business objective above, the Company is focused on the following two pillars:</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>Infrastructure Services</span></em></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company seeks to operate validator software that stakes ETH to confirm transactions, propose and add new blocks, and maintain consensus on the Ethereum blockchain. Through these activities, validators generate attestations-cryptographic digital signatures that verify both the validity of each block and its underlying transactions. The Company views general-purpose attestations as an emerging standard increasingly adopted by both public and private sector actors. These include proof-of-ownership, proof-of-data, identity verification, and other digitally signed attestations that enable individuals, organizations, and systems to create verifiable, tamper-proof claims on the blockchain. This capability serves a broad range of institutional and retail clients across sectors, including biotechnology, consumer industries, regulatory compliance, supply chain management, artificial intelligence, financial services, and education.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company expects to generate revenue primarily through service fees for attestation activities. In the attestation process, the Company's validators will receive attestation requests, such as verifying the validity of proposed blocks and voting on block finality. These attestation requests are generated by a wide range of on-chain activities, including signing digital signatures, completing transactions, processing cross-border payments, verifying messages or content, authenticating identity for event ticketing, redeeming loyalty rewards from applications, and participating in corporate governance votes. These assignments are drawn from the general validator set through Ethereum's consensus protocol, meaning that many attestation requests originate from outbound clients with whom the Company may or may not have direct relationship. The protocol automatically routes these requests to the Company's platform for attestation. When these duties are performed in accordance with protocol rules, fees are credited on-chain to the Company's designated withdrawal address.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company is currently in the pre-commercialization stage of its services. At this stage:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Infrastructure Partnerships.</span></strong><span> The Company is focused on onboarding a select group of infrastructure partners and pursuing deep collaboration with them, including the potential white-labeling of their core components for business use. These partnerships are designed to accelerate time-to-market by leveraging proven technology stacks rather than building all stacks in-house, thereby reducing development risk and ensuring institutional-grade performance from the outset. The Company is prioritizing partners with established track records in digital asset custody, validator operations, and enterprise blockchain integration. By embedding these components into its service architecture under white-label arrangements, the Company can maintain brand consistency and product control while relying on battle-tested systems for security and reliability. This partnership strategy also enables flexible scaling as demand increases, giving the Company access to operational redundancy, technical support, and global coverage without incurring disproportionate upfront capital costs.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Technology Evaluation.</span></strong><span> The Company is actively testing different infrastructure providers and their respective services to determine optimal integration pathways. For example, while Fireblocks and BitGo both offer custodial solutions, the efficiency of transaction processing, quality of user experience, and breadth of API integrations differ across platforms. Fireblocks offers a highly networked ecosystem with rapid transaction routing and strong institutional adoption, whereas BitGo provides more conservative custody frameworks with multi-signature security and regulatory licensing in multiple jurisdictions. These distinctions matter when integrating with downstream financial partners, exchanges, and liquidity providers, as performance and compliance requirements vary depending on transaction volume and jurisdictional oversight. In parallel, the Company is assessing validator infrastructure across providers offering Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), slashing insurance, and redundancy protocols to ensure both technical resilience and institutional-level risk mitigation. As the Company builds its business stack, these evaluations allow it to mix-and-match providers for an optimal balance of cost efficiency, speed, compliance, and security, creating a modular architecture that can evolve with changing regulatory and market conditions.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Compliance Framework.</span></strong><span> The Company is diligently establishing a robust internal compliance framework. Because business operations directly involve the use of both the Company's treasury and its partners' resources, it is essential to implement a mature compliance system that governs access rights, enforces segregation of duties, and ensures proper authorization for all financial activities. This framework includes multi-layered approval processes, monitoring and reporting protocols, internal audits, and adherence to applicable regulatory standards. The goal is to build an operational environment where sensitive data and financial transactions are safeguarded through strong governance, reducing the likelihood of mismanagement, unauthorized access, or regulatory breaches. The Company's compliance initiatives are also designed to align with expectations of institutional investors, including sovereign wealth funds, family offices, and asset managers, who require demonstrable risk management systems before allocating capital.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Given that the attestation business may expose clients' information to smart contract risks and financial risks, the Company believes the most prudent approach is to integrate established, market-tested infrastructure components that can significantly mitigate such risks while ensuring institutional-grade reliability. The Company anticipates bringing the business to commercialization within six months, with initial development costs estimated at approximately $5 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>Treasury</span></em></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, attestators are required to hold and stake ETH in order to conduct the attestation process. The scale of ETH staked through an attestator's infrastructure directly enhances its capacity to secure the network and generate accurate, reliable attestations. In this context, the Company has established an ETH-denominated treasury, records ETH as a core operational asset on its balance sheet, and intends to expand the size of its ETH holdings to support the attestation business as necessary.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company has raised ETH through a combination of equity and debt financings. Capital is raised and deployed with the objective of optimizing the cost of capital through disciplined balance sheet management, the strategic timing of issuances, and the allocation of proceeds to ETH acquisitions and validator development.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For further information, please see the Company's Annual Information Form dated September 16, 2025 available on the Company's SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Outlook for Q4 2025 and Beyond</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company is developing its business through the following initiatives:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Partnership Alignment:</span></strong><span> The Company is actively pursuing strategic partnerships with established Ethereum infrastructure providers, custodians, and institutional-grade staking platforms. These collaborations are designed to expand validator capacity, enhance system resilience, and reinforce market credibility by aligning with trusted industry leaders. By leveraging partnerships, the Company hopes to accelerate adoption, share technical expertise, and integrate best-in-class infrastructure standards to better serve institutional clients.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Attestation Platform Commercialization:</span></strong><span> A central priority is the commercialization of the Company's attestation platform. The commercialized platform will provide visibility into key technical metrics, including latency, uptime, finality checkpoints, epoch performance, overall network health, unbonding status, and slashing risk, ensuring enterprise clients can monitor performance and reliability with transparency and precision. Following the launch of the attestation platform the Company will continue building on strategic partnerships with industry-leading companies, the platform may be scaled to handle a greater volume of attestations and be repositioned to serve a broader base of institutional clients.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Treasury Expansion and Management:</span></strong><span> The Company's ETH-denominated treasury serves as a core operational requirement, providing the capital base necessary to operate validators and secure the Ethereum network. The Company plans to systematically expand its ETH holdings, while generating sustainable revenue through the deployment of these assets into attestation operations. In parallel, the Company is advancing research into new revenue models and diversifying streams derived from attestation activities. This includes exploring innovative service models for enterprise clients and pursuing integrations with leading technology partners to optimize ETH-related operations across the workflow.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Global Education and Business Development:</span></strong><span> To foster adoption of attestation standards, the Company is committed to thought leadership, ecosystem engagement, and enterprise education. Through participation in global conferences, proposed engagement with regulators, and development of industry-specific case studies, the Company hopes to highlight the role of attestations in enabling secure, tamper-proof verification. These initiatives are designed to accelerate institutional trust, onboard enterprise partners across sectors, and establish the Company as a global leader in blockchain-based attestation infrastructure.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Republic Technologies Inc.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Republic Technologies is a publicly traded technology company integrating Ethereum infrastructure into the global economy.

The Philippine company likely remains on track to meet its 2025 core-income management guidance of PHP50 billion.

Further, higher share of captive miners (~20%) impacted the quarterly e-auction volume. Despite sharp uptick in hydro generation during the monsoon season (~15% of total power generation vs. ~6% in non-monsoon months), coal-based thermal power continued to dominate the energy-mix with &gt;63% share in Q2 FY26. Historically, as monsoons recede, the demand for thermal power rises, and the share of coal-based generation typically rises to ~75% in H2. However, with India experiencing early showers in May’25 and an extended monsoon in several regions in Oct’25, we expect off-take volume to be marginally impacted in FY26.

Higher infra spends by state and central govts coupled with demand boost from construction completion of Real Estate projects launched between FY22 to FY25, would drive volume growth for pipes during FY26-28E. 2) EBITDA margin improvement of 358bps over FY25-28E driven by a) operating leverage benefit due to strong volume growth, b) margin improvement in the Kisan Mouldings asset due to initiatives by APOLP and c) improving contribution from higher margin products like CPVC. Basis our assumptions of 21% volume CAGR, minor realisation increase, and EBITDA margin improvement of 358bps over FY25-28E, we forecast APOLP EPS to grow at a CAGR of 63.5%. Consol ROCE is expected to reach 18.3% in FY28E vs 6.7% in FY25. We incorporate a PEG ratio based valuation framework that allows us a rational basis to assign a valuation multiple that better captures earnings growth. We arrive at a 1-year forward TP of INR 420/share for APOLP. We assign a PEG ratio of 0.85x on FY25-28E core EPS CAGR, which we believe is a conservative.
