It also removed its Chinese CEO, citing concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company produces large volumes of chips in the Netherlands that are widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries.

Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or from the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution to the problem. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia, Nexperia China and Wingtech did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Court filings showed that the seizure by the Dutch government came as U.S. pressure was rising on Nexperia after Wingtech was placed on a restricted-export list, though Dutch authorities say governance shortcomings were the trigger. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Oct. 4, China's commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips from China.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Industry bodies have sounded the alarm over the possible impact on production, with Stellantis </span><span> saying on Thursday that it had set up a \"war room\" to monitor the situation. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Japanese automaker Nissan </span><span> said it had enough chips at the moment to last until the first week of November without disruption. </span></p></span></div></div>",
