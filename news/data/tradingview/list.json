            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Randall W. Forsyth</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All eyes were on the parade of earnings reports from the technology behemoths this past week. But what grabbed the markets' attention were the implications of their massive capital investments in artificial intelligence on their balance sheets and cash-flow statements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the center of this debate was Meta Platforms, which plunged 11% on Thursday after reporting a miss on earnings but, more importantly, said it was pushing full-speed ahead on AI data centers, projecting $71 billion in spending, up from $69 billion previously. Moreover, the company said that capital expenditures \"will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All of which is absorbing increasing amounts of megatechs' cash flow. As Doug Kass of Seabreeze Partners observes, the so-called hyperscalers have morphed from being \"capital light\" to capital-intensive operations. In the process, they have had to turn to external financing for their ambitious AI buildouts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In fact, Meta brought this year's biggest investment-grade corporate bond deal to market, totaling some $30 billion, the latest in a parade of recent data-center borrowing. Bank of America tallies $75 billion of AI-related public debt offerings in the past two months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And that doesn't count other financings, including Meta's creative off-balance-sheet funding of its Louisiana data center, described by colleague Adam Levine in last week's Tech Trader column. That includes a $38 billion loan tied to Oracle's data centers, on top of $18 billion of public bonds issued by the company, led by world's second-richest person, Larry Ellison.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Putting numbers to Kass' point, BofA credit strategists Yuri Seliger and Sohyun Marie Lee write in a client note that capital spending by five of the Magnificent Seven megacap tech companies ( Amazon.com, Alphabet, and Microsoft, along with Meta and Oracle) has been growing even faster than their prodigious cash flows. \"These companies collectively may be reaching a limit to how much AI capex they are willing to fund purely from cash flows,\" they write.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consensus estimates of AI capex suggest, they calculate, that it will climb to 94% of operating cash flows, minus dividends and share repurchases, in 2025 and 2026, up from 76% in 2024. That's still less than 100% of cash flows, so they don't need to borrow to fund spending, \"but it's getting close,\" they add.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That leaves no room to return capital to shareholders. The companies could opt to fund AI investments by eliminating share buybacks, which would mean those investments would take the ratio of capex to cash flow back to the low 70% range. Or the companies could take advantage of their stocks' elevated price/earnings ratios by issuing equity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Much more expedient, and more favorable from an equity investors' standpoint, is to continue to issue debt. And that's especially so while credit-market conditions are so salubrious. According to multiple reports, Meta received over $120 billion of orders for its $30 billion of high-grade (Aa3 by Moody's, AA- by S&amp;P Global Ratings) bonds on offer, a reflection of massive investor demand for investment-grade corporate bonds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On that point, Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Schmid pointed to easy financial market conditions as one reason for dissenting against the central bank's decision to lower its federal-funds target a quarter percentage point, to a range of 3.75% to 4%, this past week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Equity markets near record highs, narrow corporate bond spreads, and robust high-yield bond issuance counter the suggestion that monetary policy is restrictive, he said in a statement on Friday explaining his vote. Meanwhile, inflation has exceeded the Fed's 2% target for more than four years, he added. (Fed governor Stephen Miran dissented in the opposite direction, preferring a half-point cut, as he had at the September meeting.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kass points out that unlike earnings per share, cash flow can't be manipulated by companies. If they spend more on AI than they generate internally, they have to finance the difference. That's no problem currently, especially with the credit markets ready, able, and more than willing to fund megatech borrowers. And the future promise from AI may justify today's spending.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But there is a credit cycle. And tech hadn't depended on it until now.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Randall W.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Megan Leonhardt</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of the best views of waves breaking off Maine's rugged coast can be seen from Ogunquit's Marginal Way, a coastal cliff walk in the southern part of the state. But storms and erosion have taken a toll, threatening the structural integrity of the roughly 1.5-mile trail. Erosion, by its nature, can weaken foundations over time, leading them to crumble under pressure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. labor market looks to be undergoing a similar sort of erosion, with hiring stalled as employers weigh months of economic and policy uncertainty. Yet, while conditions may not be as \"stable\" as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated this past week, there are indications the market's foundation is much stronger than that of Marginal Way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For one, the number of people filing for unemployment benefits hasn't shot up, at least not yet. The Labor Department hasn't released official estimates of weekly initial jobless-claim volumes since early October, due to the government shutdown, which began Oct. 1. But Citigroup economists estimate on the basis of available state data that initial jobless claims fell to 220,000 filings for the week of Oct. 25 from 232,000 in the prior week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That alone signals the number of Americans losing their jobs, even in the midst of a government shutdown, hasn't reached alarming levels. Mike Reid, senior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, credits healthy corporate fundamentals, noting that profit growth was strong in the third quarter. Reid says he would be concerned if weekly claims rise above 275,000.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Higher-income households, bolstered by stock market and home-equity gains, have continued to spend, boosting corporate revenue and earnings and driving broader economic growth. Bank of America reports that total credit-card spending per household rose 0.8% in the year ended Oct. 25. That has helped keep employment in the retailing business \"surprisingly stable\" in recent months, says Lisa Simon, chief economist at Revelio Labs, which maintains a workforce database.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Moreover, more small businesses said in the latest National Federation of Independent Businesses survey that they are planning to hire. The hospitality sector posted the strongest rebound in hiring in October, with monthly payroll growth up 13.8%, breaking a two-year pattern of October declines, according to data from Homebase — a provider of employee management software to about 150,000 small businesses, which collectively employ about two million people. The transportation and logistics sector recorded monthly payroll gains of 4.8% in the month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Education and healthcare, which have driven much of the job growth this year, likely will continue to add jobs as well, Revelio's Simon says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Private payrolls, in general, may have ticked higher in recent weeks. ADP reported on Tuesday that total private employment grew by a four-week moving average of 14,250 jobs in the week ended Oct. 11, up from a four-week average gain of 10,750 jobs in the week ended Oct. 4.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The pickup suggests that the hiring freeze that has plagued much of the labor market in recent months may be easing, although the recovery is \"tepid,\" says ADP chief economist Nela Richardson. She cautioned that the weekly pulse data are estimates and that recent hiring patterns have been volatile week to week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To be sure, the job market isn't as robust as it was a year ago, or even back in April — and the risk of more layoffs shouldn't be discounted. Data from Indeed, a leading job-search website, show that job-posting levels are trending down month over month in nearly every industry sector, even though posting levels in the aggregate are still 2% above a prepandemic baseline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Small businesses, which employ nearly half of all U.S. private sector employees, have been especially conservative in their hiring decisions. Only three of 13 industries showed positive momentum in October on a smoothed three-month basis, Homebase noted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We probably have hit the bottom in terms of the deceleration of employment growth,\" says Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But Uruci doesn't expect to see 100,000 monthly payroll additions again soon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon.com, General Motors, Paramount Skydance, and United Parcel Service all announced significant workforce reductions over the past week that collectively totaled more than 65,000 job cuts. So far, layoffs have been driven primarily by company or industry-specific issues.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the past year, town officials in Ogunquit approved plans to reinforce Marginal Way and fortify it against future erosion. So, too, the U.S. labor market can be shored up by continued consumer spending, business investment, and policies that promote economic growth. The latest layoff headlines sowed fears of a jobs recession, but the reality, so far, looks more encouraging.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Megan Leonhardt at megan.leonhardt@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The AI suggests the token could rally toward the $8 mark by year’s end, representing a 217% increase from its current price of $2.52.Source: Claude AI</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ripple’s courtroom victory against the SEC earlier in the year reignited market optimism, pushing XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 in July. Over the past year, the asset has climbed an impressive 380% year-to-date and 392% in the last 365 days, outperforming Bitcoin’s 55% growth and Ethereum’s 50% by nearly 7x to 8x.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With the introduction of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s close contacts with the current pro-crypto US administration, Ripple has further cemented its status as a compliance-friendly digital payments provider, drawing strong investor interest in regulatory-aligned crypto solutions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Several bullish flag setups have formed across XRP’s 2025 price charts, hinting at sustained technical momentum.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If additional market catalysts emerge, such as a wave of expected ETF approvals, new institutional partnerships, or the timely delivery of “Project Crypto”—an SEC initiative to provide clarity to the industry, a 12-month target of $8 could become a realistic target.Sui Network: Claude Calls This One an Easy 10X Crypto</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sui Network ($SUI) continues to generate substantial buzz, positioning itself as a blockchain capable of outperforming Ethereum in speed and scalability.Source: Claude AI </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the “Ethereum killer” label often depends on perspective, Sui’s standout feature is its extraordinary throughput, reportedly handling up to 297,000 transactions per second (TPS), compared to Ethereum’s average of just 15 TPS.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the last 24 hours, SUI has risen 3%, trading at $2.35. Claude’s report suggests the token could sustain this uptrend and potentially reach $25 next year, thanks to its sophisticated smart contract ecosystem, scalability, and interoperability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If current slow market conditions persist, Sui could feasibly touch $5 by Christmas. Technical indicators, however, support a breakout scenario, with the forming two bullish flag patterns over the last year, typically a precursor to prolonged upside potential.Aave (AAVE): Ethereum’s DeFi Titan May Double Rapidly, Says Claude</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aave ($AAVE) remains a cornerstone of decentralized finance, allowing users to lend, borrow, and earn passive returns through a secure, efficient platform.Source: Claude AI</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Renowned for its flash loans, liquidity pools, and multi-chain accessibility, Aave has played a pivotal role in advancing the DeFi landscape.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Its commitment to innovation, community governance, and growing institutional traction positions Aave not just as a survivor of the DeFi boom, but as one of its key architects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Claude AI envisions Aave’s price potentially soaring from current levels of $217 all the way up to to $1,000, a remarkable jump of 5x in 12 months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Currently, Aave’s price action is forming an expanding triangle pattern. It could actually reach the lower target of $600 early next year, which will be a strong psychological foothold on the way to $1,000. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Bold Meme Coin Presale with 4,900x Potential!</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has been billed “the Dogecoin of this cycle” despite still only being in presale, and such buzz has already attracted over $3.8 million in funding from investors hoping for outsized gains.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Claude’s crypto report believes his one is explosive, estimating potential returns of up to 4,900% from its current low fixed presale price of $0.0002655. Source: Claude AI</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If Claude’s analysis is correct, Maxi Doge could be worth $0.013275 in a year, which would still make it worth only a penny even after it has hypothetically gone to the moon. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Marketed as Dogecoin’s more chaotic and high-energy relative, Maxi Doge thrives on crypto’s degen culture, leveraging viral memes, contests, and community interaction to fuel growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI benefits from faster and cheaper transactions than Dogecoin’s dated chain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Of the total 150.24 billion MAXI tokens, 25% are allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” aimed at supporting marketing efforts, strategic collaborations, and ecosystem development.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Staking has already gone live, offering up to 79% APY, though yields will gradually decrease as staking participation rises. The current presale price is $0.0002655, with incremental increases set for upcoming rounds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors can acquire MAXI using MetaMask or Best Wallet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s and pages.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Visit the Official Website Here</span></p></span></div></div>",

The economic trend of the industry is revealing. Although cyclical, the long-term trend is that we have pretty much deflated the industry. We lack creativity and line up at the farm-subsidy trough regularly when prices or competition gets \"too tough.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crop insurance is a classic example. It's much easier to raise corn when insured to provide a decent return on substandard farmland that is more suited to raising cattle. The result is that we have a shortage of beef and a surplus of corn. Getting Uncle Sam involved in the private sector? Be careful what you wish for.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thomas C.

Previous investors (e.g., Harvard University) can't get their money back because no one can afford to pay the quoted prices (by the PE managers). The only solution is to sell these problems to the public; otherwise, a lot of Wall Street managers are going to see their bonuses disappear.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Robert Ray On Barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Know When to Fold 'Em</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To the Editor: On Oct. 23, Barron's announced that \" 24-Hour Stock Trading Is Coming — and Wall Street Isn't Ready.\" Well, neither am I.

The data fog is due to the government shutdown, now in its fifth week and on track to beat longevity records.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While shutdowns typically exert a temporary drag of 0.1% to 0.2% on GDP growth for every week that they are on, activity mostly recovers after the shutdown ends. Any stock market disruption has also been short lived. This partly explains why the current government shutdown has turned mostly into a background noise for markets. More than that, alternative data show that economic momentum has remained positive in the second half of 2025, supporting our view of no recession in the near term...</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Dallas Fed Weekly Economic Index, which tracks weekly changes in consumer behavior, the labor market, and production, and is scaled to the year over year change in real GDP, implies growth of 2% to 2.5% in Q3 and so far in Q4.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Veneta Dimitrova</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sunny Season for Stocks</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paulsen Perspectives Oct. 30: The S&amp;P 500 is at an all-time high. Nonetheless, historical stock market seasonals are suggesting the S&amp;P 500 may continue rising at least until next summer. Positive seasonals are comforting but are far from infallible. While not definitive, they do provide a nice foundation for stock investors headed into the winter months — particularly when economic policies are becoming more accommodative, S&amp;P 500 earnings momentum remains strong, stock market participation seems to be broadening, and valuations outside of new-era names still remain relatively attractive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Confidence on Main Street remains near record lows, suggesting there is still considerable room for pessimism and fear to abate and be replaced by rising confidence, fueling both economic and stock market successes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jim Paulsen</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Housing Trends Are Troubling</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Early Morning With Dave Rosenberg Research rosenbergresearch.com@substack.com Oct. 30: As the equity market gets propelled by the relentless AI trade, not every sector is joining in on the party. The Homebuilding stocks have rolled over by more than 16% from September highs, even with lower mortgage rates. The Residential REITs sector has slumped to an 18-month low and is back into an official bear market (down by almost -22% from the nearby peak). Rates are lower, but it is the reason they are lower that matters: cracks emerging in the labor market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Significant incentives weren't enough to prevent the likes of D.R. Horton from reporting a decline in its quarterly profits, with the builder's gross margin on home sales slipping to 20% from 21.8% in the past quarter, with average prices deflating by -3% from year-ago levels. This is an industry-wide phenomenon. [There are] stagnant home sales, economic uncertainty, aggressive incentive campaigns (add on mortgage buydowns), and price discounts. Tech doesn't need job creation — but housing does.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adding insult to injury was the news that pending home sales in September, a bellwether leading indicator, came in flat versus a consensus forecast of 1.2%. At a depressed 74.8 reading, it lines up in the bottom 7% of all time and it really says something that it is lower today than at the depths of the housing-induced recession in November 2008.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>David Rosenberg</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Improving Outlook for Oil</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investment Commentary Wells Fargo Investment Institute Oct. 27: Last week, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil traded near the 2025 low in the mid-$50s before U.S. sanctions on Russian oil producers caused a late-week spike...</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What now? We believe a modest softening of the economy in the near term, combined with OPEC+'s seemingly aggressive intention of adding oil supply, will keep oil prices under pressure in the coming months. However, we believe this supply deluge will eventually ease. WTI oil prices are below the $65 average breakeven cost for new oil wells in the U.S. This suggests that U.S. oil production growth will likely stall, as it becomes unprofitable for an increasing number of domestic oil producers to drill new wells as oil prices decline further. Additionally, the OPEC+ campaign to increase production is on track to conclude in 2026, notably tightening the global oil-supply spigot.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking through to year-end 2026, we forecast the improving supply outlook, coupled with a reaccelerating economy, will push WTI oil prices into our target range of $65 to $75 per barrel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Austin Pickle</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>10 Dividend \"Cushions\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sector Watch CFRA Oct. 27: The S&amp;P 500 is trading at a price/earnings ratio of 24 times next-12-month earnings projections, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ. This is a 42% premium to its 20-year average and more than two standard deviations above the long-term mean. The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology sector trades at a 66% premium to its 20-year average, while Communication Services (43%), Consumer Discretionary (41%), and Industrials (47%) also trade at extremes to their long-term averages...</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors concerned about a possible pullback in prices might want to look to dividends as correction cushions. Granted, not all high-yielding stocks are worth buying. Like blades of grass that stick up too far and end up being trimmed back, stocks may sport elevated yields due to unsustainable payout ratios (dividends as a percent of earnings) that may get reduced, possibly trimming the stock price along the way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here are 10 of the highest yielding stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with [Buy or Strong Buy] rankings by CFRA analysts, with dividend payout ratios of 75% or lower: Comcast, EOG Resources, Exxon Mobil, Hasbro, Invesco, Merck, Omnicom Group, Target, J.
