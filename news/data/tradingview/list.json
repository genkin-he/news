Now, new research reveals that these matings had a strong pair-up pattern.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's a really interesting, provocative hypothesis that there was this long-term mating preference,\" said Joshua Akey, a Princeton University geneticist who wasn't involved in the work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DNA extracted from ancient bones and teeth has previously shown the genes from our extinct cousins live on in many present-day humans. Those genes play a role in our sleeping habits and our susceptibility to certain diseases, including Covid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A trio of University of Pennsylvania researchers dug deeper into these</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ancient pairings and published their findings Thursday in a new   study in the journal Science.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They compared DNA from 73 modern women in Africa to genetic information from three female Neanderthals.

The mating preferences his group noted remained consistent.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For Akey, the work demonstrates the power of ancient DNA as a research tool.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Using genome sequences to be able to infer something about the social dynamics of interactions that happened tens or hundreds of thousands of years ago is pretty amazing,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Aylin Woodward at aylin.woodward@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Money markets are underpricing the risk that the Reserve Bank of Australia will raise interest rates at its next policy meeting in mid-March. Stephen Walters, chief economist at Optimal Economics says pricing for March is around 20%. \"That seems too thin,\" he adds. Inflation remains above target and the forces driving it higher are numerous, he adds. Against this backdrop it's encouraging to see some emerging recognition in Canberra that a 40-year high in government spending as a percentage of GDP is not warranted when the economy is running at fully capacity, he says(james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)</span></p></span></div></div>",
