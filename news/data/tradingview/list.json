Don't believe them? Take it from Palantir's customers themselves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a research note Thursday, UBS upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral with a $180 price target. Shares ticked 0.5% lower to $135.24 on Friday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 1.1%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Given the 70% revenue growth Palantir achieved in the fourth quarter and its 2026 guidance for 61% growth, \"the consensus view baked into the stock is that at least near-term, the company is facing extraordinary demand,\" analysts wrote. \"As such, bullish checks are expected.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The firm recommends that investors take advantage of the stock's 35% move off its recent high \"for the premier growth story in software\" that sits at the nexus of artificial intelligence and data, the \"two most powerful spending trends,\" according to UBS.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The near-term debate surrounding the shares is whether Palantir can sustain durable growth and whether other players such as Databricks, OpenAI, and Anthropic might arise as challengers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The firm is a longtime supporter of Palantir, even quietly from the sidelines. UBS initiated coverage on the stock in December 2024. At the times, analysts \"were quite positive on the company fundamentals then and ever since.\" Concerns over Palantir's lofty valuation stood in the way of a Buy rating at the time, but those have abated amid a broad-based software selloff.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Given lingering concerns that the AI boom has run its course, the analysts may sound overly enthusiastic. Don't believe them? Palantir's customers are just as positive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To underscore their conviction in Palantir's growth story, the firm spoke with several of customers and partners. These conversations \"reaffirmed our view that Palantir is facing significant demand for AI and data software, with use case expansion in the existing customer base and no material emerging competition,\" analysts wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One Palantir Vanguard Elite partner pointed to continued opportunities for expansion in the government sector. \"The Army went all in on logistics in Palantir with Vantage,\" the partner said, noting that most other agencies have implemented its software to some degree — including the Space Force and Air Force — and adding cryptically that \"a number of three- or four-letter agencies\" were starting to expand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A second partner noted that many clients turned to Palantir for \"speed to value,\" asserting that the company was \"good at stitching data together,\" which gives it an edge over players like Anthropic, the developer of Claude Code.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A third customer working in healthcare IT noted that the Palantir spend would be close to $50 million by the end of the year after starting at the $30 million to $35 million range.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many of the players whose customer relation management software is used in the pharmaceutical industry today \"are not capable of generating these insights,\" the customer said, adding that \"most companies won't leverage their AI capabilities.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>UBS analysts asserted that this view reflects \"the AI disruption bear case on application software,\" with incumbent CRM applications serving merely as data stores that can be accessed by Palantir \"to extract real insights for customers.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They aren't the only bulls. On Friday, Rosenblatt Securities initiated coverage on shares of the data-analytics company with a Buy rating and $150 price target.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

But former Marvel Enterprises CEO Eric Ellenbogen, who purchased the oldest home at Smoke Tree in 2021 for $3.95 million, is bucking that trend by listing the house publicly with Bennion Deville Homes/Luxury Portfolio International.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We felt strongly that offering the property on the open market would provide the greatest opportunity to identify the right architectural steward, like ourselves,\" said Ellenbogen, 68, who bought the house with his husband, Dominic Ramos-Ruiz.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the foot of the San Jacinto Mountains, Smoke Tree Ranch has a near-mythical status in Palm Springs. Dating to the early 1900s, the ranch has long drawn some of America's wealthiest families, including Walt Disney and the Ford family of the Ford Motor Company. Known for its Wild West feel, the community has dirt roads and unassuming homes, many of which still belong to the families that built them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ellenbogen's home, built in the 1930s, had been owned by the Gilmore pharmaceutical family for roughly 90 years before he bought it. After the purchase, Ellenbogen worked to have the home successfully designated as a historic landmark by the city of Palm Springs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sitting on about 1.8 acres, the roughly 5,500-square-foot house surrounds a central courtyard with a large pool, according to the listing agents, Patrick Jordan and Stewart Smith. On the exterior, there are steel casement windows and wood shake shingles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ellenbogen has bought and sold several Midcentury-Modern homes over the years, including several in Palm Springs: a 1960s house designed by architect William F. Cody, and Twin Palms, which was once owned by Frank Sinatra. He also owned a Los Angeles home designed by Modernist architect Carl Maston, which he sold to \"Glee\" creator Ryan Murphy. Ellenbogen joked that house hopping is his \"unfortunate habit.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A native Angeleno, Ellenbogen was CEO of Marvel in the late 1990s. After his stint at the comic-book publisher, he co-founded the entertainment company Classic Media, which sold to DreamWorks Animation for $155 million in 2012 and later to NBCUniversal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Gilmore house was already in great condition when he purchased it, Ellenbogen said, but it took more than two years of research and documentation to secure its landmark status. \"It was not protected, and absent this historical designation could have been torn down or ruined,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ellenbogen said he is selling the property because he and Ruiz have other homes around the country, and are spending more time at their home in Spain. \"I did what I set out to do, which was really to protect the property,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Katherine Clarke at Katherine.Clarke@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
