In 2025, the company issued and sold shares of Class A common stock for gross proceeds of $1,327.6 million through its Q4 2025 and Q3 2025 ATM Programs.

The company is also subject to complex tax arrangements, including a Tax Receivable Agreement that could result in substantial payments, potentially exceeding actual tax benefits.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Regulatory and Reputational Risks:</span></strong><span> Regulatory risks are significant, as the company must obtain approvals in each country it operates, and changes in U.S. trade policy could affect costs and supply chain dynamics. The public perception of nuclear energy and potential accidents pose reputational risks, while the constrained supply base could impact production schedules and costs.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Management's Discussion and Analysis:</span></strong><span> Management acknowledges the challenges of scaling production and securing contracts for NPMs. The company is focused on refining its design and manufacturing processes to enhance competitiveness.

The potential loss of government incentives for nuclear power could also adversely affect market demand.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Market Risks:</span></strong><span> NuScale is exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in electricity prices and changes in regulatory environments. The company’s ability to compete in markets with low power prices is uncertain, and inflation could increase the cost of NPMs, affecting competitiveness. Additionally, cybersecurity risks are a concern, as breaches could impact operations and reputation.

The company maintains unsecured bank lines of credit totaling $370 million and has been actively managing its debt portfolio with new issuances and repayments to support capital expenditures and working capital needs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Future Outlook:</span></strong><span> H2O America plans to invest approximately $458 million in capital expenditures in 2026, excluding acquisitions, with a focus on distribution system investments and compliance with environmental regulations.

The company is expanding its operations in Texas, which will increase its exposure to regulatory and market risks in that region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Regulatory Risks:</span></strong><span> The proposed acquisition of Quadvest presents several risks, including regulatory approval delays, integration challenges, and potential failure to realize anticipated benefits. The company faces significant regulatory risks, particularly in obtaining necessary approvals from the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) and other regulatory bodies. Additionally, the integration of Quadvest's business may be complex and time-consuming, potentially impacting customer relationships and operational efficiency.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Litigation Risks:</span></strong><span> H2O America is also exposed to litigation risks, particularly concerning water quality and contamination. A class action lawsuit against a subsidiary, CWC, highlights the potential for significant legal costs and reputational damage. The company’s operations are subject to stringent environmental regulations, which could increase compliance costs and impact financial performance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Water Supply Adequacy:</span></strong><span> The company faces operational risks related to water supply adequacy, which depends on factors such as rainfall, reservoir levels, and regulatory restrictions. Water shortages could lead to increased costs and operational challenges. The concentration of business in California, Texas, and Connecticut makes H2O America susceptible to regional risks, including political, regulatory, and environmental challenges.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Market Risks:</span></strong><span> H2O America is exposed to market risks, including interest rate fluctuations that could impact the cost of capital. The company’s substantial indebtedness, particularly related to the Quadvest acquisition, may reduce financial flexibility and increase borrowing costs. Additionally, the company faces risks related to inflation, which could increase operational costs and impact profitability if not offset by rate increases.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SEC Filing: </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766829/000162828026012438/hto-20251231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">H2O AMERICA [ HTO ] - 10-K - Feb. 26, 2026</a></p></span></div></div>",
