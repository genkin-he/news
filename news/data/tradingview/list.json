            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Robb M. Stewart</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OTTAWA--Canada's economy shrank more than anticipated in the final quarter of 2025 after businesses offloaded inventories that were built up earlier in the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This withdrawal from non-farm stockpiles, alongside weak business investment, offset a rise in exports and increases in both household and government spending to continue a volatile stretch for Canada in the wake of the U.S. administration's protectionist shift.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gross domestic product declined at an annualized rate of 0.6% in the October-to-December period to 2.502 trillion Canadian dollars, the equivalent of US$1.829 trillion, Statistics Canada said Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The pullback was slightly steeper than the 0.2% drop in activity forecast by economists, and partially unwound the prior quarter's downwardly revised 2.4% expansion. Over 2025, real GDP grew 1.7%, the slowest pace since a drop in 2020 during the global pandemic, largely due to a decline in exports to the U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The weak end to the year came with a recovery in industry-level activity in December, though little of that appears to have carried into 2026, when activity was likely held back by snowstorms and severe cold temperatures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bank of Canada policymakers anticipated no growth in the fourth quarter, and have projected a modest recovery this year, with growth averaging 1.1% as the country's once booming population growth slows and the nation adjusts to U.S. tariffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trade with the U.S., by far Canada's biggest market, cooled last year and was only partially made up for by increased trade with new markets. For the year, Canadian exports globally grew 1.5%, propelled by a jump in gold and soaring precious metals prices. Despite a recovery in the second half of the year, shipments to the U.S. didn't fully recover from a second-quarter slump and Canadian exports overall were down 1.7% for the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Imports nudged up 0.3% in the final quarter, but were down 0.4% for the year after a steep decline in the third quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Prime Minister Mark Carney, elected last April as a counter to President Trump, has pledged to strengthen the resilience of Canada's economy and decouple it from a dependence on its biggest trading partner. The push includes efforts by the former central banker to bring financial relief to sectors hit hardest by tariffs while pushing for a doubling of non-U.S. exports over the next decade.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are indications Carney's efforts are bearing fruit. The U.S. has gone from being the destination for roughly 70% of Canadian exports to about 64% at the latest count, and inbound shipments from the U.S. now represent less than 57% of imports from 60% last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Final domestic demand, a gauge of spending by all sectors of the economy, grew 2.4% at an annualized rate in the three months after falling 0.5% the previous quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Household spending rose 0.4% nonannualized after weakening slightly in the prior quarter, and left household consumption for the year up 2.3% to keep up with the 2.2% pace in each of the previous two years. For the quarter and the year, the rise in household spending was led by outlays on rent and financial services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Government investment increased 0.8% for the three months, buoyed by spending on weapons systems for a second quarter running. In contrast, business capital investment slipped 0.1%. For 2025, capital investment was up 1.4%, led by a rise in government spending.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wage growth cooled in the latest quarter, with employee compensation rising 0.5% after a 1% increase in the third quarter. On an annual basis, compensation rose 3.9%, the smallest rise since 2016 outside of 2020 during the pandemic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The household savings rate was 4.4% in the fourth quarter, down from 5.2% a quarter earlier, as an increase in disposable income lagged spending.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, it was the withdrawal from businesses inventories that was the greatest drag on GDP, with manufacturers and wholesalers in particular taking from stockpiles. For the year, non-farm inventories fell for the first year since 2020, even as farm stocks rose for the first time in three years with strong crop production.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The national data agency said GDP in December was up 0.2% from the month before, the strongest growth since September and following flat industry-level activity in November. After contracting for two months running, manufacturing saw growth in the final month of the year and wholesale trade rose for the first month in three.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The agency's advance estimate indicates GDP was essentially unchanged in January, as increases in mining, oil and gas extraction, and finance and insurance, were offset by weakness in manufacturing and real estate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Robb M.

The struggling retailer says the change helps it establish better merchandising authority with its customers, one of the primary goals laid out by its new CEO Michael Fiddelke since he took the role earlier this month. The change comes as many retailers and brands say they plan to remove synthetic dyes and other ingredients from their food formulations. Walmart last year said it would remove synthetic dyes and dozens of other ingredients from its store brand food by the end of this year. Whole Foods hasn't sold products made with synthetic dyes for decades. Target's May deadline puts it ahead of some cereal sellers' plans to reformulate their goods. Kellogg's has said it's phasing out the ingredients by the end of 2027. General Mills has previously said they plan to remove the ingredients by this summer.
