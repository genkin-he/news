(\"Jasper\" or the \"Company\") </span><span> and certain officers.   The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and docketed under 25-cv-08010, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired Jasper securities between November 30, 2023 and July 3, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants' violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired Jasper securities during the Class Period, you have until November 18, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class.  A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com.   To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>[Click here for information about joining the class action]</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jasper, a clinical-stage biotechnology company, focuses on developing therapeutics targeting mast cell driven diseases such as Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (\"CSU\"), Chronic Inducible Urticaria (\"CIndU\"), and Asthma. The Company's lead product candidate is briquilimab, a monoclonal antibody designed to block stem cell factor (\"SCF\") from binding to and signaling through the CD117 (\"c-Kit\") receptor on mast and stem cells. According to Jasper, the \"SCF/c-Kit pathway is a survival signal for mast cells and [the Company] believe[s] that blocking this pathway may lead to depletion of these cells throughout the body, including in the lungs and in the skin, which could lead to significant clinical benefit for patients with mast-cell driven diseases such as asthma and chronic urticarias\" and \"[t]o that end, [Jasper is] focusing on advancing a portfolio of clinical programs in mast cell driven diseases.\" In 2024, to \"strengthen [its] balance sheet and support development of briquilimab,\" Jasper completed an oversubscribed $50 million financing \"with a syndicate of leading life science investors,\" purportedly \"extending [its] cash runway through the third quarter of 2025.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In November 2023, the Company commenced a Phase 1b/2a clinical study of subcutaneous briquilimab for the treatment of CSU (the \"BEACON Study\"). When announcing the first patient dosing in the BEACON Study, Jasper's Chief Executive Officer Defendant Ronald Martell stated, in relevant part, that he was \"confident in the ability of our clinical organization to continue to execute at a high level as we advance briquilimab into clinical trials in CIndU and other mast cell-driven diseases.\" In December 2024, the Company commenced a Phase 1b/2a clinical study evaluating briquilimab in allergic asthma (the \"ETESIAN Study\"). In addition, Jasper has attempted to develop briquilimab as a one-time conditioning therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency (\"SCID\") patients undergoing a second stem cell transplant.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act -a law enacted by Congress in 2013 designed to improve and ensure the safety of the U.S pharmaceutical supply chain-all prescription drugs must be labeled with a unique product identifier that includes, among other things, a \"lot number.\" Drug \"lots\" are batches of a product that are manufactured, processed, packaged, or stored under the same conditions. If a medication is compromised, pharmaceuticals companies can use lot numbers to trace the affected batches and alert healthcare providers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to the Company, \"[t]he manufacture of pharmaceuticals is subject to extensive [current Good Manufacturing Practices (\"cGMP\")] regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control.\" Because Jasper does not currently own or operate any manufacturing facility, the Company relies on third-party contract manufacturing organizations to produce its drug candidates in purported \"accordance with cGMP regulations for use in [its] clinical studies.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Jasper lacked the controls and procedures necessary to ensure that the third-party manufacturers on which it relied were manufacturing products in full accordance with cGMP regulations and otherwise suitable for use in clinical trials; (ii) the foregoing failure increased the risk that results of ongoing studies would be confounded, thereby negatively impacting the regulatory and commercial prospects of the Company's products, including briquilimab; (iii) the foregoing increased the likelihood of disruptive cost-reduction measures; (iv) accordingly, the Company's business and/or financial prospects, as well as briquilimab's clinical and/or commercial prospects, were overstated; and (v) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On July 7, 2025, Jasper issued a press release reporting updated data from the BEACON Study. The press release stated that \"results from the 240mg Q8W and the 240mg followed by 180mg Q8W dose cohorts appear to be confounded by an issue with one drug product lot used in those cohorts, with 10 of the 13 patients dosed with drug from the lot in question,\" that \"[t]he Company is investigating the drug product lot in question and expects to have the results of that investigation in the coming weeks,\" and that Jasper was \"taking steps to ensure that drug product from the lot in question is returned to the Company and that sites have drug product from other lots to continue dosing.\" Further, the press release revealed that the Company \"has also determined that the drug product lot in question was used to treat participants enrolled in the ETESIAN [Study]. As a result, and in order to focus resources on advancing briquilimab in CSU, the Company is halting the study and pausing development in asthma.\" Finally, the press release stated that \"the Company is halting development in SCID\" and, contrary to its prior representation of having a strong balance sheet and a cash runway extending \"through the third quarter of 2025,\" that Jasper \"will be implementing a number of other cost cutting measures including a potential restructuring, to extend runway and reduce expenses.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On this news, Jasper's stock price fell $3.73 per share, or 55.1%, to close at $3.04 per share on July 7, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Market analysts were quick to comment on the Company's announcement. For example, on July 7, 2025, BMO Capital Markets published a report downgrading Jasper to market perform and lowering its price target from $6.77 per share to $4.00 per share (the \"BMO Report\"). The BMO Report stated, in relevant part, that \"potential Briquilimab drug lot issues, coupled with existing uncertainty around dose-response [], will pressure the [Jasper] story moving forward\" given, among other things, Jasper's \"financing overhang\" and market competition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After the end of the Class Period, on July 9, 2025, the Company issued a press release entitled \"Jasper Therapeutics Announces Corporate Reorganization and Other Cost Cutting Measures to Extend Cash Runway.\" The press release revealed that Jasper was reducing its workforce by approximately 50%, that \"[i]n order to focus resources on the development of briquilimab in chronic urticaria, Jasper is halting its other clinical and preclinical programs,\" and that Defendant Edwin Tucker was departing his role as the Company's Chief Medical Officer effective August 1, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

class=\"\"><span>Collectively, the five shallow holes drilled at Omui define a north-south mineralized corridor approximately 200 m long (Figure 2). Mineralization is open to the north and south. Importantly, all mineralized intercepts lie within 50 m of surface making this material potentially amenable to small scale open pit extraction. Of particular note, a 2 m wide high gold zone showing 24.22 gpt Au and 173.40 gpt Ag was encountered in hole 25OMI-002. Although the true width of mineralized intercepts is not fully understood at this time, it appears that there is a broad, sub-horizontal zone of silicification and mineralization underlying much of the Omui target.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hydrothermal silicification typically accompanies gold-silver mineralization with silica contents commonly ranging from 80-90%. High silica content is required for smelter flux. Although the east-west breadth of this zone requires similar drilling to better determine the overall extent of mineralization, Irving considers assay results from its low-angle drilling program to be very favourable. Irving and JX are currently discussing next steps to advance Omui towards becoming a new important source of smelter flux in Japan.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Omu Sinter Drilling - Civil Engineering Groundwater Survey and Rock Strength Measurements</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A shallow, vertical diamond drill hole, 25OMS-001, was recently completed at Omu Sinter yielding a 41.81 m thick high-silica gold-silver intercept (Figures 3-5). Silica content averages an impressive 96.6% and gold and silver grade, 0.54 gpt and 8.7 gpt, respectively. This hole confirms strong continuity of Omu Sinter, a shallow, flat horizon of silica deposited by ancient hot spring fluids. The water table was observed at the drilling depth of 30m or 9m above sea level. Also, the aquifer was interpreted to lie at the basal fractured zone.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Given the horizontal orientation of this horizon, true width of this intercept is approximately 100% of the drill width. This silica body lies just a couple meters below surface making it ideally suited for potential small scale open pit extraction. Additional drilling is being completed at Omu Sinter to further test the groundwater, and the continuity and extensions of this deposit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We are very pleased to see expansive, shallow deposits of gold-silver-bearing silica emerge at both Omui and Omu Sinter,\" commented Dr. Quinton Hennigh, director and technical advisor to Irving. \"At Omu, our goal is to find deposits that will prove suitable for use as sources of smelter flux within the Japanese base metal smelting industry. Our recent drill results indicate we are headed in the right direction. We look forward to working with our partner, JX, in further advancing work at the Omu project to achieve this mission.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All samples discussed in this news release are ½ split sawn diamond core samples.

The Company operates through three segments: Urban Solutions, Energy Solutions, and Mission Solutions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Throughout 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, Fluor's Urban Solutions segment accounted for the largest portion of the Company's revenue and profit. The Urban Solutions segment offers EPC and project management services to the advanced technologies and manufacturing, life sciences, mining and metals, and infrastructure industries, as well as provides professional staffing services. The Company's infrastructure projects in this segment include work on, </span><em><span>inter alia</span></em><span>, the Gordie Howe International Bridge (\"Gordie Howe\"), as well as the Interstate 365 Lyndon B. Johnson (\"I-635/LBJ\") and Interstate 35E (\"I-35\") highways in Texas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In February 2025, Fluor provided financial guidance for the full year (\"FY\") of 2025, including adjusted EBITDA of $575 million to $675 million and adjusted earnings per share (\"EPS\") of $2.25 per share to $2.75 per share. Defendants reaffirmed the foregoing financial guidance in May 2025, notwithstanding their acknowledgement of the potential negative impacts of ongoing economic uncertainty on Fluor's business resulting from trade tensions and other market conditions. Contemporaneously, Defendants touted, </span><em><span>inter alia</span></em><span>, the purported health and stability of Fluor's and its customers' operations and the strength of the Company's risk mitigation strategy, both for itself and its clients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding Fluor's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) costs associated with the Gordie Howe, I-635/LBJ, and I-35 projects were growing because of, </span><em><span>inter alia</span></em><span>, subcontractor design errors, price increases, and scheduling delays; (ii) the foregoing, as well as customer reduction in capital spending and client hesitation around economic uncertainty, was having, or was likely to have, a significant negative impact on the Company's business and financial results; (iv) accordingly, Fluor's financial guidance for FY 2025 was unreliable and/or unrealistic, the effectiveness of the Company's risk mitigation strategy was overstated, and the impact of economic uncertainty on the Company's business and financial results was understated; and (v) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On August 1, 2025, Fluor issued a press release reporting its financial results for the second quarter (\"Q2\") of 2025. Among other results, the press release reported Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.43, missing consensus estimates by $0.13, and revenue of $3.98 billion, representing a 5.9% year-over-year decline and missing consensus estimates by $570 million. Defendants blamed these disappointing results on, </span><em><span>inter alia</span></em><span>, growing costs in multiple infrastructure projects due to subcontractor design errors, price increases, and scheduling delays, as well as reduced capital spending by customers. The same press release also provided a negatively revised financial outlook for FY 2025, guiding to adjusted EBITDA of $475 million to $525 million, down significantly from Defendants' prior guidance of $575 million to $675 million, and adjusted EPS of $1.95 per share to $2.15 per share, down significantly from Defendants' prior guidance of $2.25 per share to $2.75 per share, citing \"client hesitation around economic uncertainty and its impact on new awards and project delays and results for the quarter[.]\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The same day, Fluor hosted a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss the Company's Q2 2025 financial results. During that call, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Defendant James R. Breuer, disclosed that the infrastructure projects that had negatively impacted Fluor's Q2 2025 results were the Gordie Howe, I-635/LBJ, and I-35 projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Following the foregoing disclosures, Fluor's stock price fell $15.35 per share, or 27.04%, to close at $41.42 per share on August 1, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

The heavy weighting afforded the megacap tech stocks meant the reception given to their third-quarter earnings was very likely to determine the stock market's short-term direction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And so, poorly-received reports from Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) saw the wider market retreat sharply on Thursday, while positivity over Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) results are pushing index futures back up on Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The volatility speaks to investors' sensitivity to any sign of cracks in the bullish AI narrative that is currently delivering stock market exuberance. And we can consider Michael Burry of hedge fund Scion Asset Management in the cautious camp.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a new message on X, Burry - who rose to fame after being featured in the Michael Lewis book \"The Big Short\" and was played by Christian Bale (below) in the movie  - delivered a poetic warning: \"Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play,\" the latter a reference to the nuclear-showdown assessment from the movie Wargames.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Because he is mainly known for his bets against esoteric credit assets ahead of the 2007-08 financial crisis, Burry is wrongly labelled as a perennial bear.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, 13-F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that at the end of last year SAM held only long positions, with his top three bets on China's Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com (JD).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the end of the first quarter of 2025 he had tuned more cautious buying put options - a bet share prices will fall - on the three China tech companies. His biggest position was a put trade on Nvidia (NVDA), which did trend lower for the first four months of this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Burry's next filing for the end of June shows that negative Nvidia position gone - though we don't know exactly when he closed it - which is just as well, because the chipmaker's stock has more than doubled since its April lows.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Instead, the portfolio was replete with bullish bets, including call options - the right to buy a stock - on Alibaba, Meta, ASML (ASML), UnitedHealth (UNH), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and lululemon athletica (LULU).

It's still possible that it contains mainly long positions - after all the end of the third quarter was a month ago. But his latest social media message suggests he is nervous about the stock market's rally, and he's now adopting a much more defensive stance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One reason why observers like Burry may be getting more anxious is evidence of a shift in the funding of big tech capex.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Traders have been happy to see hundreds of billions of dollars earmarked for AI-related investment, particularly as most of the money was sourced from company cashflow.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But Meta's recent deal to construct its Hyperion data center site in Richland Parish, Louisiana, included a $30 billion financing package comprising mostly of debt held via a special purpose vehicle. The structure means Meta does not hold the debt on its balance sheet, helping to protect its credit rating.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The concern among some investors is that as companies look for ever more funding to deploy, they may use the Meta deal as a template. Spending cash from the kitty is clean, clear and less dangerous if things go wrong. Financial engineering using what could be called quantum debt, which can be two things at once - not debt according to the rating agencies, but Meta-backed debt according to the buyers - is more opaque and potentially more risky.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Financial Times and Bloomberg report that Meta is also looking at another $25 billion bond sale.
