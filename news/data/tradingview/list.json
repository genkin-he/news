Photos of Huang sharing beers and fried chicken with Samsung Electronics (SSNLF) Chair Jay Y. Lee and Hyundai Motor Executive Chair Chung Euisun at Kkanbu Chicken went viral this week, setting off a speculative buying frenzy across South Korea's retail-heavy market. While Kkanbu itself isn't listed, investors rushed into anything that even smelled of chicken Kyochon F&amp;B soared as much as 20%, poultry processor Cherrybro hit its daily 30% limit with trading volumes nearly 200 times average, and robot maker Neuromeka jumped sharply. It's the latest reminder that in Korea, virality can move markets faster than fundamentals ever could.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But behind the viral moment sits a deeper play. Huang's trip to Seoul wasn't just about beer and banter it was about business. Nvidia has been pushing to expand its presence in South Korea, a crucial supply chain hub as the company faces tighter export restrictions in China. During his visit, Huang announced fresh AI chip deals with Samsung and Hyundai moves that could strengthen Nvidia's foothold in memory and automotive computing. For the Korean conglomerates, closer ties with Nvidia could mean a steadier supply of the high-end GPUs that power next-generation artificial intelligence systems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Huang's influence has become something of a phenomenon in its own right. Over the past year, several smaller AI firms have seen their shares surge after he casually name-dropped them in presentations. Now, his simple dinner outing has triggered a similar reaction only this time, it's a fried chicken rally. As Huang told reporters outside the Seoul restaurant, I love fried chicken and I love beer and I love fried chicken and beer with my friends. For investors watching the AI boom unfold, it could be another sign that Nvidia's reach cultural or commercial is still expanding.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Futures on the London Metal Exchange are down 0.8% to $10,843 a metric ton after climbing above the $11,100 mark earlier this week. The U.S. dollar index--which measures the greenback against a basket of other major currencies--is up 0.3% to 99.81, making dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for international buyers. The pullback comes as traders assess the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone on December rate cuts and the U.S.-China trade agreement. Yet, copper is still headed for a weekly gain of more than 5%, supported by concerns over global supply following a series of disruptions at major mines this year. Investors will be watching upcoming sentiment indicators from China due early next week for signals on demand.

Still, a 0.3% decline in August GDP \"certainly raises the odds of a technical recession,\" Davenport says. Oxford says it expects Canada's economy to struggle to grow in the coming months and remain vulnerable to further trade-related disruptions. Davenport says there's \"a chance\" of further Bank of Canada rate cuts should GDP and labor data weaken more than anticipated.

However, Reitzes says the surprise 0.3% drop in August does reinforce BMO's belief that the risks remain skewed to the downside. The firm believes another quarter-point cut, in early 2026, is possible due to softness in the labor market, which would take the BOC's policy rate to 2%. BMO notes the wholesaling sector was particularly weak, down 1.2% in August, while the trade-exposed factory sector declined 0.5%.

That, alongside recent lower-than-expected U.K. inflation data, suggests an increased volume of Bank of England interest rate cuts, he says.

GDP on an industry basis surprisingly fell 0.3% in August, and the early estimate is for a 0.1% gain in September--which Figueiredo estimates puts 3Q GDP largely in line with the BOC forecast for 0.5% annualized growth. Only 43% of sectors tracked have posted positive growth over the past 3 months, or well below the historical average of about 60%, the economist says. Still, \"we don't yet see enough weakness for central bankers to cut rates any further,\" Figueiredo says. (paul.vieira@wsj.com, @paulvieira)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0905 ET - The shock 0.3% decline in Canadian GDP in August isn't quite as bad as it looks, given temporary factors and an upward revision to growth in July, Capital Economics' Stephen Brown says. The advance estimate is that GDP inched up 0.1% on-month in September, which implies growth of 0.4% annualized for the third quarter. That is only trivially weaker than the Bank of Canada's 0.5% growth estimate, Brown says. But he says that does tilt the odds toward 4Q growth being weaker than the central bank's forecast of 1%.

This bears watching, says CIBC Capital Markets, as the Bank of Canada predicts a pickup in growth in 4Q. All told, Canada GDP in August fell 0.3%, versus an estimate for a flat reading. Statistics Canada's early estimate for September is that GDPedged upward by 0.1%. That would translate into a 0.4% annualized 3Q gain, or slightly below the Bank of Canada's forecast for 0.5% jump. \"The lack of momentum towards the end of the quarter may spook policymakers somewhat,\" says CIBC economist Andrew Grantham. The BOC cut its policy rate this week, to 2.25%, and signaled it would stay there so long as the economy unfolds as forecast.

Next week's Fedspeak includes Governor Cook on Monday, Vice-Chair for Supervision Bowman on Tuesday and Governor Miran on Friday.

A lower U.K. risk premia is likely to push gilt yields lower, Gkionakis says. \"Potential for reduced spending in the Autumn budget may cause yields to fall due to pricing out of risk premia.\" In addition, recent U.K. jobs, inflation and GDP data indicate that the economy is slowing, raising the possibility of the BOE cutting rates in the coming months, he says. Two-year gilt yields last trade at 3.762%. They fell to 3.744% on Tuesday, just shy of a 14-month low, Tradeweb data show.

It comes after GDP expanded an upwardly revised 0.3% in July, the first growth in four months. The weakness in August was marked by a fifth contraction in goods-producing industries since the start of the year, including the first decline in mining and oil and gas extraction in three months and a slump in utilities activity thanks to worsening drought conditions. Services-producing industries also edged lower, the first decline in six months in part thanks to a flight attendants strike that weighed on air travel and the first fall in wholesale trade in four months. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0840 ET - Canada's economy tracking toward a modest recovery for 3Q. Industry-level GDP fell a sharper-than-expected 0.3% on-month in August following upwardly revised growth of 0.3% in July. Statistics Canada's advance estimate indicates GDP increased 0.1% in September. Based on that, the economy is headed for a 0.4% drop in GDP on an annualized basis for the 3Q after shrinking 0.7% on the same basis the prior quarter. More fulsome expenditure-based data will only be released late next month, but as it stands the economy tracking in line with the modest 0.5% growth the Bank of Canada forecast for 3Q.
