It has voting rights of 11.5% but with the option to boost that to more than 50% if Rapidus runs into any financial or operational problems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The initial capital injection will be deployed immediately, with an additional 150 billion yen earmarked in the upcoming budget, bringing the government's total equity commitment in Rapidus to 250 billion yen for the 2026 fiscal year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The move signals a shift toward a more aggressive industrial policy as Japan pushes to regain its footing in the global silicon arms race, industry analysts said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Japan has pinned its hopes on Rapidus, a state-backed venture established in 2022 with the mission of developing home-grown advanced chipmaking capacity. It has also been courting foreign companies, seeking to bring their expertise into the domestic ecosystem.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earlier this month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. finalized an agreement to produce 3-nanometer chips at its second Japanese facility in Kumamoto, an upgrade from previous plans for more mature nodes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That was a major leap for Japan, which doesn't yet have capacity to mass produce advanced chips essential for artificial intelligence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The government has been pushing to change that, backing projects like the Kumamoto expansion, which provides a high-volume manufacturing baseline for the country. Rapidus meanwhile is focused on the even more ambitious goal of making 2-nanometer logic chips.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To further safeguard its investment in the state-backed venture, the government will hold a so-called \"golden share\" in Rapidus, granting it veto power over board decisions to protect against economic security risks and foreign influence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A combined $1.07 billion investment pledge in Rapidus from 32 companies reflects renewed interest from the private sector too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The investment pool, which includes contributions from a broad range of domestic industry leaders, surpassed the government's initial projections for private funding.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The capital commitment \"exceeds the initial target of 130 billion yen,\" a sign that \"expectations for the project are clearly mounting\", Akazawa said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Yang Jie at jie.yang@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

This was the second time it has expanded its buyback program after initially approving 100 billion yen in November last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company now plans to repurchase up to 90 million shares by May, representing more than 1.5% of its outstanding shares. This is a substantial increase from the 55 million shares originally announced.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sony said it had launched the share buyback in a bid to improve capital efficiency. It added that the plan was expanded to allow more flexibility in repurchases, after considering the current pace of buybacks and stock market trends.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The share price move may also reflect a shift in investor flows, as stocks of other gaming companies have also risen.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Sony's stock increase is likely part of a broader movement to take profits on semiconductor-related stocks following Nvidia's earnings and to repurchase gaming-related stocks that had been recently sold off heavily,\" said Morningstar equity research director Kazunori Ito.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sony's shares, which outperformed other gaming stocks, gained even further in reaction to the share buyback expansion, he added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We are seeing rotation into laggards like...Sony that [had] been trading woefully with AI and semiconductor related names sucking in all the flows,\" with the shift expected to continue into March, said Andrew Jackson, head of Japan equity strategy at Ortus Advisors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Jason Chau at jason.chau@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
