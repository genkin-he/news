            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jason Zweig</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tina is back.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tina stands for \"there is no alternative.\" Years ago, when interest rates were near zero and investors were acting as if stocks were the only choice, market strategist Jason Trennert of Strategas Research Partners popularized the term \"the Tina market.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The latest argument for Tina comes from a newly updated analysis by a team of researchers who find that retirement savers shouldn't own any bonds at all.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Instead, according to this line of reasoning, investors should keep one-third of their savings in U.S. stocks and two-thirds in international stocks. The researchers advocate that you should hold all stocks, all the time — not only when you're young and saving for retirement, but even after you retire, for as long as you live.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If only stocks were a sure thing. In financial markets, nothing ever is. You can't just take an analysis of the past, no matter how careful it is, and assume you can extrapolate it into the future.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To reach their conclusion, Scott Cederburg, a finance professor at the University of Arizona, and his colleagues Aizhan Anarkulova at Emory University and Michael O'Doherty of the University of Missouri, analyzed stock and bond returns from 39 countries from 1890 through 2023, taking the longest available period during which each was classified as a developed market. That's up to 134 years for such markets as the U.S. and the U.K., and as short as four years for Colombia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Their central finding, across the decades and around the globe: Bonds have historically tended to go up and down in sync with stocks over long periods, making them poor diversifiers — while offering low returns, to boot.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For that full sample, after inflation, Cederburg and his colleagues determined that bonds earned 0.95% annually — far below the 7.74% on U.S. stocks and 7.03% on international stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That means that most people who save for retirement in target-date funds that hold a gradually tapering mix of stocks, bonds and cash could come up short, Cederburg and his co-authors say.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This message comes at a time when investors are already taking Tina to the limit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the S&amp;P 500's record close of 6890.89 on Tuesday, U.S. stocks were valued at 40.5 times their long-term earnings, adjusted for inflation. According to data from Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Shiller of Yale University, that's the highest ratio in a quarter century — since the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"With valuations where they are, this may just be a tougher investment environment for current retirement savers,\" Cederburg tells me.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We're not trying to pretend that putting all your retirement money into stocks isn't risky,\" he adds. \"It's an incredibly risky proposition.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In fact, in earlier research, Cederburg and his colleagues looked at more than three dozen global markets back as far as 1841. Over all possible 30-year horizons, investors in those markets who held a domestic all-stock portfolio underperformed inflation 12% of the time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What about in the U.S.? Edward McQuarrie is an emeritus business professor at Santa Clara University who has studied long-term asset returns back to the 18th century. He found that U.S. stocks outperformed inflation in every 30-year period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, they did underperform bonds in 25% of all 30-year stretches, although many of those periods overlapped and most — but not all — were in the 19th century.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All this should point you toward an inescapable but often overlooked fact: Stocks are likely to be the best-performing asset, but even a high likelihood isn't the same thing as certainty. The odds are in your favor, but you will need luck on your side. We all will.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consider two hypothetical investors, each with $1 million invested in the S&amp;P 500. They both withdraw 4% a year, in equal monthly installments, for the next 20 years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One retires on Dec. 31, 1999, right before the bear market of 2000-02; the other on Dec. 31, 2002, shortly after that nightmare ended and a new bull market began.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The first investor would have a little more than $890,000 left after 20 years, calculates financial planner Allan Roth of Wealth Logic in Colorado Springs, Colo.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The second investor would have more than $4 million. (These hypothetical results don't count fees, taxes and inflation.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you happen to retire into a bull market, you could end up with more money every year even after you withdraw to support your spending. If you have the bad luck to retire into a bear market, you could end up running out of money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's why I still own some bonds ( in my case, inflation-protected Treasurys), and I think you should, too. The historical odds, and current government policy, are against them. But stocks also are far from a sure thing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tina feels friendly right now as stocks flirt with record highs. But over a lifetime, as I've written before, investing as if there is no alternative to stocks will demand that you have the patience of a tortoise and the emotions of a stone.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here's the ultimate trouble with Tina. Let's say the odds that stocks will outperform bonds in the future — if, but only if, the future resembles the past — are something like five out of six.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As investing author William Bernstein points out, \"That is also how often you win at Russian roulette.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Jason Zweig at intelligentinvestor@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "title": "Inside the Fight For 1-800-Gambler: As Betting Soars, an Addiction Helpline Is Torn Apart — Barrons.com",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Nick Devor</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As sports betting became ubiquitous, so did one phone number: 1-800-Gambler.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The helpline digits appear in fine print on gambling ads and lottery tickets nationwide, offering gamblers an immediate source of support if their play turns problematic. Call volume soared in recent years as dozens of states legalized sports betting and the industry centralized its problem gambling efforts to one point of contact. Some 326,000 calls went to the number over a recent 12-month period, along with another 8,500 texts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But in September, the helpline was thrown into disarray after a New Jersey court stripped 1-800-Gambler of its national sponsor and millions in donations. The ruling transferred control of 1-800-Gambler from the National Council on Problem Gambling, or NCPG, to a New Jersey advocacy group that launched the number four decades ago.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The legal battle and sharp accusations among advocates threaten to undermine years of progress in treating gambling addiction in the U.S. At the core of the debate are disagreements around national standards versus individual care.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Any disruption in helpline services can have life-or-death consequences; call-center operators have stories of talking people off a ledge. People with gambling disorders have higher suicide rates relative to other mental health conditions. Research from the American Association on Suicidality has found that helplines significantly decrease crisis states and hopelessness.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's just a little bit horrifying to see this happening, because I think we all want the same thing, ultimately, which are our pathways to connect people to treatment or information on this issue that are easily memorable and accessible,\" says Ted Hartwell, a former executive director of the Nevada Council on Problem Gambling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Problem gambling treatment faces a scarcity of funding across the country, as Barron's has previously reported. The federal government, for its part, has no programs in place for gambling addiction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2021, the National Football League stepped into the void with a $6.2 million grant to the NCPG, which also receives backing from major casino companies and online sportsbooks. The NFL funds boosted the council's revenue by 450% year over year, giving the group the firepower to nationalize problem gambling efforts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The NCPG used the money to license the 1-800-Gambler number, develop nationwide text and chat features, and spark an advertising blitz. The council, which says it is \"neutral on legalized gambling,\" leveraged industry connections to get big brands on board with the helpline, while lobbying state regulators to mandate use of the number.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The NFL told Barron's that its grant \"enabled the NCPG to unify helpline access nationwide under 1-800-Gambler, making it easier for anyone, anywhere in the U.S., to get help when they need it.\" The grant was renewed in 2024, bringing the NFL's promised contributions to $12.6 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But as the problem gambling effort grew on a national scale, longstanding local advocates felt sidelined. The Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey, which created 1-800-Gambler in 1983 and still owns the number, began to have second thoughts on its licensing deal with the NCPG after the group imposed requirements on local call centers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>New data-collection efforts from the NCPG also created tension with local groups. In some cases, gamblers were asked to answer survey questions before receiving assistance, according to state advocates in New Jersey, Florida, and New Mexico.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The NCPG and the NFL say national data are crucial in the fight against gambling addiction. Local counselors say data collection is incompatible with a need for anonymity, since gambling addicts often experience a level of shame around their behavior.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If they were sharing identifiable information, I don't think people would share with us as much as they do,\" says Candice Cookson, who answers problem gambling calls in Ohio and leads helpline operations for the United Way of Greater Cleveland.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gathering information on 1-800-Gambler callers became a priority for the NCPG after the NFL's investment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In November 2022, the NCPG's helpline committee prepared a document outlining data collection recommendations. \"As call centers begin collecting the same key data points and using similar language, it will enable comparisons across states and will give us the ability to spot trends in real time,\" reads the document, which was reviewed by Barron's. Age, gender, race, military service, and information on the caller's relationship to gambling are all recommended data points for collection.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Data-collection efforts are key to providing NCPG with insights into contact trends, allowing the organization to better advocate for federal funding that supports problem gambling prevention, education, and treatment efforts,\" the national group said in announcing a renewal of the NFL's multimillion-dollar grant in 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Florida helpline operators, who handled 33,000 calls and texts via 1-800-Gambler over a recent 36-month period, never collected that kind of data and pushed back on the changes, saying that additional friction on calls could result in hang-ups and untreated callers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This past May, the NCPG cut operators at the Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling out of the national system. The move was \"due to FCCG's lack of communication surrounding the Network Contact Center Standards,\" Jaime Costello, the NCPG official overseeing helpline operations, told the organization in an email viewed by Barron's. \"Because we are unable to verify whether or not FCCG meets the requirements, we were forced to reroute contacts,\" Costello wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Florida's removal ran counter to a recent audit conducted for the NCPG, which had lauded the Florida council's helpline operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On April 30, the Florida council answered a call to its helpline from a caller who identified herself as Julia seeking help for her gambling problem, according to a recording of the call reviewed by Barron's. After nearly a half-hour of the operator answering her questions and assembling a list of resources, Julia revealed that it had \"actually been a quality-assurance call paid for by the National Council on Problem Gambling.\" She praised the operator for his handling of their interaction. \"You did awesome,\" Julia said. \"You conducted this call in a manner that is high quality.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By the next day, the NCPG had begun rerouting helpline calls away from its Florida affiliate, according to an official familiar with the decision. Callers with a Florida area code were sent to a call center contracted by the NCPG where critics say disconnects and unreturned messages frequently occur.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Costello says the rerouting was about a lack of communication from the group. As for the audit, she says that \"one call does not signify consistent quality care.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Calls from New Mexico numbers saw a similar rerouting in May after the state's problem gambling council also resisted the NCPG's new data collection efforts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before the NCPG rerouted calls earlier this year, Kandace Blanchard, the New Mexico council's executive director, says her call center was picking up 1-800-Gambler calls from New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. Her operators developed long-term relationships, she says, with frequent callers looking to speak to the same person each time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Blanchard's helpline had also handled calls from the Navajo Nation, whose territory stretches across the New Mexico and Arizona border. She has Navajo-speaking counselors on-call 24/7. A 2014 study found that Native Americans experience more than double the rate of problem gambling compared with the broader U.S. population.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After the rerouting, some Navajo callers to 1-800-Gambler found that no one could understand them. On multiple occasions, Blanchard says, the NCPG's call center was forced to transfer a Navajo-speaker back to the New Mexico line in the middle of the night. The delay in service compromised care, Blanchard says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Costello says she was unaware of those instances. Her group offers interpretive services through a third party. Blanchard says she had flagged the issue to Costello and provided Barron's with emails that corroborate her claims.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During a meeting of the NCPG's helpline committee in May, the group's chair said the decision to reroute callers from Florida and New Mexico was made to ensure that they received a certain level of care. He added that the NCPG was \"trying to be discreet\" about the rerouting, according to a meeting attendee who spoke with Barron's.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The New Mexico and Florida councils \"refused to provide any documentation that they met any of our standards,\" Costello says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling declined to comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The dispute over 1-800-Gambler has brought a long-simmering debate to the forefront: whether to nationalize problem gambling treatment even as casinos face a patchwork of state regulations and rules.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the NFL donation supercharged 1-800-Gambler, problem gambling treatment remains fragmented. There are nearly two dozen state-specific numbers run by local advocacy groups like the New Mexico and Florida councils.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The NCPG and other nationally minded officials believe that gambling's omnipresence in popular culture requires a streamlined helpline system with one memorable number; state-based advocates say problem gambling treatment requires a regional approach tailored to the specific challenges of local communities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unification of the helpline system was a longtime goal for Keith Whyte, who spent 26 years as the executive director of the NCPG before he left in January to start a responsible gambling consultancy firm. \"It's an embarrassment in some ways that the field has not been able to unify behind a number,\" he says. The move to 1-800-Gambler was a crowning achievement for Whyte, but his national system has splintered in the months since he left the NCPG.</span></p></span></div></div>",

The benchmark Dutch TTF contract falls 0.7% to 31.16 euros a megawatt hour in afternoon trade, and is down 2.7% on the week. Last week, investment funds reduced their net position in the TTF gas futures market by 14 terawatt hours, indicating they expect lower prices ahead, DNB analysts say. Meanwhile, according to industry group Gas Infrastructure Europe, EU storage levels are currently 82.8% full and have been broadly flat in recent days.
