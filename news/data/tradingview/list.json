Revenue growth of 8.7% in Ramsay's Australian private-hospital business was the stand out in the result, analyst Saul Hadassin says. Barrenjoey raises its price target by 13% to A$38.25/share. That reflects 2%-5% EPS upgrades across FY 2026-2028 and revised assumptions around capital expenditure. \"We remain neutral rated, with the stock trading on a near-term price-to-earnings of 28X, and think the market has already priced in a sizeable, medium-term recovery in Australian earnings,\" Barrenjoey says.

Among worst performers on Japan's benchmark index, Sumitomo Electric Industries falls 5.6%, Furukawa Electric drops 5.4%, and JX Advanced Metals is down 4.5%.

Virgin Australia reported 1H Ebit of A$490 million. That was 5% higher than consensus hopes for A$466 million. Analyst Samuel Seow says fuel, depreciation and better margins in its Velocity frequent-flyer business were the drivers of the 1H result. \"Interestingly, while profit/financial metrics are ahead, it appears Virgin Australia is comfortable growing slower than peers to achieve above-industry pricing/yield,\" Citi says. This trend appears to be continuing in 2H, with higher revenue-per-average-seat-kilometer and lower capacity than competitors. \"However, this isn't impacting profitability with guidance largely in line/modestly ahead,\" Citi says. Virgin Australia is unchanged at A$3.15. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</span></p></span></div></div>",

Harvey Norman reported sales growth of 3.5% on-year in Australia in January. That was slower than the 4% growth reported by rival JB Hi-Fi for its own-name stores. Analyst Michael Simotas notes there was an extra Saturday in 2026 than the same period a year earlier. That should have been a tailwind for sales. The upshot is that Harvey Norman's sales growth is lagging consensus expectations in 2H of a more than 5% improvement, Jefferies says. So, \"consensus expectations for 19% 2H net profit growth look optimistic,\" it says. Jefferies had a hold call and A$7.10/share price target ahead of the 1H result. Harvey Norman is down 7.7% at A$5.84 today. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ)</span></p></span></div></div>",
