If you trade on centralized DeFi interfaces, you need to assume your data is visible. The Axiom scandal shows that insiders could potentially see user IDs, wallet addresses, and position sizes before they hit the public chain. This is a massive breach of crypto security. If you are a high-volume trader, this exposes you to predatory insider trading mechanics that can silently bleed your portfolio dry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the risk isn’t just digital. As we’ve noted before with the Binance employee wrench attack, the physical safety risks of leaked personal data are real. When internal logs create a database of “who has the money,” that database becomes a target. While projects like Hyperliquid launch DeFi policy centers to try and legitimize the space with better standards, incidents like the Axiom scandal drag the industry back into the shadows. For now, the safest bet is to assume that if a human verified your account or built the dashboard, a human can probably see your trades.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>DISCOVER: 5 High-Risk High-Reward Cryptos</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Follow 99Bitcoins on X For the Latest Market Updates and Subscribe on YouTube For Daily Expert Market Analysis.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Key Takeaways</span></strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>ZachXBT exposed Axiom Exchange staff for allegedly using internal tools to spy on and front-run users for insider trading.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The scandal highlights severe security gaps in centralized DeFi front-ends, even those backed by Y Combinator.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Your trading data on these platforms may be visible to employees, posing both financial and privacy risks.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>The post Axiom Exchange Insider Trading Scandal: Is Your Trading Data Being Used Against You? appeared first on 99Bitcoins.</span></p></span></div></div>",

In January, our partner Nuvisan reported challenges in the stability of the ADC constructed for the study, and as such the results were inconclusive. Based upon this experience, we have activated a plan to produce new ADCs using different bioconjugation strategies and several structural variants of Microcystin payloads, with the goal to identify the optimal Pre-Clinical Candidate (PCC) to take into Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Also in December, Simris completed a funding round that included the conversion of a large portion of the Company’s debt as part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen and stabilise the Company’s financial position. This included restructuring outstanding loans, converting debt into equity and completing targeted capital injections. While these measures have been dilutive, they have significantly reduced our debt burden and strengthened our equity base. Importantly, the transactions also brought in new cash to the Company, improving short-term liquidity and giving us the financial runway required to continue operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I am extremely happy that we were able to bring Julian Read back into the business as board member. His strategic thinking, knowledge of the industry, experience in transformation and investor relations are a significant boost for Simris and I am delighted to have him back on board.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Finally, we announced a memorandum of understanding with the French company Immunrise, who are currently concluding legal, technical and operational due diligence for the acquisition of Simris’ assets in Hammenhög, Sweden. We are optimistic that that the Company will close this deal, thereby completing Simris’ transformation from a food supplement to a biotech company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The market for ADC’s continues to grow rapidly and driven by:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The expansion for outpatient ADC administration.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>A rapidly expanding &gt;65-year-old demographic and associated increase in tumour diseases.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The approval of new ADCs for expanded indications.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>ADC revenues were $13bn in 2024 an increase of 25% on the previous year and are forecast to continue growing at a CAGR of 10%* into the 2030’s. In addition to the three points above, further growth of the ADC market will be stimulated by:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Accelerated R&amp;D funding and clinical trial initiations.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Growing pharma investments (M&amp;A and license deals).</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>An increasing demand for effective, low-toxicity drugs.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Novel payload classes, including a growing diversification into other biological inhibitors, contributing to a broader pool of payloads that can be also used in combination to overcome drug resistance.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the optimism, there are some areas that can hold back growth, namely:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Production-related payload supply constraints (mainly auristatin/PBD) creating a bottleneck in ADC production.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>High manufacturing complexity and associated safety measures.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Simris’ unique platform is a game changer for the industry as it is ideal for overcoming these constraints. Our technology platform enables us to develop effective payloads of both high and low-toxicity tailored for the specific cancer type whilst also improving safety of the payload by avoiding its ability to enter healthy cells. Furthermore, the production of cyanotoxins in cyanobacteria is both immensely scalable and cost effective.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The value of cyanobacterial toxins is already evident. Six of the fourteen FDA-approved and commercially available ADC’s, accounting for 40% of the estimated $13bn sales revenue in 2025, are based upon a cyanotoxin (MMAE &amp; MMAF).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Simris can offer multiple new classes of conjugation-ready cyanotoxins, and other cyclic peptides. All of these can be further optimised for both efficacy and safety via structural modifications covered by Simris IP.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I am so impressed and grateful for the energy and passion that the team is applying their work. They believe strongly in the purpose of their work and the potential of our science.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Finally, I wish to thank all of our shareholders for their continued belief and support in what we are working to achieve. Together we can cure more people of cancers and help them to stay healthy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>*Simris estimates based upon the forecasts of twelve different ADC market intelligence reports.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The report is published on Simris Groups website:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>https://simrisgroup.com/financial-information/financial-reports/</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Contact Details:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Daniel Kubitza</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interim CEO of Simris Group AB</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Email:</span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"http://mailto:daniel.kubitza@simris.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">daniel.kubitza@simris.com</a></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mobile: +33 6 71 04 21 52</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>www.simrisgroup.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Simris Group AB (PUBL):</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Simris Group is a biologics company identifying and commercialising high value, natural, biologically active compounds found in microalgae and cyanobacteria to extract for applications in biopharmaceuticals, dietary supplements and cosmetics.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Simris Group's shares are traded on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market with the short name SIMRIS and ISIN code SE0008091664.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Certified Adviser is Amudova AB, telephone: 08-546 017 58, email:</span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"http://mailto:info@amudova.se\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">info@amudova.se</a><span>.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>This information is information that Simris Group is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>An analyst has pointed out where Solana support levels could lie based on a Parallel Channel forming in the asset’s weekly price chart.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Solana Parallel Channel Could Indicate Support At These Levels</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed how support is looking for Solana from the perspective of a Parallel Channel that may be emerging in its 7-day price.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The “Parallel Channel” is a pattern from technical analysis (TA) that forms whenever an asset trades between two parallel trendlines. There are a few different ways a Parallel Channel can be categorized based on the orientation of its trendlines.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ascending Channels involve lines that are pointing up, while Descending Channels have a downward slope. These types correspond to periods of parallel consolidation to a net upside and downside, respectively.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the context of the current topic, the third and the most basic type is of interest: a Parallel Channel that’s parallel to the time-axis. As the price moves inside such a channel, it observes a phase of perfectly sideways action.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the weekly price of Solana has potentially been moving inside in recent years:</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:480px;aspect-ratio:0.8\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:39204714b094b-2f943ca53b9704b2d9948b1b6af6af0e-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"Solana Parallel Channel\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:39204714b094b-2f943ca53b9704b2d9948b1b6af6af0e-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#f1f1f1\"/></picture></div></button></figure><p class=\"\"><span>As displayed in the above graph, Solana retested the upper level of the Parallel Channel a couple of times during 2025. Each time, the price ended up topping out and a decline followed. The upper line of a Parallel Channel is considered to be a source of resistance, so these rejections may have been signs of the pattern being in action.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since the latest rejection, SOL has been moving down in a sharp manner as the cryptocurrency sector as a whole has observed a bearish shift. So far, the coin is still contained inside the upper half of the channel, but if momentum weakens, it might end up traveling lower.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to the analyst, these levels could act as support in such a scenario: $50.22, $22.47, and $9.98. These levels correspond to a point 50%, 75%, and 100% down the channel, respectively.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Solana last tested the lower-most of these levels during the bear market of the previous cycle. Back then, it had helped the cryptocurrency reach a bottom. It now remains to be seen which direction the asset will go next and if a retest of any of these levels will take place.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SOL isn’t the only cryptocurrency observing a Parallel Channel setup. As Martinez has highlighted in another X post, the monthly price of Stellar (XLM) has also been moving down such a pattern, with possible support levels existing at 0.147, 0.078, and 0.041.</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:480px;aspect-ratio:0.8\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:39204714b094b-835925eca2c0892ea9408a107a4ee152-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"Stellar Parallel Channel\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:39204714b094b-835925eca2c0892ea9408a107a4ee152-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#f0f0f0\"/></picture></div></button></figure><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>SOL Price</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the time of writing, SOL is floating around $81, down 5.5% in the last 24 hours.</span></p></span></div></div>",

According to Evans, HIP-6 establishes a permissionless token launch auction for new HIP-1 assets, specifically tailored for teams seeking to issue tokens directly on Hyperliquid. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The system adapts Uniswap’s continuous clearing auction model to function within Hyperliquid’s central limit order book (CLOB) environment, allowing token launches to occur natively within the exchange’s infrastructure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At present, while HIP-1 and HIP-2 already allow permissionless token deployment and automated liquidity provisioning, gaps remain in capital formation and price discovery. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Teams launching tokens on Hyperliquid often need to secure funding off chain, manually provide their own liquidity to seed HIP-2 pools, or release tokens into relatively thin order books. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These limitations have meant that, despite its technical strengths, Hyperliquid has not yet reached feature parity with other high-performance ecosystems and exchanges when it comes to initial token offerings. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>HIP-6 is designed to close that gap, though participation will remain optional for projects. By integrating capital raising and liquidity seeding into a single on-chain flow, the proposal aims to simplify the process for founders. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Funds raised during the auction would be split automatically between the token deployer and liquidity provision through HIP-2, reducing operational friction and reliance on external arrangements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Auction Structure And Ecosystem Growth</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>A core component of the proposal is its approach to price discovery. Instead of a one‑time auction vulnerable to timing strategies, HIP-6 uses a continuous clearing auction that unfolds over multiple blocks. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This structure is intended to determine a fair market price while minimizing the “sniping” and last‑minute bidding behavior often seen in traditional token launches.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The upgrade also seeks to strengthen the broader ecosystem around Hyperliquid. By creating utility for aligned quote assets, HIP-6 could contribute to higher total value locked (TVL) in those assets and generate yield for the platform’s Assistance Fund. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While HIP-6 addresses how new tokens raise funds and establish initial liquidity, it does not dictate how those tokens create long-term value or how their governance systems operate. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mechanisms such as revenue sharing, buybacks, staking rewards, treasury oversight, or voting rights would remain up to individual projects. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Similarly, tokenholder protections—such as treasury lockups, on-chain transparency requirements, or vesting schedules affecting both buyers and team allocations—would need to be built on top of the HIP-6 framework.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The proposal’s stated objective is to make the initial auction process as efficient and equitable as possible, leaving post-launch design choices to the creativity of the Hyperliquid community.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the time of writing, HYPE, the platform’s native token, was trading at $27.430, representing a 3% drop over the previous 24 hours. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Featured image from OpenArt, chart from TradingView.com </span></p></span></div></div>",

Discovery Inc. (WBD). The all-cash transaction, valued at $81 billion in equity and $110 billion in enterprise value, positions Paramount as a premier global media and entertainment powerhouse.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The announcement follows a dramatic turn in the industry, as Netflix declined to raise its offer for WBD, effectively clearing the path for Paramount to step in with its $81 billion bid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the agreement, Paramount will pay $31 per share in cash for WBD's outstanding stock. To protect shareholders, a 'ticking fee' of $0.25 per share per quarter will be added if the transaction has not closed by September 30, 2026. Paramount projects that the deal will generate over $6 billion in synergies, achieved through technology integration, procurement savings, real estate optimization, and streamlined operations across the combined company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The financing package is equally ambitious. Paramount has secured $47 billion in equity, backed by the Ellison Family and RedBird Capital Partners, with new Class B shares priced at $16.02 each. In addition, $54 billion in debt commitments from Bank of America, Citigroup, and Apollo will support the transaction, including funds to backstop WBD's existing bridge facility. Paramount shareholders will also be offered a $3.25 billion rights offering at the same share price, ensuring broad participation in the deal's funding.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approvals and a shareholder vote scheduled for early spring.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Warner Bros. Discovery closed the regular trading session at $28.17, down $0.63 or 2.19%. In after-hours trading, the stock showed a slight recovery, rising to $28.26, an increase of $0.09 or 0.32%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Copyright(c) 2026 RTTNews.com.

In November 2025, we began to see early signs of an improved supply-demand balance, driven by stronger-than-expected demand from energy storage systems (ESS), as well as certain supply disruptions.
