            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Dow Jones Newswires Staff</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. futures were up, while global markets were mostly lower after many indexes hit record highs this week. The highly anticipated agreement between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping received a muted response with market watchers saying China appeared set to maintain the rare-earth curbs introduced in the spring, and businesses expecting more rocky times ahead for U.S.-China commerce. Gold rose, while oil fell.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>U.S. futures for the S&amp;P 500 were up 0.6% and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1% after both indexes closed lower Thursday following earnings from Meta Platforms and Microsoft. Tech stocks fell on concerns over increased spending outlooks for the two companies.</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Asia stocks were mostly lower, except Japan's Nikkei which closed up 2.1% after data indicated the economy is showing signs of improvement. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.8% lower, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.4%.</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>All major indexes in Europe were lower, with London's FTSE down 0.3% and Germany's DAX 0.4% lower. France's CAC 40 was down 0.15% and the Stoxx 600 fell 0.4%, lead by the technology sector which was down 0.9%. Bucking the trend were Fuchs and Puig which were up 9.5% and 7.9%, respectively after third-quarter earnings.</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>U.S. Treasury yields edged higher in Asian trade across the curve except for the two-year maturity, but moves were overall small after this week's major central-bank policy decisions. The two-year Treasury yield was down 0.1 basis point at 3.612%, while the 10-year yield rose 1.2bps to 4.103%, according to Tradeweb.</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Eurozone government bond yields rose in early trade, absorbing the European Central Bank's policy meeting on Thursday. The ECB left the key interest rates unchanged, as expected, and sounded relatively relaxed about the eurozone's growth outlook. The 10-year German Bund yield rose 0.8bp to 2.646%, according to Tradeweb.</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The dollar remained higher, supported by reduced bets for another interest-rate cut in December after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said it was far from a done deal. The Fed delivered a widely expected 25-basis-point rate cut on Wednesday. The DXY dollar index rose 0.1% to 99.658, close to the three-month high of 99.724 reached Thursday.</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Bitcoin recovered marginally but remains below the key $110,000 level following losses sustained overnight after a tech-led selloff in U.S. stocks. Reduced market bets for another interest-rate cut by the Fed in December also weighed on risk appetite. Bitcoin rose 1.9% to $109,559 after reaching a one-and-a-half-week low of $106,396 late Thursday, LSEG data show.</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Gold prices rose in early trading as investors digest the trade deal between the U.S. and China and the Fed's hawkish tone on December interest-rate cuts. Futures in New York are up 0.4% to $4,032.10 a troy ounce after retreating back below the $4,000 mark earlier this week, and are now set for monthly gains of more than 4%.</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Oil prices were headed for a monthly loss of nearly 3% ahead of Sunday's OPEC+ meeting. In early trade, Brent crude and WTI both slipped 0.6% to $63.98 and $60.20 a barrel, respectively. The market has largely priced in a modest output increase of 137,000 barrels a day for December, but concerns over a growing supply glut continue to weigh on sentiment.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Barcelona Editors at barcelonaeditors@dowjones.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The lender, which is one of the country's three main banks and is majority owned by the government, is reviewing its mortgage credit-risk models. It has formally put itself for sale and confirmed that it isn't yet in any talks. The outcome of the risk model review could add around 110 basis points of capital, analyst Borja Ramirez Segura estimates. Recent reports touted Bankinter as a potential buyer but neither party has commented and the Spanish lender, which operates digitally in Ireland through Avant Money, said at its 3Q results that it has low appetite for M&amp;A. Shares closed 23% higher on Thursday. (elena.vardon@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

It was a year of travails and scandals for the royal family which the queen described as an \"annus horribilis\".</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Andrew was said to be devastated by the break-up from his wife, who described him as a gentle man who deserved to be loved. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The couple had two children, Beatrice and Eugenie, and the family remained close and on good terms after they divorced in 1996, going on holiday together and sharing the same house.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'AIR MILES ANDY'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After leaving the military, Andrew's personal life still hit the headlines. Tabloids linked him to a series of women, from swimwear models to entrepreneurs. Photographs appeared of Andrew cavorting on yachts or sunbathing surrounded by topless women. The papers dubbed him \"Air Miles Andy\" for his jetset lifestyle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But his long-term friendship with Epstein, who was jailed in 2008 for child sex offences, began to haunt him. He was forced to quit his roving trade ambassador job in 2011 over the ties and Giuffre filed her allegations against him in 2015.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>She took her own life in April and her account returned to prominence with the publication of her memoir this month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I never have really partied,\" Andrew told the BBC. \"I was single for quite a long time in the early 80s but then after I got married I was very happy and I've never really felt the need to go and party and certainly going to Jeffrey's was not about partying.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To critics, his downfall was a consequence of an arrogance and sense of entitlement. A former royal protection officer told an ITV documentary that Andrew would throw tantrums if the teddy bears on his bed were moved.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>His royal world came crashing down not long after he gave what turned out to be a calamitous interview to BBC TV to explain why Giuffre's account of meeting him sweating and dancing at a London nightclub before having sex with him could not be true.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He was ridiculed for saying he went to see Epstein in New York to tell him he could no longer be seen with him, for saying Giuffre's story was wrong because he was visiting a pizza restaurant to celebrate his daughter's birthday on the night in question, and for saying he was unable to sweat.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He was also criticised for failing to show sympathy for those who say they were abused by Epstein and for saying he was not sorry about his friendship with the financier. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein,\" he said in a later statement as he quit official royal duties. But it came too late to save his reputation.</span></p></span></div></div>",

It also removed its Chinese CEO, citing concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia's move came after the Dutch chipmaker's Chinese unit resumed supplying semiconductors to local customers but stipulated that all sales to distributors would need to be settled using the Chinese yuan. Previously, transactions had been settled with foreign currencies like the U.S. dollar.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>        The company produces large volumes of chips in the Netherlands that are widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries. Some 70% of the Netherlands-produced chips are packaged in China and sold mostly to distributors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"While we have maintained shipments for as long as commercially feasible, continuing the current flow of supply from our front-end sites is no longer justifiable,\" the letter said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Unless these contractual obligations are fully satisfied, we cannot resume wafer supply to the site. Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or from the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution to the problem. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Nexperia said it is financially independent of Wingtech and it does not raise capital from Wingtech, the letter showed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Nexperia confirmed that it sent the letter but said it could not comment further. Nexperia China and Wingtech did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Court filings showed that the seizure by the Dutch government came as U.S. pressure was rising on Nexperia after Wingtech was placed on a restricted-export list, though Dutch authorities say governance shortcomings were the trigger. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On October 4, China's commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips from China.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Industry bodies have sounded the alarm over the possible impact on production, with Stellantis </span><span> saying on Thursday that it had set up a \"war room\" to monitor the situation. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Japanese automaker Nissan </span><span> said it had enough chips at the moment to last until the first week of November without disruption. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some Nexperia products that used to cost just a few Chinese cents have gone up in price to two or three yuan each over the past two weeks, more than 10 times their original cost, according to a source familiar with the matter. </span></p></span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, the trade agreement between the U.S. and China did little to resolve questions over Chinese purchases of Russian oil, analysts say. \"There has been no indication on the Chinese side as to whether they will stop buying,\" according to ANZ. \"There was also hope that China would agree to purchases of U.S. oil and gas as part of a broader U.S.-China deal.\" (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
