While Paramount is seeking to buy all of Warner Discovery, Netflix's deal is for the Warner movie and TV studios and HBO Max streaming service.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Warner said if the board still favors Paramount after Netflix revises its offer, Warner would be entitled to terminate the Netflix agreement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Until then, the Netflix merger agreement remains in effect, and the Warner board continues to recommend in favor of the Netflix transaction, the company said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Netflix spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount on Tuesday submitted a revised bid of $31 a share for all of Warner Discovery, including cable networks such as CNN and Food Network, for an $81 billion deal .

The Omnibus Plan was adopted in accordance with Policy 4.4 - </span><em><span>Security Based Compensation </span></em><span>of the TSX Venture Exchange, which requires all listed issuers to maintain a security-based compensation plan governing the granting of stock options. Magna Terra's previous stock option plan, originally adopted on November 13, 2009, and last amended and restated on November 12, 2012 (the \"Legacy Plan\"), was a \"rolling\" plan that reserved for issuance a maximum of 10% of the Company's issued and outstanding common shares from time to time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Omnibus Plan authorizes the Company to grant a broader range of equity-based awards, including (i) stock options, (ii) deferred share units (\"DSUs\"), (iii) restricted share units (\"RSUs\"), and (iv) performance share units (\"PSUs\") (collectively, the \"Awards\"). The Omnibus Plan with respect to the stock options is a \"rolling\" plan such that the aggregate number of common shares reserved for issuance pursuant to stock options granted under the Omnibus Plan (including the stock options currently outstanding under the Legacy Plan) shall not exceed 10% of the Company's total issued and outstanding common shares from time to time. In respect of DSUs, RSUs, and PSUs, the aggregate number of common shares reserved for issuance pursuant to Awards other than for stock options granted under the Omnibus Plan shall not exceed 10,808,722, being 10% of the issued and outstanding common shares on the date of the management information circular.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Omnibus Plan replaces the Legacy Plan in its entirety.

Each stock option is exercisable at $0.155 per share for a period of five years from issuance and will vest over an 18-month period in three equal tranches. The RSUs vest over a three-year period in three equal tranches starting one year from the grant date. Each RSU converts to one common share of the Company upon settlement in accordance with the Omnibus Plan.

Forward-looking statements are based upon a number of assumptions and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that are disclosed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking information in this document include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our business strategies, operational sales, marketing and portfolio optimization strategies including targets, and the expected results of such strategies, predictions and expectations with respect to industry trends including growth in the senior population, a deficit of long term care beds and the pace of new construction starts, expectations with respect to taxes that are expected to be payable in the current and future years and statements regarding the tax classification of distributions, occupancy and rate forecasts, and the ATM Program, including the expected benefits thereof and intended use of net proceeds. Forward-looking information can be generally identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate,\" \"continue,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"expected,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"should,\" \"believe,\" and similar expressions. There can be no assurance that forward-looking information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those expected or estimated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information. These factors are more fully described in the \"Risks and Uncertainties and Forward-Looking Information\" section in Chartwell's Management's Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2025 (the \"2025 MD&amp;A\"), and in materials filed with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada from time to time, including but not limited to our most recent Annual Information Form the (\"AIF\").

Management uses certain financial measures to assess Chartwell's operating and financial performance, which are measures not defined in generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") under IFRS. The following measures: FFO, FFO per unit, same property adjusted NOI, adjusted NOI, adjusted operating margin, REVPOS, DOEPOS, NOIPOS, liquidity, interest coverage ratio and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio as well as other measures discussed elsewhere in this release, do not have a standardized definition prescribed by IFRS. They are presented because management believes these non-GAAP measures are relevant and meaningful measures of Chartwell's performance and as computed may differ from similar computations as reported by other issuers and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by such issuers.
