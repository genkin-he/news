They’re locked inside training runs that cost $100 million and take months to complete. Once a foundation model reaches critical mass, it becomes prohibitively expensive to replicate. The first mover that assembled the training corpus wins permanently unless new infrastructure changes the rules.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Google has 20 years of search query data. Meta has 15 years of social interaction data, and OpenAI partnered with publishers who will never license the same content to competitors. These are permanent moats that compound with every new user interaction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto built decentralized alternatives to centralized finance, so where is the decentralized alternative to centralized intelligence? It doesn’t exist because crypto hasn’t treated data ownership as an existential fight worth having.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Crypto founders aren’t building data set protocols</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The brutal truth is that data set infrastructure is less exciting than yield farming. Crypto founders chase token velocity, speculative upside and viral growth mechanics. Building attribution layers for training data generates zero speculation, requires years of ecosystem development and demands partnerships with institutions that move slowly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Boring infrastructure, however, is precisely what mattered. Ethereum wasn’t exciting when it launched; it was a slow, expensive computer that academics appreciated. Chainlink wasn’t exciting; it was an oracle network that took five years to gain adoption. The most critical crypto infrastructure often resembled homework compared to the casino next door.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Data set attribution protocols are the homework right now. The market opportunity is larger than DeFi, the network effects are more potent than those of any protocol token, and regulatory pressure creates inevitable demand. Yet crypto capital flows into the next NFT marketplace instead of the infrastructure that could prevent AI companies from becoming more powerful than nation-states.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The window is closing fast</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI companies are not waiting for permission. They’re training GPT-5, Claude 4 and Gemini Ultra right now using data scraped from millions of creators who will never see compensation. Every training run that completes without onchain attribution makes centralized control more entrenched.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Once these models reach sufficient capability, they become self-reinforcing. Users generate data through interactions, which train the next version, and the next version attracts more users. The flywheel accelerates, and competitors cannot catch up because they lack both the initial corpus and the ongoing data stream.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto has maybe two years before this window closes permanently. After that, data set monopolies become facts of nature that no amount of decentralized infrastructure can dislodge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>What crypto should build instead of more DEXs</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The crypto industry needs data set registries where contributors cryptographically sign data licenses before any training begins. It requires attribution protocols that log which data sets influenced which model outputs, and micropayment rails that automatically split inference revenue among the original creators. It needs reputation systems that rank data set quality based on measured model performance, rather than subjective metrics.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The technology is simpler than most DeFi protocols. Data set registration requires cryptographic hashes, contributor wallet addresses, licensing terms in standardized formats, and usage logs. Training runs record the data used and when it was used — inference requests route payments to registered contributors proportionally.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This infrastructure doesn’t require new consensus mechanisms or experimental cryptography, but rather builders who prioritize preventing monopolies over farming liquidity rewards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Crypto’s mission or crypto’s obituary</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto’s founding thesis was preventing centralized control over valuable networks. Bitcoin prevented central banks from monopolizing money. Ethereum prevented tech companies from monopolizing computation. But if AI companies monopolize intelligence, those victories become irrelevant. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What good is decentralized money if centralized models control what people think? What good is decentralized computation if centralized training data determines which ideas get amplified? Intelligence is upstream of everything, from finance and governance to media and education. Whoever controls AI training data controls the future information environment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto can either build the infrastructure that makes data set monopolies impossible, or it can watch AI companies perfect the exact centralized control that blockchain was invented to prevent. There’s no third option where crypto remains focused on token speculation while being relevant to the most significant technological shift of the century.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The industry needs to build data set attribution infrastructure now, or write crypto’s obituary as the movement that talked about decentralization. In contrast, centralized AI companies built permanent monopolies on human knowledge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Opinion by: Ram Kumar, core contributor at OpenLedger.</span></strong></em></p><p class=\"\"><span>This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Bitcoin slipped 3.8% to $110,063, while Ethereum dropped 3.6% to $3,853, and XRP fell 4.1% to $2.51. The pullback reflects a clear risk-off sentiment, as investors step back amid growing uncertainty over global policy decisions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Why Crypto is Crashing?</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Traders are in panic mode after Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the recent 25-basis-point rate cut could be the last one for 2025. He warned that the Fed might “wait a cycle” before introducing further easing, dashing hopes for faster monetary relief.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The comments hit risk assets across the board, with the Dow Jones slipping 0.2% and the S&amp;P 500 remaining flat, as markets began pricing in a longer stretch of tight financial conditions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adding to the pressure, the much-hyped Trump–Xi meeting delivered little clarity. While both sides described it as “productive,” traders viewed it as a temporary truce rather than a real breakthrough. The lack of concrete progress has kept nerves high, especially as global markets brace for potential ripple effects from renewed trade disputes and tariff tensions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Institutional Players Still Buying</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the price decline, institutional demand for crypto remains robust. Bitcoin ETFs recorded $202.48 million in net inflows on October 28, led by BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark &amp; 21Shares, pushing total inflows past $62 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ethereum ETFs also gained traction, attracting more than $246 million in net inflows.

While critics point out that he has predicted crashes for years, his warnings resonate strongly in today’s climate of economic uncertainty.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Major Crypto Crash Ahead? </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Echoing Kiyosaki’s warning, trader Jonesy cautioned that rate cuts often precede major market crashes, citing 2000, 2007, and 2020 as examples when markets plunged by as much as 56%. His trading indicators now point to instability, suggesting that the April lows might only mark the beginning of a deeper decline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For now, Bitcoin remains above $108,000, but fear is spreading fast. With the Fed holding firm and global tensions rising, investors are once again seeking safety in gold, silver, and crypto — just as Kiyosaki warned.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>FAQs</span></strong></p><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Why is the crypto market down today?</span></strong></strong><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto prices are down as traders react to Fed comments hinting at fewer rate cuts in 2025 and uncertainty from the Trump–Xi trade talks.</span></p><span> </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>How does the Federal Reserve impact Bitcoin and crypto prices?</span></strong></strong><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>When the Fed delays rate cuts, liquidity tightens, making investors risk-averse.

It highlights the need for 2,000 new beds in the western zone, 1,500 in the east and south, and approximately 4,000 in long-term care facilities to support an ageing population and sustained population growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“The population growth will result in demand for outpatient and inpatient facilities alike,” said Dr. Gireesh Kumar, Associate Partner – Healthcare Advisory, MENA at Knight Frank. “However, with the current and planned investment in the sector, investment opportunities need to be carefully evaluated, with the catchment area becoming increasingly important.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He added that investors are actively monitoring “outpatient and ambulatory care facilities, long-term care and post-acute care facilities, centres of excellence – Ophthalmology, Dental and Aesthetics – and inpatient facilities in the mid and value segments.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Private sector leads expansion</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Private healthcare providers have been rapidly scaling to meet demand. Currently, private providers deliver 70 percent of outpatient services in Riyadh, up sharply in recent years, driven by growing insurance coverage that now exceeds half the city’s population.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kumar explained, “Broader insurance coverage, greater accessibility, specialised care, and more efficient service delivery have shifted patient demand to the private sector. Outpatient and inpatient volumes grew by 2.5X and 3.1X, respectively, in 2023 compared to the public sector.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While Riyadh remains a major investment hub, Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province is also experiencing rapid healthcare expansion. Almoosa Health Company, an integrated healthcare provider, has been actively investing in the region to meet rising demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“Given the strong outlook and growing demand for quality healthcare in Saudi Arabia, particularly in the Eastern Province, we believe this is the right time to invest in the growth and expansion of our business, to meet the needs of the region, while inviting new shareholders to be a part of our compelling growth story,” CEO Malek Almoosa told Zawya Projects in an interview last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company successfully completed its $449 million initial public offering (IPO) on the Saudi Exchange in December 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In August 2025, the company secured a Shariah-compliant 650 million Saudi riyal ($173 million) credit facility from Banque Saudi Fransi to support its expansion plans. Almoosa said the proceeds would be used to fund two new specialist hospitals in Al Khobar and Al Hofuf, which will collectively add 700 beds to the current network.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“Private healthcare providers are expected to play a key role in addressing these challenges,” he said in the 2024 interview, emphasising that expansion aligns with Vision 2030’s objectives to elevate private sector participation and expand healthcare accessibility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another key player in Saudi Arabia’s private healthcare landscape is Burjeel Holdings, which has been expanding its network of specialty services in the Kingdom.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In an August 2025 interview with Zawya Projects, CEO John Sunil highlighted the company’s focus on complex care areas, saying, “Saudi Arabia continues to be a key growth engine. We are scaling our PhysioTherabia network and preparing to launch day surgery platforms.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sunil explained in that interview that Burjeel’s strategy is anchored on building integrated care models that combine preventive, acute, and rehabilitative services. “With tools like AI-based diagnostics, we are gaining better visibility across the system and improving both clinical and operational performance,” he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Burjeel has also invested heavily in expanding specialty services such as oncology, surgical specialties, and women’s health.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Saudi Arabia’s growth story is mirrored across the broader Gulf region. According to JLL’s whitepaper </span><em><span>Navigating the GCC Healthcare Investment Landscape</span></em><span>, nearly 400 healthcare transactions were recorded across the GCC between 2021 and April 2025, with Saudi Arabia and the UAE accounting for 92 percent of the total.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>JLL data shows that early-stage funding and M&amp;A dominate the deal pipeline, with 28 percent of all transactions involving hospitals and clinics. The firm expects further consolidation as larger entities acquire successful startups to integrate innovative solutions into their existing healthcare offerings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Digital transformation and AI integration</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Digitalisation is playing a transformative role in Saudi healthcare. The Kingdom’s digital health market, valued at SAR 698 million in 2022, is projected to grow at a 25 percent compound annual rate through 2030, supported by the rollout of the Unified Electronic Health Record system and the NPHIES data exchange platform, according to the Ministry of Investment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kostas Deligiannis, Zone President for Eurasian &amp; African Growth Markets at GE HealthCare, said, “Through streamlined analytics and improved visibility under NPHIES, Saudi Arabia has revolutionised patient data management… Enhanced interoperability and patient-centered care support evidence-based decision-making, reducing the complexity and cost of managing multiple systems and improving efficiency and care quality.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He added that GE HealthCare’s “AI-enabled imaging and monitoring solutions align closely with the Kingdom’s vision of predictive and data-driven care. Telemedicine, remote monitoring, and AI-powered diagnostics are also expanding access, especially in remote areas.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Vision 2030 anchors confidence</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Kingdom’s Vision 2030 anchors investor confidence and provides a clear roadmap for healthcare sector growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Deligiannis noted that Vision 2030’s Health Sector Transformation Programme has “directly fuelled the Kingdom’s emergence as a leading destination for healthcare investment within the GCC,” with private sector participation projected to rise from 40 percent to 65 percent of total healthcare spending by 2030.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Saudi Arabia’s National Centre for Privatisation &amp; PPP (NCP) is actively promoting Public-Private Partnership (PPP) opportunities in the healthcare sector.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In October 2024, Altakassusi Alliance Medical (AAM), a joint venture between the Alliance Medical Group, King Faisal Specialist Hospital &amp; Research Centre, and Lifeline Medical, achieved financial close for their diagnostic imaging public-private partnership (PPP) project, the very-first privatisation and partnership project between the private sector and Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Health.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In July 2025, NCP and the Holy Makkah Municipality initiated tendering for a mixed-use project that included a 200-bed long-term care hospital and a 100-bed multi-specialty hospital.Knight Frank’s Kumar highlighted the potential for preventive and value-based care, saying, “As preventive care expands — through early disease detection, lifestyle management, and digital health interventions — it has the potential to accelerate healthy lifespan and reduce the burden of chronic diseases.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Developers and investors are already responding to rising demand. Approximately 3,575 new beds are planned through 2030 in Riyadh, with 63 percent concentrated in northern districts around King Abdullah Financial District and the Expo 2030 site.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Knight Frank’s zoning analysis recommends value-segment hospitals for the south, mid-segment hospitals for the east and west, and premium multispecialty clinics for central and northern districts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Saudi Arabia’s combination of regulatory clarity, private sector investment, and adoption of advanced technology positions Riyadh — and the Kingdom more broadly — at the center of the Gulf’s healthcare transformation. As Knight Frank concludes, “Riyadh is well-positioned to lead the next wave of healthcare advancement in the region.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(Reporting by SA Kader; Editing by Anoop Menon)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(anoop.menon@lseg.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Subscribe to our Projects' PULSE</span></strong><span> newsletter that brings you trustworthy news, updates and insights on project activities, developments, and partnerships across sectors in the Middle East and Africa.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Joe Light</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Signs that the government shutdown could soon end have begun to emerge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lawmakers returned early to their home states this weekend as Senate negotiators said there was little chance of a breakthrough before next week. But at least some senators have indicated that a resolution is in sight. Although Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R., S.D.) adjourned the Senate on Thursday, seeing little progress in negotiations, on Wednesday he told MSNBC that bipartisan talks had \"ticked up significantly.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Jon Ossoff (D., Ga.), have said the pace of negotiations is quickening. Sen. Kevin Cramer (R., N.D.) on Thursday told reporters he is \"seeing some movement\" as the talks progress.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While there is no guarantee an agreement is reached, the talks are the closest lawmakers have come. For the past month, Democrats have insisted that they won't vote in favor of funding the government unless the bill includes an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire at the end of the year. Some Republicans say they want to consider extending the subsidies as well, but Thune has said he won't hold those talks while the government is closed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As of Saturday, the funding lapse will have lasted more than 31 days. It is almost certain to become the longest in history, beating the 35-day shutdown in 2018 and 2019 in President Donald Trump's first term.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A number of events are amping up the pressure for a deal. Saturday is the first day of open enrollment for ACA plans in most states, and the expiration of subsidies for next year means many enrollees will likely see premiums skyrocket.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The White House also says the government this weekend will run out of funding for benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps low-income families buy food. A judge on Friday said the government must keep distributing benefits. On Tuesday, voters in Virginia and New Jersey will choose their next governor, while California is voting on a redistricting measure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The shutdown's effects have already begun to bleed into ordinary Americans' lives. Airports across the country in the past week have had delays or ground stops due to staffing shortages in air-traffic control. Flight delays helped end the 2018-19 shutdown.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To break the logjam, centrist Democrats and Republicans are discussing not just a so-called continuing resolution that would fund the government in the short term but also long-term bipartisan spending bills to fund certain agencies. Thune in the past has said discussions on full-year bills, which would still need to be approved by the House of Representatives, shouldn't happen while the government is closed. But by reaching agreements on both at once, Democratic lawmakers could point to the bills as a partial victory.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The funding-bill discussions could also create confidence among Democrats that Republican lawmakers will hold healthcare talks when the government reopens, said Beacon Policy Advisors in a note on Friday. Rather than attaching the subsidies to the bill, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) may have to settle for a promise for a vote on the subsidies in coming weeks, or the creation of a healthcare working group, the analysts wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Analysts say that the best window for a deal is likely late next week, after the elections.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This doesn't end until enough pain points arrive,\" said Brian Gardner, Stifel's chief Washington policy strategist, predicting that it might take the kinds of air-traffic disruptions seen in 2019 to end the stalemate. \"We're closer to the end than the beginning.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Joe Light at joe.light@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
