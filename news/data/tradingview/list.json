Further, higher share of captive miners (~20%) impacted the quarterly e-auction volume. Despite sharp uptick in hydro generation during the monsoon season (~15% of total power generation vs. ~6% in non-monsoon months), coal-based thermal power continued to dominate the energy-mix with &gt;63% share in Q2 FY26. Historically, as monsoons recede, the demand for thermal power rises, and the share of coal-based generation typically rises to ~75% in H2. However, with India experiencing early showers in May‚Äô25 and an extended monsoon in several regions in Oct‚Äô25, we expect off-take volume to be marginally impacted in FY26. Moreover, rising contribution from the captive mines over the next few years is likely to exert additional pressure on e-auction offtake.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Outlook</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thus, we trim our FY26/FY27 adj. EBITDA estimate by 4.2%/3.9%, while keeping FY28 unchanged. Notwithstanding these near-term headwinds, we remain positive on the company‚Äôs long-term outlook and maintain BUY with a TP of Rs 440, valuing the stock at 5x EV/EBITDA.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For all recommendations report,¬†click here</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Disclaimer:¬†The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Higher infra spends by state and central govts coupled with demand boost from construction completion of Real Estate projects launched between FY22 to FY25, would drive volume growth for pipes during FY26-28E. 2) EBITDA margin improvement of 358bps over FY25-28E driven by a) operating leverage benefit due to strong volume growth, b) margin improvement in the Kisan Mouldings asset due to initiatives by APOLP and c) improving contribution from higher margin products like CPVC. Basis our assumptions of 21% volume CAGR, minor realisation increase, and EBITDA margin improvement of 358bps over FY25-28E, we forecast APOLP EPS to grow at a CAGR of 63.5%. Consol ROCE is expected to reach 18.3% in FY28E vs 6.7% in FY25. We incorporate a PEG ratio based valuation framework that allows us a rational basis to assign a valuation multiple that better captures earnings growth. We arrive at a 1-year forward TP of INR 420/share for APOLP. We assign a PEG ratio of 0.85x on FY25-28E core EPS CAGR, which we believe is a conservative. We do a sanity check of our PEG ratio based TP using implied EV/EBITDA, P/BV, and P/E multiples.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Outlook</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On our TP of INR 420, FY27E implied EVEBITDA/PB/PE multiples are 11.4x/2.0x/20.8x all of which are reasonable in our view.

Hybrid working offers companies a significantly lower cost base with an average saving of $11,000 per employee[ii].</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>International Workplace Group is the leading global platform for work ‚Äì featuring thousands of locations in more than 120 countries ‚Äì with members able to access all the locations and business services via the IWG app.¬†</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As the ongoing shift towards more flexible, decentralised and hybrid models of working accelerates, the potential for further growth is exponential, with an estimated 1.2 billion white collar workers globally and a total addressable market of more than $2 trillion.

The currency is hovering near its all-time low of 88.80 hit last month. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    While strong intervention by the Reserve Bank of India had helped the currency pull back from the brink of 88.80 earlier this month, elevated dollar demand from importer hedging and the maturity of positions in the non-deliverable forwards market has weighed on the currency since. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Pressure also intensified on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve delivered an expected rate cut accompanied by commentary by Chair Jerome Powell that was perceived as hawkish. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the day, state-run banks were spotted offering dollars intermittently, which helped buffer the rupee against declines, two traders said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    The bias is towards further weakness in the rupee but the RBI will dictate the pace at these levels, one of the traders said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>FX advisory firm IFA Global expects the currency to hover between 88.20-89.20 over the next 6 weeks, describing its view as \"moderately bearish\" in a Friday note. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Asian currencies, meanwhile, were slightly higher on the day while the dollar index </span><span> was little changed at 99.4 after rising 0.3% in the previous session.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>India's benchmark equity indexes, the BSE Sensex </span><span> and Nifty 50 </span><span> were down about 0.2% each on the day.
