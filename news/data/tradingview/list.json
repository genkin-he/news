According to people familiar with the plans, the state producer has offered extra volumes to partners in the United Arab Emirates' onshore concession, with some of those barrels already sold on the spot market. The development comes as Saudi Arabia and Iran have reportedly accelerated shipments in recent weeks, amid concerns that tensions between Washington and Tehran could potentially disrupt exports.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The precise scale of the incremental Murban supply has not been disclosed. Adnoc holds a 60% stake in the onshore concession, which has the capacity to produce about 2 million barrels per day of Murban, while TotalEnergies, BP </span><span>, China National Petroleum Corp., Inpex, Zhenhua Oil and GS Energy own the remainder. Some of the added cargoes have weighed on Murban's relative performance this week, with the grade slipping against Brent and Dubai benchmarks as additional barrels were offered. At the same time, Brent futures touched $72.61 a barrel on Thursday, the highest intraday level since last July, underscoring that benchmark pricing dynamics remain firm even as regional supply signals build.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ahead of the OPEC+ gathering, some delegates have indicated they expect the group could agree to resume modest output increases from April. Adnoc has previously adjusted volumes in response to shifts in OPEC+ quotas aimed at managing prices or reclaiming market share, suggesting that the latest move may align with broader policy adjustments. For energy-focused investors, the combination of firmer Brent pricing and indications of rising Middle Eastern exports could introduce near-term volatility as the market awaits clearer guidance on production strategy.</span></p></span></div></div>",
