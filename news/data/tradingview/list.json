A higher degree of volatility than expected made clients more cautious, particularly across the consumer goods, auto, and tech and digital services sectors, she says. WPP said Ogilvy's like-for-like revenue less pass-through cost declined by a high-single percentage digit last year, which compares with a 5.4% fall for the group overall. Shares fall 2.5%.

Fourth-quarter sales came in 15% above the analysts' estimate, while Ebitda were 23% above their forecast. The analysts note, though, that gross margin was a bit shy of expectations, likely due to transitory integration costs associated with acquisitions and the transition of Alani Nu to Pepsi's distribution system. The company didn't provide guidance for the coming year. \"Still, given Celsius and Alani Nu brand momentum and margin expansion as integration activities resolve, we believe in our thesis that Celsius's energy drink category, on-trend brands, and operational synergies should allow it to grow at a pace well above beverage industry norms,\" the analysts write.
