            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Dov Lieber in Tel Aviv, Alexander Ward in Washington and Laurence Norman in Berlin</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Israeli and U.S. military intelligence had long watched and waited for a rare opportunity: senior political and military leaders in Iran holding a meeting — where they could all be killed at once.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The day finally came Saturday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Intelligence officers had identified not just one meeting but three, Israeli officials said. And they had a fix on Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, Iran's top decision maker and spiritual leader.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The moment was so unique that U.S. and Israeli warplanes struck in full daylight. Israeli jets dropped 30 bombs on Khamenei's compound leaving it scorched and shattered. President Trump said the Iranian leader was killed in the strike.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Israel also said it had killed a number of other top political and military officials including Ali Shamkhani, a top security adviser to Khamenei; Mohammad Pakpour, commander of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps; and Defense Minister Amir Nasirzadeh.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The attacks once again highlighted the capabilities of Israel's intelligence services and its ability to catch its enemies vulnerable and unaware.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Everybody waited for a target at midnight, when there is cover of darkness,\" said Amos Yadlin, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, adding that Israel struck late at night at the start of its surprise attack on Iran last June. The daylight attack, he said, \"was a tactical surprise.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran hasn't said whether Khamenei is dead, but if confirmed, the ayatollah's killing would be a remarkable capstone on more than two years of war in which Israel has also killed the top leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, indirectly precipitated the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, and created the most severe crisis in Iran's regime in its half-century in power.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But it also ushers in a period of uncertainty and possible instability that alarms other Persian Gulf governments, and reveals an ambition for regime change that has led to frustrating failures for prior American administrations. Both Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu encouraged Iranians to rise up and take control of their country. Few activists or analysts say there is a clear path for them to do so.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran retaliated by striking at targets not only in Israel but across the Persian Gulf, with explosions in Dubai, Bahrain and Qatar — countries that aren't usually caught up in the region's wars. Israeli air defenses intercepted missiles over northern Israel, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Israel and the U.S. said they were continuing to carry out strikes. Officials said they could be heavy for days.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This fateful operation will continue as long as necessary, and it requires patience,\" Netanyahu said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the lead-up to the campaign, Israel's military brass had been flying in and out of Washington to plan the offensive, including its top general, air force chief, head of military intelligence and Mossad director. Netanyahu met with Trump in December at the president's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, where they agreed publicly that military action would be justified if Iran persisted in its nuclear and ballistic-missile programs, and met with him again in early February at the White House.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, Israeli intelligence was gathering targets in Iran and sharing them with the U.S., Israeli officials said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Iranian government's precarious hold on power came into focus with an outbreak of protests that started in late December and spread quickly around the country. Trump warned he would intervene if Iran killed protesters and came close to ordering a strike in mid-January, but his advisers convinced him the U.S. didn't have enough firepower in the region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump ordered the largest buildup of American firepower in the Middle East in two decades, dispatching two aircraft carriers, about a dozen destroyers and a host of advanced fighter planes to the seas and bases around Iran.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, the president reopened a diplomatic track, saying he would rather cut a deal than attack. The U.S. team pushed tough demands — Iran would have to dismantle its nuclear facilities, turn over its stockpile of uranium and give up nuclear enrichment, none of which were acceptable to Iran.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran appeared to show an openness to compromises that it had rejected outright in the past.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But one of its latest proposals would have left Iran with thousands of advanced centrifuges and permitted Iran to enrich uranium as much as 20% — far in excess of the initial caps on Iran's nuclear program under the 2015 nuclear deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Iranian position wasn't anywhere close to the token enrichment program the U.S. was willing to consider, U.S. officials said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump got on the phone Thursday with his two envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, U.S. officials said. They told him the talks had gone badly: Tehran wasn't willing to end its nuclear enrichment or dismantle its missile program, the officials said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That further confirmed for Trump that he had one option left, the officials said. The U.S. also had intelligence that Iran considered attacking American targets before Trump authorized strikes, a senior administration official said, adding a sense of urgency to the president's decision. U.S. casualties and damage to American interests would be higher unless the U.S. moved first, the senior official said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The attack began just before 10 a.m. Iran time with enormous waves of missiles and jets. By evening, about 200 Israeli fighters had struck close to 500 different targets, in the largest single air campaign in Israel's history, the Israeli military said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. forces struck hundreds of targets of their own and defended against hundreds of Iranian missile and drone attacks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Israeli strikes focused on high-value officials and Iran's missile capabilities, while the U.S. attacks went after missile infrastructure and military targets, people familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In parallel with the strikes, Israel hit Iran with broad cyberattacks that targeted media and phone apps with messages calling on Iranians to rise up against their government, said people familiar with the matter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Israel hacked an app widely that helps Muslims track prayer times and is widely used in Iran, causing it to send messages calling on Iran's armed forces to defect and telling the population that \"help has arrived.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The state news agency IRNA was also hacked. One message on its front page referred to the unfolding strikes, calling it \"A terrifying hour for the security forces of the Ayatollahs' regime; the IRGC and the Basij have suffered a crippling blow.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Dov Lieber at dov.lieber@wsj.com, Alexander Ward at alex.ward@wsj.com and Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The reason? AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The blowback was quick and severe.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After Block CEO Jack Dorsey announced that his financial-technology firm was laying off 4,000 people, text threads between workers outside Block erupted, while executives began furiously dissecting the move. And then, they went public.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Square is just the beginning,\" former Meta and Salesforce executive Clara Shih  warned on X.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"A lot of the jobs that we've thrown human beings at the last 20 or 30 years, you won't need as many human beings doing those same jobs,\" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy  said in a television interview Friday, while noting new roles will also be created.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Everyone will point the finger at everyone else,\" investor Brian Norgard predicted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some saw Block's move as evidence of the company's mismanagement and overhiring. Plenty raised concerns that other executives might now follow suit and more aggressively lay off their own employees.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even if some considered AI a convenient excuse for the layoffs, the downsizing sparked outrage among technology workers. Many viewed the move as the clearest sign yet that companies would be far smaller in the future — and that employees would bear the pain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"When things crystallize like this, it brings out the pitchforks and the torches,\" said Marc Cenedella, CEO of the jobs platform Ladders. \"People are angry at the destabilizing impact that AI is inevitably going to have on our economy and our work life.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Backlash to AI has been simmering for months. In a YouGov survey released in December, 77% of respondents said they worried AI could pose a threat to humanity. A separate survey from the Pew Research Center showed many people were more concerned than excited about AI. Fearing higher utility costs or job losses, communities around the country have sought to block or delay new data-center projects, part of growing resistance to such projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Until recently, AI messaging from the business and tech elite in public has been largely focused on the benefits to economic growth, innovation and, naturally, bottom lines. Yes, there may be a bumpy transition and many roles will change, but businesses and the broader economy will emerge more prosperous, creating a raft of new jobs, the narrative goes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now, as angst over the AI boom shows up in stock-market jitters and viral online posts, more executives are saying that a key part of harnessing AI's promise will be to confront the economic and societal upheaval that could come with it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"AI will create more productivity, but it could create other derivative effects,\" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told investors Monday. \"Laying those people off will cause a problem, even if it creates more productivity in society. That's why society's got to think this through a little bit. It may happen faster than we can adjust to it.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The vibe shift around AI has been undeniable of late.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fears of its more destructive potential have rippled through markets in recent weeks, sending the stocks of software makers, insurers and even food-delivery apps like DoorDash lower. A viral thought experiment by Citrini Research foretelling mass white-collar unemployment, cratering consumer spending and financial contagion tapped into deep anxieties about the technology both on Wall Street and among the broader public.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some AI leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have rebutted the doom-and-gloom scenarios. Huang told a conference in February that the idea that AI will replace software is \"the most illogical thing in the world.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Growing AI fears</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To white-collar workers, it doesn't feel that illogical, especially as more companies initiate layoffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thomas Kerr, an accountant in Cleveland, said he has told friends and professional acquaintances that they should prepare for white-collar jobs to go away, and to find a sense of meaning in potentially new occupations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's the industrial revolution — people going from farmland into factories — but we don't know what the factories are yet,\" Kerr said of the AI era. As people lose their jobs, \"we're going to have to help people holistically find purpose and to let them know it's OK, and it's not your fault, and it's not your boss's fault.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On earnings calls, more companies are mentioning AI when referencing layoffs, according to AlphaSense, a financial-research platform.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Companies are also more explicitly including the backlash to AI as a potential threat to their companies. The number of S&amp;P 500 companies that included AI as a material risk in securities filings jumped to 72% last year from 12% in 2023, according to an analysis by the Conference Board and ESGAUGE. The game maker Roblox puts it like this in its annual report: \"Failure to address AI ethics issues by us or others in our industry could undermine public confidence in our use of AI.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The disclosures reflect a reality, analysts say, that much remains unclear about AI. \"Companies have realized this is so transformative, and there's still so many unknowns, that they do have to make sure to disclose these risks because they could have large implications,\" said Sarah Hoffman, director of AI thought leadership at AlphaSense.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Smaller teams</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Block expanded rapidly during the pandemic, as it built out its Cash App business alongside Square. The payments firm ended 2019 with 3,835 workers and employed 12,985 people by the end of 2023. Dorsey wrote on X that the company had overhired during the pandemic, and told analysts that he also believed other companies would undertake similar restructurings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Within the next year, I believe the majority of the companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes,\" Dorsey told analysts. \"I don't think we're early to this realization. I think most companies are late.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many longtime technology executives agree.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Smaller teams do better than larger teams, always,\" Mo Koyfman, founder and general partner at the venture-capital firm Shine Capital, said in an interview. \"Every additional body that you throw at a problem adds more process, more bureaucracy, more politics, more inefficiency, more coordination.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The rapid pace of change with AI has also led to a shift in how executives talk about AI. Many are beginning to be far more candid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since taking the top job at the telecom giant Verizon last fall, CEO Dan Schulman has predicted that artificial intelligence could trigger 20% to 30% unemployment over the next two to five years. He warns that humanoid robots might encroach on the manual-labor jobs some see as AI-proof. And he has called for more reskilling efforts to help tame the coming tech storm.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We are at a precipice right now that if you say to your employees there's not gonna be any job disruption, I think you lose all credibility — because all of them get it that there's going to be,\" Schulman said in a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, earlier this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Verizon said in November it planned to cut more than 13,000 jobs, its largest reduction ever. As part of the move, the company also created a $20 million reskilling and career-transition fund for affected workers.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jim Carlton | Photography by Kelsey Brunner for WSJ</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>TELLURIDE, Colo. — On a snowy March evening last year, a local official stepped to the microphone to declare that this winter ski paradise was in crisis. He singled out one man.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Chuck is failing us all,\" said Paul Wisor, grim-faced and wearing a blue puffer jacket, as he stood before the council and a packed room of residents. They gave him a standing ovation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Chuck\" was Chuck Horning, the longtime owner of the Telluride Ski &amp; Golf Resort.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While many ski towns have spent years mourning the rise of corporate conglomerates swallowing mom-and-pop owners, a growing faction in Telluride was pushing in the opposite direction. They wanted to oust Horning, one of the last independent operators of a major Western ski resort.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Detractors argued Horning had allowed the resort to lag behind rivals like Vail and Jackson Hole.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Time to chuck Chuck,\" councilman Dan Enright posted on social media. \"Telluride, it's about damn time for change.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Change came — just not the kind anyone anticipated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Over the following year, Telluride descended into what some called the \"ski-gate scandal\": an apparent attempted coup to force Horning to sell to investors. The upheaval has involved resignations, a work stoppage and a protest. In recent days, local leaders hired an outside team of former federal prosecutors to investigate whether any town elected official or employee committed wrongdoing in connection with the ordeal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Horning, an 82-year-old real estate mogul who skied in jeans, buys his shirts at Costco and cuts his own hair, has his own name for what Telluride has become. \"Little Chicago,\" he said, sitting in his Newport Beach, Calif., office, working through a Taco Bell bean burrito. On a wall, a clock was set permanently to Telluride time. \"This place is as corrupt as anything.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'Adventure investing'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The feud is unfolding in one of America's most spectacular corners, a box canyon beneath the country's highest concentration of 13,000- and 14,000-foot peaks. Telluride attracts the ulta-wealthy — Oprah Winfrey and Kelly Ripa own homes in the area; Forbes dubbed it the Hamptons of the West, while Realtor.com ranked it the most luxurious ski town in the U.S. in 2024. Yet it retains a hippie vibe, with no stop lights and bumper stickers bearing slogans like \"Crazy is still better than corporate.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The town was born in an 1800s gold rush, a wild place that drew outlaws, including Butch Cassidy, who robbed his first bank here. Like many Old West boomtowns, it went bust, until skiing became the new gold. Beverly Hills entrepreneur Joe Zoline founded the ski resort in 1972, and a Sony heir owned it before Horning took control about 20 years ago.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Horning said he grew up in a strict Seventh-day Adventist household in Northern California, forbidden from reading anything other than the Bible and approved nonfiction. He once sneaked home a copy of Zane Grey's classic Western, \"Riders of the Purple Sage,\" and envisioned his future as a type of freewheeling cowboy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I just wanted to get out away from the freaking people telling me what to do,\" he recalled.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>His father was a surgeon who built hospitals, and Horning learned real estate at his side. He established a chain of senior homes before pouring millions into Southern California commercial properties. When a church friend suggested he expand into ski resorts, Horning visited Aspen but was turned off by \"all these fancy people,\" he said. \"Not for me.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The friend sent him a photo of another town. \"He says, 'Telluride is for sale',\" Horning recalled. \"I said, what the hell's that?\" After a visit to Austria to see how a similarly remote resort there succeeded, Horning took the plunge. He bought control of the Telluride resort and adjacent land for $45 million. \"I call it adventure investing,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As the new head of Telluride, he overhauled what he considered the resort's \"horrible\" cuisine. He fired a manager over the bad chili and other subpar food. He backed two culinary standouts — Bon Vivant, perched at 11,200 feet, and Alpino Vino, billed as North America's highest-elevation restaurant and known for its tomato soup and signature grilled cheese.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Around town, Horning cut a colorful figure. He was seen strolling about wearing a gold chain and Western clothes, sometimes with a cowboy hat. \"He used to come out and shake people's hands,\" said Paul Savage, 74, a longtime local skier.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Discontent simmers</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But over the years, Horning's unconventional style alienated some. Locals had long relied on the resort to draw visitors to the two towns that border it: Telluride, in the box canyon, and Mountain Village, higher up the slopes. Yet Horning cut the resort's marketing budget, convinced the money was wasted. He recalled paying $70,000 for a full-page ad in a travel magazine and getting three phone calls.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The way you market is word-of-mouth,\" he said. \"Advertising is bullshit.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Instead, he plowed money into services such as ski valets, who wear yellow jackets and help guests carry their gear. He narrowed ads to target markets like Phoenix and Dallas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Repeat visitors like Sonny Baker, 53, of Boston, praised Horning for keeping the resort homey and the crowds a fraction of those elsewhere. But critics called him cheap.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Chuck is a real-estate investor, you know, so he tries to spend the least amount of money,\" said Dirk de Pagter, the founder of a Telluride real-estate firm.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Horning, they say, also had a pattern of discarding managers. He even fired his own son, Chad, who Horning said led several attempted management coups against him. Chad Horning declined to comment, saying, \"This is a highly personal family matter.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Resort operations worsened, some critics say, after the 2020 departure of a respected ski industry executive who had served as CEO. Some skiers noticed less grooming on runs. A popular lift-top cafe closed for rebuilding with no signs of reopening. On Christmas Eve 2024, a mechanical problem prompted the evacuation of 70 skiers from a lift.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's just like a litany of problems,\" said Kristen Hughes, another local real-estate broker. \"It's not one thing. It's like a lot of things.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Horning said the former CEO was dismissed \"with cause,\" that he tries to hire the right people and get out of their way, that all the lifts pass safety requirements, and that the cafe is awaiting permitting. He also said grooming has been unaffected and the high costs of running a ski resort don't leave him enough income to replace everything, though he spent about $6 million last summer upgrading three lifts, with more work set for this summer. \"We're not there, but we're on the way.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A local 2024 market analysis showed Telluride lagging behind the competition. While the number of air passengers flying into nearby airports during ski season continued to rise at Vail, Aspen and Jackson Hole following the pandemic, they had flattened in Telluride.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There needs to be commitment, not only on spending more, but it even needs to be a commitment on keeping the current infrastructure up,\" de Pagter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'Hostile takeover'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The tipping point was, on the surface, a typical small-town dispute.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Early last year, Horning declined to renew permission for the sponsor of a weekly summer concert series to use a parcel of his property. He did so after a dispute with the organizers involving crowd sizes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wisor, Mountain Village's town manager, bristled. At a March 2025 gathering at Town Hall, the council voted to claim a public easement on Horning's land. Then Wisor stood at a lectern and gave a speech aimed at Horning. \"Tonight, I think it's pretty clear that Chuck is neglecting both the resort and the community,\" he said, as snow fell outside.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The audience and council members rose and applauded.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Horning was furious. He wrote a letter to the local paper, calling Wisor \"slanderous, mean-spirited and extraordinarily unprofessional.\" A state district court, siding with a legal challenge filed by Horning's lawyers, dismissed the town's petition to condemn the parcel. Horning reinstated permission for the concerts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An Instagram account called \"ChuckChuck\" materialized, depicting Horning as the Grinch. That angered his supporters. \"He does a lot for this community and most of that effort and care go unnoticed,\" said Baylor Blanchard, the owner of a property-management firm, who was recently hired to be a resort executive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bigger fights were taking shape. Local officials accused Horning of backing out of a plan to help fund an overhaul of the iconic gondola connecting Telluride and Mountain Village — a free 12-minute ride that stitches the two towns together. Horning said he didn't go along partly because he didn't trust how local leaders would spend his money. \"These people get the power,\" he said. \"They're dangerous.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mountain Village responded by passing, through a November 2025 ballot measure, a 5% tax on lift-ticket sales at Horning's resort to fund the gondola. On top of that, Mountain Village commissioned a study that concluded Horning's water rates — used for snow-making — should rise by more than 300%. Wisor framed it as simple fairness: residential rates had climbed 146% since 1998, while the resort's snow-making rates had only risen 10%, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Horning's lawyer said making snow enables the resort to open earlier, which benefits the entire economy. Horning suspected something more sinister was at play.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I'm sure you're familiar with a hostile takeover,\" Horning said. \"That's exactly what it was.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then, in late December, during the busy holiday season, Horning's 76-person ski patrol voted to strike.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The patrollers, responsible for safety on one of the nation's steepest ski mountains, demanded a 35% pay raise. They argued that Telluride's high cost of living forced many to work multiple jobs and have long commutes.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Sune Engel Rasmussen</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the austere cleric who ruled Iran for more than three decades and reshaped the balance of power across the Middle East through confrontation with the West and the projection of militant Shiite influence, has died. He was 86.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The undisputed leader of post-revolutionary Iran and spiritual leader of millions of Shiite Muslims, Khamenei developed the nation's nuclear program and built a once-powerful network of regional militant groups that Israel has been systematically dismantling for more than a year. His resistance to the U.S. and Israel resonated widely in the Middle East, even as it gradually fell out of step with large parts of Iran's population, many of whom despised living under his firebrand form of theocratic governance and wanted to escape the country's global isolation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After taking power in 1989, despite domestic and foreign pressure, Khamenei built Iran into a formidable military and political power. His predecessor, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, had left the nation bankrupt and humiliated, following an eight-year war with neighboring Iraq, one of the deadliest global conflicts of the past century.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"When Khomeini died, the Islamic Republic was a dumpster fire,\" said Afshon Ostovar, associate professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif. \"Khamenei, through guile and persistence, was able to achieve something pretty miraculous. He turned Iran into a regional power that controlled a pretty wide geography.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An instrument for Khamenei's expansion was a network of armed groups in the Middle East that fought at Iran's behest, pinning down foes and providing Tehran with strategic space to prevent direct enemy attacks. At the height of Iran's expansion, it controlled a land corridor running from Tehran through Iraq and Syria to Lebanon, through which it could transport arms and personnel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Khamenei's fortunes changed with what first appeared to be a victory: the attack led by Hamas, its Palestinian ally, on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The deadliest single assault ever on Israel, it was heralded by Tehran as a testament to the strength of the alliance it had built from scratch, and brandished Khamenei's self-styled status as a flag bearer for the Palestinian people.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the war Israel unleashed in response, in Gaza and beyond, set in motion a cascade of events that would diminish Iran's regional power and leave Khamenei exposed. The decapitation of close Iranian allies Hezbollah and Hamas, and a series of Israeli strikes on Iran that killed some of its highest-ranking commanders, upended the entire Middle East.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the time of his death, Khamenei no longer drove an expansion of Iranian power, but was working hard to salvage the pieces of the Islamic Republic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>His death leaves Iran at a precipice. Khamenei was the linchpin that held together hard-liners and more moderate elements of the Islamic Republic. He secured his rule at home by building fierce loyalty among those who supported him, and a pervasive surveillance state to suppress those who didn't.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So critical was Iran's Supreme Leader to the nation's security that his health was considered a state secret, though state media said he had prostate surgery in 2014. Now Iran's leaders will have to navigate a transition of power, while confronting domestic discontent, economic hardship and external pressure for change from the U.S. and others.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Without him, Iranians are left in uncertainty. Khamenei's rule partly depended on being a guarantor of national security. Before Israel's military campaign to destroy its nuclear facilities and kill senior military leaders and scientists, the Islamic Republic under him had provided relative safety for its citizens from the wars and terrorist attacks that ravaged neighboring countries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran kept hostile forces away from its soil for decades after the 1980-1988 war with Iraq — which killed hundreds of thousands of Iranians, including from chemical weapons deployed by Saddam Hussein. From the mid-2010s, while Islamic State killed tens of thousands in neighboring Iraq and Afghanistan, the extremist group also carried out four major attacks in Iran, killing roughly 150 people — fewer than it killed over the same period in France.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran's nuclear program brought Khamenei into conflict with Israel and the West. He reactivated the program in the 1990s, after it had been initiated by the Shah in the 1950s. The construction of atomic plants had stalled during the revolution and the subsequent war with Iraq.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the Supreme Leader repeatedly insisted the program was peaceful and issued a religious pronouncement asserting Iran wouldn't acquire nuclear arms, Western officials believe Iran was seeking to develop nuclear weapons until at least 2003. The fast pace of the program's development worried Western powers who imposed increasingly stringent trade restrictions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While Khamenei expanded Iran's clout, economically he fared worse. International sanctions and government mismanagement prevented Iran from fully capitalizing on its immense natural resources. Its regional ambitions were a drain on its already stretched finances. Iran was often prevented from selling oil, its main export, and the wealth from what it did sell disproportionately enriched a small elite.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran under Khamenei did register progress in some important areas. It boasts some of the best healthcare and education in the region. Life expectancy increased to 77 years in 2023 from 62 in 1986, according to the World Bank. In the same period, Iran boosted female literacy rates to 81% from 41%. But millions of Iranians continue to live in poverty and lack jobs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Neither a full-blown dictatorship nor a democracy, Iran's cleric-ruled system contains elements of both. Khamenei knew how to strike a balance to ensure his political survival. Allowing moderate forces a space in elections gave Khamenei a veneer of legitimacy, while political restrictions ensured that he never lost control.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If he let democracy loose, he'd be removed,\" said Mohammad Ayatollahi Tabaar, associate professor at Texas A&amp;M University. \"On the other hand, if he put an end to these things [such as elections], there could be a public revolt.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, in recent presidential elections, the establishment sidelined scores of moderate and reformist candidates from running for the presidency, helping smooth a path to victory for candidates loyal to Khamenei. His growing reliance on hard-liners in the system put the Islamic Republic on an increasingly confrontational course with its enemies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Khamenei held a pope-like position in the Shiite Muslim world: elected by a council of elders to convey the word of God. His black turban, clerical robes and graying beard composed the picture that adorned offices, walls and billboards across the country.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To millions of Iranians, he maintained that authority until his death. Khamenei sought to guide the world's Muslims, not just Shiites, and said Iran wanted to usher in an Islamic revival that would sweep the region, \"like the scent of spring flowers that is carried by the breeze.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For many people in the Middle East, Khamenei's touch didn't feel like a breeze. His strong-armed governance confined tens of thousands of critics to prison and drove hundreds of thousands of Iranians into exile.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>His legacy will also be tainted by his stern support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during that country's civil war that broke out in 2011, killing hundreds of thousands and displacing millions. For over a decade, Iran sent Revolutionary Guard forces to Syria and mobilized tens of thousands of impoverished militia fighters from neighboring countries to bolster Assad's war effort that centered on starving and bombing cities into submission.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Khamenei's virulent anti-Americanism came to the fore during the U.S. invasion of Iraq, when he ordered Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to fund and train local militias. The armed groups, part of Iran's expanded footprint in the region, killed hundreds of U.S. servicemen, in addition to thousands of Iraqis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The presence of foreign troops is damaging for the Iraqis,\" Khamenei said in 2005. \"The U.S. and Britain will eventually have to leave Iraq with a bitter experience.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Through propping up predominantly Shiite groups, Khamenei did more to sow sectarian strife among Muslims than to unite them, his critics say, and he damaged Shiite Islam in the process. As public unrest became more frequent during his rule, so did chants from protesters of \"Death to Khamenei\" or calls to stop funding Iran's allies in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"After Khamenei's regime, Iran is far more secular and critical of Shiism than when he came to power,\" said Abbas Milani, director of Iranian Studies at Stanford University.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite his fundamentalist beliefs, Khamenei was a nimble politician. He survived waves of social change in Iran and multiple American administrations bent on undermining his rule.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He surrounded himself with advisers and military commanders who kept Iran largely safe from foreign threats.

It is also roughly double the national share of 8.8% last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cheryl Norris, a 76-year-old who works as an independent antique dealer, has owned a pair of homes in Northern California for decades. Her two children in their 30s don't see a clear path toward buying a home there themselves. California's home prices rank among the highest in the U.S., reaching a median single-family sales price of nearly $900,000 last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When Norris dies, she plans to leave her Santa Rosa property, with its low-pitched roof and large picture window, and her more expansive three-bedroom retreat set on more than 2 acres in San Rafael to her daughter and son.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Even though my kids work as hard as I did, it's sad that inheritance is their best shot at homeownership here,\" she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The state's high rate of inherited homes reflects California's unique circumstances: years of skyrocketing home prices, and tax policies that encourage owners to avoid selling their houses before they die.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The people who inherit these houses enjoy tremendous benefits. They can move into homes that they otherwise might not be able to buy at current prices, or they can sell them and keep the proceeds without having to pay capital-gains taxes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the high rate of homes passed on after death is distorting the state's housing market, favoring longtime homeowners and their families over all other home buyers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Homeownership has become a 'til-death-do-us-part scenario\" in California, said Jeff Fishman, a Los Angeles financial adviser.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That limits the state's supply of homes for sale, pushing prices higher and increasing the incentive not to sell, said Ken DeLeon, founder of DeLeon Realty in Palo Alto, Calif.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We're in this negative feedback loop,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Homeowners are holding on to their homes for longer across the U.S., partly because many older people are still working or want to age in place. And the inheritance rate is rising nationally.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But these rates are even higher in California, where the typical homeowner stayed put for almost 17 years in 2024. The national median was about 12 years, according to Redfin.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The situation can be traced in part back to 1978, when voters passed Proposition 13, which generally caps property-tax increases at 2% a year based on the most recent purchase price. Longtime owners pay taxes based on decades-old valuations. New buyers are taxed at much higher current market valuations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This disparity encourages many homeowners to stay put rather than move to a different home and take on a higher tax bill. A new buyer today can pay 10 times as much property tax as a neighbor who purchased in the 1970s.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>California tightened its property-tax rules in 2021 to limit the circumstances in which heirs can keep a parent's low tax rate. So only one of Norris's homes will benefit from a low property-tax bill after her death.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This change has encouraged more heirs of vacation properties to sell, said Rachel Dodson, partner at the law firm Ayoub &amp; Dodson. But it doesn't meaningfully change the math that encourages homeowners to pass on the home to their heirs in the first place.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The specter of a huge capital-gains tax bill creates another major obstacle to selling. Federal law allows a $250,000 exclusion ($500,000 for couples) for homeowners selling their primary residences. With many California homes now worth millions, homeowners often have gains that far exceed these limits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the home is inherited, its value for tax purposes resets to its market price on the date of death. For a home that appreciated from $200,000 to $2 million, the heir could save more than $500,000 in federal and state taxes, said Miklos Ringbauer, an accountant in Los Angeles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Darred Greenside, along with his brother and cousin, inherited a three-bedroom San Francisco home that his aunt and uncle purchased in 1964 for $41,000. Greenside and his brother bought out their cousin's share of the house, and Greenside moved from Seattle to live in the home.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At more than $18,000 a year, Greenside's property-tax bill is far higher than the $1,100 his aunt paid annually. But because he has no mortgage payment, Greenside is still saving money compared with paying rent for a smaller apartment in the city, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I don't have any regrets,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some politicians and housing economists want to increase the capital-gains exclusion for home sales to encourage older people to sell their homes before death, especially large houses that could be desirable for younger families.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In many parts of the country, older people need to sell their homes to cover the cost of assisted living or other types of care. But in California, homeowners with mortgages have about $600,000 in equity on average, according to Cotality. They can take out home equity lines of credit or rent out their homes to fund their living expenses without selling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For Jameson Norris, Cheryl Norris's 35-year-old son who works gig jobs like ride-share driving, the prospect of inheriting his mom's homes with his sister is both a relief and humbling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 1988, Cheryl and her late husband bought their Santa Rosa home for about $149,000. Decades later, the home has roughly quadrupled in value. And the San Rafael hilltop home, valued at about $281,500 in 1985, is now worth an estimated $1.8 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jameson said he'd likely never be able to buy his own house in San Rafael, where the typical home costs about $1.2 million, according to Zillow.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's a bit depressing knowing it's nearly impossible for me to buy my own place,\" he said, \"even though I'm so grateful.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Nicole Friedman at nicole.friedman@wsj.com and Veronica Dagher at Veronica.Dagher@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Bitcoin is trading at weekly RSI levels historically seen near bear market bottoms, signaling that selling pressure may be easing. While confirmation is needed, the market is in a zone often marking late-stage capitulation. The key question: was the recent drop the final flush, or is one last shakeout still ahead?</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>RSI Compression Signals Downside Exhaustion</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to crypto analyst Batman, Bitcoin’s weekly RSI has fallen back into the same territory that historically marked prior bear market bottoms. This momentum zone has repeatedly appeared during late-stage capitulation phases, making it a critical signal that the market could be nearing another major turning point.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, Batman is clear that this does not confirm the bottom is already in, stressing the importance of waiting for proper confirmation before declaring a reversal. Still, he notes that when RSI compresses to these levels on the weekly timeframe, Bitcoin has typically been much closer to a structural low than to the beginning of a fresh collapse.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reflecting on the 2022 bear cycle, Batman points out that once RSI entered this extreme zone, price managed to print one final lower low. However, that move occurred very close to the ultimate bottom, indicating that most of the downside had already played out by the time momentum reached such depressed readings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The analyst concludes that probabilities matter more than precision. From his perspective, when Bitcoin trades at these weekly RSI levels, it historically represents a zone where strategic accumulation becomes increasingly attractive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Bitcoin’s Six Consecutive Weekly Lower Highs — A Rare Signal</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a recent weekly Bitcoin analysis, SuperBro pointed out that BTC has now printed six consecutive weekly lower highs, a rare structural pattern. The last time this occurred was during the COVID crash in 2020, a period marked by extreme volatility and eventual macro reversal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Price is currently slipping beneath the 200-week EMA and the volume Point of Control (POC), though the weekly candle has not yet closed. A reclaim of the POC before the close could trigger a sharp upside reaction and signal that the breakdown attempt is losing strength.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Just below current levels sits the rising 200-week SMA, adding another layer of higher-timeframe support. RSI remains at extreme levels, suggesting that momentum is already deeply stretched. When you combine oversold conditions with six straight lower highs pressing into major support, the case for sustained downside continuation becomes less convincing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beyond the near-term structure, the broader megaphone formation remains intact. If that macro pattern ultimately plays out, its upper trajectory projects potential targets north of $300,000, keeping the long-term expansion thesis firmly on the table despite current compression.</span></p></span></div></div>",
