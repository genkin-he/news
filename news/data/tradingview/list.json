            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Ben Dummett</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jack Dorsey isn't wasting any time. The chairman and co-founder of Block is cutting 40% of the payments company's workforce, or more than 4,000 employees, betting artificial-intelligence tools can fill the gap.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here's how he explained the decision.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This isn't about cutting costs</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dorsey said Block, which owns Square and Cash App, is financially sound. Instead, the tech entrepreneur argues that companies need flatter structures and fewer employees to thrive in the AI era.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company,\" Dorsey said Thursday on a call with analysts. \"A significantly smaller team using the tools we're building can do more and do it better.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Block is already seeing the change internally, he added, \"and intelligence tool capabilities are compounding faster every single week.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Better to move fast than slow</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A big challenge for companies wanting to restructure is how to minimize disruption and maintain the morale of employees sticking around. In a memo to Block staff that was posted on X, Dorsey said he had two options: To cut gradually over time or \"be honest about where we are and act on it now.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He favors the second option. \"Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,\" Dorsey wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A harbinger for U.S. Inc.?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Employees across companies should brace themselves for similar large-scale layoffs, Dorsey predicted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Within the next year, I believe the majority of the companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes,\" Dorsey told analysts. \"I don't think we're early to this realization. I think most companies are late.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cuts mean changes for customers too</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Large-scale layoffs at Block won't just impact the company's workers. Its customers will feel the shift too, Dorsey said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The use of AI tools means customers will be able to build their own features directly, he said, on top of the company's capabilities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A risky move</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dorsey acknowledged that such a big cull could risk Block's ability to serve its customers in the short term. But he remains defiant.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"A decision at this scale carries risk. But so does standing still,\" Dorsey said in his memo.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Block has conducted a review to determine the roles and people it requires to expand the business, Dorsey said, adding that it had \"pressure-tested those decisions from multiple angles.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I made this decision, and I'll own it,\" he wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The Swiss maker of generic drugs earlier this week reported fourth-quarter results that were uneventful but were nonetheless well received, Papadakis says. In the short term, there is limited room for positive revisions to earnings estimates, the analyst says. Recent share gains reflect a favorable backdrop and a step up in biosimilar sales growth in 2026, but not necessarily a likely deceleration next year, according to DB. DB cuts its recommendation on Sandoz stock to hold from buy, but lifts its target price to 70 Swiss francs from 63 francs. Shares fall 2.7% to 68.44 francs.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>OTTAWA, ON, Feb. 27, 2026 /CNW/ - Northern Shield Resources Inc. (\"Northern Shield\" or the \"Company\") </span><span> is pleased to announce that through map staking, option agreements and property purchase, the Company has increased its land position from 32 km(2) to 420 km(2) pursuant to definitive agreements entered into with arm's length parties on February 18, 2026 (collectively, the \"Definitive Agreements\"). The Company's flagship Root &amp; Cellar Gold-Silver-Tellurium-Copper Property (\"Root &amp; Cellar\" or the \"Property\"), on the Burin Peninsula in southeastern Newfoundland, forms the core of the land position. Recent work at Root &amp; Cellar, suggests a large, diatreme/porphyry-hosted, polymetallic Cu-Au-Ag-Te-Mo zone, which was the impetus for the land acquisitions in the Avalon Zone of eastern Newfoundland.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The most significant of these new properties is the 212 km(2) Fortune Property (Figure 1) composed of two property options totalling 65 km(2) , with the remainder having been map staked directly by Northern Shield. The Fortune Property covers a 40 km trend that is highly prospective for porphyry copper and epithermal gold systems, and includes multiple indications of such systems including 4 known occurrences:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stewart: The Stewart prospect represents the most aerially extensive and continuous zone of exposed alteration on the Burin Peninsula, reaching widths of up to 850 m and extending along strike for upwards of 4 km (Figure 2a). It represents an extensive zone of advanced argillic alteration including pyrophyllite, alunite and vuggy quartz, interpreted to be a lithocap to a porphyry Cu-Mo-Au system. The lithocap is anomalous in gold, copper and molybdenum over significant intervals including historical surface trenching results of 0.09 g/t Au over 219 m, (Dyke, B., 2008,) and a drill intercept of 0.13 g/t Au over 111 m (Setterfield, T., 2016,) along with anomalous Cu and Mo.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Forty Creek: The Forty Creek intermediate sulphidation quartz vein is along strike from Stewart and hosts gold and silver tellurides with values up to 59 g/t Au and 2,290 g/t Ag (Setterfield, T. 2011). (Figure 2b) and grab samples with values to 0.16% Cu and 0.1 g/t Au in a nearby silicified pyrophyllite alteration zone.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Point Rosie: Hosts multiple quartz-sericite-pyrite (phyllic) alteration zones consistent with epithermal and porphyry copper systems over a 4 km strike length. Copper-gold-silver anomalous quartz veins (Figure 2c) with values up to 0.67 g/t Au and 0.65% Cu (Noel, N., 2020) have recently been discovered within a 2.5 km gold-in-soil anomaly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Feeder Brook: Hosts multiple quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration zones with grab samples values to 0.9 g/t Au (Dimmell, P., 2003). Nearby till samples collected by the Geological Survey of Newfoundland and Labrador are anomalous in porphyry copper pathfinder elements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some of the assay certificates for the results mentioned have been reviewed by Northern Shield while others have not, and Northern Shield is relying on third party assessment reports filed with the Newfoundland and Labrador government for the values quoted. None of the samples were collected or assayed by Northern Shield and hence cannot be fully and independently verified by the Company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company has also acquired 3 claim groups totalling 136 km(2) on the Cape St Mary's Peninsula across Placentia Bay from Root &amp; Cellar. The primary target is a porphyry copper system similar to Root &amp; Cellar based on Cu and Mo anomalous till samples reported by the Geological Survey of Newfoundland and Labrador and description of \"malachite-stained quartz stockwork veining\" in the government's mineral occurrence database. Some of the tills are also highly anomalous in nickel and cobalt and since gabbroic rocks are reported from the area, the claims will also be targeted for magmatic Ni-Cu-Co sulphides.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We are very excited about these new land positions. We see growing interest in the porphyry copper potential of the Burin Peninsula as we uncover more mineralization at the Creston Copper Target. As such these new properties cement our \"first mover status\" and allow us to use the knowledge we have gained from Root &amp; Cellar to our advantage. We haven't just amalgamated a prospective land position but amalgamated, incentivized, and mobilised some of the most experienced and tenacious prospectors in the region. They are our first asset and, collectively, have seen more rocks on the Burin than anybody. I have little doubt that they will have success in finding new mineralization in the spring.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- Ian Bliss, President and CEO, Northern Shield</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Definitive Agreements</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Point Rosie/Feeder Brook</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the Point Rosie/Feeder Brook Option Agreement (the \"Point Rosie Agreement\"), the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Seabourne Resources Inc.

Our approach harnesses both the adaptive and innate immune systems with the goal of restoring immune function and generating lasting immunological memory in patients. At the core of our strategy is the Cancer BioShield(TM) platform, which is designed to stimulate critical lymphocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T cells, and memory T cells via our proprietary IL-15 superagonist, ANKTIVA(R) (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept). Our Cancer BioShield platform is anchored by this antibody-cytokine fusion protein and is complemented by a portfolio that includes adenovirus-vectored vaccines, allogeneic (off-the-shelf) and autologous NK-cell therapies, and additional immunomodulators intended to promote immunogenic cell death and support durable immune responses while potentially reducing reliance on high-dose chemo-radiation therapy.
