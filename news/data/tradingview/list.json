            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Joanne Kaufman</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Walk-ins are welcome at Susan's, the \"brightly lit box\" of a nail salon that's the setting for \"Pick a Color,\" Souvankham Thammavongsa's slender, superb debut novel. And when business is sluggish, the mani-pedi price drops to 10 bucks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The one-star rating may or may not explain why there generally aren't sufficient advance bookings to keep the five chairs at Susan's continuously occupied. In any case, increasing traffic is the understandable goal of the shop's proprietor, Ning, who readers follow through a typical, typically long workday. And people can't always be counted on to keep their appointments. Their loss, as far as Ning is concerned.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There are others like us scattered around the city,\" she notes. (That American city is never specified.) \"And some are just a few doors down from us. But we're the best. It's no lie and I'm not kidding anybody when I say that. We're the best. I get people in and out, in and out, and so do the Susans.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To be clear, regardless of what's written on the ID tags, no employee is actually named Susan. \"So many girls come and go. I don't want to bother getting new name tags each time,\" says Ning, who is eminently practical — she pushes cost-effective threading over wasteful wax and tops off nail-polish bottles with polish thinner — and always eager to cut her losses. \"Besides, you know, it's never difficult to pronounce a name like Susan.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To add to the aura of interchangeability, Ning and her employees are all more or less the same height; they dress alike (black pants, black T-shirt, black running shoes), leave their nails unvarnished and keep their glossy black hair at the same length. Noting a follicular discrepancy, Ning grabs a pair of scissors and demands that one of the nail technicians, Mai, submit to an immediate 2-inch trim.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This insistence on absolute conformity is framed as Ning's desire to make things simpler for the clients (there's also a bit of contempt mixed in). It can be better read as Ning's desire for anonymity — she hasn't heard anyone call her by her real name in what seems like decades, and she's good with it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But all those efforts at twinning are a bit futile. Ning can't help but stand out. Ironically, considering her profession, she is missing her left ring finger, a loss that is noted several times but cannily goes unexplained. \"I don't hide what I don't have,\" she says. \"I spread the space I do have wider. Pinky finger and middle finger go their separate ways.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, her frequently stated eagerness to get customers in and out, in and out, 20 minutes max — \"and that goes for the girls too, if they don't have what it takes\" — seems more about a discomfort with intimacy and attachment than about a drive for maximum efficiency and maximum revenue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But Ning defends her impatience. \"People in love are boring,\" she notes of a steady, chatty customer known simply as the waitress.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Most people are not that interesting,\" she says at another point. \"They're the same to me. Hands and toes, toes and hands.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ning, 41, is a former boxer and Olympic hopeful whose time in the ring informs her world-weary, world-wary worldview, her tough management style (\"I don't like to chitchat, no how-are-yous, no coddling\") and her quick, jabbing insights about both the employees and the clients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apparently, the easiest shakedown targets are single people. \"They aren't spending it on anyone, and so they have a little more to spend on themselves,\" Ning thinks. \"And they'll do anything — anything, I tell you — if you can help them imagine not being alone anymore.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The new girl didn't knock, or do anything to call attention to herself, \" she thinks, summing up a fresh hire. \"Probably thinks when she breathes she's making too much noise. . . . The way she waves her hand tells me everything about her.

Growth funds remain 74% actively managed, while Value funds stand at 67%. In contrast, just 25% of \"Blend\" (Core) category assets stay under active management.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Midcaps have the highest percentage of active management, likely due to the lack of good passive alternatives in this segment.

Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary have the lowest passive ownership at around 20%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The continued growth of passive investing raises important questions for all market participants as Jefferies suggests passive's market share could accelerate further given active management's poor performance this year. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, the persistent preference for active management in Growth and Value styles indicates investors still see value in specialized approaches.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(Ragini Mathur)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>*****</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>EARLIER ON LIVE/ MARKETS:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MORGAN STANLEY DROPS LONG EURO, YEN CALL VS DOLLAR CLICK HERE</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>NASDAQ RALLIES AS AMAZON, NVIDIA OFFER HALLOWEEN TREATS CLICK HERE</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    POTENTIAL FOR \"ONE OF THE MORE CONSEQUENTIAL BOE MEETINGS IN RECENT MEMORY\"      CLICK HERE  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    WHITHER EUROPEAN BANK STOCKS?
