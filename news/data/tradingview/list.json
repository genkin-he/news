Consumers continued to show demand for out-of-home entertainment experiences, with a wide variety of great movies bringing audiences to the big screen at Marcus Theatres during the holiday season. We are excited for a 2026 film slate that includes several family films and some of the biggest movie franchises. In our hotel division, stable leisure demand and strong group bookings contributed to a year of record revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, with our newly renovated properties driving our outperformance in both the fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2025. The positive impact of the strategic reinvestments made over the past few years will continue to position Marcus Hotels &amp; Resorts well for both the near- and long-term, as our renovated assets continue to win in their markets.

Gramz, president of Marcus Theatres. \"Looking to fiscal 2026, holdover fourth quarter fiscal 2025 films, including the long run of Avatar: Fire and Ash, and several new films released in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 has kicked off what is expected to be a robust slate of must-see movies in the year ahead. The franchise heavy slate includes the newest installments of several family favorites that tend to play well in our markets, including Toy Story 5, Minions &amp; Monsters, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, and the live action adaptation of Moana, along with popular action adventures like Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu, Spider-Man: Brand New Day, Dune: Part Three, and Avengers: Doomsday. Moreover, the highly anticipated release of Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey, nostalgic revivals like Scream 7 and The Devil Wears Prada 2, and a large slate of other appealing wide release films means fiscal 2026 has more than something for everyone. And with the highest concentration of luxury recliner seating and PLF screens among the top theatre circuits, incredible food and beverage offerings, consumer-friendly technology, and the outstanding contributions of our associates, Marcus Theatres is well positioned to capitalize on what is expected to be a memorable year of moviegoing.\" Several films have contributed to early fiscal 2026 first quarter results, including the carry over impact of late 2025 releases including Avatar: Fire and Ash, Zootopia 2, The Housemaid, Song Sung Blue, Anaconda, Marty Supreme, and The Spongebob Movie: Search for Square Pants, and new releases during the first quarter of fiscal 2026 such as 28 Years Later, The Bone Temple, Send Help, GOAT, Wuthering Heights and I Can Only Imagine 2.

The company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) attributable to Marcus Corporation before investment income or loss, interest expense, other expense, gain or loss on disposition of property, equipment and other assets, equity earnings or losses from unconsolidated joint ventures, net earnings or losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and non-cash share-based compensation expense, adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the company does not consider indicative of its core operating performance. A reconciliation of this measure to the equivalent measure under GAAP, along with reconciliations of this measure for each of our operating segments, are set forth in the attached table.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management and the company's board of directors to assess the company's financial performance and enterprise value. The company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure, as it eliminates certain expenses and gains that are not indicative of the company's core operating performance and facilitates a comparison of the company's core operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period. The company also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a basis to determine certain annual cash bonuses and long-term incentive awards, to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and to compare its performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by analysts, investors and other interested parties as a performance measure to evaluate industry competitors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of the company's financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings (loss) as a measure of financial performance, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and it should not be construed as an inference that the company's future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or free cash flow for management's discretionary use. In addition, this non-GAAP measure excludes certain non-recurring and other charges and has its limitations as an analytical tool. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the company will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the items eliminated in the adjustments made to determine Adjusted EBITDA, such as acquisition expenses, preopening expenses, accelerated depreciation, impairment charges and other adjustments. The company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that the company's future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Definitions and calculations of Adjusted EBITDA differ among companies in our industries, and therefore Adjusted EBITDA disclosed by the company may not be comparable to the measures disclosed by other companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About Marcus Corporation</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Headquartered in Milwaukee, Marcus Corporation is a leader in the entertainment and hospitality industries, with significant company-owned real estate assets.
