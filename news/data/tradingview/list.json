            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>European natural-gas prices are on track for a weekly loss as weather forecasts signal limited demand for heating in the near term. The benchmark Dutch TTF contract falls 0.7% to 31.16 euros a megawatt hour in afternoon trade, and is down 2.7% on the week. Last week, investment funds reduced their net position in the TTF gas futures market by 14 terawatt hours, indicating they expect lower prices ahead, DNB analysts say. Meanwhile, according to industry group Gas Infrastructure Europe, EU storage levels are currently 82.8% full and have been broadly flat in recent days.

The adoption of the FSP is subject to the ratification of shareholders to be sought by way of ordinary resolution at a General Meeting (\"GM\") of the Company to be held at 111 Park Street, London W1K 7JF at 15:00 on Tuesday, 18 November 2025, notice of which will be mailed to shareholders today. If the resolution is not passed, the FSP will lapse, and the awards made will have no effect.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Background and Rationale</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company has adopted the FSP and the SOP to provide a framework to support the Company's recruitment, retention and incentivisation of highly qualified Directors, senior management and staff.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Subject to shareholder ratification of the FSP, the Company has made awards under the FSP to its two Executive Directors, Scott Gilbert and Geraldine Geraldo. The Company considers that the FSP provides a compelling structure to retain and incentivise the Executive Directors to deliver strong and sustained performance, material share price growth and substantial shareholder value over the long term.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company has adopted the SOP and made share option awards with a market value exercise price to its Executive Directors and other senior employees. Options with the same terms have been made to the Company's Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Directors as detailed below.  These awards have been made to support retention, incentivisation and alignment with shareholders over the long term.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In designing both the FSP and the SOP, the Company has taken independent advice from H2G Remuneration Advisory LLP, which benchmarked the plans against market comparators within the AIM energy and natural resources sector. The resulting structures are considered to be in line with prevailing market practice, in particular by ensuring that rewards are directly linked to value creation for all shareholders. The Company has also consulted with certain major shareholders in respect of both the FSP and the SOP.  This exercise provided valuable feedback which has been taken on board in finalising the terms of the FSP and the SOP.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company is also considering the establishment of an employee benefit trust, in due course, whereby shares may be purchased in the market to support options granted under the FSP and SOP, in order to limit shareholder dilution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pradeep Kabra, Corcel's Independent Non-Executive Chair, commented: \"These new incentive plans are designed to align our leadership team's interests directly with those of our shareholders. The Board believes these arrangements, developed with independent expert advice and reflecting feedback from major shareholders, provide an appropriate and competitive framework to retain and motivate our key executives as we pursue our growth objectives.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Key terms of the 2025 Founder Share Plan</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The FSP is a value creation plan based on delivering increased equity value over next three years above a share price of 0.34p per Corcel share (the \"Base Price\"), the price at which the Company last raised equity capital in July 2025 and yesterday's closing mid-market price. The FSP is intended to provide the potential for participants to be meaningfully rewarded for generating material shareholder value above the Base Price with the main parameters being that the rewards will amount to 10% of shareholder value created (increases share price together with any dividends and other distributions) over the next three years above a compounded annual return of 15%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The FSP will be performance tested and awards will vest based on the average share price over the final 20 dealing days of the three-year performance period, which commenced on the date the awards were made (the \"End Share Price\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Awards have been granted as units equally (50:50) to the Company's Executive Directors, Scott Gilbert and Geraldine Gerado. The value of the awards at the end of the three-year performance period will be delivered to the Executive Directors by the grant of nominal cost share options which will be exercisable up to 5 years from the adoption of the FSP.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The FSP is subject to an overall cap that the number of options issuable pursuant to the FSP will not exceed 8% of the shares in issue at the date of grant of the share options. The options will be subject to malus and clawback provisions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The adoption of the FSP is a Related Party Transaction under the AIM Rules. The Independent Directors, being all the directors with the exception of Scott Gilbert and Geraldine Geraldo, consider, having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser, Zeus Capital, that the terms of the transaction are fair and reasonable insofar as the shareholders of the Company are concerned.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Key terms of the 2025 Share Option Plan</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The SOP is a conventional share option plan under which options with a market value exercise price may be granted from time to time to participants.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A total of 494.7 million Options have been granted under the SOP with an exercise price of 0.34p, of which 133.2 million have been granted to each of the two Executive Directors as detailed in the table below, with the balance of 228.3 million being issued to other senior staff.

The $9 billion bid was thoroughly unexpected and the bank questions what it implies for Novo Nordisk's confidence in its own obesity programs. It also seems unlikely that the move is unrelated to recent board changes, Deutsche Bank adds. The bank has a buy rating and 600 Danish kroner target price for the stock. Shares fall 2.7% to 314 kroner. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

After spiking on U.S. sanctions against Russia's largest oil company, prices have retreated with higher OPEC+ output and weaker seasonal demand containing advances. While the \"overarching bearish balance outlook continues to accelerate,\" risk premiums still exist as Russian output is likely to be a key focus, analysts at Rystad Energy say in a note. Rystad raised its Brent price forecast for 4Q to $63 a barrel from $62 a barrel.

Still, a 0.3% decline in August GDP \"certainly raises the odds of a technical recession,\" Davenport says. Oxford says it expects Canada's economy to struggle to grow in the coming months and remain vulnerable to further trade-related disruptions.

However, Reitzes says the surprise 0.3% drop in August does reinforce BMO's belief that the risks remain skewed to the downside. The firm believes another quarter-point cut, in early 2026, is possible due to softness in the labor market, which would take the BOC's policy rate to 2%. BMO notes the wholesaling sector was particularly weak, down 1.2% in August, while the trade-exposed factory sector declined 0.5%.

GDP on an industry basis surprisingly fell 0.3% in August, and the early estimate is for a 0.1% gain in September--which Figueiredo estimates puts 3Q GDP largely in line with the BOC forecast for 0.5% annualized growth. Only 43% of sectors tracked have posted positive growth over the past 3 months, or well below the historical average of about 60%, the economist says. Still, \"we don't yet see enough weakness for central bankers to cut rates any further,\" Figueiredo says.

Statistics Canada's early estimate for September is that GDPedged upward by 0.1%. That would translate into a 0.4% annualized 3Q gain, or slightly below the Bank of Canada's forecast for 0.5% jump. \"The lack of momentum towards the end of the quarter may spook policymakers somewhat,\" says CIBC economist Andrew Grantham.

The reduction in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods after the Trump-Xi meeting should boost the price competitiveness of Chinese exports and ease pressure on exporters, while the suspension of shipping levies will benefit Chinese shipbuilders and shipping firms. Although the summit didn't resolve deeper structural issues, it sets the stage for continued high-level exchanges next year that should help contain the risk of significant escalation in tensions, she adds. CGS International believes the improved backdrop strengthens the case for global investors to increase their Chinese equities allocation.

Despite a trade deal between the two countries, there was no concrete timeline or guidance on when Chinese companies might gain access to Nvidia's advanced AI chips, analysts led by Andy Yu write. This ambiguity is likely to weigh on AI infrastructure names, including data-center stocks, and large tech companies that depend on advanced chip availability for their AI-related businesses.

Meanwhile, she said, she isn't convinced inflation is on a firm track back toward the Fed's 2% target.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That combination suggests the Fed should be more reluctant to cut rates to support the labor market with rate cuts, which weaken the Fed's anti-inflation stance, Logan said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Logan hasn't been a member of the Fed's policy committee this year, under the system that rotates votes annually among the Fed's 12 reserve-bank presidents. But she made it clear that if she had gotten a vote this week, she would have dissented against the Fed's cut.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I would have preferred to hold interest rates steady,\" Logan said, according to a published version of her remarks. She said later in the speech that she is also skeptical that a further cut in December will be the right move.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Fed's decision to cut rates by a quarter point to a range of 3.75% to 4% at a second straight meeting was contentious, with two voters dissenting. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid took the same view as Logan, arguing the Fed should have kept rates still. Fed governor Stephen Miran dissented in the other direction, backing a half-point rate cut.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a press conference after the vote, Chair Jerome Powell said that another cut in December--something that many traders had been counting on--was far from a foregone conclusion. His comments likely reflected a base of skepticism about further cuts among the Fed's policy committee as the group met over two days this week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Logan acknowledged that the labor market has weakened, but said that future policy choices could respond quickly if the situation worsens further. \"These are all risks the FOMC will be able to closely monitor and address promptly if there is evidence they are becoming more likely to materialize,\" she said, referring to the Fed's policy committee by its acronym.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the other hand, she expressed impatience with persistent inflation, noting that prices already rose nearly at the Fed's annual target rate between January and August alone.

In late 2022, for example, the BOE forecast that the U.K. economy would enter a deep recession, but that forecast assumed rates were going to rise more sharply than policymakers intended.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What policymakers were actually doing was signaling that they wouldn't raise the key rate as rapidly as investors expected because such a big move in borrowing costs would tank the economy. However, business and consumer confidence was weakened by the recession call.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The central forecast is not going away, but it will play a less important role in decision making, as Bernanke recommended.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Russia isn't expected to oppose any potential OPEC+ plans for an output hike of 137,000 barrels a day for December, according to Rystad Energy. The energy research firm estimates that between 500,000 and 600,000 barrels a day of Russian oil production could be curtailed in the next two months as a result of the latest U.S. sanctions, but the risk of immediate production shut-ins are extremely marginal at the moment. \"Given that any impact on Russian output will take time to materialize and with Moscow keen to project stability, it is unlikely Russia will oppose another modest OPEC+8 production increase,\" says Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis. \"For the Kremlin, staying composed and signaling control remain central to its strategy.\" In afternoon trade, Brent crude and WTI rise 0.5% to $64.69 and $60.94 a barrel, respectively.
