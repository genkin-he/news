            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jared Mitovich</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gerry Clauss is a former electrician. But he had never worried so much about paying for electricity until the power bill on his single-family home hit $422 a month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That was over the summer, so he turned off the air conditioner, began freeze-drying bulk food purchases rather than storing them in his electric freezer, and started shutting off his lights more often.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's got to the point where people will do what they gotta do to survive,\" the 65-year-old from Hainesport, N.J., said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He said he plans to vote Tuesday for Republican Jack Ciattarelli in Tuesday's election for governor, motivated in part by soaring energy costs in an open race where they have become a hot topic. Clauss agrees with Ciattarelli's goal to quit a regional carbon-reduction program, which the former state assemblyman has pitched as a way to lower power bills — though Clauss supports clean energy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Big power bills are overlapping with rising food prices and inflation that remains persistently above the Federal Reserve's target, frustrating Americans. Fall weather lightens electric bills as people stop using air conditioning, but a cold winter could hike bills again for those who rely on electric heat systems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Retail power prices in New Jersey were up 19% in August from a year earlier, the latest state-by-state data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show, on the leading edge of a 6% nationwide increase in the same time frame. There are several driving forces, including a rapidly growing number of data centers pumping up demand in some regions. The slow addition of new power generators, retirement of old plants and costly grid upgrades are also playing a role.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consumers can mitigate their power use somewhat, but they have to keep the lights on, too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If strawberries are expensive, I'll buy apples — there are substitutes, \" said Meredith Fowlie, an energy economist at the University of California, Berkeley. \"Electricity, in the long run, there aren't many substitutes.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a group that helps states manage low-income utility assistance programs, said costs are a rising hardship. The organization projects customer electricity shut-offs due to unpaid bills could rise to 4 million nationwide this year, up from about 3.5 million last year and 3 million in 2023.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some of the biggest increases since last year are in parts of the Eastern U.S. where data centers are popping up, and where the grid is managed by operator PJM Interconnection. Wholesale prices — the price utilities pay for power — are rising, and can be passed on to the consumer with state regulatory approval.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The pressure on peak electricity demand capacity will likely persist, potentially meaning unyielding pressure on customer utility bills,\" the Bank of America Institute said in an October report. This will hit lower-income households disproportionately, the report said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The price on customers' bills can vary widely around the country due to many other reasons, too, including weather-influenced demand, the cost to fuel and run power plants, pricey fixes for aging infrastructure and state regulations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In Maine, customers have seen surging costs to help foot the bill to fix power lines damaged during winter storms in recent years, said Andrew Landry, the state's deputy Public Advocate. The New England state's retail prices are up 23% on the year through August.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The biggest utility there, Central Maine Power, is asking regulators for permission to increase bills more in the next five years to help further improve the grid to defend against damage, said Kimberly Harriman, deputy chief executive of parent company Avangrid. She said spending more now will ultimately save customers over the long run by lowering the likelihood of outages and costly repairs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has said the rate increase will add another cost burden for vulnerable people. Proposed rate increases are also facing opposition in places such as Minnesota, where rates haven't significantly risen in the last year, but could: A big utility there is seeking a 10% increase through 2026 for several stated reasons, including upgrades to boost reliability and preparation for rising power use.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Surging prices have become a big factor in New Jersey's governor's race, where Ciattarelli is running against U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat. At a debate in October, she called for a state of emergency on utility costs to allow her to freeze rates in place while pursuing cost-reducing measures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This utility rate crisis is kind of the issue that woke up the campaigns,\" said Ashley Koning, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Price increases are hitting businesses, too. Steve McFadden, owner of a coffee shop in Collingswood, N.J., said he has had to raise prices because of surging power costs. \"We can absorb some of it, but then it hits a saturation point,\" he said, adding that he had submitted his mail ballot for Sherrill with the issue in mind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the past year and a half, businesses looking for office space in southern New Jersey have increasingly asked about their exposure to higher electric bills, and more are opting for fixed energy contracts to keep prices stable, said Andrew Koller, a research analyst at Wolf Commercial Real Estate, a regional real-estate firm.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>HABcore, an affordable-housing provider in New Jersey, has seen rising electricity costs hit low-income residents who pay their own utilities in subsidized units, said Chief Executive Steve Heisman. The nonprofit is also feeling the pinch: Its group-living home in Asbury Park, which houses 30 people, saw electricity costs total $8,075 between June and September, up 35% from the same period last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Accountant David Healey said he had never budgeted for electricity until the power bill on his three-bedroom New Jersey house hit $550 by July.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's the difference between groceries or medicine or keeping the lights on,\" the 38-year-old in southern New Jersey said. Wanting to keep costs under control this winter, he just installed solar panels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Jared Mitovich at jared.mitovich@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Rachel Louise Ensign | Photography by Zack DeZon for WSJ</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aretsky's Patroon is the picture of Manhattan restaurant chic, with black-framed windows set against white brick and an enviable East Side address. Its $300 bottles of wine sell briskly, as do its $75 lamb chops.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Six private dining rooms are already almost fully booked for evening business meetings and birthday parties through the end of the year. Revenues are better than they were before the pandemic, even when accounting for inflation. And customers show no signs of trading down from high-end menu items.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I'm really grateful for that,\" said co-owner Diana Lyne. She prepared for business to slow down earlier this year when President Trump announced widespread tariffs. \"We no longer truly understand the U.S. economy,\" she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All kinds of warning signs seem to be flashing through the economy, and in New York City in particular, where discontent over the high cost of living has propelled democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani to a commanding lead in the race to be New York's mayor. Yet many wealthy people in the city are spending freely. Like the U.S. broadly, rich people are keeping the party going in New York, and powering a burgeoning local economy that caters to the well-to-do.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The most affluent Americans have gained trillions of dollars in new wealth in the past five years, largely thanks to rising home prices and a robust stock market. Their wages keep rising, and they are landing big inheritances. And they are undeterred by continuing inflation and a hiring slowdown that is pressing working- and middle-class families.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The top 10% of earners made up 49.2% of all spending nationally in the second quarter of 2025, a record high driven by spending by the very richest in this group, according to an analysis of government data from Moody's Analytics. Spending by the top 10%, a group that includes households earning roughly $275,000 a year or more, rose 4.4% from a year earlier, compared with a 2% increase for people earning less.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About 30% of households in Manhattan earned $200,000 or more in 2024, compared with 14% of households nationally, according to the Census. (The median household income across the five boroughs is $81,228.) While that income may not make you feel rich in New York, the city attracts big spenders from around the world.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About 34,000 of the nearly four million New York City households that filed tax returns in 2023 earned $1 million or more, according to preliminary estimates from the city's Independent Budget Office. Nearly 2,000 of those households earned $10 million and up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The city claims 152 billionaires with their primary business address in the metro area, more than any other city in the world, according to data from Altrata, a wealth-intelligence firm.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"People with money still have money. People who are spending a couple thousand dollars on a group of 20 to go out for a night, they're not really changing how they spend,\" said Noah Tepperberg, co-chief executive of restaurant and nightclub operator Tao Group Hospitality. Revenue in the company's nightclubs is up 10% from a year earlier. The biggest challenge is the number of new venues competing for customers' business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>John Clyde decamped to his home in upstate New York after the pandemic emptied Manhattan's streets. The consulting firm he co-founded gave up its office space and went remote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now he's back in the city every other week, as much for fun as he is for work. The 54-year-old has tried many of the dozen or so Omakase sushi menus near his other home, a West Village apartment. He has seen favorite musical acts such as Counting Crows and David Byrne, and he doesn't sit in the nosebleeds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I want to be there and experience it up close,\" Clyde said. \"I tend to spend more than I used to.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cash is also pouring in from big spenders outside the city.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Luxury hotels saw the biggest gains in occupancy and average daily room rates year-to-date through September, compared with a year earlier, of any category, according to CoStar. Travelers want to stay in new boutique hotels and apartment suites that are hard to snag, said Henley Vazquez, the co-founder of Fora, a high-end travel agency. (The average client who books a five-star room in New York spends $1,710 a night, the highest of any U.S. metro.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The return of the wealthy to the city helped the economy come roaring back after the depths of the pandemic. Mamdani wants to raise taxes on people earning above $1 million a year, and his ascendance has prompted fears about an exodus of the wealthy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>City tax revenue rose more than 8% in the year that ended in June, driven largely by people earning more. The top 1% of earners pay nearly 50% of income taxes, according to a report from the city's comptroller using 2021 data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>High earners are vital to keeping the service economy humming, business owners said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since the pandemic, Aretsky's Patroon \"lost a lot of customers to their second homes or third homes.  They come in when they're in town. But we have new customers who have taken their places,\" co-owner Lyne said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The restaurant, which shut for six months during the pandemic, now has more than 70 employees and plans to hire more if private dining keeps booming.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On a recent Tuesday night, the newly refurbished Waldorf Astoria's swanky bar and lounge were brimming with guests, locals and suited businessmen indulging in $38 martinis and $28 bite-size pigs-in-a-blanket presented on a tiered silver platter. The hotel is within sight of JPMorgan Chase's new $3 billion Park Avenue skyscraper.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The city has always been a place of economic extremes, where great wealth and poverty exist side by side. Now, the rich are creating demand for services that surprises even veteran New Yorkers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You have people making $5 million a year who can't afford things. It's a strange alternate universe,\" said Rachel Glazer, a Compass real-estate broker who lives and sells property in Tribeca, one of the priciest neighborhoods in the city, where wealth creates competition for all kinds of services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are two kinds of people in the neighborhood, she said. One group includes professionals such as investment bankers and law-firm partners who would be extremely rich anywhere else. But here they are topped by the truly wealthy: heirs, celebrities and the very top earners in finance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A recent birthday party attended by one of her elementary-school-age daughters featured a spa day and gift bags with personalized robes for the children. Glazer booked a $377-a-month after-school gymnastics class for one of her daughters that meets once a week six months in advance out of fear of getting waitlisted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rents are up more than 7% across the city from a year earlier, according to StreetEasy. Some of the demand for rentals comes from wealthy people finding it is too expensive to buy, because of the combination of high home prices and mortgage rates above 6%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Those who do buy homes often have enough money to buy properties outright. About two-thirds of home purchases in Manhattan, where the median price is $1.2 million, were all-cash deals, according to real-estate brokerage Douglas Elliman. People are increasingly using money from family trusts to purchase apartments in the most expensive uptown co-op buildings, said Rich Ferrari, Elliman's New York City chief executive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Realtors are listing a handful of rentals for $100,000 a month and up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Living in a city dominated by wealth can be hard for people on more modest incomes. And price hikes also extend to smaller purchases: a takeout lunch is often $15 or more.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In this environment, even people who aren't the city's highest earners are swept up in the wealth economy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Recent New York University graduate Bryce Chan is spending $1,850 a month, or nearly half of her take-home pay, on rent for the Flatiron apartment that she shares with two friends. Her room has no window or air conditioning. Chan, who works in energy technology, calls cans of chickpeas from Trader Joe's \"a major food group.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the frugality, she often finds herself forking over up to $20 for her go-to tequila and soda. Chan and her friends try to limit themselves to a few drinks and find house parties later in the evening.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last year, West Village resident Ellie Williams, 26 years old, started documenting her weekends and posting videos of young people on the street talking about where they go out. She now has tens of thousands of followers, a fact she attributes to New Yorkers wanting to spend — but strategically.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Her friends will complain about spending if they buy five drinks at an unremarkable bar. But they are willing to shell out on hot spots that they consider to be unique experiences. When Williams visited the new East Village bar Schmuck, the line was out the door.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You have to go out in New York City,\" Williams said. \"That's the whole point of living in this amazing and beautiful city.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Rachel Louise Ensign at Rachel.Ensign@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "title": "AI Is Teaching the Next Generation of M.B.A.s the Classic Case Study — WSJ",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Lindsay Ellis</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When students turn to artificial intelligence to do assignments, it's usually to do the work easier, faster and, to the chagrin of educators, with less brain power. Not so at Northwestern University, where AI is revolutionizing the cornerstone of American business education — the case study.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For more than a century, M.B.A. students have learned business strategy through the case method. Professors assign write-ups of real-life corporate challenges. Students pore over pages of charts and reports on executives' perspectives, then debate in class the best plan of attack.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, AI is turning that method on its head. Students no longer read through every available factoid on, say, Walmart's wages for hourly workers and write a memo — tasks that can be easily circumvented with generative AI tools. Instead, M.B.A.s must draw out details and data through open-ended conversations with AI chatbots and then craft a strategy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Students who've worked through the AI-guided case — this one involves helping a school district erase a $50 million deficit fueled by transportation costs — say it more closely resembles what consultants and business leaders do in the real world: You're not handed information. You must determine what you need to know from a cast of AI-created school officials and employees, and grill it out of them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We started to fight fire with fire,\" says Kellogg associate professor Sébastien Martin, who created the tool — not as a shortcut but to slow students down and force them to think and engage.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most of them exchange an average of more than 50 messages with each character as they try to solve the school's budget crisis, Martin said. He and colleague Daniela Hurtado Lange began designing and crafting the AI school-district case in early 2025 and rolled it out to students a few months later. Martin estimates that more than 2,000 students have used AI cases as more professors integrate them into their classes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consultant 'PTSD'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At Kellogg, one-third of the Class of 2026 worked as consultants before enrolling. A slightly bigger share of last year's graduates landed in the field after graduation, making a median annual salary of $190,000. Similarly high percentages of students pursue consulting at other top business schools, including programs at Yale, Dartmouth and the University of Chicago.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is the exact kind of case that would come to me in consulting,\" said Aayush Khanna, 26, a second-year M.B.A. at Kellogg. Conversing with the chatbots felt so real, he said, that some of his classmates felt \"PTSD\" from their pre-M.B.A. careers in consulting, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You could feel the characters being designed in a way that emulates real-life experiences,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI isn't the first technology to transform the case method. A 1984 Boston Globe article detailed the \"case study in anxiety\" at Harvard Business School when students began more widely using personal computers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now at HBS, students are allowed to use technology including AI tools before and after class, but the classrooms themselves are generally tech-free, said Mitchell Weiss, an HBS faculty chair who teaches a second-year elective course that heavily integrates AI. (There are exceptions, including for hands-on AI classroom exercises.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In Weiss's public-entrepreneurship class, students practice selling police-record management systems to a chatbot posing as a police chief. Then, in class, they practice selling to one another — in front of a corporate-account executive — before selling to an interactive avatar. In another case, an AI tool evaluates students' spreadsheets forecasting funding.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Weiss has developed a similar experiment to Martin's at Kellogg, having students collect information through interviews with AI chatbots for a case. One recent topic was sovereign AI — whether countries needed to develop their own AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The AI exercise was more challenging for the students than the traditional method, Weiss said, because they needed to gather and prioritize the information themselves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There were also some kinks to work out in teaching, Weiss found. Unlike a typical case, that gives all students access to the same information, they came to the AI-case class with different facts because they asked the AI bots different questions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sassy characters</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the Kellogg school-district case, the AI-created superintendent shares that the transportation budget has become untenable. The students are tasked with delivering concrete recommendations on how to cut costs. The students then can text with the five virtual, AI-crafted characters — the superintendent, a principal, a bus driver and district finance and operations chiefs — that respond to users conversationally.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In building the case, Martin prompted the AI to study Boston, its school system's history of segregation, plus details on real schools' test scores and reputations. He told the program to be inspired by the real district and individual schools, but never to reference real schools directly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Each character has its own personality and approach. The school system's chief financial officer, for example, doesn't want to chitchat and won't share data until he knows what you'll do with it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When Martin used AI to design the character, he incorporated the prompt: \"Make frequent sassy remarks that they are wasting your time. It sounds bad, but it's really important for the story.\" (Martin said it's quite hard to make chatbots, who aim to please, act rudely.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bus driver, dubbed Linda Johnson, explains she's driven for the district for 23 years and, when prompted, details everything on her route from the double-parked cars and narrow streets to her Dunkin' order. Principal David Rodriguez says he's heartbroken when he hears of students having to wake up at 4:30 a.m. to make it to school, given the bus schedule.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Some of the chatbots really wanted to talk to you. Some were not interested in you being there,\" said Caroline Harmening, a second-year M.B.A. who worked as a consultant before attending Kellogg.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's not quite a substitute for talking to real people, she said, but it was much more like \"something you might do in the real world.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Try the tool for yourself</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A limited version of Kellogg's AI school-district case is available to Wall Street Journal readers to try here.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Lindsay Ellis at lindsay.ellis@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

For example, trackers logged an outflow of 411 BTC on Oct. 24, suggesting this isn’t an isolated blip but part of several recent transfers tied to the firm’s wallets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some analysts say the pattern looks like growing selling pressure. Other market watchers say the sums are consistent with client execution and rebalancing. Market Sentiment Split </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sentiment indicators show a split mood. Social measures and the so-called Fear and Greed gauge have dipped into fear territory lately. Yet heads of some asset managers argue the opposite.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley has said institutions are “rushing in,” and he points to growing institutional interest as a signal that demand is building at higher levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Those two views sit at odds: visible outflows and rocky short-term flows on one side, and growing institutional allocation on the other. Price Context And What It Means </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bitcoin has been trading just a little over $110,000 as these moves happen. That price level matters because traders watch it as a barrier for bulls.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When big transfers land near key price points, they get extra attention; some see them as profit-taking, others as routine client service. Either way, the net effect on price depends on whether buyers step in to absorb the supply.Signals Traders Are Watching </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Keep an eye on three items: ETF flows, OTC activity, and on-chain outflows from known custodians. Spot crypto ETFs have shown net withdrawals in recent weeks, which can sap demand even if big institutions are slowly buying elsewhere.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If ETF outflows persist while wallets tied to major brokers keep moving coins out, price pressure may rise. But if inflows return to spot ETFs or large buyers match the OTC sales, that pressure can ease quickly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView</span></em></p></span></div></div>",

Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>[Click here for information about joining the class action]</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Savara is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on rare respiratory diseases. The Company's lead product candidate is MOLBREEVI (also referred to as \"molgramostim\"), an inhaled granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. MOLBREEVI is in a Phase 3 IMPALA-2 pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (\"aPAP\"), a chronic and debilitating rare lung disease characterized by the abnormal build-up of surfactant in the alveoli of the lungs. Savara has consistently represented that, based on investments in MOLBREEVI and its purported \"track record of strong fiscal discipline,\" the Company is \"sufficiently capitalized\" as early as through 2026 and as late as into the second half of 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In December 2024, Savara began a rolling submission of a Biologics License Application (\"BLA\")-</span><em><span>i.e.</span></em><span>, a submission requesting approval to distribute a biologic product across state lines-to the United States (\"U.S.\") Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") for MOLBREEVI for the potential treatment of aPAP (the \"MOLBREEVI BLA\"). In a press release announcing the submission, the Company touted that, \"given the positive results of the pivotal, Phase 3 IMPALA-2 trial, we believe MOLBREEVI demonstrates a favorable benefit-risk profile and could fundamentally change the way aPAP is treated,\" and that \"initiation of the [MOLBREEVI] BLA is an important milestone in potentially addressing the unmet need in aPAP, for which there are no approved medicines in the U.S. and Europe.\" Moreover, Savara represented that it \"expect[ed] to complete the submission of the rolling [MOLBREEVI] BLA by the end of [the first quarter of] 2025.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To obtain FDA approval of the MOLBREEVI BLA, Savara must submit, among other things, information regarding MOLBREEVI's chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (\"CMC\"). Specifically, the CMC section of a BLA must provide a detailed account of a product's manufacturing process-including process validation runs, stability testing, and analytical method validation-and detailed descriptions of facilities, equipment, and quality control procedures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the MOLBREEVI BLA lacked sufficient information regarding MOLBREEVI's chemistry, manufacturing, and/or controls; (ii) accordingly, the FDA was unlikely to approve the MOLBREEVI BLA in its current form; (iii) the foregoing made it unlikely that Savara would complete its submission of the MOLBREEVI BLA within the timeframe it had represented to investors; (iv) the delay in MOLBREEVI's regulatory approval increased the likelihood that the Company would need to raise additional capital; and (v) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On May 27, 2025, Savara issued a press release \"announcing that the Company received [a refusal to file] letter from the FDA for the [MOLBREEVI BLA] as a therapy to treat patients with [aPap].\" Specifically, Savara revealed that \"[u]pon preliminary review, the FDA determined that the [MOLBREEVI BLA] was not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review and requested additional data related to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC).\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Market analysts were quick to comment on the Company's announcement. For example, on May 27, 2025, Guggenheim published a report (the \"Guggenheim Report\") revising its price target for Savara to $8.00, down from the previous $9.00. Guggenheim stated that it \"do[es] not expect Savara to be profitable on a continuing basis until 2028 and expect[s] the company may raise additional capital, potentially through a secondary stock offering that could dilute the holdings of current investors.\" In addition, the Guggenheim Report noted that the \"CMC Delay Could Lead to Change in Molbreevi Manufacturing Strategy,\" predicting a delayed market launch sometime in early 2027, a year later than initially expected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On this news, Savara's stock price fell $0.90 per share, or 31.69%, to close at $1.94 per share on May 27, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then, after the end of the Class Period, on August 13, 2025, Savara issued a press release announcing the Company's financial results for the second quarter of 2025. Among other things, the press release revealed that, contrary to the Company's prior representations that it would complete its rolling submission of the MOLBREEVI BLA in the first quarter of 2025, Savara now \"plan[s] to resubmit the [MOLBREEVI] BLA in December [2025].\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Weston Blasi</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One sportsbook had 96.7% of World Series bets on the Dodgers to beat the Blue Jays once the matchup was finalized</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most sports bettors want the Dodgers to win the World Series. Sportsbooks are praying for the Blue Jays.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tonight, the Toronto Blue Jays are hoping to win their first MLB World Series since 1993. And U.S. sportsbooks hope that the Blue Jays win, too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's because the Los Angeles Dodgers were heavily favored to beat Toronto in the series. In fact, once this year's World Series matchup was finalized, almost every single bet (96.7%) made on ESPN Bet over which team would win the World Series was made in favor of the Dodgers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The wagers have been driven by the Dodgers' popularity as reigning champions and as home to one of the best players in baseball, Shohei Ohtani. And this type of overwhelming liability could lead to a bad outcome for sports-betting companies if the Blue Jays don't win and the sportsbooks have to pay up - again.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Betting companies are already coming off a football season where FanDuel owner Flutter (FLUT) took a $370 million hit on NFL games after casual bettors benefited from some of the most \"customer-friendly\" betting outcomes that online sportsbooks have ever seen. So while a Toronto win would mean paying out some long-shot futures, it would still be a far better result for the betting operators than another Dodgers victory - which would trigger huge payouts on the most bet-on team all season.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sportsbooks typically favor outcomes that go against the majority of wagers placed on a sporting event, which is why nearly all of them are pulling for the Blue Jays right now.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Before the World Series began, the Blue Jays winning it all was a good outcome for the sportsbook,\" Seamus Magee, trading manager at BetMGM, told MarketWatch in an email.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Dodgers can still give them a run for their money, though. \"Toronto is still the preferred winner, but we wouldn't mind seeing a Game 7,\" Magee added. The series is currently 3-2 in favor of Toronto, and sportsbooks generally prefer longer series because more games equals more bets - and more juice for sportsbooks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, the Blue Jays winning the whole thing would provide a lifeline to betting companies. \"We definitely need the Blue Jays. Toronto winning would be a strong result for us,\" Caesars Sports head of baseball trading Eric Biggio said to Fox. \"If you know of any Blue Jays backers with deep pockets, you can send them our way.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The two most popular individual prop bets on BetMGM for Game 6 on Halloween night are Toronto's Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hitting over 0.5 home runs (+400), and Ohtani hitting over 0.5 home runs (+195). The biggest liability for World Series MVP - as in, the players who sportsbooks least want to see win the award - are Ohtani, Guerrero Jr. and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, in that order.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition to ESPN Bet (DIS), BetMGM (MGM) and Caesars (CZR), other U.S. sportsbooks were also showing an overwhelming amount of bets on the Dodgers heading into Game 6. But it's not just bets that were made in the days leading up to the World Series; fans have been backing the Dodgers all year long.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From the archives: How does a gambling site lose money? DraftKings just lost $250 million in revenue - mostly on NFL games.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Toronto opened the season at +6000 odds to win the World Series before the season (1.6% implied probability of winning), while the Dodgers went into the season at roughly +750 odds. In other words, expectations were low for Toronto heading into the year, and high for the Dodgers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even with those long-shot odds for Toronto, sportsbooks would rather pay out those bets than face the heavy losses that would occur with a Dodgers series win. That's because the Dodgers were the most wagered-on team in terms of total futures bets, and in total money at nearly every major sportsbook.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to betting data from DraftKings (DKNG), at the start of the MLB playoffs, 36% (or over 1 in 3) of all World Series winner bets were made for the Dodgers - more than triple the amount of bets on the next most wagered-on team. The Dodgers also had 22% of all money wagered (otherwise known as handle) to win the World Series.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>More bets were on the Los Angeles Dodgers than any other team to win the 2025 World Series.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's not clear exactly how much sportsbooks would lose if the Dodgers were to win, as the ones mentioned in this story declined to comment on potential loss amounts or betting figures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Several members of the r/BlueJays subreddit have begun sharing that they placed small wagers on their team to win the World Series at long odds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"That $20, +6000 bet I put pre-season on winning the WS is looking a lot more realistic,\" one Reddit user posted before the playoffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I grabbed it at +7500!\" another user wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sportsbooks typically profit from the \"vig,\" their commission on each bet. However, their strategy involves more than just balancing wagers. When a popular team, such as the Dodgers or Yankees, is heavily favored, sportsbooks adjust the odds to encourage betting on the underdog to minimize their risk. Despite this, sometimes bettors still take the favorite - and win.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unfavorable sports-betting outcomes can really hurt sportsbooks' bottom lines. For example, FanDuel, the Flutter Entertainment sportsbook, took a $74 million loss during a regular-season NFL game between the Detroit Lions and San Francisco 49ers, which ended in a 40-34 win for the favored Lions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For sportsbooks, the stakes are high and their rooting interest is clear: They're all in on the Blue Jays.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See: Sportsbooks were called 'victims' in new NBA gambling probe. Here's what DraftKings, FanDuel have to say.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Weston Blasi</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Notably, its price breached the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) after it pushed from its support zone of $2.45.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The jump signals the possibility of a massive rally in November after it had consolidated for several weeks.

Guided by a clear strategic vision rooted in transparency, governance, and innovation, the company has built a reliable and efficient trading ecosystem supported by advanced infrastructure and a liquid, resilient, and growth-oriented financial market since replacing the former Kuwait Stock Exchange and assuming responsibility for the operation and management of the market in 2016. These efforts form part of a comprehensive series of reforms and modernization initiatives that have strengthened Kuwait’s regional and international competitiveness.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The privatization of Boursa Kuwait in 2019 marked a defining milestone in the company’s history, as it became the first government entity in the country to be fully privatized, leading to higher levels of efficiency and corporate governance. This was followed by the company’s self-listing in 2020, a move that underscored its commitment to transparency and further reinforced investor trust.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As part of its ongoing development strategy, Boursa Kuwait has launched a series of initiatives to enhance market infrastructure and diversify investment tools, working closely with the capital market apparatus to reclassify the Kuwaiti capital market as an Emerging Market in the world’s leading index providers. The company has also continued to collaborate with regulatory and supervisory authorities to advance the next phases of the Market Development Program.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company continues to support listed companies and strengthen their access to global investors through its series of roadshows and corporate days in major investment capitals, positioning the exchange as a dynamic, attractive and sustainable investment platform and supporting Kuwait’s national vision and development agenda.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Boursa Kuwait:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The establishment of Boursa Kuwait in 2014 marked the first step in the privatization project of the Kuwait Stock Exchange, which was founded in 1977 as the first exchange in the Gulf Cooperation Council region and was reorganized in 1983 as an independent financial institution. The transitional phase began in 2016, with Boursa Kuwait officially assuming the responsibilities and operations of the Kuwait Stock Exchange, replacing it with an official license in the same year after the successful completion of the transitional phase. This ensured that Boursa Kuwait developed the infrastructure and operated according to best practices and international standards. It commenced the creation of an advanced, reliable trading platform built on efficiency, credibility, and transparency to serve all asset classes with a focus on the interests of traders and the national economy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Boursa Kuwait has undertaken various market reforms as part of its comprehensive plans to enhance it in several stages. It succeeded in introducing innovative investment tools, enhancing transparency, and restructuring the market to increase its liquidity and competitiveness, based on its mission-focused strategy, which emphasizes developing the market to meet international standards. The company's developmental and improvement efforts have also contributed to the reclassification of the Kuwait market as an «emerging market» among key global index providers, enhancing Kuwait's position as a leading regional financial center.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a pioneering step in Kuwait's privatization field, the privatization of Boursa Kuwait was successful, conducted in two stages. The first stage was in February 2019 when a consortium of Kuwaiti investment companies and a global exchange operator won the privatization bid, acquiring a 44% stake in the company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In December 2019, the privatization process was completed through the public offering of a 50% stake owned by the Capital Markets Authority to Kuwaiti citizens, with the offering oversubscribed by more than 850%. Boursa Kuwait is listed on the «Premier Market» under the name «Boursa».</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For further information, please contact:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ahmad Rashed Alowaish</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>PR and Media Manager - Boursa Kuwait</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Email:              aalowaish@boursakuwait.com.kw</span></p><span>Send us your press releases to pressrelease.zawya@lseg.com</span><p class=\"\"><span>Disclaimer: The contents of this press release was provided from an external third party provider.
