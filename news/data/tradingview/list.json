Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) stood at ₹537 crore, down 13% from ₹620 crore in Q2FY25, mainly on account of lower volume and lower realisation, partially offset by better cost management.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Margins contracted to 13.8% from 15.5% a year earlier.

That compared with a net income of $26.3 billion, or $18,272 a share, in the year-earlier period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Operating profits from insurance underwriting more than doubled from a year earlier. A mild hurricane season in the U.S. during August and September helped reinsurance firms like Berkshire hold on to premiums. Berkshire's results have also benefited from a turnaround at its auto insurer, Geico.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire's cash including equivalents rose to a record $358 billion, after accounting for a payable for purchasing some short-term government debt, from $344 billion at the end of June. Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its own shares during the three months ending in September, marking the fifth-straight quarter in which it has passed on buying back any stock. The company was a net seller of stocks for a 12th straight quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire is nearing a monumental handoff. Buffett, 95 years old, will step down as CEO at the end of the year and hand the reins to Greg Abel, his handpicked successor. The company's shares have faded this year, underperforming the S&amp;P 500, as shareholders wrestled with what the transition to the Abel era would mean for Berkshire's businesses, its investment portfolio and its eye for acquisitions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In October, Berkshire agreed to pay $9.7 billion to buy Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical business, OxyChem. It was the company's biggest deal since acquiring insurance conglomerate Alleghany in 2022.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Operating earnings, which exclude some investment results, rose 34 % to $13.5 billion from $10.1 billion a year earlier. Results from the company's BNSF railway remained in line with last year despite tariff pressures on consumer goods and other products transported by rail. Income from the insurance business fell, a likely result of slightly lower short-term interest rates relative to last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Buffett has said that operating earnings are the better measure of the company's performance. Accounting rules require Berkshire to include unrealized gains and losses from its giant investment portfolio when it reports net income, meaning that short-term fluctuations in the stock market can cause big swings in quarterly income.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Heather Gillers at heather.gillers@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The owner was a dog lover who had an adorable 12-year-old, tan-and-white Shih Tzu mix named Cookie, and I ended up with the listing because I lived in that neighborhood, where I was known as \"the crazy dog lady\" due to my involvement with animal rescue and fostering dogs. A few years earlier, I had fostered a blind and deaf dachshund named Ruby, and I used to carry her around in a Moby Wrap, a baby carrier that wraps around your chest and allows you to swaddle the dog. I would wear Ruby wherever I went, including showing properties, so I got a reputation for being the agent who wears a dachshund strapped to her chest.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fast forward to this listing. While I had it, the owner had to go into the hospital, and she told me that Cookie would not be comfortable with strangers coming into the home while she wasn't there. She asked me to hold the dog whenever there were people in the house, but the idea of holding her for two hours at a time for each of the open houses seemed too difficult. So, I suggested the Moby Wrap instead, and I wore that dog through two open houses and at least half a dozen private showings. She was a very cute dog. She looked like a little Muppet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cookie seemed to enjoy the experience, fortunately, and I think she actually helped me sell the house, for over ask, to a family with two dogs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mike Fabbri, real-estate agent, The Agency, New York City</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the spring of 2023, I worked with a couple who wanted to purchase an apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, but they wanted their Pokemon-obsessed 6-year-old son to have a say. How? By playing Pokemon in each neighborhood before his parents would commit to a purchase. We spent an afternoon covering four neighborhoods as the child played the game and caught Pokémon characters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It turns out that Central Park West was a hot spot for Pokémon GO characters that day, and after we toured a two-bedroom co-op that was listed for about $2 million, the child ended up catching a Snorlax as soon as we stepped inside Central Park. A Snorlax is a blue-green character that looks like a bear and is apparently extremely rare to find because it spends the majority of its life asleep. The child was screaming and jumping up and down. He was so excited to find it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Although my clients looked at seven other apartments that day, no other area came close in terms of Pokémon action, so they knew that apartment was the one. They wrote up an offer that same day for the full asking price.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gerard Splendore, associate broker at Coldwell Banker Warburg, New York City</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I took a listing for a three-bedroom co-op in a landmarked Art Deco building in Brooklyn Heights in September 2022. It sold in April 2023 for just below the $1.795 million asking price, but before the closing I received a request from the sellers: They insisted that I pay $20,000 for them to lease a temporary residence until they could move into their home upstate, where there were tenants for another three months after our closing. While I have been generous in the past — paying for an air conditioner or to have a place cleaned, for example — $20,000 was almost the full commission.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The sellers were aware of the timing issue when they accepted the buyer's offer, but they didn't mention it until just before the closing. The buyers needed to get out of their place, so they couldn't delay moving in. The contract had firm dates, and you can't bring up issues like this after the fact.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I want to be on good terms with my buyers and sellers. I want people to say nice things about me, and I was worried they might kill the deal. Until you're handed a commission check at closing, you keep thinking you have to do whatever you can to keep the deal moving forward. So, I went to management for an objective third-party opinion, and the principals of my firm were equally flabbergasted. They drafted a succinct and clear email to the sellers saying we will help them find a rental to live in, but in no way are we responsible to pay their rent.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In my 25-year career, I've never had anybody ask for something like this. Luckily, the sellers ended up dropping their demand, they moved out on time and they left a very clean apartment. The deal closed, and the buyers moved in on time. I was very relieved that it ended so cleanly.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Edited from interviews by Robyn A.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jackie Snow</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Forget teaching robots to think like humans. A field called swarm robotics is taking inspiration from ants, bees and even slime molds — simple creatures that achieve remarkable feats through collective intelligence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unlike traditional robots that take orders from a central computer, swarm robots work like ant colonies. No single robot is in charge, but the swarm accomplishes complex tasks through simple interactions between neighbors. Each robot interacts only with those nearby, sometimes communicating with sounds or chemical signals in particles they release.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Researchers say this approach could excel where traditional robots fail, like situations where central control is impractical or impossible due to distance, scale or communication barriers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For instance, a swarm of drones might one day monitor vast areas to detect early-stage wildfires that current monitoring systems sometimes miss. Hundreds of drones could be continuously patrolling, able to detect fires within minutes of ignition. If some drones fail, others would continue monitoring.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A human operator might set parameters like where to search, but the drones would independently share information like which areas have been searched, adjust search patterns based on wind and other weather data from other drones in the swarm, and converge for more complete coverage of a particular area when one detects smoke.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In another potential application, a swarm of robots could make deliveries across wide areas more efficient by alerting each other to changing traffic conditions or redistributing packages among themselves if one breaks down.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Robot swarms could also manage agricultural operations in places without reliable internet service. And disaster-response teams see potential for swarms in hurricane and tsunami zones where communication infrastructure has been destroyed. At the microscopic scale, researchers are developing tiny robots that could work together to navigate the human body to deliver medication or clear blockages without surgery.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Teaming up</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Part of what has kept swarm robotics in research instead of real-world applications has been cost. But the economics of the field have shifted in recent years, according to Sabine Hauert, a professor of swarm engineering at the University of Bristol in England. Cheaper sensors, batteries and processors have made it possible for a much broader range of researchers to build and test robot swarms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In recent demonstrations, teams of tiny magnetic robots — each about the size of a grain of sand — cleared blockages in artificial blood vessels by forming chains to push through the obstructions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The robots navigate individually through blood vessels to reach a clog, guided by doctors or technicians using magnetic fields to steer them, says researcher J.J. Wie, a professor of organic and nano engineering at Hanyang University in South Korea. When they reach an obstruction, the robots coordinate with each other to team up and break through.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wie's group is developing versions of these robots that biodegrade after use, eliminating the need for surgical removal, and coatings that make the robots compatible with human tissue. And while robots the size of sand grains work for some applications, Wie says that they will need to be shrunk to nano scale to cross biological barriers, such as cell membranes, or bind to specific molecular targets, like surface proteins or receptors on cancer cells.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On their own</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other researchers are exploring what happens when swarms move beyond any human-designed coordination. The phenomenon is known as emergent intelligence — when simple machines, following only a few local cues, begin to organize and act as if they share a mind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In one experiment, a group of robots were programmed with just three abilities — move forward, emit sound and listen to neighbors — then placed in a space with various obstacles and given no further instruction. They spontaneously linked together to form chains that slithered through some obstacles and surrounded other objects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Each robot has minimal functionality,\" says Igor Aronson, an engineer at Pennsylvania State University who led the project. \"But together, they show behaviors that look intelligent.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The research draws inspiration from single-celled slime molds that self-organize when starving. While the molds use chemical signals to coordinate, Aronson and his collaborators chose acoustic communication instead, since sound waves travel faster than chemical signals, making the approach more practical for robotic applications.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The work suggests that sophisticated coordination might not require sophisticated machines. Intelligence, in this case, isn't coded in advance but emerges from the way simple parts interact. And as those parts grow slightly more capable — say, with improved sensors or processing power — the behavior could evolve too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If you add a little bit more complexity,\" Aronson says, \"you would expect even more intelligence to emerge.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jackie Snow is a writer in Los Angeles. She can be reached at reports@wsj.com.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Mainardi is an adjunct professor of strategy at the Kellogg School of Management. He is the former CEO of Booz &amp; Co. and Strategy&amp;.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Organizations perform best when their strategy, or what they aim to achieve, aligns with execution, which is the process of putting that plan into action. It's called \"coherence.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unfortunately, such alignment is rare in the real world.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Too often, the organization's strategy gets diluted by internal politics, pressure to produce good quarterly results or a fear of saying no. A hospital, for instance, will hire a new tech vendor whose product conflicts with the hospital's model of patient-centered care. Or a business school gives the green light to a donor's idea that doesn't fit the school's mission. Everyone sees the drift, but no one stops it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I believe, though, that a solution to this coherence gap is in sight — thanks to AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Call it a \"coherence prompt.\" Trained on an organization's purpose and strategy, this AI tool wouldn't make decisions for leaders, but it would act as a kind of strategic conscience, flagging drift, pointing out disconnects and helping people think about their organization's strategy at every level. It would ask and help assess every project with four simple questions:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Does this project or investment fit the strategy we've committed to --   and the value we've promised to deliver?   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Does it build on the capabilities we've said we want to lead with?   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Are we focusing our time and investment where it matters most?   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Does this reflect our culture -- and what we've learned from experience? </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>These prompts aren't new. They're grounded in a body of published, peer-reviewed research and strategy work that's been tested across industries for decades. What's new is that — thanks to AI — we can now apply them consistently, dispassionately and at scale, right when decisions are being made.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Staying true to a strategy requires constant vigilance. A dispassionate prompt — one that reminds leaders of what they have agreed to — can make a real difference by highlighting disconnects and asking, \"Are you OK with that?\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And the best part? It's simple to implement. Large organizations already run on structured processes — investment committees, resource allocations, budget reviews. You don't need to reinvent the system. Just add the coherence prompt to the steps that already exist, and let it test the logic before decisions are locked in.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is how we used to support clients as consultants — by bringing an outside perspective to help ensure strategy and execution were in alignment. But we couldn't stay in the room forever. Now, organizations can build something better.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Leadership will always be human. But in complex systems, alignment shouldn't have to depend on heroics. Tools such as AI can help leaders stay more intellectually honest, reinforcing coherence where it's most at risk: in the moment of decision.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Cesare R.

While the leading altcoin notably showed a significantly volatile price action, bearish sentiments reigned supreme, resulting in a net 4.37% loss. Interestingly, popular expert Ali Martinez has highlighted a critical price level for Solana investors’ attention amid the current market uncertainty. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>To Fly Or Crash? Solana Future Rests On Key Price Point </span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a recent X post, Martinez dives into the present Solana market structure, highlighting several potential developments tied to the $180 price level. Notably, the daily chart reveals that Solana has been strictly trading in an ascending channel since May 2025, with zero deviations recorded. Importantly, the altcoin has been moving near the lower boundary of this channel, currently around $180, which acts as a pivotal support. This price point also aligns with the 200-day simple moving average, thereby reinforcing its validity.</span></p><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:864.8878107944208px;aspect-ratio:1.441479684657368\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:fde2b621c094b-258dfc1271944df7dbbcdbdc2efe9062-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Solana\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:fde2b621c094b-258dfc1271944df7dbbcdbdc2efe9062-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f7f7f7\"/></picture></div></figure></span><p class=\"\"><span>Furthermore, on-chain data from the leading analytics platform Glassnode shows that 24.5 million SOL were purchased at this level, reflecting a high market demand that will likely prevent further price incursion upon a retest. Looking at Martinez’s analysis, a consistent price hold above $180 retains the validity of the ascending channel and presents a setup for a potential price gain to $230, with further price targets at $290. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, if an overwhelming bearish pressure pushes Solana below $180, investors can expect a further decline to around $115, while a potential crash to $50 is also feasible. Therefore, Solana’s behavior at $180 presents a possible 56% gain or 72% loss from current market prices. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Solana Market Overview </span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>At press time, Solana (SOL) is trading at $185, up 4.57% over the past 24 hours. Despite the daily rebound, its monthly performance remains negative, with a 14.27% decline highlighting the broader weakness seen in the last week. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a notable development, Bitwise launched the first-ever Solana Spot ETF on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) this week, marking a major milestone for altcoins. The achievement was quickly followed by Grayscale, which introduced its own Grayscale Solana Trust, further signaling growing institutional interest in Solana.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This week’s events represent a significant step toward broadening institutional access to Solana and other altcoins, paving the way for deeper market participation beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to SoSoValue data, the two newly launched ETFs have already attracted strong demand, recording $154.73 million in net inflows and $439.97 million in net assets within the first three trading days. Meanwhile, several other Solana-linked ETFs are reportedly in the pipeline, including the Canary Solana ETF, VanEck Solana Trust, and CoinShares Solana ETF, all currently awaiting SEC approval.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Analysts have penciled in a 20%-plus gain in operating profits, helped by a light hurricane season.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the size of the profit is just one point to watch. As is usual with Berkshire, investors will be focused on cash levels, investment activity, and any stock repurchases as they examine the results. The earnings report and 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission are expected to be issued at the same time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>News of buybacks might come as the biggest surprise because Berkshire hasn't repurchased any stock since May 2024. Any repurchases would be viewed favorably as a sign that CEO Warren Buffett views the stock as inexpensively valued.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Is it time to take some profits?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The S&amp;P 500 is coming off its best midyear stretch since the 1950s. Now it's a question of taking some profits or holding for a rally at year-end.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With the S&amp;P 500 on pace for a 16% yearly gain already, investors find themselves at a familiar crossroads: lock in profits while they are hot, or stay greedy and bet on a typical year-end rally that could push stocks to new highs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The S&amp;P 500 SPX just defied one of Wall Street's most entrenched seasonal clichés - \"sell in May and go away\" - with its strongest May-through-October stretch since 1950. Historically, this six-month stretch is the worst seasonal period for stocks, with an average gain of only 2.1%, according to data compiled by LPL Financials. But this time, the S&amp;P 500 advanced 22.9% during the period, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was up nearly 17% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP surged 36%, according to FactSet data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>History also shows that when stocks resist the \"sell in May\" slump with double-digit summer gains, the rally often has more room to run.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 12% from November through April in such cases, outpacing the market's usual 7% return during its most favorable six-month window, said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial (see chart below).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SOURCE: LPL Research, Bloomberg</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As October drew to a close, investors turned their attentions to the final two months of the year - a period that's historically bullish - while wondering whether a year-end rally is already underway.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>History suggests that the S&amp;P 500 has shined the brightest in November and December, averaging a 3.1% gain during those two-month periods since 1945, while logging positive returns 76% of the time, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To be sure, seasonal trends do not always translate into reality and should always be viewed in the context of current market conditions. Seasonality simply reflects the broader market climate rather than the immediate setup on Wall Street - meaning stock performance through year-end doesn't have to follow any seasonal script, LPL's Turnquist noted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After all, \"economic conditions, earnings, geopolitics, along with fiscal, monetary and trade policy, are much bigger drivers of price action\" in the stock market this year, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stovall told MarketWatch that macro forces also support the case for a year-end rally. His CFRA team continues to see stock prices advancing through the end of 2025 on \"an improvement in earnings-growth expectations\" combined with potentially another interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve in December.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We're still looking for two Fed rate cuts in 2026, so that could also help to shore up stock prices, at least through the end of April,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See: Will the Fed cut interest rates in December? Here's what experts are saying.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. central bank last week voted to lower the target range for the federal-funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 3.75% and 4%, and officially announced its plan to stop shrinking its portfolio of assets beginning Dec. 1. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned investors against assuming another rate reduction will follow in December, saying it's \"not a foregone conclusion\".</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a result, investors have scaled back expectations for a December rate cut, with fed-funds futures traders on Friday only pricing in a 69% chance of a rate reduction at the end of the year, down from 90% before the October policy meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See: Here's what a government shutdown means for markets - and your wallet</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Of course, investors can't ignore the political storm clouds gathering in Washington. The ongoing government shutdown - now stretching into its second month - is beginning to ripple through the economy and straining American households.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The longer the government shutdown lasts, the bigger of a potential drag it could have on consumer confidence, said Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at SimCorp. \"So far, we haven't seen the impact, but I've got to imagine that eventually we are going to see the impact, as people are not getting paid or [receiving] food benefits,\" she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. stocks finished higher on Friday, while also scoring weekly and monthly gains. The S&amp;P 500 advanced 2.3% in October, while the Dow was up 2.5% and the Nasdaq surged 4.7% for the month, according to FactSet data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Joy Wiltermuth contributed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Isabel Wang</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
