Whether operating in tech, industrial manufacturing, food and beverage, energy, retail, or agriculture, companies are now being asked, and in some cases required, to understand and manage their water risks. As a result, forward-thinking organizations across the globe are shifting from reactive compliance to proactive water stewardship that protects business value while supporting resilient water systems for the communities where they operate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What Is Water Risk?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Water risk refers to the wide range of physical, regulatory, reputational, social, and financial impacts that arise when water availability, quality, or access cannot be reliably ensured for business operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Water risk encompasses multiple interconnected threats, including:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Physical risks</span></strong><span> - droughts, floods, declining water quality, infrastructure failures, and climate-driven weather variability that disrupt access to clean, reliable water.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Regulatory and compliance risks</span></strong><span> - evolving discharge limits, permitting requirements, water use restrictions, and enforcement actions with direct financial impacts.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Reputational and social license risks</span></strong><span> - community concerns about competition for water, operational impacts on culturally or economically important water resources, and pressure from customers and investors to demonstrate responsible water use.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Financial and supply chain risks</span></strong><span> - increased costs for sourcing water or treatment, lost productivity due to operational interruptions, and vulnerabilities tied to suppliers operating in water-stressed or high-risk regions.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Water risk recognizes that the challenge is not just how much water is available - but whether businesses can reliably access and responsibly use water in a way that is sustainable, socially acceptable, legally compliant, and economically viable over</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Water Risk and Business Practices </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Understanding water risk has become essential for business continuity, resilience, and long-term growth. Water-related disruptions can affect nearly every aspect of operations - from production schedules and facility performance to supply chain stability and stakeholder confidence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Depending on the industry and location, risks can manifest differently. For example:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Agricultural businesses facing decreased yields due to extreme weather or declining irrigation water quality.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Manufacturing companies with water-intensive processes experiencing downtime from water restrictions or new treatment requirements.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Beverage and consumer goods companies experiencing reputational backlash if water use affects local communities or ecosystems.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Industrial and technology facilities facing permitting delays or legal scrutiny regarding wastewater discharges and water withdrawals.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Ineffective water management heightens exposure to operational losses, regulatory penalties, supply chain instability, and negative investor attention as markets increasingly evaluate water performance within ESG assessments. Conversely, organizations that identify and mitigate water risks early gain a competitive advantage through resilience, efficiency, innovation, and improved stakeholder trust.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Water Risk Assessment </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At its core, a water risk assessment evaluates the water-related hazards that a business may face. It provides a comprehensive picture of the potential challenges and vulnerabilities that result from degraded water quantity and quality, regulatory changes, and community concerns, such as water access, competition with local users, and impacts to culturally or economically important water resources. Conducting an assessment helps businesses identify potential geographic hotspots and prioritize areas for action. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our  Water Risk Assessment Methodology has three primary goals: </span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>To identify potential risks to operations in the short to medium term. </span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>To help inform business objectives and decisions in the medium to long term, such as acquisitions or expansions. </span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>To begin water stewardship strategy development. </span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>How Water Risk Assessments Work </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before conducting a water risk assessment, it is important to determine the boundaries of the client's portfolio being assessed, such as local water facilities, regional infrastructure, or global operations. Clearly defining the scope up front ensures that resources are directed toward the areas of highest risk and strategic importance and that the results align with decision-making needs around investments, compliance, and long-term planning.  Once the boundaries are confirmed, the targeted location is assessed for specific characteristics, like water availability and quality, regulatory and legal requirements, the socio-economic impact of water scarcity, and impacted stakeholders. Additionally, businesses may also analyze their water use and efficiency, supply chain dependencies, regulatory risk, and potential financial implications associated with water-related risks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Assessing water risk doesn't need to be complicated.
