Although its valuation has retreated 35% since November's AI strategy announcement, the selloff is an overreaction, RBC says. The company's fundamentals remain entirely intact, it says. By leveraging Google-backed integrations and a custom ChatGPT app, the property website is digitizing the property-hunting experience through new search tools, RBC says. A strategic partnership with NatWest should drive mortgage-related activity, diversifying its revenue streams, RBC says. These innovations reinforce the model's durability, it adds. \"We continue to see the selloff in the shares as unjustified and don't see anything in [Friday's] results that suggest the shine is coming off.\" Shares are up 5.1% at 4.51 pounds.

The country's fiscal-deficit target is likely to be maintained at around 4% of GDP, while the quota of special local government bonds may be raised further from last year's record 4.4 trillion yuan to support infrastructure projects, UOB adds. China could also increase the issuance of ultralong-term special treasury bonds to around 1.5 trillion yuan this year, it says.(jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy_jiahuihuang)</span></p></span></div></div>",
