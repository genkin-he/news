The final protocol design for the Phase 3 trial of Ryoncil® as part of the second-line treatment regimen in adults with steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease (SR-aGvHD), a population approximately three times the size of the pediatric SR-aGvHD population, is locked down following a recent meeting with FDA and will be provided to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) in March for site initiation.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Mesoblast’s second generation product rexlemestrocel-L to create multiple revenue streams in blockbuster indications</span></strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Mesoblast will seek to use its data from large randomized controlled trials in chronic discogenic low back pain (CLBP) and inflammatory chronic heart failure with low ejection fraction to support approvals for rexlemestrocel-L, aligning with recent announcements by the FDA that a single pivotal trial is the new default option for FDA approval.5</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Confirmatory Phase 3 trial for chronic discogenic low back pain (CLBP):</span></strong><span> During the period, Mesoblast received positive feedback from FDA on potential filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) confirming that a clinically meaningful reduction in pain intensity in the active arm versus placebo at 12 months can support product efficacy and stated that the robust results on opioid reduction from at least one adequate and well controlled trial could be included in the Clinical Studies section of product labeling. Mesoblast’s second randomized controlled Phase 3 trial in CLBP is on track to complete its 300-patient enrollment target in March/April this year with the trial actively recruiting across 40 sites in the U.S.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>BLA filing for end-stage patients with chronic heart failure with low ejection fraction (HFrEF):</span></strong><span> Mesoblast has generated new data showing that a single administration of rexlemestrocel-L at the time of open heart surgery and device implantation to support the left ventricle in end-stage patients with HFrEF, reduces right heart failure hospitalizations, mortality from right heart failure, and portal hypertension with major bleeding events. With these new data, existing Orphan Drug designation for treating this group of patients, and FDA’s stated preference for randomized controlled trials, Mesoblast is moving from filing for accelerated approval to filing for full FDA approval next quarter.

January retail sales values jumped on month, and though the dataset has been a poor guide to consumption recently, Thieliant expects the BOJ's consumption activity index--a more reliable barometer of consumer spending--to also record a robust rise. Meanwhile, a core gauge of inflation in Tokyo showed that price growth excluding fresh food and energy edged up in February, leaving it firmly above the BOJ's 2% target. Elsewhere, industrial production was much weaker than expected in January, and forecasts signal a decline in output this quarter, the economist notes. But on balance, the data point to conditions conducive to further tightening. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

Discovery after Netflix said it wouldn't match the David Ellison-led company's latest offer for the iconic Hollywood property.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix pulled the plug on its deal soon after the Warner board of directors said it determined Paramount's $31-per-share offer for the entire company was superior to Netflix's bid for Warner's movie and television studios and HBO Max streaming service. Paramount is now poised to take control of the entertainment company home to properties and brands including HBO, Superman and Harry Potter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We've always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match,\" Netflix Co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement. \"This transaction was always a 'nice to have' at the right price, not a 'must have' at any price,\" the pair said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pending regulatory approval, Paramount will own not only Warner Bros. and HBO, but also many popular cable networks including CNN, TNT, TBS and Food Network. The deal would represent a major ground shift for the entertainment industry, which is trying to adapt to seismic shifts in audience habits and technology.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The development marks a stunning come-from-behind win for Paramount, whose overtures had previously been rebuffed at every turn by Warner. After multiple unsolicited bids from Paramount last year, Warner opened a sale process that ended with Netflix as the winning suitor. Netflix in December signed a deal to buy Warner's studios and HBO Max for $27.75 a share, or $72 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shortly after, Paramount launched a hostile takeover effort, going directly to shareholders with a $30-per-share bid for the whole company, including the cable networks Netflix didn't want.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When Ellison's Skydance Media acquired control of Paramount last August, going after Warner became his top priority. Paramount was seen as too small to compete against deep-pocketed giants such as Disney, Netflix and Amazon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Joe Flint at Joe.Flint@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The bank is encouraged by Supercheap Auto's positive momentum, with like-for-like sales accelerating to 5% in the key holiday period across November and December. That's a solid result in a highly promotional and competitive market, analyst Tom Kierath says. \"However, Rebel still seems a work in progress given supply chain challenges and stock loss issues which will take some time to resolve,\" he says of Super Retail's sports equipment and clothing brand. Rebel's like-for-like sales growth improved in November and December to 5%, but slowed in the first eight weeks of 2H to 2%.

All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate\", \"budget\", \"plan\", \"endeavor\", \"continue\", \"estimate\", \"evaluate\", \"expect\", \"forecast\", \"monitor\", \"may\", \"will\", \"can\", \"able\", \"potential\", \"target\", \"intend\", \"consider\", \"focus\", \"identify\", \"use\", \"utilize\", \"manage\", \"maintain\", \"remain\", \"result\", \"cultivate\", \"could\", \"should\", \"believe\" and similar expressions (including negatives and variations thereof). Lycos believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date hereof, but no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to be correct and such forward-looking statements should not be unduly relied upon. Without limitation, this press release contains forward-looking statements pertaining to Lycos' business strategy, objectives, strength and focus. Statements relating to production, reserves, recovery, replacement, costs and valuation are also deemed to be forward-looking statements, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and that the reserves can be profitably produced in the future. The forward-looking statements and information are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by Lycos, including expectations and assumptions concerning Lycos' ability to execute its plans and strategies. Although Lycos believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements and information are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements and information because Lycos can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. By its nature, such forward-looking information is subject to various risks and uncertainties, which could cause the actual results and expectations to differ materially from the anticipated results or expectations expressed.

The term barrels of oil equivalent (\"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>boe</span></strong><span>\") may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet per barrel (6 Mcf/bbl) of natural gas to barrels of oil equivalence is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. All boe conversions in the report are derived from converting gas to oil in the ratio mix of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Product Types</span></strong><span>.

All reserves values, future net revenue and ancillary information contained in this press release are derived from the Reserves Report unless otherwise noted. All reserve references in this press release are \"Company gross reserves\". Company gross reserves are the Company's total working interest reserves before the deduction of any royalties payable by the Company. Estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same level of confidence as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties, due to the effect of aggregation. There is no assurance that the forecast price and cost assumptions applied by McDaniel in evaluating Lycos' reserves will be attained and variances could be material. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All evaluations and summaries of future net revenue are stated prior to the provision for interest, debt service charges or general and administrative expenses and after deduction of royalties, operating costs, estimated well abandonment and reclamation costs and estimated future capital expenditures. It should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented in the tables below represent the fair market value of the reserves. The recovery and reserve estimates of Lycos' crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves provided herein are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. Actual crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil, reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves. The reserve and associated cash flow information set forth herein are estimates only.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves. Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves. Proved developed producing reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate. These reserves may be currently producing or, if shut-in, they must have previously been on production, and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty. Undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure (e.g., when compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to render them capable of production. They must fully meet the requirements of the reserves category (proved, probable, possible) to which they are assigned. Certain terms used in this press release but not defined are defined in NI 51-101, CSA Staff Notice 51-324 - Revised Glossary to NI 51-101 (\"CSA Staff Notice 51-324\") and/or the COGEH and, unless the context otherwise requires, shall have the same meanings herein as in NI 51-101, CSA Staff Notice 51-324 and the COGEH, as the case may be.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Oil and Gas Metrics</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>This press release contains metrics commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry which have been prepared by management. These terms do not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, and therefore should not be used to make such comparisons.

Even the most ardent EM bull must be wondering if this blistering rally can continue. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The figures out of South Korea are staggering.

But even though \"FOMO: might be a factor, it is not the main story. The KOSPI is actually trading at its lowest multiple, based on 12-month forward earnings, since June. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In other words, many investors are buying for the very rational reason that they expect to be rewarded with bumper earnings growth moving forward.</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1078.3625730994152px;aspect-ratio:1.797270955165692\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2026:newsml_L1N3ZM0RJ-1281db7f7e4d6002c264f359521d9b83-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"chart\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2026:newsml_L1N3ZM0RJ-1281db7f7e4d6002c264f359521d9b83-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#fcf9f9\"/></picture></div></button><figcaption class=\"caption-CvWHk7Ya\"><span class=\"copyright-CvWHk7Ya\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-CvWHk7Ya\">South Korea financial conditions loosest on record - Goldman</span></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1049.5268138801262px;aspect-ratio:1.749211356466877\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2026:newsml_L1N3ZM0RJ-29f6f991830ea4f1af59ad45bc6abfd1-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"chart\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2026:newsml_L1N3ZM0RJ-29f6f991830ea4f1af59ad45bc6abfd1-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#d6dae4\"/></picture></div></button><figcaption class=\"caption-CvWHk7Ya\"><span class=\"copyright-CvWHk7Ya\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-CvWHk7Ya\">Investors most overweight EM in 5 years - BofA</span></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:797.6154992548435px;aspect-ratio:1.3293591654247392\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2026:newsml_L1N3ZM0RJ-3ca0b12ab0b3e74d33c7a5c12cff2ee1-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"chart\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2026:newsml_L1N3ZM0RJ-3ca0b12ab0b3e74d33c7a5c12cff2ee1-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#3a2c17\"/></picture></div></button><figcaption class=\"caption-CvWHk7Ya\"><span class=\"copyright-CvWHk7Ya\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-CvWHk7Ya\">US stocks still historically expensive vs EM</span></figcaption></figure><p class=\"\"><span>HOW BULLISH IS TOO BULLISH?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The KOSPI may be an outlier in terms of the scale of its gains in early 2026, but not the direction of travel. MSCI's benchmark emerging market </span><span>CBOE:EFS</span><span> and Asia ex-Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) indices are both up 15% this year, while the main equity indices in Taiwan </span><span>TWSE:TAIEX</span><span> and Brazil </span><span> are up nearly 25% and 20%, respectively.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Taiwan, home to the world's largest maker of the chips used in AI applications, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing </span><span>, plays a pivotal role in the global AI supply chain for companies such as Nvidia </span><span> and Apple </span><span>. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reflecting the expected AI windfall, Taiwan's statistics office just raised the country's 2026 GDP growth forecast to 7.7% from the 3.5% it predicted in November. That's an astonishing revision in just a few months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This all suggests that the presumed U.S. advantage in tech and AI – once at the heart of the \"American Exceptionalism\" narrative – is eroding rapidly. Emerging countries, especially in Asia, are catching up, and investors are reallocating accordingly. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bank of America's latest global fund manager survey showed that the rotation out of U.S. stocks and into emerging markets surged in February, and investors are now the most overweight EM stocks they have been in five years. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Indeed, investors' biggest overweight position in any asset or sector is now emerging markets, the survey showed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Analysts at TS Lombard are certainly committed to the cause. Their EM equity allocation is the highest ever and is currently double their allotment to U.S. stocks. Investors haven't been this bullish on emerging markets for more than 20 years, they reckon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This hyper-optimism smacks of a bubble in the making. But if you think the global AI story has a long runway - and Nvidia's latest bumper sales and outlook suggest it does - then this reallocation away from the U.S. makes strategic sense. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And it may make financial sense too. The S&amp;P 500's valuation premium over MSCI's benchmark EM index may have shrunk a bit this year but remains historically high. So despite the outperformance in recent months, EM stocks are still relatively cheap. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And against a relatively benign global macroeconomic backdrop of a softer dollar, stable Treasuries market and dovish-leaning Federal Reserve, capital may have plenty of reasons to keep flowing towards emerging markets. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This rotation has been fierce, but it may still have room to run.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(The opinions expressed here are those of </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/authors/jamie-mcgeever/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Jamie McGeever</a><span>, a columnist for Reuters)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Enjoying this column?
