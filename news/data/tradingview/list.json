Economist Elias Hilmer says Chinese stocks have struggled to advance so far this year, partly weighed by the broader U.S. tech selloff. However, while weakness in the U.S. has been broad-based, declines in China have been concentrated in the communication services sector. Hilmer adds that concerns weighing on U.S. tech stocks, such as overstretched valuations and the sustainability of earnings growth, are less pronounced in China, where risks of capital misallocation are lower and stock valuations remain near historical medians. \"Overall, the weak start to the year for Chinese equities appears overdone,\" CE says.(jason.chau@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

The Green Party won the Gorton and Denton election, with Labour coming in third place behind Reform. At the 2024 general election, Labour comfortably took the seat but its popularity has since fallen. The news raises doubts about Starmer's future ahead of wider U.K. local elections in May. Alongside political uncertainty, there are concerns that Starmer could be replaced by a leader that favors more fiscal spending, worsening the public finances. The euro rises to a high of 0.8764 pounds, LSEG data show. Sterling falls 0.1% to $1.3461. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
