Discovery said Thursday it determined that Paramount's revised offer to buy it is superior to the deal it has with Netflix, the latest twist in the monthslong battle over the storied entertainment company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix now has four business days to make a revised offer for the Warner board to determine whether it matches Paramount's latest bid. While Paramount is seeking to buy all of Warner Discovery, Netflix's deal is for the Warner movie and TV studios and HBO Max streaming service.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Warner said if the board still favors Paramount after Netflix revises its offer, Warner would be entitled to terminate the Netflix agreement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Until then, the Netflix merger agreement remains in effect, and the Warner board continues to recommend in favor of the Netflix transaction, the company said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Netflix spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Warner's latest move marks an about-face after months of rejecting Paramount's overtures. The battle for Warner is significant for the futures of both Paramount and Netflix, coming as the entertainment industry struggles to adapt to seismic shifts in technology and viewing habits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both Netflix and Paramount see Warner's library — which includes Harry Potter, Batman and hit TV shows such as \"Friends\" and \"The Sopranos\" — as a valuable asset that could boost their respective streaming services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount on Tuesday submitted a revised bid of $31 a share for all of Warner Discovery, including cable networks such as CNN and Food Network, for an $81 billion deal . Netflix in December reached a deal to buy Warner's studios and HBO Max for $27.75 a share, or $72 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As part of its revised bid, Paramount agreed to exclude the Warner cable networks from the proposed agreement's \"material adverse effect\" clause, meaning the deal's price tag won't shrink if the linear TV networks business declines in value before the close.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Additionally, Paramount accelerated the timing of its proposed \"ticking fee\" of 25 cents, which it would pay to Warner shareholders for each quarter its deal hasn't closed, to start after Sept. 30 instead of in January.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The offer also includes an increased $7 billion termination fee that Paramount would pay if the transaction failed to close due to regulatory concerns. Paramount would additionally be on the hook for the $2.8 billion breakup fee Warner would owe Netflix should that deal fall apart.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount's latest bid came after Warner's board of directors set a seven-day window for the companies to negotiate, which Netflix permitted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount has long said its all-cash bid was superior because it wanted the entire company, unlike Netflix, and it believed it had a cleaner path to regulatory approval.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos is in Washington, D.C., Thursday meeting with Justice Department and White House officials to make the case for the deal, a person familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount, led by David Ellison, went directly to shareholders with a tender offer in December, after being rebuffed by Warner multiple times. The suitor gradually sweetened its offer — backed by Ellison's billionaire father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison; private-equity firm RedBird Capital; and a group of sovereign-wealth funds — until Warner agreed to reopen negotiations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Joe Flint at Joe.Flint@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESS Newswire / February 26, 2026 / Redwood AI Corp.

The Performance Upgrade was generated as a part of Redwood AI's continued commitment to perpetual model development.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A key benefit of the Performance Upgrade is that it will allow Redwood's chemistry synthesis model to run full studies on standard CPU infrastructure, rather than solely on specialized GPU hardware. This is intended to broaden accessibility for organizations that want powerful AI models that can be run without restrictive cloud computing setups and to simplify deployments in environments where GPU availability, procurement, or approvals can create delays, such as systems requiring to be air-gapped for security purposes. Many synthesis support tools are dependent on high intensity externally hosted systems, limiting their use where IP or other restrictions may not be feasible, and where computational costs alone can be expensive. Accordingly, this Performance Upgrade is designed to broaden the Company's platform and make it suitable for potential clients for whom other software is not suitable for their needs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Performance Upgrade also aligns with recent advances in AI deployment strategies associated with \"AI sovereignty,\" supporting biopharmaceutical organizations that prioritize keeping compute and sensitive workflows within their preferred infrastructure footprint. By enabling effective CPU-based execution, Redwood believes users will have more options to deploy closer to where data resides, whether on-premise, within specific regions, or within tightly controlled environments, while maintaining consistent performance. This is of critical importance given the sensitive intellectual property considerations of many organizations. Redwood's engineering improvements include more efficient code management designed to keep the system lightweight while retaining accuracy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By lowering infrastructure intensity and improving runtime efficiency, the Performance Upgrade is also expected to reduce ongoing costs of operation and hosting. This can be particularly valuable for organizations scaling usage across teams, adding new workloads, or expanding coverage across projects where predictable compute budgets and reliable performance are critical.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"</span><span>We built this Performance Upgrade to make the platform more dependable under real-world constraints. Users should not have to choose between speed, control, and cost. By improving efficiency and enabling full studies to run on CPUs, teams can keep workflows moving even when infrastructure is constrained, while scaling more predictably as demand increases. Critically, this helps ensure our product remains usable as organizations develop AI use policies that may restrict deployment of larger models that cannot meet stringent geographic or on-site requirements,\" said Louis Dron, CEO of Redwood AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Redwood AI Corp.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Redwood AI uses advanced artificial intelligence to accelerate drug discovery and development.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>The Ethereum Foundation is taking a decisive step to strengthen decentralized finance (DeFi) on ETH and launching a new initiative. This move signals a renewed strategic focus on scaling DeFi adoption, improving protocol security, and fostering sustainable growth across lending, trading, and on-chain financial services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Why Boosting Developer Support And Ecosystem Funding</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a key development, the Ethereum Foundation is launching a renewed and more ambitious protocol to strengthen DeFi within the ETH ecosystem. Ethereum Daily has revealed on X that the initiative is being framed as a Defipunk approach, which is centered on building financial infrastructure that is truly permissionless, private, secure, and fully open-source. The goal is to enable anyone, anywhere, to save, borrow, hedge risk, or make payments without relying on big companies like banks or large corporations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rather than focusing solely on incremental upgrades to existing applications, like improved stablecoins, the Foundation’s vision reportedly targets deeper structural innovation. The key areas include developing more secure price oracles, enhancing privacy loans to reduce unfair liquidations, and integrating artificial intelligence (AI) to strengthen system security.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With a newly formed DeFi team leading the effort, the foundation is inviting developers who share its vision to help build a financial system that will give users full control and expand accessibility, not just speculators.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>How Inflow And Outflow Trends Reveal Strategic Positioning</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even as ETH price action has been brutally down from $4,900 to below $2,000, Ethereum spot ETF flows are quietly signaling a shift behind the surface. The head of research at Lisk, analyst Leon Waidmann, stated that the ETF flow dynamics have shown that after a period of heavy outflow around mid-2025, the intensity of selling pressure has been gradually fading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, the massive inflow waves that were seen in late 2024 and early 2025 have subsided, and the peak panic selling that followed has largely dissipated. The recent ETF flow bars are significantly smaller in both directions compared to the prior volatile period, and sellers are running out of steam.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Waidmann noted that this shift is significant because, despite one of the sharpest ETH drawdowns in recent memory, the institutional exodus appears to be exhausting. While the weak hand that wanted out has largely exited, this means there’s no bottom.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, there’s still a slight outflow bias in recent weeks, indicating that there’s no confirmed accumulation signal yet. Waidmann emphasized that the intensity of the selling pressure is clearly fading, which is the first step that must happen before any trend reversal. In his view, participants should pay attention to when the selling dries up before sentiment recovers, because that’s usually where the next move will start to build.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Those genes play a role in our sleeping habits and our susceptibility to certain diseases, including Covid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A trio of University of Pennsylvania researchers dug deeper into these</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ancient pairings and published their findings Thursday in a new   study in the journal Science.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They compared DNA from 73 modern women in Africa to genetic information from three female Neanderthals.
