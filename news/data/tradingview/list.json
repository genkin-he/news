The stock reaction was just what IonQ needed after coming under increased scrutiny earlier this month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>IonQ shares have fallen 25% this year through Wednesday's close, driven lower by the announcement of an acquisition at the end of January and, more recently, a shortseller report accusing the company of misstating its revenue and buying up smaller companies to spur growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>IonQ told Barron's, which was the first to report on the allegations, that the firm had made \"false, misleading, and unsubstantiated claims.\" The company didn't provide a rebuttal to what it called \"substantial misrepresentations\" of its government relationships, business strategy, and financial sustainability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Government relationships are essential for IonQ. As is the case with peers like Rigetti, federal contracts are major contributors to revenue. Just on Monday, IonQ announced that it had been awarded a contract under the Missile Defense Agency, an arm of the Defense Department, with a ceiling of $151 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company is under no obligation to respond to short reports, but the allegations clearly spooked investors. Since the report was made public on Feb. 4, shares have fallen more than 12% through Wednesday's close.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In an industry like quantum computing, where investors have very little to go off — none of the pure play companies are profitable, and their technology has yet to be broadly commercialized — allegations like these can have a big impact on sentiment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, the company has attracted its fair share of admirers, both from a retail investor standpoint and on the Street. Twelve of the 15 firms tracked by FactSet rate the stock at Buy, while the remaining three rate it at Hold.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In an interview with Barron's in May 2025, de Masi coined the term \" Nvidia of quantum computing\" to describe IonQ's aspirations to grow into the largest and most comprehensive player in the industry, and the nickname stuck.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It doesn't seem the company is abandoning these goals any time soon. IonQ has been on an acquisition spree for the past year as it aims to absorb new technologies into its portfolio, from satellite imagery to atomic clocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Perhaps the most consequential purchase was that of British start-up Oxford Ionics, whose proprietary technology allowed IonQ to claim a record in quantum performance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company's loss from operations swelled to nearly $229 million in the fourth quarter from $77.5 million last year. Operating costs and expenses rose to just over $290 million from $89.2 million in 2024. In all, IonQ finished the quarter with a net loss of $753 million, wider than a $202 million loss in the year-ago period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Software stocks IGV have gained for the last two days and he thinks they bottomed on Feb. 23, he told clients in a video blog.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lee believes investors are 95% into the decline of Mag 7 as he sees the rotation out of those stocks nearing an extreme level. Software is 99% done with a selloff now in the final weeks, and cryptocurrencies are also in the last weeks of a pullback, he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A supportive stat for markets overall that he points to is the so-called January barometer. The argument is that if the S&amp;P 500 SPX rises for the first week of January and the month overall - the index gained 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively - February tends to be a \"payback\"month, with a median monthly average decline of 0.4%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That gives way to an even stronger March performance, potentially an average gain of 2%, followed by an even better April, says Lee.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lee is sticking to some themes he flagged headed into 2026, such as energy  XLE and basic materials XLB, both of which rallied this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Industrials, financials and small-caps are also poised to gain in a \"stronger 2026,\" and he's also keen on Mag 7 stocks, bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD), given he believes the selloff for those assets is nearly over.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lee it should be noted is chairman of Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), and that crypto is down 30% year to date, versus a 21% drop for bitcoin.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of his arguments about an Ethereum bounce has to do with how much the crypto has unwound its prior bull market. In 2020, it was a 96% retracement, in 2022 that was 83%, in 2025 it was an 84% retracement. The current one is up to 90%, so he thinks that process is nearly finished.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lee is known as one of Wall Street's most accurate forecasters who correctly told investors to buy stocks during pandemic lows and nailed the 2023 bull market.

The decline reflected Krispy Kreme's decision last year to pull out of lower-trafficked, less-profitable distribution points and prioritize sales in locations with retail partners such as Walmart, Target and Costco.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On an organic basis, revenue fell 3.9%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We saw really meaningful progress in the fourth quarter on that turnaround, which shows the plan is working,\" Charlesworth said. The company added roughly 1,100 high-traffic locations last year while completing its exit from underperforming stores, positioning itself to return to growth in 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shares jumped 23%, to $3.67, in premarket trading Thursday. Through Wednesday's close, the stock had lost roughly half of its value over the past year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Krispy Kreme ended 2025 with about 7,160 fresh-delivery locations, nearly 200 more than at the end of the third quarter. The company guided for systemwide sales to grow 2% to 4% in constant currency this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The outlook came as the company widened its fourth-quarter loss to $29.1 million, or 17 cents a share, from a loss of $22.2 million, or 13 cents a share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings of 9 cents a share topped analyst expectations of 3 cents a share, according to FactSet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Technology, including artificial intelligence, is also supporting Krispy Kreme's turnaround operations. While AI isn't a major factor in day-to-day production currently, it is being used in back-office functions such as demand planning and route management.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"AI isn't a big part of the productivity journey so far,\" Charlesworth said. \"It's more down to optimizing production, looking at yields and making sure our shops have the right people at the right time.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To meet changing consumer preferences, Krispy Kreme has introduced smaller portion options, including bite-sized and mini doughnuts, and the company plans to launch a line of mini cake donuts later this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company also positions its brand as a treat for special occasions. The majority of the company's doughnuts are purchased for sharing, typically two to three times per year, often around holidays or events such as Valentine's Day and Halloween.
