            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Myra P. Saefong</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The crude-oil market is seeing a 'rare occasion' where supply risks are more focused on the Americas</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Any potential U.S. strike on Venezuela's military sites could pave the way for Venezuela's elected government to return to power - and that raises significant risks for oil markets, said the Price Futures Group's Phil Flynn.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Escalating U.S. tensions with Venezuela and an upcoming monthly decision by major oil producers on crude output targets were the focus of traders heading into the weekend.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. plans to attack military installations inside Venezuela and the strikes could come at any moment, the Miami Herald reported Friday, citing sources with knowledge of the situation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In response to the report, White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly told MarketWatch in an email that \"unnamed sources don't know what they're talking about. Any announcements regarding Venezuela policy would come directly from the President.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, oil prices found some support in the wake of the news report of potential strikes, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery (CLZ25) (CL.1) edging up by 0.6% to $60.93 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices were still trading lower for the week and have declined for the month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Although the U.S. already has certain sanctions on Venezuela in place, \"those do not impact physical [oil] production and transport in the same way that possible damage from military activity could,\" Colin Cieszynski, portfolio manager and chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management, told MarketWatch. \"So this appears to be forcing investors to adjust their supply-risk expectations.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is a \"rare occasion,\" Cieszynski noted, where \"supply risks are more focused in the Americas.\" He pointed out that U.S. crude prices were up a bit more than global benchmark Brent crude, which saw its January contract (BRNF26) - which becomes the front month at the end of the session - move up by 0.4% to $64.62 on ICE Futures Europe.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A U.S. strike on Venezuela's military sites would potentially pave the way for Venezuela's elected government to return to power, said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group. \"This raises significant risks for oil markets, particularly diesel, as supplies are already low and Venezuelan heavy oil is an important source.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The situation, meanwhile, could overshadow concerns about the recent sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft Oil Company and Lukoil OAO, said Flynn.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oil traders also are anticipating the latest decision by the major oil producers known as OPEC+ over the weekend. The group plans to hold its monthly meeting on Sunday and is expected to decide on production targets for the month of December.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the last meeting in early October, OPEC+ agreed to increase production in November by another 137,000 barrels a day, despite rising concerns of a global supply glut. The group has been announcing monthly production increases since April.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2026, the global oil market may see an average surplus of 4 million barrels per day, according to reports from the International Energy Agency and World Bank Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read: An oil supply glut could sink prices to $35 a barrel next year. Why the U.S.-China trade truce won't change that.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the short term, analysts were expecting oil officials to announce a similar rise of 137,000 barrels per day in production targets, said David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But long term, it looks as if the oil market wants to go lower, retesting the double bottom from this past May of $55 front-month WTI, he said in emailed comments to MarketWatch Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The reason is simply the ongoing slowdown in global demand growth, against recent reports that there will be a supply overhang of around 4 million bpd next year,\" said Morrison. \"That could be countered by U.S. sanctions on Rosneft/Lukoil, but I don't think traders put much store in the effectiveness of sanctions. Maybe this time it's different.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Myra P. Saefong</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The chip maker announced on Oct. 6 that it had notched a deal to become a major supplier for OpenAI. The ChatGPT maker plans to deploy 6 gigawatts worth of AMD chips in exchange for up to 160 million shares of AMD stock. The deal propelled AMD shares to their best month since 2001, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Micron Technology continued its banner year in October, with shares rising 36.1% for the month. AI has driven a surge in demand for the company's dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, products, giving Micron license to raise prices as customers' inventories thin out. The company got an additional boost this week when South Korean rival SK Hynix forecast a \"supercycle\" of demand for memory chips.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shares of Teradyne jumped 33.1% to an all-time high in October. The maker of test systems for semiconductors and robotics closed last week down for the month. But shares surged after the company beat earnings expectations for the third quarter and issued fourth-quarter guidance that blew past analysts' estimates, citing robust AI-related demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>J.B. Hunt Transport Services rebounded from a rough year, rising 24.8% in October. The freight company has combatted a weak shipping economy by controlling costs. That strategy paid off: Hunt posted third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16 that easily beat analysts' expectations, driving the stock to its largest single-day gain since 1998. It remains narrowly down in 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Data-storage company Western Digital was the second-best performer in the S&amp;P 500 in the third quarter, but it will have to settle for fifth place in October. The stock rose 23.4% amid a spike in demand for storage hardware due to cloud and AI investments. Another earnings beat this week adds to Western's momentum heading into the home stretch of 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Conversely, Fiserv was the worst performer in October as shares cratered nearly 48.9%. The stock had its worst day on record Wednesday after Fiserv slashed its full-year outlook, sending shares down 44%. CEO Mike Lyons attributed the guidance cut to overly upbeat expectations for growth in Argentina and a previous focus on \"short-term initiatives\" that came at the expense of long-term customer relationships. Third-quarter earnings also missed analysts' expectations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alexandria Real Estate Equities fell 32.5%. The real estate investment trust swung to a loss in the third quarter and issued full-year guidance that underwhelmed investors. Alexandria lowered the midpoint of its earnings guidance to a loss of $2.94 a share from earnings of 50 cents a share, citing the potential for additional real estate impairments in the fourth quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Molina Healthcare sank 21% in October. Last week, the health insurer reduced its full-year earnings guidance for the third time in months, citing cost pressures and underperformance in its marketplace business. Earnings and revenue for the third quarter also came in sharply below Wall Street's estimates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CoStar Group declined 20.7%. CoStar's third-quarter earnings report Tuesday put it squarely in the spotlight. While the real estate data-analytics company issued an upbeat outlook for the full year and posted adjusted earning that beat consensus, CoStar reported a net loss of $30.9 million versus a profit of $53 million last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cybersecurity company F5 declined 20.6%. Shares sank by double digits on Oct. 16 alone, when F5 disclosed it had suffered a security breach that gave nation-state affiliated hackers \"persistent access\" to some of its systems. The Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency said at the time that the hack presented \"an imminent threat to federal networks.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.com and Nate Wolf at nate.wolf@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The new platform features dual artificial intelligence engines that deliver Fortune 500-quality analysis capabilities without requiring internal SEO expertise. As a result, agencies can now produce professional backlink strategy reports in approximately 45 to 60 minutes instead of spending multiple hours on manual creation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>White-Label Backlink Strategy Report Creation System Announced By LinkDaddy</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8814/272742_e30a4b9e645409be_002full.jpg</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>More information is available at https://linkdaddy.com.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The launch addresses a significant challenge facing SEO agencies seeking to expand their service offerings while maintaining operational efficiency. Unlike generic template-based solutions, the white-label system analyzes both client websites and agency capabilities to create authentic authority positioning in delivered reports. This dual analysis approach ensures recommendations align with actual agency strengths, providing meaningful differentiation in competitive markets where cookie-cutter reports fail to impress potential clients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Two specialized artificial intelligence engines work in coordination to optimize both analysis quality and investment recommendations. The Dynamic Reasoning Engine processes data from premium SEO tools with monthly subscription values exceeding $1,000, delivering comprehensive competitive intelligence and technical assessments that would otherwise require significant tool investments. Meanwhile, the Dynamic Investment and Scaling Engine ensures strategic budget recommendations consistently fall within the $4,000 to $6,000 range through mathematical service scaling rather than arbitrary pricing structures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The platform includes several proprietary methodologies that differentiate it from standard SEO reporting tools. First Mover Advantage Identification discovers hidden revenue streams through specialized keywords that competitors have not yet targeted in their optimization strategies. To ensure long-term sustainability, the Strategic Dilution Methodology provides a systematic 3-phase approach for anchor text optimization that aligns with search engine preferences and reduces penalty risks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LinkDaddy has served over 3,800 customers and completed more than 16,000 backlink orders since establishing operations 10 years ago in the SEO services industry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To learn how the white label system integrates with existing service offerings, interested agencies can schedule a strategy consultation at https://calendly.com/linkdaddy/strategy-call</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Contact Info:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Name: Tony Peacock</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Email: tony@linkdaddy.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Organization: LinkDaddy</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Address: 80 Southwest 8th Street, Miami, Florida 33130, United States</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Website: https://linkdaddy.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/272742</span></p></span></div></div>",
