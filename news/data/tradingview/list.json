            "title": "How Tim Cook Evaded Disaster at Apple This Year — WSJ",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Rolfe Winkler</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It took two quarters for Tim Cook to save Apple from what was almost a disastrous year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>President Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs risked massively increasing the company's costs. A pending court ruling imperiled Apple's lucrative Google contract. Plus, the company was seen as lagging on artificial intelligence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Facing so much uncertainty, Apple tumbled to a market capitalization of $2.6 trillion in April and lost its title as the world's most valuable company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Six months later, Cook pushed Apple's market value above $4 trillion for the first time. That's more than 10 times what the company was worth when Cook took over as chief executive from Steve Jobs 14 years ago.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During Cook's years at the helm, Apple hasn't unveiled a revolutionary technology or introduced a new product that will reshape people's lives the way the iPhone did. Instead, Cook, who turns 65 on Saturday, has won over shareholders by doing just enough to protect and grow the business, a conservative strategy that has been on display this year with clever political and legal maneuvering and enticing new iPhones.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Scariest to Apple investors had been the threat of tariffs and Trump's direct criticism of Apple's supply chain. Apple remains largely reliant on huge manufacturing operations built up in China over more than 20 years, a supply chain Cook himself built when he was head of Apple's operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With most iPhones still made there, investors panicked on \"Liberation Day\" in April when Trump announced massive import tariffs. Apple's stock cratered more than 20% in the days that followed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cook was already in position to avoid the worst from a U.S. trade war with China. He had been shifting the final assembly of more iPhones to India for several years, so he was able to reroute more India-assembled phones to the U.S. to dodge the tariffs on China.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That didn't please Trump. \"We're not interested in you building in India. India can take care of themselves,\" Trump said in May, referring to Apple.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But Apple's supply chain is never coming back to the U.S., not in any substantial way, current and former employees say. Among other advantages, Asia has pools of both skilled and cheap labor that aren't available domestically.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During Trump's first term, Cook learned he can win over the president by giving him a good headline. In 2018, Apple promised to invest $350 billion in the U.S. over five years — primarily spending the company was already planning to make, say people familiar with the calculations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2019, facing potential tariffs on China, Cook personally lobbied Trump, explaining how such levies would increase iPhone prices and help foreign rivals. Then Apple reversed its decision to move production of its Mac Pro computer to China from Texas, and Cook led Trump on a tour of the Austin factory. \"Today I opened a major Apple manufacturing plant in Texas,\" Trump boasted. Actually, the factory had been open since 2013, and it made a niche product. Cook didn't correct Trump.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The strategy worked. Trump scaled back tariff threats during his first term, giving exceptions to electronics like the iPhone.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So Cook deployed the strategy again. In August, Cook said he was increasing Apple's promised U.S. investments to $600 billion over four years. He made the announcement next to Trump in the Oval Office, as he gave him a plaque with a base of gold.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Again, Cook gave up little, making promises primarily on already planned investment, said the people familiar with the figures. Investments include making AI servers in Texas and offering manufacturing training for U.S. businesses in Detroit. Specific figures Apple announced were a $2.5 billion commitment to make iPhone cover glass in Kentucky with longtime supplier Corning, and a $500 million partnership to produce rare-earth magnets in the U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What Cook isn't doing is committing to make Apple's popular products in the U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After the U.S. investment pledge, Trump announced Apple would be exempt from a tariff on imported electronics, leaving the company subject to only a smaller China tariff, which Trump agreed to cut in half on Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's not the only blow Cook avoided this summer. During the penalty phase of an antitrust trial against Google, a judge held in his hands the ability to cancel payments Google makes to Apple for placement as the default search engine in Apple's Safari web browser.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Such a move would have cost Apple dearly. The contract generates more than $20 billion of revenue a year for Apple, nearly all of which falls to the bottom line, accounting for roughly a fifth of the company's operating profit, analysts estimate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cook sent lieutenant Eddy Cue to testify. Apple's senior vice president in charge of services told the judge he \"lost a lot of sleep thinking about\" the possible disappearance of the Google contract and testified that technology shifts are so powerful they can take down even the most massive companies. The subtext: The judge didn't need to impose harsh penalties; the market would take care of itself.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The judge gave Google a slap on the wrist and said the competitive dynamics of the marketplace were changing already, largely because of AI. Notably he said prohibiting search-distribution payments would harm companies such as Apple. As one analyst said at the time: \"Apple didn't just dodge a bullet; they dodged a missile.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Just after Labor Day, Cook welcomed hundreds to Apple's spaceship campus to unveil his newest generation of iPhones. A new, thinner smartphone dubbed the iPhone Air was the star of the show. But its weaker camera, single speaker, smaller battery and high price tag have combined to make the device less popular with customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nothing stood out as a game changer; perhaps the biggest cheer among those in attendance was for a camera sensor that enables landscape photos without turning a phone to the side.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even so, Apple delivered just enough new features across the rest of its iPhone 17 lineup that many customers are upgrading. On Thursday, Apple projected up to 12% revenue growth in the holiday quarter, double Wall Street's estimate, thanks to strong iPhone sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company has faced criticism for being slower to deliver flashy AI advancements while rivals make huge  investments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the stock has been supported, in part, by $100 billion in annual share buybacks, and revenue continues to grow because of Cook's focus on delivering products that have become ubiquitous in people's lives. His motto has been be best, not first.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many forget that the first-generation AirPods almost nine years ago were widely mocked as expensive Q-tips that were easily lost. They had been a challenging product to develop, and Cook stuck with them. Now they are a must-have iPhone accessory that generate billions of dollars in annual sales. So is the Apple Watch, which evolved from a somewhat marginal digital fashion statement into a widely used health and fitness device.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All the while, Cook has milked the iPhone ecosystem for more revenue each year, selling apps, subscriptions and App Store ads, and squeezing bigger payments from Google. All those services surpassed $100 billion in revenue this past fiscal year for the first time, at a higher profit margin than device sales. News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The knock on Cook since the day he took over is that he isn't a \"product guy\" like his predecessor. Jobs paid frequent visits to Apple's design studio where future products were in development. Cook doesn't stop by as much, preferring to focus on operations. Yet on his watch, Apple built its own semiconductor operation that designs some of the best chips in the world.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When Cook eventually steps down, some analysts want the company to appoint a more visionary, product-minded CEO who can better innovate in the age of AI. Neither he nor the company has suggested that is imminent, and he is widely expected to continue as executive chairman once he leaves the CEO post.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Rolfe Winkler at Rolfe.Winkler@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By James Mackintosh</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amid the wild surge in AI spending, investors in listed companies are making the same demand they have for years: Show me the money. It may not be enough to prevent a lot of wasteful corporate investment, and it definitely doesn't apply to private artificial-intelligence developers, but it's a sign that the market isn't completely unhinged.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alphabet and Meta showed with their quarterly results this week that the most important thing to investors is making a return on AI spending. Both increased their already vast capital-spending plans. Both spent most of their time with Wall Street analysts talking about AI and new products.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But Alphabet shares rose after it focused on how it is selling basic AI services today. Meanwhile, Meta's stock slumped 11% after it emphasized aggressive investment to get ahead in the hope that what it calls \"superintelligence\" comes earlier than expected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The performance gets to the heart of how markets work. In normal times investors prefer companies that generate more profit with less capital — with the ideal being a firm with what Warren Buffett calls a \"moat\" protecting its business from too much competition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The alternative is speculative investment in the hope of big profits at some point in the future. This is a hallmark of venture capital and a handful of stocks driven by private investors, typically with a chief executive able to articulate a strong narrative about that future. Tesla is the modern archetype: a car company with much broader ambitions and a never-ending story about vast success on the way...soon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In bubbles, everyone gets caught up in the idea that spending on the hot theme will deliver vast profits eventually. When the bubble is big enough, it shifts the behavior of the market as a whole from disliking capital expenditure, and hating speculative capital spending in particular, to loving it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So far, that doesn't seem to have happened.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The history of investor views of capex is neatly measured by what finance professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French dubbed the \"investment factor,\" the old tendency of stocks in companies that invest the most to lag behind. From the 1960s through to the early 2000s, companies that increased capex the most were pretty consistent laggards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The two big exceptions were the Nifty Fifty boom of the late 1960s and early 1970s, briefly interrupted by a recession, and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. In both periods of excess investors thought companies could invest successfully, and rushed to buy the heaviest spenders before, as usual, being disappointed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Over the past quarter-century, however, a greater focus on corporate governance and a new investor appreciation of return on capital helped limit management hijinks. The stocks of companies that invested the most no longer fell behind those of stingier companies, but didn't beat them by much either.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before I checked the data, I expected the new AI boom to show up in a renewed investor love of capex, similar to the bubbles of the past. Who wants dull stocks that merely make predictable profits and give them back to shareholders, when you could bet on the creation of our new robot overlords?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In fact there's little sign of a shift in the investment factor, which has behaved perfectly normally this year, with higher-spending big companies tending to underperform a little. It doesn't show up in investor attitudes to buybacks, either — another gauge of whether they prefer companies to return capital to investors or spend it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The S&amp;P 500 buyback index, which holds the 100 S&amp;P companies repurchasing the most shares, rose about in line with the rest of the market this year, aside from a wobble this week. The same goes for a more stringent Nasdaq index that includes only businesses that buy back so much they cut their share count by 5%. Investors continue to like buybacks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sure, performance for indexes of \"dividend aristocrats\" and high dividend payers has been abysmal — and it is because of AI. But it isn't because of capital spending. The problem with buying based on dividends is you miss out on almost all of the tech sector, and these shares, along with some Big Tech stocks that sit in other sectors, have driven gains this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>None of this proves there isn't an AI bubble, of course. Valuations of private AI companies such as OpenAI are absurd, and the money pouring into data centers is so big it is measured as a share of GDP. But, so far at least, the speculative fervor visible in markets hasn't translated into investors in big listed companies abandoning their preference for a bird in the hand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to James Mackintosh at james.mackintosh@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

Our mission is to advance mining projects with a laser focus on our resource-stage Swanson Gold Deposit and the Beacon Gold Mill, which have significant potential to deliver long-term value. The Swanson Gold Project is approximately 18,304 hectares (183 km2) in size and includes several prospects rich in gold and critical metals previously held by Monarch Mining, Abcourt Mines, and Globex Mining. LaFleur has recently consolidated a large land package along a major structural break that hosts the Swanson, Bartec, and Jolin gold deposits and several other showings which make up the Swanson Gold Project. The Swanson Gold Project is easily accessible by road allowing direct access to several nearby gold mills, further enhancing its development potential. Lafleur Mineral's fully refurbished and permitted Beacon Gold Mill is capable of processing over 750 tonnes per day and is being considered for processing mineralized material at Swanson and for custom milling operations for other nearby gold projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>ON BEHALF OF LAFLEUR MINERALS INC.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paul Ténière, M.Sc., P.Geo.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chief Executive Officer</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>E: info@lafleurminerals.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LaFleur Minerals Inc.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1500-1055 West Georgia Street</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vancouver, BC V6E 4N7</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Neither the Canadian Securities Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cautionary Statement Regarding \"Forward-Looking\" Information</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This news release includes certain statements that may be deemed \"forward-looking statements\".

(OTCQB:UNIB) announced that it had an unaudited net income attributable to University Bancorp, Inc. (\"UNIB\") common stock shareholders in 3Q2024 of $4,371,716 $0.85 per share on average shares outstanding of 5,169,518 for the third quarter, versus an unaudited net income of $2,744,480.07, $0.53 per share on average shares outstanding of 5,169,518 for 3Q2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the 9 months ended September 30, 2025, net income was $5,535,896 $1.19 per share on average shares outstanding of 5,169,518 for the period, versus $7,913,973.04, $1.53 per share on average shares outstanding of 5,169,518 for the 9 months ended September 30, 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the 12 months ended September 30, 2025, net income was $8,640,829, $1.67 per share on average shares outstanding of 5,169,518 for the period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shareholders' equity attributable to University Bancorp, Inc. common stock shareholders was $98,317,450 or $19.02 per share, based on shares outstanding at September 30, 2025 of 5,169,518.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>President Stephen Lange Ranzini noted, \"In late 2024, University Bank's shareholders' equity passed $100 million for the first time, and in October 2025, UNIB's shareholders' equity also passed $100 million for the first time. This milestone is a remarkable achievement, considering that our predecessor corporation, Newberry Bancorp, started with $1,500,000 shareholders' equity in July 1988, and UNIB brought just $400,000 of shareholders' equity to the merger of the two entities in early 1990.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Return on Equity (ROE) at University Bancorp continues at acceptable levels, despite mortgage originations nationwide continuing to be at 30-year lows with respect to units originated, with the annualized ROE for the TTM ended September 30, 2025 being 9.4% on initial shareholders' equity of $91,925,253.43 at September 30, 2024. To provide some perspective on the mortgage origination industry's long-term cycles and where we are at in that cycle, here is a chart from the Mortgage Bankers Association:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Overall, our business development efforts continue at a rapid pace. For example, faith-based deposits have grown past $145 million, and on October 1st, we rolled out a new product that enables the automatic sweep of idle balances in brokerage firms into and out of our faith based deposit products. University Bank is now licensed for conventional mortgage lending, reverse mortgage lending and home equity lending in all 50 states. We have completed the rollout of our 1st Mortgage HELOC program in all 47 states where we intend to introduce the product, and are now working on rolling out a home equity lending program in 47 states, with the loans being sold to the secondary market and subserviced by our Midwest Loan Services division. In addition to product extensions and geographical expansion of our existing product suite, we are working on closing four small acquisitions, pending regulatory approvals, which will expand our core banking, insurance and wealth management businesses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earnings in 4Q2025 will be positively impacted by a sale of about $84 million of portfolio loans in two transactions, designed to keep University Bank's total assets under $1 billion as of year-end 2025, to avoid additional regulatory requirements and expenses that would kick in if our total assets were over $1 billion as of a year-end.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At 9/30/2025 cash &amp; equity investment securities at UNIB, available to meet working capital needs and to support investment opportunities at UNIB were $26.0 million. UNIB also was recently approved for a $12.5 million line of credit on which we are in the process of working towards a legal closing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A portion of UNIB's working capital, $18.3 million, has been invested in a portfolio of publicly traded financial services related investments. At 9/30/2025, two of these investments were large:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Currency Exchange International (Symbol CURN), a Canadian bank holding company that specializes in foreign exchange, of which we own 12.41%, 762,339 shares of common stock at an average price per share of $13.38. The firm is trading at about 6x EBIT adjusted for the now completed exit from their unprofitable Canadian business, however in our opinion it is worth 10x EBIT or $30 per share, and it is a growing business.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Pulsar Helium (Symbol PSRHF), of which we own 4.999% of the common stock, 7,505,265 shares at an average price per share of $0.45. Pulsar Helium probably has between $42 million to $210 million of Helium-3, an unique resource that is very useful for producing electricity from fusion reactors. While Helium-3 is available on the Moon, Pulsar has the only commercially viable deposit of Helium-3 known on Earth. The estimated range for Helium-4 in its reservoir is in our opinion probably $1 billion to $5 billion. The range for CO2 in its reservoir is probably $0.5 billion to $2.5 billion. All production costs and the cost of separating the gas produced from Pulsar's reservoir is expected to be offset by the sale of the CO2 to the food processing industry, or to a new use, cooling for AI Data Centers, a superior alternative to using large amounts of water, which is meeting with political resistance. There is a 20% mineral rights royalty payable on all production . Between shares outstanding and options / warrants that are in the money that are expected to be exercised shortly, the company has about 165 million shares outstanding. At the current share price of US$0.581 the market capitalization of the company, which currently has no debt and sufficient cash on hand to get to production in under two years with a project finance loan, is $96 million. The value of the company is probably between $600 million and $3 billion, or $3.64 to $18.18 per share. Of note, at 9/30/2025 our Pulsar Helium shares were marked to market at $0.32 per share, and they closed today at $0.581 per share.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Other Key statistics as of 9/30/2025:</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td rowspan=\"1\"><span>TTM Revenue</span></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>$</span></p></td><td colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"\"><span>135,074,269</span></p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>10 Year Average ROE</span></td><td></td><td colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"\"><span>26.6</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>%</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><span>5 Year Average ROE</span></td><td></td><td colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"\"><span>15.1</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>%</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><span>Current Ratio, #</span></td><td></td><td colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"\"><span>397.4</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>x</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><span>Efficiency Ratio, %+</span></td><td></td><td colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"\"><span>86.2</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>%</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><span>Total Consolidated Assets</span></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>$</span></p></td><td colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"\"><span>1,158,646,487</span></p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><span>TTM ROA%</span></td><td></td><td colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"\"><span>0.86</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>%</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><span>TCE/TA %</span></td><td></td><td colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"\"><span>9.07</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>%</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><span>NPAs/Assets %</span></td><td></td><td colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"\"><span>0.57</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>%</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><span>Texas Ratio %</span></td><td></td><td colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"\"><span>8.36</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>%</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><span>NIM %</span></td><td></td><td colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"\"><span>4.22</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>%</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><span>NCOs/Loans</span></td><td></td><td colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"\"><span>0.001</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>%</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><span>Trailing 12 Months P-E Ratiox</span></td><td></td><td colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"\"><span>10.1</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>x</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><span>Price to Book Value Ratiox</span></td><td></td><td colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"\"><span>89</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>%</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Treasury Shares</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>37,381 shares</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>#Parent company only current assets divided by 12-month projected cash expenses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>+Calculated as: (non-interest expense/ (net interest income + non-interest income)).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>xBased on last sale of $16.85 per share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Excluding goodwill &amp; other intangibles related to the acquisition of Midwest Loan Services and Ann Arbor Insurance Center, net tangible shareholders' equity attributable to University Bancorp, Inc. common stock shareholders was $97,724,240 or $18.90 per share at 9/30/2025.
