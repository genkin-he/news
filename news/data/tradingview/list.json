This momentum continued in the third quarter as same-store sales grew by 15%. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both figures suggest that Bitcoiners comprise only a small (but growing) percentage of their customer base and sales, meaning Bitcoin accumulation will likely be slow compared to Bitcoin-focused treasury companies or Bitcoin miners. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are, of course, other benefits to accepting Bitcoin.

At the same time, we continued to diversify into Oceania, South America, and Africa to offset market headwinds in Asia, North America, and Europe. During this period, our total revenue increased by 27.43%, driven by a 51.89% surge in domestic sales and new customer acquisitions from the emerging markets. As global disruptions and uncertainties gradually subside, we believe our solid sales base will support a strong rebound, providing a renewed springboard for future growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"During this period, we increased research and development spending by 53.50% to advance production process technologies, customization capabilities. To address rising material, labor and bad-debt costs, we adopted a volume-first strategy to expand market share and better absorb fixed costs. While this temporarily compressed our margins, we view it as a strategic short-term trade-off that does not diminish our underlying profitability potential.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Furthermore, our successful Nasdaq IPO in July 2025 has strengthened our balance sheet and enhanced our capital resources to pursue additional strategic initiatives and market opportunities. As personalization and customization evolve from niche segments into mainstream consumer trends, we believe that our business is well positioned to leverage flexible pricing, expand value-added services, and enter a virtuous growth cycle, supported by our diversified market reach, growing product suite, accumulated technological expertise, and enhanced capital base.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Looking ahead, our current strategy, anchored in continuous product and technology innovation, will remain as the foundation for sustainable growth and global expansion, particularly in the North America market. We will continue to invest in R&amp;D while maintaining strict cost-efficiency measures to execute this strategy efficiently, supporting long-term shareholder value, even amid a macroeconomic environment of both headwinds and tailwinds.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>First Half of Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Revenue</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Revenue was $12.40 million for the first half of fiscal year 2025, representing an increase of 27.43% from $9.73 million for the same period of last year. The increase was primarily attributable to an approximately $3.91 million increase in sales in mainland China, and partially offset by the decrease of approximately $1.18 million in sales in Asia (excluding mainland China). The increase in revenue in mainland China and the decrease in other Asian markets were mainly due to uncertainties in overseas markets, where customers' demand and consumption prospects remained relatively weak, leading the Company to strengthen its domestic sales initiatives, such as increasing participation in trade fairs and promotional events, expanding direct marketing and business negotiations with key customers, and adopting more competitive pricing to strengthen its market position in mainland China.</span></p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><span> </span><br/><span>                         For the Six Months </span><br/><span>                               Ended           For the Six Months Ended </span><br/><span>--------------------- </span><br/><span>                           April 30, 2025           April 30, 2024                Change </span><br/><span>---------------------  ----------------------  ------------------------  ------------------------- </span><br/><span>                          Sales      As % of       Sales      As % of </span><br/><span>---------------------                                                                  ------- </span><br/><span>Country/Region           Amount       Sales       Amount      Sales         Amount          % </span><br/><span>---------------------  -----------  ---------  -------------  ---------  ------------  ----------- </span><br/><span> Mainland China        $11,459,301  92.38%      $  7,544,314  77.50%     $  3,914,987    51.89% </span><br/><span> Asia (excluding </span><br/><span>  mainland China)          371,784   3.00%         1,556,241  15.99%      (1,184,457)  (76.11)% </span><br/><span> North America              59,069   0.48%      `    123,884   1.27%         (64,815)  (52.32)% </span><br/><span> Europe                    427,115   3.44%           499,126   5.13%         (72,011)  (14.43)% </span><br/><span> Oceania                    39,715   0.32%             7,970   0.08%           31,745   398.31% </span><br/><span> South America              11,634   0.09%             2,468   0.03%            9,166   371.39% </span><br/><span> Africa                     35,616   0.29%                 -      -%           35,616   100.00% </span><br/><span>                        ----------  -----          ---------  ----- </span><br/><span> Total                 $12,404,234    100%      $  9,734,003    100%     $  2,670,231    27.43% </span><br/><span>                        ==========  =====          =========  ===== </span><br/><span> </span></pre><p class=\"\"><span>Cost of Revenue</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cost of revenue was $11.06 million for the first half of fiscal year 2025, representing an increase of 42.70% from $7.75 million for the same period of last year.

The economic trend of the industry is revealing. Although cyclical, the long-term trend is that we have pretty much deflated the industry. We lack creativity and line up at the farm-subsidy trough regularly when prices or competition gets \"too tough.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crop insurance is a classic example. It's much easier to raise corn when insured to provide a decent return on substandard farmland that is more suited to raising cattle. The result is that we have a shortage of beef and a surplus of corn. Getting Uncle Sam involved in the private sector? Be careful what you wish for.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thomas C.

Is It Too Close to the Sun?\" Up &amp; Down Wall Street, Oct. 24).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The problem with private equity is that buyouts with 3% interest rates don't make sense with rates over 7%. Previous investors (e.g., Harvard University) can't get their money back because no one can afford to pay the quoted prices (by the PE managers). The only solution is to sell these problems to the public; otherwise, a lot of Wall Street managers are going to see their bonuses disappear.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Robert Ray On Barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Know When to Fold 'Em</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To the Editor: On Oct. 23, Barron's announced that \" 24-Hour Stock Trading Is Coming — and Wall Street Isn't Ready.\" Well, neither am I.

He writes the Substack ne wsletter Fool Me Twice.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That Argentine President Javier Milei's right-wing party, La Libertad Avanza, swept parliamentary elections on Oct. 26 is a blessing to many. For U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, it means that a big gamble paid off. For U.S. taxpayers, it means that a $20 billion loan will probably get repaid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It might be an early death rattle for Argentina's Peronists, however. The populist, nationalist political bloc, which led the country into decades of economic crises, is officially waning. That will bring relief to investors and the many Argentine citizens who despise the hold the party has long held over the nation's political and economic life.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Argentina's history of default is well-known. Practically since it gained independence in 1816, it has been caught in an endless loop of boom, bust, devaluation, default, and inflation. Less appreciated is that Argentina is periodically gripped by an urge to reform its ways.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the global depression of the 1930s, Argentina's federal government managed not to default when many others did. In the 1990s, President Carlos Menem successfully lowered inflation and privatized many industries. After defaulting on foreign debt in 2001, the government managed to run fiscal surpluses for six years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But in each case, the Argentina people reverted to voting for politicians who overspent — and crisis returned. It happened again in 2019, when the reformist government of President Mauricio Macri was replaced with Peronist politicians. Argentina defaulted for a ninth time in mid-2020.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Milei, a former economist, promised to end this cycle. Running for election in 2023, he said: Don't believe politicians who blame our problems on foreign creditors, adding: We spend too much and print too much money. And then, waving around a chain saw, he said: The solution is to cut government.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Inflation was nearing 200%, and the country was exhausted by financial chaos. For the first time in my memory, the Argentines didn't vote for a good-looking candidate promising handouts. They voted for a scruffy guy in a leather jacket promising pain now, gain later.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There certainly has been pain. Milei's austerity plan hasn't had long to work. He has dramatically cut inflation, but growth and investment are trailing. There isn't yet light at the end of the tunnel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So, Milei and his supporters were fearful of this fall's election. In particular, they were afraid of a repeat of 2019, in which a bad showing of Macri's party in primary elections cratered financial markets, virtually handing the victory to his Peronist opposition before the actual vote. To eliminate this risk, Milei got Congress to suspend the primary. But Axel Kicillof, the Peronist governor of the very Peronist province of Buenos Aires, had a move of his own: He shifted his province's provincial elections up to Sept. 7 — seven weeks before the national midterms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kicillof's move had its desired effect. In the Buenos Aires election, the leading Peronist party, the Justicialists, won 47% of the popular vote. Milei's LLA party won just 33%. Markets panicked like it was 2019. The Argentine peso dropped more than 5%, Argentine 2035 sovereign bond yield rose 15%, and the country's flagship stock index, the Merval, dropped 10%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Enter grandmaster Bessent. Either Argentina would deplete its foreign reserves, free its currency into a huge devaluation, and the Peronists would win the midterm election, or the U.S. would lend Argentina sufficient currency to head off a shock devaluation. Bessent's bet — a $20 billion swap line — was risky. Milei might lose, and the U.S. might not get repaid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But Milei crushed the Peronists in the midterms. It was a reverse of the Buenos Aires vote: Milei's party won more than 40% of the vote and the Peronists just over 30%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Peronists are now at their weakest point in recent history. At their peak after the 2007 elections, they occupied the presidency and held about 60% of the seats in both chambers of Congress. They are now down to less than 40%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But a grim outcome for the Peronist movement bodes well for investors — and for the U.S. and the International Monetary Fund, each of which has tens of billions of dollars on the line.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For stock, bond, and foreign direct investors, Argentina now presents a wide-open field. The looming problem since 2023 has been the potential that the Peronists would come back and overspend, confiscate private businesses, extend capital controls, and default on debts. As these fears dissipate, asset prices, foreign investment, and gross-domestic-product growth should rise. In turn, the probability that Milei's reform program will be completed is much higher. A virtuous cycle has been unlocked.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nobody can say for sure if this is all sustainable. But one optimistic thought is that the Peronist party's collapse in October could be a failure from which it may never come back. It isn't dead yet: Too many individuals and organizations are wedded to its beliefs. But, for the first time, we can contemplate its slow relegation to political irrelevancy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What would cement the case for that would be for Milei to triumph at the ballot box in 2027. Investors in Argentine assets should hope for that.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors from outside the Barron's newsroom.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Steven M. Sears</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financially savvy people with substantial wealth ultimately discover that managing tax liabilities is as important — and maybe even more so — than making money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By proactively managing taxes, it is possible to reduce the amount of money paid to the U.S. government, which, of course, increases the amount of money that one keeps. This is why sophisticated investors rely on financial advisors, accountants, and tax lawyers, who often work in concert.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aside from generation-skipping trusts and other estate-planning tools that shield a family's hard-earned assets, there is a simple strategy that anyone can and should use each year: doubling down on high-conviction stocks that have stumbled.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The strategy entails reviewing your stock positions and identifying shares that are trading for less than their original purchase price. Once you complete that portfolio review, buy a corresponding number of shares at the current market price and then wait 31 days.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After that period, you can sell the original batch of stock and register a realized loss on your taxes — the difference between the initial purchase price and the sales price. At the same time, the cost basis of the stock is reset to the price of the second batch of stock, which raises the odds of paying lower taxes when you ultimately liquidate the position.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is critical that an investor holds both positions for 31 days. If the stock is sold before 31 days have passed, the transaction violates the Internal Revenue Service's so-called wash-sale rule. When that happens, the tax loss isn't allowed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deadline for doubling down without violating the wash-sale rule is Nov. 28, according to Michael Schwartz, Oppenheimer &amp; Co.'s chief options strategist.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anyone who is interested in this strategy should consult their accountant and tax advisor. It is important that tax professionals are aware of what is happening in a client's investment portfolio.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The double-down strategy isn't suitable for all stocks. It is best used when a favored, high-conviction equity has run into trouble and tumbled lower.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Because there is risk in doubling down on a fallen stock, Schwartz favors using call options in case the stock never recovers. Call options, which represent 100 shares of the associated stock, increase when stock prices rise. Calls are often used as stock proxies whenever investors want to establish investment exposure to an idea or stock without using a lot of money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Options always cost less money than buying the associated stock. One drawback, however, is that stock dividends, if applicable, aren't enjoyed by options investors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consider Chipotle Mexican Grill, a popular choice for those who crave healthy foods prepared quickly. The stock has ranged from $38.30 to $66.74 over the past 52 weeks. After getting slammed in Thursday trading, it was hovering at $32.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company recently approved a $500 million stock buyback, but investors remain concerned about weak earnings and high valuations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bullish investors who bought the stock higher and want to reset the stock price could buy a December $36 call that expires in 2026. After 31 days, the original stock position with a higher cost basis could be sold to record a tax loss.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Any gains on the option would be treated as long-term capital gains, assuming you hold it for more than a year and sell it before it expires, Schwartz says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the stock fails to rally and remains below the call strike price, the trade fails. The money spent on the call would be lost.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The only solace is that calls cost less than buying the equivalent number of shares, so not as much money is at risk — which is why this tax strategy lends itself to options.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Email: editors@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",

The data fog is due to the government shutdown, now in its fifth week and on track to beat longevity records.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While shutdowns typically exert a temporary drag of 0.1% to 0.2% on GDP growth for every week that they are on, activity mostly recovers after the shutdown ends. Any stock market disruption has also been short lived. This partly explains why the current government shutdown has turned mostly into a background noise for markets. More than that, alternative data show that economic momentum has remained positive in the second half of 2025, supporting our view of no recession in the near term...</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Dallas Fed Weekly Economic Index, which tracks weekly changes in consumer behavior, the labor market, and production, and is scaled to the year over year change in real GDP, implies growth of 2% to 2.5% in Q3 and so far in Q4.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Veneta Dimitrova</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sunny Season for Stocks</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paulsen Perspectives Oct. 30: The S&amp;P 500 is at an all-time high. Nonetheless, historical stock market seasonals are suggesting the S&amp;P 500 may continue rising at least until next summer. Positive seasonals are comforting but are far from infallible. While not definitive, they do provide a nice foundation for stock investors headed into the winter months — particularly when economic policies are becoming more accommodative, S&amp;P 500 earnings momentum remains strong, stock market participation seems to be broadening, and valuations outside of new-era names still remain relatively attractive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Confidence on Main Street remains near record lows, suggesting there is still considerable room for pessimism and fear to abate and be replaced by rising confidence, fueling both economic and stock market successes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jim Paulsen</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Housing Trends Are Troubling</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Early Morning With Dave Rosenberg Research rosenbergresearch.com@substack.com Oct. 30: As the equity market gets propelled by the relentless AI trade, not every sector is joining in on the party. The Homebuilding stocks have rolled over by more than 16% from September highs, even with lower mortgage rates. The Residential REITs sector has slumped to an 18-month low and is back into an official bear market (down by almost -22% from the nearby peak). Rates are lower, but it is the reason they are lower that matters: cracks emerging in the labor market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Significant incentives weren't enough to prevent the likes of D.R. Horton from reporting a decline in its quarterly profits, with the builder's gross margin on home sales slipping to 20% from 21.8% in the past quarter, with average prices deflating by -3% from year-ago levels. This is an industry-wide phenomenon. [There are] stagnant home sales, economic uncertainty, aggressive incentive campaigns (add on mortgage buydowns), and price discounts. Tech doesn't need job creation — but housing does.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adding insult to injury was the news that pending home sales in September, a bellwether leading indicator, came in flat versus a consensus forecast of 1.2%. At a depressed 74.8 reading, it lines up in the bottom 7% of all time and it really says something that it is lower today than at the depths of the housing-induced recession in November 2008.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>David Rosenberg</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Improving Outlook for Oil</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investment Commentary Wells Fargo Investment Institute Oct. 27: Last week, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil traded near the 2025 low in the mid-$50s before U.S. sanctions on Russian oil producers caused a late-week spike...</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What now? We believe a modest softening of the economy in the near term, combined with OPEC+'s seemingly aggressive intention of adding oil supply, will keep oil prices under pressure in the coming months. However, we believe this supply deluge will eventually ease. WTI oil prices are below the $65 average breakeven cost for new oil wells in the U.S. This suggests that U.S. oil production growth will likely stall, as it becomes unprofitable for an increasing number of domestic oil producers to drill new wells as oil prices decline further. Additionally, the OPEC+ campaign to increase production is on track to conclude in 2026, notably tightening the global oil-supply spigot.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking through to year-end 2026, we forecast the improving supply outlook, coupled with a reaccelerating economy, will push WTI oil prices into our target range of $65 to $75 per barrel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Austin Pickle</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>10 Dividend \"Cushions\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sector Watch CFRA Oct. 27: The S&amp;P 500 is trading at a price/earnings ratio of 24 times next-12-month earnings projections, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ. This is a 42% premium to its 20-year average and more than two standard deviations above the long-term mean. The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology sector trades at a 66% premium to its 20-year average, while Communication Services (43%), Consumer Discretionary (41%), and Industrials (47%) also trade at extremes to their long-term averages...</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors concerned about a possible pullback in prices might want to look to dividends as correction cushions. Granted, not all high-yielding stocks are worth buying. Like blades of grass that stick up too far and end up being trimmed back, stocks may sport elevated yields due to unsustainable payout ratios (dividends as a percent of earnings) that may get reduced, possibly trimming the stock price along the way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here are 10 of the highest yielding stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with [Buy or Strong Buy] rankings by CFRA analysts, with dividend payout ratios of 75% or lower: Comcast, EOG Resources, Exxon Mobil, Hasbro, Invesco, Merck, Omnicom Group, Target, J.

            "title": "Income Investing: Want High Yields? Have a Look at Mortgage REITs. — Barron's",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Amey Stone</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you need current income and are concerned that interest rates are headed lower, take a look at mortgage real estate investment trusts, or mREITs. Don't back up the truck, but with yields of 14% or more, a little can go a long way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MREITs are publicly traded companies that manage pools of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. They can focus on residential or commercial mortgages, or a specific region. They live in the esoteric world of high-yielding, often highly leveraged income plays like business development companies, or BDCs, and closed-end funds. That leverage allows them to pay out far more in dividends, typically monthly, than the mortgage income they collect.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The biggest mREITs are Annaly Capital Management (NLY) and AGNC Investment (AGNC), which both yield 14%. They trade at a premium to their book value per share, which suggests it isn't a great time to jump in, but that's just one of many factors to weigh. Perhaps more salient: MREITs tend to get a tailwind when the Federal Reserve lowers rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But make no mistake, these income plays are very complex and can be volatile. They generally trade based on the spread mortgages earn over Treasury yields (the wider the better). Like banks, they usually benefit from a steep yield curve so they can borrow at lower rates and lend at higher rates, improving their net interest margin. The yield curve steepened this year, but predicting what the Fed will do next is no easy task.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MREITs stumbled about 1% on Wednesday when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said investors shouldn't count on a December rate cut. In March through early April, mREITs fell about 20% due to worries that the Fed would be reducing MBS held on its balance sheet and that the federal government might not maintain its implicit guarantee of agency MBS, and because of economic pain set off by tariffs. The yield spread on MBS got very wide and then came back in as the mortgage market recovered, but is still wider than historically, says Peter Federico, CEO of AGNC.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fact is, it's truly hard to predict how mREITs will perform based on interest rates or the real estate market because they are highly complex and can deploy a variety of hedges. That's the main argument for buying a passive vehicle, says Coulter Regal, a product manager at VanEck Funds. \"If you're not willing to do a deep dive into individual mREITs, we think a broad basket is a great way to get access to the whole industry,\" Regal adds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are two main index exchange-traded funds. The iShares Mortgage Real Estate (REM) yields 8.4% and has returned 9.5% year to date. VanEck Mortgage REIT Income (MORT) has returned 7.7% year to date and yields 13%. Annaly, AGNC, and Starwood Property Trust (STWD) make up more than a third of each fund.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mark Grant, chief global strategist at Colliers Securities, argues that mREITs' monthly income stream matters more than fluctuations in stock prices. He highlights three that focus on residential mortgages: AGNC; Armour Residential REIT (ARR), which yields 18%; and Orchid Island Capital (ORC), which yields 19%. My colleague Paul R. La Monica recently covered 9% yielder Rithm Capital (RITM), which focuses on the recovering office market and is the fourth largest holding in Van Eck's mREIT ETF.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Federico says lower mortgage rates could boost the value of AGNC's long-duration holdings (since fixed-income prices move inversely to interest rates). But if mortgage rates fall too fast, prepayments could crimp the value of existing MBS. He's encouraged that the federal government reaffirmed its implicit guarantee of agency mortgages earlier this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is a fascinating time in our market,\" he says. \"There are so many crosscurrents.\" For him that's fun. Investors who like to stay atop trends and earn double-digit yields might find it gratifying, too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Amey Stone at amey.stone@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Lewis Braham</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's hard to imagine anyone taking Warren Buffett's place. But at 95, the investing legend is retiring as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at year end. And with the once-sleepy textile company he acquired in 1965 now a trillion-dollar conglomerate, it will be difficult for even the savviest successor to maneuver such a behemoth to trounce the market like Buffett once did.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While Barron's has identified conglomerates such as Fairfax Financial Holdings that mimic the company's business structure as \" Berkshire Hathaway wannabes,\" there are also fund managers who have successfully emulated Buffett's investment style. Their funds have key features — concentrated portfolios, both value and quality factors, and good corporate governance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As Buffett once described his strategy: \"Keep all your eggs in one basket, but watch that basket closely.\" With a plethora of index funds holding hundreds of stocks, Buffett's concentrated active style is becoming increasingly rare. \"If you want to get a result that's different than the index, you can't look like the index, which means you're going to have different weightings,\" says Chris Davis, manager of the Davis Select U.S. Equity exchange-traded fund, which recently held just 26 stocks. \"But you can get a lot of diversification with 25 or 30 stocks.\" Davis isn't just a Buffett fan; he's on Berkshire's board of directors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One risk of such concentration is \"lumpy\" returns that differ widely from the index, both for better and worse. That's something fund investors interested in Buffett's style must accept. But they shouldn't tolerate another risk — individual company blowups, which fail the \"watch that basket\" concentration test. Infamously, the Sequoia Fund, which Buffett himself once championed, imploded when its portfolio stake in Valeant Pharmaceuticals grew to over 30% in 2015 and the stock subsequently collapsed during a regulatory investigation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Davis rarely lets a position in his portfolio grow above 10%. But he points out that owning a large stake in a conglomerate like Berkshire, which Sequoia did successfully for many years, is different than owning Valeant, as Berkshire is more diversified within its business lines and thus more resilient to downturns. That resilience is further strengthened by Buffett's focus on high-quality businesses with consistent cash flows, strong balance sheets, and what Buffett calls \"economic moats.\" Having a moat requires a durable business model with features that thwart competitors, such as patents, a strong brand name, and monopolistic control.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The so-called quality factor captures some of this strategy quantitatively. Morningstar defines it as a combination of a company's 12-month return on equity and its debt-to-capital ratios, favoring high cash flow and low debt. (The lower the quality rating's number, from 1 to 100, the better.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One top-performing concentrated fund with 24 stocks and a strong Morningstar quality rating is FullerThaler Behavioral Unconstrained Equity. Manager Raymond Lin seeks overlooked stocks suffering from investors' cognitive biases, meaning that the market underreacts to good news or overreacts to bad. But the companies should also be Buffett's kind of durable businesses to survive a bad economy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If we really want to see a clear example of underreaction or overreaction, and we are very strict about these downside [protection] criteria — where we want oligopolies and monopolies that have positive free cash flow and low levels of debt — we're not talking about a large group of companies that can meet all of those criteria,\" Lin says. \"So, what we found is 20 to 30 holdings is really the optimal number.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Of course, Buffett is also a famous value investor, but it's increasingly hard to buy high-quality companies cheaply today. Most concentrated funds tend to tilt in one direction — toward value or quality. Yet the savviest value managers see durable businesses that don't score as well quality-wise as current tech darlings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One such Buffett heir is manager Bill Nygren of the Oakmark and Oakmark Select mutual funds and the recently launched Oakmark U.S. Large Cap ETF. He often finds high-quality businesses in sectors that overall are considered more cyclical and lower-quality than tech. For this reason, an oil company like Phillips 66, with a price/earnings ratio of 13, sits beside search-engine giant Alphabet, with a 25 P/E, in his funds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Phillips 66 is a very high-quality midstream and [oil] refining business, but the businesses themselves are never going to be viewed as being as great as Alphabet's, and we're fine with that,\" Nygren says. He likes owning resilient companies like Phillips when the entire oil sector is cyclically out of favor and waiting for a recovery.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interestingly, Nygren's less-concentrated Oakmark fund, which holds 54 stocks, has been the better performer over the past 15 years than Oakmark Select, which has 26 — indicating, perhaps, some of the risk of concentrating too much on more cyclical names. The new ETF could be the happy medium, holding 36 names. Another fund, Hotchkis &amp; Wiley Value Opportunities, has also succeeded by combining high-quality tech with more cyclical but resilient value stocks. It holds 60 stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tilting more toward quality than value is GMO U.S. Quality. It holds 36 stocks but has a hefty 41% tech weighting and a 22 portfolio P/E, versus the Oakmark ETF's 13. But like Buffett did with his Coca-Cola position in the 1980s, GMO manager Tom Hancock recognizes the \"intangible value\" of companies with intellectual property and strong brands like Microsoft and Meta Platforms that traditional valuation metrics can't capture. \"These great companies tend to do better over time than you might think, \" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>True, but it seems doubtful anyone will ever match Buffett's record in a market where the best companies aren't cheap.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to editors@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>The AI rally has many investors wondering where to turn in anticipation of its end. The medical-device maker is one solid option. By Jacob Sonenshine</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors seeking a stock unrelated to artificial intelligence should take a look at Boston Scientific.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The historic rally in everything AI has inevitably led to thoughts about how the whole thing will end. Maybe some companies' earnings will disappoint the market? Or maybe something more widespread will occur, like Big Tech significantly reducing its spending expectations? The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has seen several days when it was deeply in the red recently, which could foreshadow a true drawdown if any of these — or other — risks emerge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With all this in mind, we look to medical-device makers. These companies are constantly enhancing their products to help improve patients' health. For example, Intuitive Surgical's new versions of its robotic surgery machines have helped the stock rise 23% in the past month, and Abbott Laboratories' newest glucose-monitoring device has brought its stock close to new highs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In cardiac health, innovative products are giving surgeons more confidence in their decisions to operate. Spending on cardiac procedures in the U.S. is expected to grow at just over 7% annually through 2030, to about $92 billion, driven mostly by an aging population, according to Grand View Research.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Boston Scientific is at the heart of it. Of its $20 billion in 2025 sales forecast by analysts, $13 billion is expected to come from its cardiovascular segment, up 23% year over year, according to FactSet. Some of that is because of small acquisitions and currency fluctuations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, not all the growth is priced into the stock, which is trading at $100, even after its recent rally. Analysts are forecasting a 13% increase in sales of cardiovascular products next year, to $14.9 billion. The company said at its September investor day that it expects low-double digit growth over the long term as it takes market share. Analysts aren't doubting that right now, especially after the company continued its record of beating quarterly earnings estimates on Oct. 22, with greater-than-expected cardio revenue in the third quarter amid larger-than-anticipated sales across every segment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Part of the cardio growth story is the Watchman product, a small implant that closes the left atrial appendage of patients with atrial fibrillation, or AF. This product is intended for patients who can't take blood thinners to stop blood clots. Watchman lowers the likelihood of blood clots, in turn reducing the risk of stroke.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Watchman sales grew 35% in the third quarter, reaching over 600,000 patients, or 12% of the five million total addressable market estimated by the company. The implant is preferred right now versus Abbott Laboratories' competing product, Amplatzer, judging by hospital purchases. Roughly 90% of their purchases of AF products are for Watchman implants, according to a physician survey from BTIG analyst Marie Thibault.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That isn't a surprise. The American College of Cardiology, a group of professionals that publishes medical journals, concluded Watchman has caused fewer postprocedural medical complications and is currently the safer product.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That story could continue in the first half of 2026, when Boston Scientific releases results of its Champion-AF trial. This clinical trial, reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration, will publish results for Watchman FLX, the latest version of its heart implant. FLX aims to improve the healing process and close larger appendages. Positive results on its effectiveness and safety would underscore Boston Scientific's ability to continue to grow its presence with heart surgeons — and potentially spark stock gains.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Watchman isn't the only avenue through which Boston Scientific can protect its competitiveness. With large profit margins and hefty free cash flow — an expected $3.4 billion this year, and growing — the company has acquired dozens of small companies over the years. An example: It bought Elutia's BioEnvelope business for $88 million in September. Elutia sells small materials that protect cardiac patients from postoperative complications, such as infection. It's the type of deal that allows Boston Scientific to package multiple products in its offerings to surgeons, providing a competitive advantage.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Acquisitions are also instrumental in the other areas of Boston Scientific's business, including medical surgical, or MedSurg, which analysts expect to grow close to 10% annually over the long term. A subsegment of that business is urology, for which the company bought Axonics for $3.7 billion in 2024. Axonics makes an implantable device that treats bowel and bladder conditions, such as overactive bladder.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Urology sales could reaccelerate next year, CEO Mike Mahoney said on the third-quarter earnings call. Sales were interrupted after Medtronic asked the International Trade Commission to block the sale of the products over alleged patent infringements. Late last year, a jury found that Axonics didn't infringe on Medtronic's patents for competitive products. The companies reached a settlement, and Axonics products are selling without restrictions again. Management expects improving growth over the course of 2026, another potential catalyst that could unlock more confidence from the market — and stock gains.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Overall, Boston Scientific could grow total sales by 11% in 2026 to $23.4 billion, according to FactSet. Sustaining such growth can bring profit margins a touch higher over time, as it can outpace the increase in operating expenses such as employee compensation and depreciation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This would spur midteen earnings per share growth annually over the long term, especially as Boston Scientific continues to repurchase shares and onboard acquisitions. The company says it will prioritize deals over buybacks, but the deals will increase EPS if they are accretive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Given management's tendency to do deals and deliver higher-than-expected growth, EPS growth could approach 20% annually, says Andrew Choi, a portfolio manager at Parnassus Investments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That would pump the stock higher, partly because it isn't as expensive as it could be. Shares trade at 30 times expected EPS for the coming 12 months, below its peak of 36 times this year and just a 20% premium versus the iShares U.S. Medical Devices exchange-traded fund's 24.9 times. When Boston Scientific shares hit peaks this year, the premium was 28%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So, the stock could trade at a larger earnings multiple — and benefit from higher earnings, particularly as the market sees continued evidence that Boston Scientific can continue to take market share. \"If they do 11% [sales growth], there's a path toward value creation\" for shareholders, says Choi.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This doesn't mean there aren't risks: The Champion-AF trial results for Watchman could disappoint, pressuring expectations for Watchman demand, or Abbott could significantly improve Amplatzer's safety.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We doubt those risks will materialize, a key reason being that Boston Scientific can spend a lot of money on research and development to keep its offerings competitive. Analysts expect almost $2 billion of such spend this year, close to Abbott's $2.8 billion. But Abbott has to spread that spending across far more businesses, including diabetes care, while Boston can use most of that money to focus on heart-related care.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the whole, Boston Scientific demonstrates an excellent risk/reward scenario for patients — and for those who want to buy the stock.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Share your questions and thoughts in the \"Conversation\" section below to   engage directly with the author and our community   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Receive alerts about more content from this author by clicking \"Follow\"   next to the author byline at top   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Stay tuned for the next live Q&amp;A!

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Megan Leonhardt</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of the best views of waves breaking off Maine's rugged coast can be seen from Ogunquit's Marginal Way, a coastal cliff walk in the southern part of the state. But storms and erosion have taken a toll, threatening the structural integrity of the roughly 1.5-mile trail. Erosion, by its nature, can weaken foundations over time, leading them to crumble under pressure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. labor market looks to be undergoing a similar sort of erosion, with hiring stalled as employers weigh months of economic and policy uncertainty. Yet, while conditions may not be as \"stable\" as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated this past week, there are indications the market's foundation is much stronger than that of Marginal Way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For one, the number of people filing for unemployment benefits hasn't shot up, at least not yet. The Labor Department hasn't released official estimates of weekly initial jobless-claim volumes since early October, due to the government shutdown, which began Oct. 1. But Citigroup economists estimate on the basis of available state data that initial jobless claims fell to 220,000 filings for the week of Oct. 25 from 232,000 in the prior week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That alone signals the number of Americans losing their jobs, even in the midst of a government shutdown, hasn't reached alarming levels. Mike Reid, senior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, credits healthy corporate fundamentals, noting that profit growth was strong in the third quarter. Reid says he would be concerned if weekly claims rise above 275,000.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Higher-income households, bolstered by stock market and home-equity gains, have continued to spend, boosting corporate revenue and earnings and driving broader economic growth. Bank of America reports that total credit-card spending per household rose 0.8% in the year ended Oct. 25. That has helped keep employment in the retailing business \"surprisingly stable\" in recent months, says Lisa Simon, chief economist at Revelio Labs, which maintains a workforce database.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Moreover, more small businesses said in the latest National Federation of Independent Businesses survey that they are planning to hire. The hospitality sector posted the strongest rebound in hiring in October, with monthly payroll growth up 13.8%, breaking a two-year pattern of October declines, according to data from Homebase — a provider of employee management software to about 150,000 small businesses, which collectively employ about two million people. The transportation and logistics sector recorded monthly payroll gains of 4.8% in the month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Education and healthcare, which have driven much of the job growth this year, likely will continue to add jobs as well, Revelio's Simon says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Private payrolls, in general, may have ticked higher in recent weeks. ADP reported on Tuesday that total private employment grew by a four-week moving average of 14,250 jobs in the week ended Oct. 11, up from a four-week average gain of 10,750 jobs in the week ended Oct. 4.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The pickup suggests that the hiring freeze that has plagued much of the labor market in recent months may be easing, although the recovery is \"tepid,\" says ADP chief economist Nela Richardson. She cautioned that the weekly pulse data are estimates and that recent hiring patterns have been volatile week to week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To be sure, the job market isn't as robust as it was a year ago, or even back in April — and the risk of more layoffs shouldn't be discounted. Data from Indeed, a leading job-search website, show that job-posting levels are trending down month over month in nearly every industry sector, even though posting levels in the aggregate are still 2% above a prepandemic baseline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Small businesses, which employ nearly half of all U.S. private sector employees, have been especially conservative in their hiring decisions. Only three of 13 industries showed positive momentum in October on a smoothed three-month basis, Homebase noted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We probably have hit the bottom in terms of the deceleration of employment growth,\" says Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But Uruci doesn't expect to see 100,000 monthly payroll additions again soon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon.com, General Motors, Paramount Skydance, and United Parcel Service all announced significant workforce reductions over the past week that collectively totaled more than 65,000 job cuts. So far, layoffs have been driven primarily by company or industry-specific issues.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the past year, town officials in Ogunquit approved plans to reinforce Marginal Way and fortify it against future erosion. So, too, the U.S. labor market can be shored up by continued consumer spending, business investment, and policies that promote economic growth. The latest layoff headlines sowed fears of a jobs recession, but the reality, so far, looks more encouraging.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Megan Leonhardt at megan.leonhardt@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
