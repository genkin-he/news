Barron's wrote recently that the new rate likely would be set at just over 4%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The new rate is based on the inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index from March through September, plus a fixed rate of 0.90% that remains in place for the life of the bonds, which can run as long as 30 years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The fixed rate is down from 1.1% for bonds issued over the past six months, reflecting a decline in market yields on Treasury inflation-protected securities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The rate on newly issued bonds will apply for the first six months that an investor holds them. The rate then resets every six months based on the annualized CPI rate plus the 0.9% fixed rate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I bonds can be redeemed after 12 months, but investors lose three months of interest if the bonds are cashed in before five years. I bonds were very popular in 2022, when inflation was running hot. The I bond rate was 9.6% from May through October that year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I bonds are available through the TreasuryDirect website. Individuals are limited to $10,000 in annual purchases.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Semiannual interest is added to the principal value of the bond, compounding over the life of the bond. This is a favorable feature because it eliminates risk on the reinvestment of interest. In comparison, Treasury notes and bonds make cash interest payments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another appealing feature of I bonds is that holders can defer paying taxes on the interest income until they redeem the bonds. This gives I bonds a quality like an individual retirement account.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interest is exempt from state and local income taxes but subject to federal income tax, which is the same as for Treasury notes and bonds. This makes I bond taxation more favorable than that for bank deposits, whose interest is subject to federal, state, and local income taxes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By JACK HOUGH</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you've lost the plot to the long-running tech drama \"Tesla,\" I have show notes. You'll want to get caught up ahead of next week's twist â€” and by \"twist,\" I don't mean a surprise but rather a wringing, in this case of a company by its shareholders. On Thursday, they'll probably vote to award CEO Elon Musk an unprecedented $1 trillion incentive package. Or is it a robo ransom? Here's what to know:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tesla isn't just a 23-year-old car maker whose production and profits peaked two years ago. It's also, as it says, a \"physical AI\" company â€” an early contender in two artificial-intelligence businesses that are as theoretically massive as they are barely existent. The first is operating robotic taxis. The second is deploying humanoid helpers to homes and businesses. These account for almost none of Tesla's current income, and most of its stock market value.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If it seems like the Tesla show has gone quiet recently, it's because its star, Elon Musk, has stepped out of the Washington, D.C., spotlight. Last spring, he was head of the Department of Government Efficiency, which found heaps of taxpayer savings, or barely any, depending on whose accounting you use. But he was neglecting Tesla, investors complained, and his smashmouth move into anti-left politics had rankled some leaf lovers who buy electric vehicles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It was a \"code red situation,\" wrote Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a Tesla super-bull, on April 20. \"Tesla's stock has been crushed\" amid \"potentially 15%-20% permanent demand destruction\" due to \"brand damage Musk has created with DOGE.\" Tesla's market value had been cut nearly by half in months, to $777 billion, below the ranks of the Magnificent Seven tech world-beaters. At the market's No. 10 spot, Tesla was sandwiched humiliatingly between an Arkansas mass merchant known for price rollbacks and an Indiana maker of obesity shots, and was a few spots behind a Nebraska investment conglomerate with stakes in reinsurance, wood flooring, and peanut brittle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then, Musk left DOGE and got out of politics. Mostly. There was a summer spat where Musk tweeted that he got President Donald Trump re-elected, and in a now-deleted post, claimed vaguely and without evidence that the president was mentioned in unreleased Jeffrey Epstein \"files.\" Musk was upset by the president's budget bill, which eliminated tax perks for electric-vehicle buyers. The episode passed, and so did the bill, yet Tesla's market value has plumped back up to $1.5 trillion. It would already be back in the Mag 7 if not for Broadcom recently Kramering into the group. Business conditions for Tesla are...better? Maybe worse. It's difficult to say. Third-quarter financial results were solid, but that was owed to an EV buying rush ahead of the September tax credit expiration. For October, JD Power predicts a 43% EV sales decline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>No matter. Tesla bulls and bears alike agree that car making today has little to do with the stock value. BofA Securities puts its contribution at 12%, plus another 17% for full self-driving, or FSD, a subscription service that for now provides \"more active guidance and assisted driving under your active supervision.\" Solar panels and related batteries account for 6% of Tesla's value, BofA reckons. The rest comes from Robotaxis, 45%, and Optimus humanoid robots, 19%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bull case for Tesla, set forth recently by Rob Wertheimer at Melius Research, who initiated coverage in mid-October at Buy, is that Musk is masterful at moving fast, including into AI data centers, and Tesla's expertise in \"touching the physical world\" separates it from other AI giants. It will \"wreck multitrillion-dollar industries,\" starting with cars. Valuation is \"guesswork,\" and Wertheimer's guess is $520 a share, versus a recent $440.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bear or neutral case is simply that it will be a long wait until the new businesses make money. FSD still isn't working as intended, and as long as that's the case, the Robotaxi business is likely to remain \"in park,\" writes William Stein at Truist Securities, who rates the stock at Hold. He assigns Tesla's Robotaxi business a valuation of $172 billion, which he notes is only modestly below the market value of Uber, even though Uber, which partners with autonomous-driving companies including Waymo, is more active in robo-taxi service today. Stein values the stock at $406.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's possible to envision marvelous things for Tesla and still be ho-hum on the stock. BofA recently tweaked its model of cash flows out to 2040 to reflect, among other things, a 40% long-term U.S. market share for Optimus, up from a prior 30%, with a penetration rate of 40% for manufacturing, and 20% for households. Count me in. I plan to use my unit mostly for high fives, and ask only for an AI Mel Blanc voice option that recalls Twiki from the old Buck Rogers in the 25th Century series. But even with BofA's ambitious market assumptions, it hiked its price target to a level that implies only 7% stock upside, and kept its rating at Neutral.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At Tesla's annual meeting on Nov. 6, shareholders will vote on stock bonuses for Musk that would take his stake from 13% to 25% if he hits ambitious goals. These include taking Tesla's market value over $8.5 trillion in a decade. For comparison, today's market leader, Nvidia, is worth $5 trillion. There are also operational milestones, from robot deliveries to earnings levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The plan will pass. Betting markets say so, along with key investors. Ives at Wedbush says he has a better chance of starting for the Yankees than the measure failing. If you don't follow New York sports, a Jets or Giants reference there would have left some ambiguity, but a Yankees one means that Musk will get his ransom. I mean performance plan.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Greater voting control is a deal breaker for Tesla's robot future, he made clear on the company's third-quarter earnings call. \"If I go ahead and build this enormous robot army, can I just be ousted at some point in the future?\" he asked. Without Musk and his robots, Tesla's valuation could collapse to that of today's cash-producing businesses â€” a catastrophic outcome. With Musk in place and chasing his record payday, grumpy valuation math can give way for now to open-ended optimism about Tesla's robo future.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Jack Hough at jack.hough@barrons.com.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Andrew Bary</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bank of America needs to up its game â€” and the banking giant is likely to unveil a blueprint for doing just that at its first investor day in nearly 15 years. It's time to consider making a deposit in BofA stock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bank of America will be holding an all-day investor event in Boston this coming Wednesday, and it will give investors a chance to hear from longtime CEO Brian Moynihan, newly appointed co-presidents Dean Athanasia and Jim DeMare, and other members of the leadership team.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The focus probably will be on growth and returns. While BofA stock has risen 21% this year, it lags behind rival JPMorgan Chase, which has gained 29% â€” a reflection, in part, of its lower returns, as measured by return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE. Moynihan looks set to outline how he hopes to close the gap on that key metric. The bank is likely to set a ROTCE target in the 16% to 18% range, up from the 14% so far this year and closer to JPMorgan's 21% return.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's a challenging task, but with one of the better earnings stories among top banks, the least-risky loan portfolio, and initiatives to boost returns, the bank has a good shot at hitting that target.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I expect higher growth, returns, and earnings,\" says Mike Mayo, the banking analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, who expects earnings growth of 13% next year to $4.35 a share before it rises as high as $6 a share in coming years. \"The question is not if, but when.\" He recently boosted his price target on Bank of America stock to $62 from $60, up 17% from a recent $53.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bank of America has a lot going for it. The company has one of the best franchises in banking, including the No. 2 consumer bank behind JPMorgan, a top five investment bank, and a leading wealth management arm led by Merrill Lynch. It's also a banking technology leader with the best virtual financial assistant in Erica, which has two million interactions a day with banking customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bank has also left a lot on the table. It's useful to compare it with JPMorgan, since the two companies have a similar business mix involving consumer banking, wealth management, commercial banking, investment banking, and trading. Since 2019, BofA's earnings are up by a third based on 2025 projections, while JPMorgan's have nearly doubled.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What's the problem? Mayo thinks the bank has been too timid, something that is reflected in the Federal Reserve's stress tests, with Bank of America showing the lowest losses relative to Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo in a downturn, thanks to the high credit quality of the bank's $1.2 trillion loan portfolio. But if Moynihan's mantra has been \"responsible growth,\" Mayo thinks it should pivot to \"more growth\" while maintaining appropriate safeguards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>BofA's credit-card loan portfolio, for instance, has been little changed over the past decade while JPMorgan and Capital One Financial have nearly doubled theirs. BofA hasn't chased co-branded credit-card deals as much as rivals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Its wealth management business has also lost some of its luster. Merrill Lynch used to be the dominant retail brokerage platform, but the business that was once known as the \"Thundering Herd\" for its bullish stance on America isn't making as much noise currently. Morgan Stanley now is the industry champ based on revenue, profits, and margins.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Over the past five years, Bank of America's wealth management revenue growth averaged 4% a year, against 8% for Morgan Stanley. Revenue growth did pick up to 8% this year. BofA's margins of 24% so far in 2025 were below Morgan Stanley's 29%. Morgan Stanley also has a better alternative-asset platform.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It hasn't helped investor sentiment that Berkshire Hathaway has steadily reduced its big stake in BofA by 40% since July 2024 to about 605 million shares, which are now worth over $30 billion. Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett hasn't said why he has reduced the stake, but he has soured on banks generally in the past five years, eliminating once-sizable holdings in Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs Group, JPMorgan, and Citigroup.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bank of America has also faced investor scrutiny over its poor decision to invest $500 billion in 2% U.S. agency mortgage securities at a historic low in rates, mostly in 2020 and 2021. That move has led to paper losses that stood at $71 billion on Sept. 30 and dampened the bank's interest margin as rates rose. Mayo calls that \"one of the worst mistakes under Moynihan's tenure,\" but, thankfully for the bank, accounting rules don't require the loss to be recognized in its capital position.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The good news is that the mortgage securities portfolio is slowly maturing, and that allows the bank to reinvest about $10 billion per quarter at yields that are two to three percentage points higher, helping to bolster its interest margin. The bank sees higher net interest income and margins in 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some of the bank's efforts have already started to pay off, with its third-quarter report showing a 31% gain in earnings to $1.06 a share. Bank of America pays a 2% dividend yield, in line with peers, and supplements that with about $20 billion annually in stock buybacks, for a total yield â€” dividends plus buybacks â€” of 7%. Mayo sees the possibility of even more share repurchases in the next two years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The investor day is also a chance for Moynihan, 66, to argue for more time as the head of the company. He wants to stay until the end of the decade, emulating JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, 69, who plans to remain at the helm for a few more years. Dimon deserves to stay, given the bank's superior performance and his industry stature; Moynihan's bid is less convincing, in light of the bank's mediocre showing. BofA stock has lagged behind shares of Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo over the past five years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Moynihan's efforts may depend on how well his investor day plan is received â€” and executed. He needs to turn the bank's performance from good to great to match peers, and there is the near-term risk that investors sell the stock on the investor day news since Wall Street is already anticipating good news. Still, at just 12.5 times 12-month forward earnings â€” below JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley â€” there's room for the stock to run if Moynihan gets it right.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mayo calls Bank of America the \"forgotten Goliath\" among the country's top banks. Moynihan has the chance to shed that label, deliver for investors, and keep the top job until 2030.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
