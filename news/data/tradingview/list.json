The company reported a solid performance despite challenging market conditions, driven by new business wins and strategic initiatives.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Financial Highlights</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>For the third quarter of 2025, Quaker Houghton reported net sales of $493.8 million, marking a 7% increase year-over-year. Organic sales volumes grew by 3%, bolstered by new business wins contributing approximately 5%. The company achieved a net income of $30.5 million, translating to earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $1.75. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $36.3 million, with non-GAAP EPS of $2.08, reflecting a 10% increase year-over-year.

The Americas and EMEA segments also saw improvements, although the Americas faced softer end market conditions.

The company also repurchased 29,791 shares for $3.8 million. These actions reflect the company's commitment to strengthening its balance sheet and returning value to shareholders.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Management's Perspective</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>Joe Berquist, Chief Executive Officer and President, commented, \"Third quarter results were strong, resulting from the team’s disciplined execution of our strategy. We achieved a 7% increase in sales on 3% organic volume growth, and a 5% improvement in adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, despite a softer than anticipated end market environment. Our performance was driven by new business wins of approximately 5% globally and amplified by continued momentum in Asia/Pacific.\"</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Future Outlook</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>Looking ahead, Quaker Houghton anticipates that the current soft market environment will persist through the end of the year, with normal seasonality expected. The company remains confident in its ability to convert its sales pipeline and execute ongoing cost and productivity initiatives.

Areddy and Yoko Kubota</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney spent much of his first six months in office trying to persuade the U.S. to lower tariffs on Canadian goods. With hopes for a speedy resolution now dashed, Carney is turning to America's biggest rival, China.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Carney is expected to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday at the APEC leaders summit in South Korea. It will be the first official meeting between the two countries' leaders since 2017, when Justin Trudeau was Canada's prime minister, and marks a significant thaw in a relationship that has been mired in acrimony for several years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Repairing relations with China has become a priority for Carney, who is seeking other markets to offset the damage caused by U.S. tariffs on Canadian exports like steel, aluminum and lumber. Canada is trying to reopen the Chinese market to agricultural products like canola oil, pork and seafood, on which China has imposed tariffs in retaliation for Canadian duties on its electric vehicles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is our second-largest trading partner. This is the second-largest economy in the world,\" said Carney on Monday, explaining why he thinks Canada needs a pragmatic approach to engagement with China. \"This is one of the most influential actors in terms of the global system such as it is, and it is a country with whom we had no senior-level contact for seven years.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The price of better relations with China may not be cheap. To get tariffs on agricultural exports lifted, China has demanded that Canada lower a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles. That would put Canada in the position of having to choose farmers over its auto industry, which would suffer if cheap Chinese vehicles came into the market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Give it to the Chinese, they are pretty good at weaponizing some of these relationships,\" said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels think tank.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the leaders of Canada's canola-producing provinces have supported the EV-for-canola tariff, Carney has so far been noncommittal. He cautioned that a deal with China on electric cars could hurt its dealings with the U.S. \"It's not that simple,\" he said, earlier this month. \"Nor is the relationship in the auto sector that simple as just open the door to China here with no impact on the relationship with the United States.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Canada has had little official contact with China since 2018, when Canada detained Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. request. China then arrested two Canadians, and it took a complex swap in 2021 to break the stalemate. Relations never fully recovered.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Canada has since accused China of interfering in its elections, restricted Chinese investments in infrastructure and mining projects and accused the country of acting as an \"increasingly disruptive global power\" in a report on Canada's Indo-Pacific strategy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China has appeared to seize on President Trump's arrival in the White House-and his tariffs and calls to turn Canada into the 51st state-as an opening to mend fences with Ottawa. Beijing responded positively to Justin Trudeau's exit as prime minister in March. In June, Carney spoke by telephone with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, and the two met in New York in September.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In recent months, Canada has begun exporting natural gas to China and referring to it as a \"strategic partner.\" Beijing has said there is \"positive momentum\" between the two countries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"They are facing the same pressure, the same sanctions, the same tactics and restrictions imposed by the U.S. unilaterally,\" Wang Huiyao, president of Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization, said of China and Canada. \"I'm sure they have a lot of common feelings.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Canada's warming relationship with China stands in contrast to its rocky ride with the U.S. Canada has been trying to persuade the U.S. to lower 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, but talks between the countries were scuttled last week after Trump became angry at an anti-tariff television commercial sponsored by the Canadian province of Ontario. The U.S. ambassador to Canada, Pete Hoekstra, on Monday said in a local television interview that \"Canada burned the bridges with America.\" In Asia this week for meetings with regional leaders, Trump also closed the door to further talks with Carney. \"I'm not going to be meeting with him for a while,\" he said to reporters on Air Force One.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chinese officials have been more positive. Earlier this month, China's ambassador to Canada, Wang Di, sent overtures to Canada. \"China has always regarded Canada as a friend and partner, and is willing to move forward with Canada,\" he wrote in an opinion piece in the Ottawa-based publication the Hill Times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some former Canadian officials cautioned that Carney could find dealing with China as challenging as dealing with the U.S., despite the recent softening in tone.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"My one big warning is, tread carefully when dealing with China,\" said Brian Clow, former deputy chief of staff for Trudeau. China can be as ruthless in negotiations as the Trump administration, he said, noting that Beijing also uses tariffs to punish other countries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shi Yinhong, a distinguished professor at Renmin University of China, said the Carney-Xi meeting is unlikely to result in major breakthroughs, though the two leaders could agree on smaller points. Canada would have limitations on the scope of any trade deal, Shi said. \"Canadians will say that, even if Trump is not good, I will not agree with China's positions,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Also complicating things for Carney is Trump. The U.S. insisted that the U.S., Mexico, Canada free-trade agreement that was negotiated during Trump's first term include a clause that effectively barred any of the countries from signing agreements with \"nonmarket economies,\" a description aimed specifically at China, said Clow.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If the Canadian government thinks it's going to all of a sudden do a big deal with China, it should think again,\" Clow said. \"The Americans won't let them.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Vipal Monga at [vipal.monga@wsj.com], James T.
