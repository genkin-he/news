The shift to higher-capacity drives should support continued margin growth, they added. Evercore reiterated an Outperform rating and a price target of $190 on Western Digital stock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mark Miller of Benchmark Equity Research also chalked up the results to robust capital spending on AI and data centers among technology companies. With no signs of that investment abating, Benchmark expects more strong quarters ahead.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Global regulators are quietly rethinking the toughest capital rules ever drafted for crypto holdingsafter a surge in stablecoin adoption forced a policy U-turn led by the United States. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's framework, originally designed in 2022 to keep banks away from high-risk digital assets, was interpreted by many lenders as a warning shot. But with the White House now actively backing regulated stablecoins through the newly enacted Genius Act, that old Wild West narrative no longer fits. The debate now centers on whether Basel's heavy-handed standards still make sense in a market that looks increasingly mainstream.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At issue is the 1,250% risk charge Basel applies to so-called permissionless tokens like Circle's USDC and Tether's USDTassets pegged to real-world reserves but operating on public blockchains. US regulators argue that treating these the same as Bitcoin could be outdated, particularly as stablecoins gain traction in payments and settlement systems. Some global peers, including the Bank of England, are seeking alignment rather than confrontation, while the European Central Bank prefers to push ahead and review later. Officials at the Fed, ECB, and Basel Committee have declined to comment, underscoring the delicacy of the talks now underway.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Europe, meanwhile, has already charted a different course. Under its latest banking package, stablecoins can be capitalized in line with the quality of their backing assetstypically cash and short-term US government debt. The Bank of England plans to unveil its own regulatory blueprint this month, signaling support for a coordinated global approach. Elsewhere, Singapore has delayed implementation by a year to maintain alignment, and Hong Kong may relax requirements for licensed issuers ahead of its 2026 rollout. With Basel having already postponed its crypto rules once in 2024, another delayor even a full recalibrationcould be in play as regulators race to catch up with an industry that no longer fits its old definitions.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Reshma Kapadia</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The first in-person meeting in six years between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping brought a round of mutual concessions on issues underpinning recent tensions. The de-escalation appeared to be more a win for China than for the U.S., but also took a worst-case scenario off the table for markets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, the trade truce is fragile, temporary, and partial.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Among the highlights: Beijing delayed implementation for a year of expanded restrictions on rare earth exports that would have roiled global supply chains. The U.S. suspended changes to its \"affiliates rule\" that sharply expanded the number of Chinese companies on a commercial blacklist. China agreed to resume buying U.S. soybeans, and the U.S. halved its 20% fentanyl-related tariffs in return for Beijing doing more to curb flows of precursors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. held off on raising tariffs by 100% — a step previewed before the meeting — and delayed any further increases to reciprocal tariffs. Both sides suspended port fees that they imposed on each other. Overall, U.S. China tariffs fell from 57% to 47%, equivalent to a roughly $40 billion reduction in tariff revenue, BofA analysts estimate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Supreme Court will hear a case challenging many tariffs on Nov 5.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The takeaway among analysts: This was largely a commercial detente that put the relationship back to about where it was before the April tariff blitz sparked a wave of escalation, with no progress in dealing with the core issues behind the U.S.-China rivalry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For markets, the lesson may be to pay even less attention to the expected flare-ups and tit-for-tat. Both leaders look happy to find ways to reduce tensions. Markets may treat each bout of turbulence with less fear, especially if, as Xi suggested, the two \"stay the right course, navigate through the complex landscape, and ensure the steady sailing forward of the giant ship of China-U.S. relations.\" Trump plans to visit China in April, and Xi will later come to the U.S, giving the leaders opportunities to resolve future issues.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But many details are yet to be worked out on problems that have led tensions to flare. Although Trump said the two didn't talk about letting China buy Nvidia's more-advanced Blackwell chips, he said that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang would talk to Chinese officials. That leaves an open question about whether the U.S. will loosen restrictions on other chips and advanced technology.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It will be substantially more difficult for the U.S. to take meaningful counter-China or derisking actions, since the main lesson coming out of the summit is that the Trump administration will negotiate these actions and is sensitive to Chinese pressure,\" says Emily Kilcrease, director of the energy, economics, and security program at the Center for a New American Security and a former U.S. trade official. \"The idea of building leverage to force concessions from China has just been proven faulty, and future U.S. threats will be seen as empty.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beijing's leverage may be at its peak, though, analysts note. The U.S. has rushed to sign agreements with Malaysia, Australia, and other allies. A deal with Vietnam is meant to make it tougher for China to reroute its exports through other countries. Reducing U.S. dependence on China could take years, but China's need for the world to buy its exports makes it vulnerable, too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"That leads to this ironic negotiating stance in which it seems they need to be more cooperative to reinforce the existing order,\" says Logan Wright, a partner at Rhodium Group. While the air of cooperation lasts, investors can turn their minds to other matters. B</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

With inflation above target, it's not clear how much the Fed's policy stance is doing right now to rein in rising prices, Hammack says. \"I think we're barely restrictive, if at all, and so I do think we need to maintain some amount of restriction to help bring inflation back down to target,\" Hammack says. In separate missives Friday, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan laid out their own cases against this week's cut.

Saefong</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The crude-oil market is seeing a 'rare occasion' where supply risks are more focused on the Americas</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Any potential U.S. strike on Venezuela's military sites could pave the way for Venezuela's elected government to return to power - and that raises significant risks for oil markets, said the Price Futures Group's Phil Flynn.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Escalating U.S. tensions with Venezuela and an upcoming monthly decision by major oil producers on crude output targets were the focus of traders heading into the weekend.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. plans to attack military installations inside Venezuela and the strikes could come at any moment, the Miami Herald reported Friday, citing sources with knowledge of the situation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In response to the report, White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly told MarketWatch in an email that \"unnamed sources don't know what they're talking about. Any announcements regarding Venezuela policy would come directly from the President.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, oil prices found some support in the wake of the news report of potential strikes, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery (CLZ25) (CL.1) edging up by 0.6% to $60.93 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices were still trading lower for the week and have declined for the month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Although the U.S. already has certain sanctions on Venezuela in place, \"those do not impact physical [oil] production and transport in the same way that possible damage from military activity could,\" Colin Cieszynski, portfolio manager and chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management, told MarketWatch. \"So this appears to be forcing investors to adjust their supply-risk expectations.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is a \"rare occasion,\" Cieszynski noted, where \"supply risks are more focused in the Americas.\" He pointed out that U.S. crude prices were up a bit more than global benchmark Brent crude, which saw its January contract (BRNF26) - which becomes the front month at the end of the session - move up by 0.4% to $64.62 on ICE Futures Europe.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A U.S. strike on Venezuela's military sites would potentially pave the way for Venezuela's elected government to return to power, said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group. \"This raises significant risks for oil markets, particularly diesel, as supplies are already low and Venezuelan heavy oil is an important source.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The situation, meanwhile, could overshadow concerns about the recent sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft Oil Company and Lukoil OAO, said Flynn.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oil traders also are anticipating the latest decision by the major oil producers known as OPEC+ over the weekend. The group plans to hold its monthly meeting on Sunday and is expected to decide on production targets for the month of December.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the last meeting in early October, OPEC+ agreed to increase production in November by another 137,000 barrels a day, despite rising concerns of a global supply glut. The group has been announcing monthly production increases since April.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2026, the global oil market may see an average surplus of 4 million barrels per day, according to reports from the International Energy Agency and World Bank Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read: An oil supply glut could sink prices to $35 a barrel next year. Why the U.S.-China trade truce won't change that.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the short term, analysts were expecting oil officials to announce a similar rise of 137,000 barrels per day in production targets, said David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But long term, it looks as if the oil market wants to go lower, retesting the double bottom from this past May of $55 front-month WTI, he said in emailed comments to MarketWatch Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The reason is simply the ongoing slowdown in global demand growth, against recent reports that there will be a supply overhang of around 4 million bpd next year,\" said Morrison. \"That could be countered by U.S. sanctions on Rosneft/Lukoil, but I don't think traders put much store in the effectiveness of sanctions. Maybe this time it's different.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Myra P. Saefong</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
