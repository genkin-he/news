Gold Fields has an option to earn into the Santa Cecilia project by funding a USD$48 million exploration option for a 75% indirect interest (10% earned to-date). Gold Fields is also a principal shareholder of Torq.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An approximately USD$11 million program, to be 100% funded by Gold Fields, is intended to target and further evaluate prospective areas, specifically Pircas Norte and Gemelos Norte, as well as other new areas with evidence of wide continuous Au-Cu mineralization.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the last drill program, the Santa Cecilia JV completed five drill holes at Gemelos Norte confirming a new copper-gold porphyry discovery including 450 m of 0.51 g/t gold and 0.155%copper. Step-out drilling at Pircas Norte extended mineralization at depth returning 206 m of 0.99 g/t gold and 0.109%Cu within 266 m of 0.81 g/t Au and 0.097%Cu.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Previous highlights from Torq's inaugural drill program include 557 m of 0.38 g/t gold, 0.23% copper and 56 ppm molybdenum in wall rock at a depth of 442 m - 999 m. This intercept bottomed in grade and represented an 81% increase in gold grade relative to historical drilling, indicating potential vectoring toward the higher-grade causative intrusion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company looks forward to testing the extent of the discoveries and evaluating additional highly prospective targets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This program was originally planned for early 2026 but has been delayed to later in the year for several reasons including the on-site death in November of an employee of a catering contractor who passed away at the exploration camp during off-duty hours. A preliminary review by Chilean authorities has ruled that the fatality was due to natural causes however governmental and potential civil suit investigations are ongoing. The Company maintains high standards of safety for its employees and requires its contractors to do the same. Neither investigation is expected to lead to legal proceedings which would have material adverse financial consequences to Torq.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shawn Wallace, CEO of Torq, commented: \"We have extended our sincere condolences to the family of the individual who passed away at site. The safety and well-being of all personnel and other stakeholders remains our highest priority.
