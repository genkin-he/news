The goal is to improve the company's engineering and product capabilities, Ahuja says. Block is also investing more in AI infrastructure and continuing to spend more in go-to-market to scale customer-acquisition efforts, she says. Ahuja says margins are expected to increase over the course of this fiscal year, but won't show up in the first quarter, as costs related to the job cuts will still be trickling through.

Today's couples aren't planning from a template; they're building celebrations that reflect who they are, what they value, and how they want to be remembered. With Gen Z now making up the largest share of engaged couples and Millennials continuing to push for personalization, weddings have transformed from scripted ceremonies into deeply authentic celebrations that reflect individual values, identities, and lifestyles. Modern couples are ditching predictable formats in favor of genuine connection, immersive experiences, and creative expression from unconventional venues to bespoke rituals and social-first storytelling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Against this backdrop of reinvention, </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>David's Bridal, Inc.</span></strong><span> (\"David's\"), the nation's leading bridal and special occasion authority and the largest AI-powered marketplace, media network, and planning ecosystem for life's most meaningful moments, today debuts </span><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Breaking Bridal</span></strong></em><span> - its first original programming series spotlighting how modern couples are redefining what it means to say \"I do.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Episodes will premiere every other week on Wednesdays on David's YouTube Channel and at DavidsBridal.com/breakingbridal, and later this year on Sling, Roku, Tubi, and Amazon Prime Video as part of video-on-demand (VOD).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From volcanic backdrops to unconventional rituals, the series moves beyond the \"aisle\" to explore the intersection of culture, wedding planning, and commerce. A whopping 91% of couples say making their wedding feel uniquely \"them\" matters more than tradition, with 92% of Gen Z couples especially prioritizing personalization over meeting expectations. That cultural shift is at the heart of </span><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Breaking Bridal,</span></strong></em><span> a documentary-style series that follows real couples and the one unexpected and exciting choice that transformed their wedding into a uniquely personal celebration. From unconventional venues and personal customs to rule-breaking decisions that defy tradition, each episode traces the emotional journey from idea to execution, culminating in celebrations that prioritize individuality over convention. Bingeable Storytelling Meets Modern Celebration: Each episode follows a clear emotional arc centered on one unexpected wedding-day decision that defies tradition. Viewers witness the journey from a bold idea to a final celebration that prioritizes individuality over convention.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We were inspired to create BREAKING BRIDAL when one couple told us, 'we're honoring tradition, but we want to curate it, too.' Another couple described their wedding approach as 'same traditions but under new management.' So, so fun and fresh!

Lower oil prices are expected to dampen corporate profits and overall incomes in the province, following what Alberta expects to be a C$4.1 billion deficit in the current 2025/26 fiscal year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alberta is also projecting budget deficits of C$7.6 billion and C$6.9 billion for 2027/28 and 2028/29, which would put the province in violation of its own legislation prohibiting more than three years in a row of deficit financing. The size of the projected 2026/27 deficit also exceeds what is permitted under provincial law by C$4.5 billion. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We created these rules, and I'm breaking them. It bothers nobody more than it does me,\" Alberta Finance Minister Nate Horner told reporters, adding the province will be seeking to amend its fiscal rules going forward. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Alberta government said it would require a WTI oil price between $74 and $77 per barrel to balance its 2026/27 budget.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The province has said its budgetary woes are also due to rapid population growth, which in recent years has exceeded that of any other Canadian province.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>($1 = 1.3680 Canadian dollars)</span></p></span></div></div>",

Discovery said Thursday it determined that Paramount's revised offer to buy it is superior to the deal it has with Netflix, the latest twist in the monthslong battle over the storied entertainment company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix now has four business days to make a revised offer for the Warner board to determine whether it matches Paramount's latest bid. While Paramount is seeking to buy all of Warner Discovery, Netflix's deal is for the Warner movie and TV studios and HBO Max streaming service.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Warner said if the board still favors Paramount after Netflix revises its offer, Warner would be entitled to terminate the Netflix agreement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Until then, the Netflix merger agreement remains in effect, and the Warner board continues to recommend in favor of the Netflix transaction, the company said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Netflix spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Warner's latest move marks an about-face after months of rejecting Paramount's overtures. The battle for Warner is significant for the futures of both Paramount and Netflix, coming as the entertainment industry struggles to adapt to seismic shifts in technology and viewing habits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both Netflix and Paramount see Warner's library — which includes Harry Potter, Batman and hit TV shows such as \"Friends\" and \"The Sopranos\" — as a valuable asset that could boost their respective streaming services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount on Tuesday submitted a revised bid of $31 a share for all of Warner Discovery, including cable networks such as CNN and Food Network, for an $81 billion deal . Netflix in December reached a deal to buy Warner's studios and HBO Max for $27.75 a share, or $72 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As part of its revised bid, Paramount agreed to exclude the Warner cable networks from the proposed agreement's \"material adverse effect\" clause, meaning the deal's price tag won't shrink if the linear TV networks business declines in value before the close.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Additionally, Paramount accelerated the timing of its proposed \"ticking fee\" of 25 cents, which it would pay to Warner shareholders for each quarter its deal hasn't closed, to start after Sept. 30 instead of in January.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The offer also includes an increased $7 billion termination fee that Paramount would pay if the transaction failed to close due to regulatory concerns. Paramount would additionally be on the hook for the $2.8 billion breakup fee Warner would owe Netflix should that deal fall apart.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount's latest bid came after Warner's board of directors set a seven-day window for the companies to negotiate, which Netflix permitted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount has long said its all-cash bid was superior because it wanted the entire company, unlike Netflix, and it believed it had a cleaner path to regulatory approval.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos is in Washington, D.C., Thursday meeting with Justice Department and White House officials to make the case for the deal, a person familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount, led by David Ellison, went directly to shareholders with a tender offer in December, after being rebuffed by Warner multiple times. The suitor gradually sweetened its offer — backed by Ellison's billionaire father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison; private-equity firm RedBird Capital; and a group of sovereign-wealth funds — until Warner agreed to reopen negotiations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Joe Flint at Joe.Flint@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
