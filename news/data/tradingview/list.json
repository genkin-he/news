And if Metsera determines the new offer remains better, it has the right under the terms of its agreement with Pfizer to terminate the Pfizer deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shares in Nasdaq-listed Metsera surged nearly 20% in premarket trading.

The 10-year Bund yield last trades at 2.657%, up 3.8 basis points after the decision. Eurozone bond yields have been driven higher by rising U.S. Treasury yields after the Federal Reserve cooled market expectations of another rate cut in December. Meanwhile, the ECB pointed to a resilient economy. \"Despite the U.S. tariffs, despite all the various sources of uncertainty, the European economy continues to eke out some growth,\" says Mark Wall, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. \"Economic 'resilience' is keeping the ECB doves in check, and the policy pause on the rails,\" he says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0936 ET - The euro recovers slightly against the dollar after the European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged as expected. The ECB said the economy has continued to grow despite a challenging global environment. It also pointed to a robust labor market, solid private sector balance sheets and past rate cuts as \"important sources of resilience\" but noted that the outlook remains uncertain given global trade disputes and geopolitical tensions. The ECB reiterated a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach to future decisions. The euro falls 0.3% to $1.1564. It hit a two-week low of $1.1546 just before the decision as the dollar strengthened in the wake of the Federal Reserve signalling a December rate cut wasn't a done deal alongside a highly-anticipated 25 basis-point cut on Wednesday. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0933 ET - Rising Treasury yields support the dollar, Bannockburn's Marc Chandler says. Bonds are selling off since Fed Chair Powell said that an interest rate cut in December can't be taken for granted. It is unclear whether overnight news of improving U.S.-China trade relations, after the Trump-Xi meeting, is having any impact on FX markets. \"I think it is hard to separate the trade story and Fed hawkish cut in driving [the] dollar,\" Chandler says, adding that markets had already been optimistic about a deal. The Bank of Japan stays put, as expected. The WSJ Dollar Index rises 0.5% as the greenback strengthens 1% versus the yen and 0.5% against the euro.

The number of Canadians receiving pay and benefits from an employer ticked up 3,300 for the month, marking no change on a percentage basis, after edging up 0.1% in July. Compared with a year earlier, payroll employment was up 31,500, or 0.2%. Gains were noted by Statistics Canada in public administration and construction, but declines in retail, wholesale and scientific and technical services. Job vacancies in August fell 2.4% to 457,400, and were 15.2% lower than a year earlier. That meant 3.5 unemployed persons for every job vacancy in August.

The exchange rate remains attractive in carry trades where investors borrow in low-yielding currencies to invest in higher-yielding ones, they say. Moreover, markets are pricing in too much risk premium ahead of next month's U.K. budget and the rise in Bank of England interest rate cut expectations looks overdone, they say. Finally, the franc has strengthened too much against the euro. Morgan Stanley has a target for sterling to rise to 1.15 francs, with a stop loss of 1.0159 francs. Sterling falls 0.1% to 1.0544 francs, having reached a low of 1.0493 Wednesday, according to LSEG.

The head of Rosenberg Research points to a line from Gov. Tiff Macklem's press conference, in which Macklem suggests tepid growth means \"excess supply is only taken up gradually.\" This indicates a disinflationary environment, he adds, \"and a telltale sign that the BOC is not yet done... Yes, the BOC thinks it has done enough but they are clearly unsure.\" Rosenberg adds the overall tone of the BOC's suite of communications was more dovish than in September \"and rather negative on the economic outlook.\" (Paul.Vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0847 ET - Bond and currency markets heed Fed Chair Powell's blunt message that an interest rate cut in December is far from certain. On the CME's FedWatch tool, odds of a third consecutive trim fall to 69% from more than 80% yesterday, when the Fed cut by 25-basis-point and Powell warned that policymakers were split about the path forward. The Government shutdown delays GDP and claims data due today. Treasurys sell off, sending yields higher. The 10-year yield is at 4.103% and the two-year at 3.614%. The WSJ Dollar Index rises 0.4%.

The BOE rate decision on November 6 is likely to be a tight vote in favor of keeping rates unchanged at 4.0%, he says. Markets price a 28% possibility of a rate cut next week, LSEG data show.

Gilt yields could rise sharply if the U.K. government underdelivers on fiscal sustainability at the Nov. 26 budget, the strategists say. Some measures, such as spending increases, more gilt issuance, and inflationary tax rises, could lead to loss of confidence in the U.K. fiscal position, they say.

The 10-year Bund yield is up 3 basis points at 2.651% following the data, little changed from before the release, Tradeweb data show. Eurzone bond yields have been trading higher, tracking U.S. Treasury yields after Wednesday's Federal Reserve announcement.

The 10-year Treasury yield rises 2 basis points to 4.078%; the 30-year yield is up 3 basis points at 4.629%; while the two-year yield is up 1.4 basis points at 3.600%, according to Tradeweb.

The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points Wednesday, as expected, but Powell said another cut in December isn't a foregone conclusion. MUFG still expects the Fed to cut rates again in December. This is \"data dependent based on the assumption that the labor market remains weak heading into year-end, and that the government shutdown comes to an end allowing the Fed to better assess the health of the U.S. economy,\" Hardman says.

Data readings remain mixed, while the possible slow rollout of Germany's fiscal expansion could reduce growth prospects and tame some of the hawks on the committee. December's meeting brings with it 2028 economic projections; if they show inflation undershooting three years in a row, the doves will be pressing the case for a cut sooner rather than later.\"  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    MATTHIEU SAVARY, CHIEF STRATEGIST, DEVELOPED MARKETS EX US, BCA RESEARCH, MONTREAL:  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    \"The ECB’s steady hand signals confidence that inflation and growth are on a sustainable path. As a result, European policy will not cause major surprises and will evolve in line with market pricing. This leaves the euro, European stocks, and bonds at the mercy of the evolution of U.S. policy and markets.\"    </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MARK WALL, CHIEF EUROPEAN ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK, LONDON:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Where's the smoking gun for a rate cut? Despite the U.S. tariffs, despite all the various sources of uncertainty, the European economy continues to eke out some growth. Economic 'resilience' is keeping the ECB doves in check, and the policy pause on the rails.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MARCHEL ALEXANDROVICH, EUROPEAN ECONOMIST, SALTMARSH ECONOMICS, LONDON: </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"No surprises from the ECB, with interest (rates) left unchanged and no real shift in language from the meeting six weeks ago. Similarly, in the press conference, Christine Lagarde is likely to reiterate that policy ‘remains in a good place’.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>IRENE LAURO, EURO ZONE ECONOMIST, SCHRODERS:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We remain confident that growth will strengthen into next year, supporting the ECB’s decision to keep interest rates on hold into 2026. However, if inflation comes in lower beyond current projections, the ECB could follow the Fed’s risk-management approach and deliver a precautionary rate cut. For now, the outlook for the eurozone has shifted positively—a welcome change after months of stagnation.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ARNE PETIMEZAS, DIRECTOR RESEARCH, AFS GROUP, AMSTERDAM:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"ECB rates unchanged as expected, and again, no forward guidance, but a repeat of the wait-and-see approach. Positive undertones in the Governing Council statement, cheerleading the resilience of the economy. A sign where the press conference is going, where we should expect a more upbeat President Lagarde.\"</span></p></span></div></div>",
