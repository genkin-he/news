The Notice of AGM will shortly be available to view on the Company's website at: https://ikigaiventuresltd.com/</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The above documentation can also be sent directly by email. Please contact ikigai@intertrustgroup.com to request this.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CEO's Statement</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I am pleased to present the financial statements for Ikigai Ventures Limited for the year ended 30 June 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company was incorporated to acquire high growth, scalable businesses operating in sectors such as healthcare, finance, agriculture, mining, and artificial intelligence, with a focus on strong ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) credentials. Our shares began trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange on 15 September 2022 (\"Admission\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since Admission, the Company has reviewed a wide range of potential acquisition opportunities and conducted due diligence on a number of them. In August 2025, I was pleased to announce that Ikigai Ventures Limited signed conditional, non-binding Heads of Terms to acquire Dotlines Global Plc and Audra Solutions Limited - a dynamic technology group headquartered in the UK, with deep ties to Singapore and significant operations in Malaysia - in a proposed GBP67m transaction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The consideration for the proposed acquisitions will be satisfied in full by the issuance of new shares in the Company, with no cash consideration payable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dotlines has demonstrated strong growth across digital infrastructure, AI-driven cybersecurity, and fintech, underpinned by proprietary platforms and meaningful commercial traction. The business has strong fundamentals and a clear global vision. Subject to completion, the combined group intends to move to the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange via a reverse takeover, providing access to capital, a public market profile, strategic M&amp;A flexibility, and a platform for long-term growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It has been a pleasure working with Matin Mahbubul and the Dotlines team and Audra teams - a business with strong leadership, clear ambition, and proven execution. We look forward to progressing to the next phase of this exciting journey.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financial Review</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the year ended 30 June 2025, the Company recorded a reduced net loss of GBP449,653 (2024: GBP482,708), which includes a non-cash accounting charge of GBP76,460 in respect of an equity incentive arrangement that will only become payable in shares upon the successful completion of a reverse takeover. Excluding this charge, the underlying operational loss for the year was GBP373,193, reflecting continued cost discipline and a reduction in overall administrative and advisory expenses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Expenditure during the year was primarily related to maintaining the Company's Main Market listing and professional advisory costs in connection with its ongoing corporate development activities. The basic loss per share for the year was 2.2 pence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As at 30 June 2025, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of GBP336,399 (2024: GBP738,758), representing the remaining proceeds from the placing at Admission. Subsequent to the year-end, the Company entered into Heads of Terms for a proposed reverse takeover, marking continued progress toward its strategic objective of identifying and completing a qualifying acquisition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Strategy and Outlook</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company aims to acquire high growth, scalable businesses in sectors such as healthcare, finance, agriculture, mining, and artificial intelligence, with a focus on strong ESG credentials. While not geographically restricted, the Directors continue to anticipate completing an acquisition in the UK, EU, or Asia-Pacific.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Board is focused on businesses that are:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·    Founder or entrepreneur-led;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·    Revenue-generating and of medium cap size;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·    Demonstrating strong growth potential; or</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·    Positioned to benefit from public company status and the Board's capital markets experience.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The signing of the Heads of Terms for the acquisition of Dotlines represents a material step forward in the delivery of this strategy. The Board remains confident in its ability to complete an acquisition that will provide long-term value for shareholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kane Black</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chief Executive Officer</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ikigai Ventures Limited</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For further information please contact:</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Ikigai Ventures Limited</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span> +44 (0)1481 211 000</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Kane Black, CEO</span></p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Cosign Limited (Company Secretary)</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>+44 (0)1481 211 000</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Allenby Capital Limited (Financial Adviser)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jeremy Porter / Piers Shimwell</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>+44 (0)20 3328 5656</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Novum Securities (Broker)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Colin Rowbury</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>+44 (0) 20 7399 9400</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><span>This information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Despite a soft trading environment in home furnishings, IKEA reported narrowing losses compared to the same period last year, benefitting from lower supplier costs and effective implementation of cost-saving initiatives. This resulted in an improved profit from continuing operations of Rp 35 billion for the period ended 30 September 2025.  Net profit was Rp 70 billion, down 62% year-on-year, due to a one-off gain on disposal of properties and Hero Supermarket in the same period last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Company Performance</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net revenue for the period ended 30 September 2025 reached Rp 3,511 billion, representing a 4% year-on-year increase. Profit from continuing operations was Rp 35 billion, a significant improvement from Rp 24 billion profit in the prior comparable period, supported by Guardian's strong performance and narrowing losses at IKEA.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Guardian continued to deliver double-digit growth in sales and profit for the first nine months of 2025. Like-for-like sales increased by 9% year-on-year, led by higher footfall in premium malls and tourist locations. Guardian continues to accelerate growth by enhancing its health and beauty proposition, expanding its store footprint, advancing omnichannel integration and capturing market share to increase accessibility for customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite continued softness in home furnishings demand, lower supplier costs, disciplined cost control and operational improvements resulted in narrowing losses at IKEA compared to the same period last year. The team remains focused on driving sales growth through initiatives such as enhanced affordability, improved product range relevance, expanded food offerings, and growth of digital footprint through Shopee.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Business Update</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company completed the sale of two properties in June 2025, further strengthening its financial position.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Prospects</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company expects the Health and Beauty business to maintain its strong growth momentum, despite ongoing uncertainty regarding the recovery of the Home Furnishings business. With a sharpened strategic focus, the Company is well positioned for sustainable growth in the medium to long term.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hadrianus Wahyu Trikusumo</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>President Director</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>31 October 2025</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For further information contact: </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hadrianus Wahyu Trikusumo, President Director</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>PT DFI Retail Nusantara Tbk</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tel: +62-21-8378 8388</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>E-mail: extcomm@dfiretailgroup.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- end -</span></p><span>This information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Sterling and U.K. government bonds would face elevated volatility if U.K. Treasury chief Rachel Reeves unexpectedly resigned, ING's Francesco Pesole says in a note. The opposition is calling for Reeves to resign after she failed to obtain a license to rent out her home but Prime Minister Keir Starmer has backed her and her letting agent has taken responsibility. In July when Reeves appeared close to leaving, gilt fell sharply alongside sterling. Markets are wary that her resignation would \"herald more relaxed fiscal rules and additional borrowing at a time when gilt issuance remains elevated.\" Sterling falls 0.1% to $1.3141, while the euro rises 0.1% to 0.8802 pounds. The 10-year gilt yield rises 2.2 basis points to 4.430%, Tradeweb data show. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
