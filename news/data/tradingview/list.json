By enabling faster, cheaper transactions while maintaining full ETH security and composability, Linea is building the infrastructure for real economic activity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Why Ethereum Needs An Economic Backbone</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Linea is rapidly evolving into the Ethereum economic backbone. Crypto analyst Henry has revealed on X that Linea was built from first principles as a reinforcement layer for ETH’s future. The reason why Linea is catching serious attention is that over $1 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) and $130 million in stablecoins represent real liquidity inflow into the network, not inflated metrics. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Furthermore, Linea’s buyback and burn mechanism ties are built directly into protocol revenue. MetaMask’s deep integration and the seamless user experience (UX) are instant reach, and the developer-first architecture actually scales without breaking ETH’s security. The rumors of a MASK airdrop and upcoming institutional deployments only add fuel to the narrative. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While others are chasing hype, LineaBuild is constructing the infrastructure that powers real revenue. Henry concluded that every stat is screaming one thing, and adoption is real. “Nothing can defeat this, and Linea is ETH’s execution layer for the next cycle,” the expert added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto analyst BullifyX has also made a bold declaration that the next evolution of Web3 is unfolding right on LineaBuild. Linea isn’t just another Layer 2 blockchain, but it’s a new foundation for scalability, speed, and developer freedom. With zkEVM precision, ultra-low gas, and ETH-grade security, Linea bridges the gap between innovation and accessibility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Furthermore, LineaBuild is a frictionless playground for builders, while for users, it delivers pure performance. BullifyX emphasizes that Linea’s role is to transform complex blockchain experiences into smooth, scalable realities, powering applications, digital economies, and the immersive metaverses. “The future doesn’t wait. It scales on LineaBuild.” BullifyX noted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The First Public Company Just Proved Ethereum’s Real-World Use Case</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a monumental shift, the institutional adoption of Ethereum had just leveled up. According to Stacy Muur, the founder of GREENDOTS, the catalyst for this advancement is the deployment of an impressive $200 million in ETH on LineaBuild by SharpLink, a publicly traded company, powered by EigenLayer’s EigenCloud, ether_fi restaking, and Anchorage for secure, regulated custody.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Muur explained that this is the first fully verifiable, ETH-aligned institutional treasury activation. Meanwhile, a public company is now using EigenCloud as infrastructure for staking and verifiable on-chain treasury management. This suggests that the ETH restaking economy is robust enough to regulate capital.</span></p></span></div></div>",

The Company's lead product candidate is MOLBREEVI (also referred to as \"molgramostim\"), an inhaled granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. MOLBREEVI is in a Phase 3 IMPALA-2 pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (\"aPAP\"), a chronic and debilitating rare lung disease characterized by the abnormal build-up of surfactant in the alveoli of the lungs. Savara has consistently represented that, based on investments in MOLBREEVI and its purported \"track record of strong fiscal discipline,\" the Company is \"sufficiently capitalized\" as early as through 2026 and as late as into the second half of 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In December 2024, Savara began a rolling submission of a Biologics License Application (\"BLA\")-</span><em><span>i.e.</span></em><span>, a submission requesting approval to distribute a biologic product across state lines-to the United States (\"U.S.\") Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") for MOLBREEVI for the potential treatment of aPAP (the \"MOLBREEVI BLA\"). In a press release announcing the submission, the Company touted that, \"[g]iven the positive results of the pivotal, Phase 3 IMPALA-2 trial, we believe MOLBREEVI demonstrates a favorable benefit-risk profile and could fundamentally change the way aPAP is treated,\" and that \"[i]nitiation of the [MOLBREEVI] BLA is an important milestone in potentially addressing the unmet need in aPAP, for which there are no approved medicines in the U.S. and Europe.\" Moreover, Savara represented that it \"expect[ed] to complete the submission of the rolling [MOLBREEVI] BLA by the end of [the first quarter of] 2025.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To obtain FDA approval of the MOLBREEVI BLA, Savara must submit, among other things, information regarding MOLBREEVI's chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (\"CMC\"). Specifically, the CMC section of a BLA must provide a detailed account of a product's manufacturing process-including process validation runs, stability testing, and analytical method validation-and detailed descriptions of facilities, equipment, and quality control procedures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects.

(\"Koito\") (the \"Koito Acquisition\" or the \"Merger\") (as described below), Cepton was an electronics company focused on the deployment of high performance, mass-market light detection and ranging (\"lidar\") technologies to deliver safety and autonomy across the Automotive and Smart Infrastructure markets. The Company offered near-range lidars, long-range lidars and ultra-long-range lidars, automotive software and smart lidar systems that include its perception software.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As of July 2023, Koito, a Japanese manufacturer of automotive lighting equipment, had invested $200 million in Cepton in exchange for common and preferred stock amounting to 30.1% of Cepton's voting power on an as-converted basis and held two out of seven seats on the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\"). In October 2023, Koito requested that the Board form a special committee to negotiate a potential transaction with Koito. In December 2023, Koito announced a bid to acquire Cepton for $3.17 per share in cash in a going private transaction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In July 2024, Cepton announced that it had accepted Koito's bid to acquire all of the Company's outstanding capital stock not owned by Koito for $3.17 per share in an all-cash transaction. According to Cepton, the Koito Acquisition would purportedly \"complement Koito's existing sensor technology roadmap, while providing Cepton with the financial stability and scalability that are crucial to the commercialization of its lidar technology.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Koito Acquisition closed on January 7, 2025, at which point all outstanding Cepton shareholders received $3.17 per share of Cepton common stock in cash. In a press release issued that same day, Cepton stated that the Merger \"marks a strategic milestone in the industrialization of Cepton's cutting-edge lidar technology, combining the strengths of both companies to reshape future mobility\" and \"[s]upported by Koito's world-renowned automotive expertise, Cepton will continue to commercialize its lidar solutions with a strong focus on quality, reliability and sustainability.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Cepton had received a credible third-party bid valuing Cepton at more than double the Koito Acquisition; (ii) Cepton's Board of Directors failed to meaningfully explore the foregoing offer and failed to disclose its terms when recommending that Cepton's shareholders approve the Koito Acquisition; (iii) consequently, Cepton's shareholders were deprived of the opportunity to meaningfully consider whether to accept or reject the Koito Acquisition; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors began to learn the truth four months after the Merger closed when, in May 2025, former Cepton shareholders filed two verified class action complaints in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware against, among others, Cepton and certain of the Company's executive officers, in connection with the Koito Acquisition. In July 2025, the foregoing actions were consolidated and restyled as In re Cepton, Inc. Stockholder Litigation, Case No. 2025-0519-LWW (the \"Delaware Action\"). Then, in September 2025, a redacted version of an amended consolidated class action complaint (the \"Amended Complaint\") filed in the Delaware Action became publicly available. The Amended Complaint followed a review of books and records produced by Cepton in response to plaintiffs' demands made under 8 Del. C. § 220. The Amended Complaint alleges that Cepton's Board agreed to the Koito Acquisition \"at a price that was so unreasonable as to shock the conscience, and then pitched the grossly unfair deal to stockholders with a Proxy that concealed critical facts.\" Moreover, the Amended Complaint alleges that \"the Proxy failed to disclose Cepton's receipt of-and the Board's utter failure to explore-a credible third-party bid valuing Cepton at more than double\" the Koito Acquisition. The Amended Complaint further alleges that Cepton's Chief Executive Officer Defendant Jun Pei was subject to conflicts in his negotiations with Koito and encouraged the Board to recommend accepting the Koito Acquisition so as to protect his own personal economic interests at the expense of Cepton's stockholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.
