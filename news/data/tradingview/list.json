            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Richard Florida</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Google co-founder Larry Page recently made headlines by spending $188 million on three Miami mansions. He's not the only billionaire looking at a big move: His Google co-founder Sergey Brin is reportedly shopping for Miami property. So is WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The shopping spree comes as California considers a wealth tax to impose a one-time retroactive levy on billionaires that has fueled speculation that they have had it with the Golden State. In New York City, where Mayor Zohran Mamdani earlier this month proposed an increase in taxes on high-income people — and short of that, a property tax increase — there is talk of a parallel exodus.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The wealthy have long threatened to leave when battling local governments over taxes. In the past, they rarely did. But their threats have teeth this time — not because they are abandoning great cities, but because they have figured out they don't have to. Now that digital technology allows them to separate where they live and pay taxes from where their businesses operate, they aren't relocating their companies. They are relocating themselves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This upends the basic arrangement that underwrote great cities — what they are, how they work and who pays for them. Amid this seismic shift looms an existential question: Can those cities survive without them?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For most of history, people lived where they worked — on the farm, above the shop, close to the factory. Suburbanization expanded the radius, but workers, managers and executives still had to be close to where jobs concentrated. Because people had to be there, cities could charge a premium. Residents paid it in housing costs, in taxes and in the costs of commuting or other frictions of day-to-day life. The alternative — living elsewhere — meant being cut off from their livelihoods and economic opportunity. Taxes were part of that price, and people paid because they had no choice.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When Covid hit, this social compact appeared to quake. A chorus of commentators predicted the imminent collapse of New York, London, San Francisco and other great global cities. They predicted the wealthy and their companies would be driven out by lockdowns, governance failures, crime and the sudden possibility of remote work. The cities, as a result, would hollow out.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There seemed to be something to it — at first. Ken Griffin relocated himself and the headquarters of his Citadel hedge fund from Chicago to Miami. The venture capitalists Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois bought homes in Miami Beach and opened an office for their venture capital fund in Miami, too. Jeff Bezos moved from Seattle to Miami, assembling a $200 million plus compound.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the predicted total exodus never fully materialized.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many of those who moved to Miami quickly came face to face with its limits. Public and private schools couldn't match what they had left behind. Housing costs rose astronomically — making Miami now one of the most unaffordable markets in the country.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most critically, they found it hard to recruit top talent. New York and London remained the centers of global finance. San Francisco remained the center for high technology, with the lion's share of venture capital investment to AI startups still flowing into the Bay Area.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2023, Thiel admitted as much, conceding that the tech industry remained densely concentrated in California and that Miami's housing costs had put the city out of reach for much of the talent he needed — making it far harder to move companies and their people than he initially thought. Griffin himself ended up building a massive new building in New York even as Citadel expanded in Miami.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But eventually they realized they didn't have to move their companies at all. Digital technology enabled them to live in one place and keep their business in another. They could establish residency in Miami, which requires no particular time spent there to claim residency status, and spend much of the year wherever else they wanted — flying into New York or San Francisco for what mattered. The city where their businesses are headquartered became just that — not somewhere they needed to reside and pay taxes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That has transformed the underlying economic logic of cities. They are no longer self-contained economic units. Digital technology is remaking them into networks — physical places connected by virtual ties and dynamic talent flows.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Economic participation now happens across places, not within them. My own research has documented the rise of what I call lifestyle tax havens — cities such as Miami, Dubai and Singapore that combine low or no income taxes with warm weather, luxury amenities and easy access to global networks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These lifestyle tax havens do not replace the great hubs. They are satellites in their orbit, part of the networks that form around them. Miami is a critical node in New York's financial network. Austin operates as a satellite of San Francisco's tech network. Dubai plays a similar role for London and the financial centers of Europe and Asia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Billionaires make headlines, but the same math applies down the economic ladder. For a high earner, a move from San Francisco, Los Angeles or New York to Miami could save 10 to 14 percentage points on income tax, based on current rates. For a professional couple earning $1 million a year, that is roughly $100,000 to $140,000 annually — adding up to more than $1 million over a decade. This is a simplification, of course — certainly, taxes can be complicated by write offs and different income types. But the income-tax rates paint a clear picture.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But what becomes of cities that are lifestyle tax havens?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They were never built to scale in the way older cities have. In the old urban system, people were anchored to place. That anchoring did more than generate tax revenue. It created loyalty, civic investment and philanthropy — the long-term commitment that built private schools, museums, hospitals, universities and cultural institutions. When people stayed, they fixed what was broken because they had no alternative.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The lifestyle tax havens often lack the civic commitment that allowed places like New York, London, Paris or Chicago to grow into fuller-spectrum cities. Places like Miami lack the integrated infrastructure and public systems, and as population and activity increase, everyday urban functions become harder to manage. Moving around becomes increasingly difficult. Housing costs rise rapidly. Schools and public services struggle to keep pace. These are not temporary growing pains. They are structural limits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The model works well enough for wealthy residents who can buy private solutions — housing, education, transportation, security. For empty-nesters and young professionals without children, the trade-offs may be manageable. For families, they are far more consequential. And for service workers — the people who staff hospitals, schools, restaurants and local government — the barriers are often insurmountable. When the people who make a city run cannot afford to live there, the city itself begins to fray.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is the dynamic the economist Albert Hirschman warned about: That loyalty is what turns frustration into voice — the impulse to fix what is broken rather than flee. Today, exit is cheap and reversible. When taxes rise or services disappoint, the response is no longer to press for reform but to move.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cities, then, are pushed toward a race to the bottom — not one driven by ideology, but by mobility. As high earners leave the tax base without leaving the economy, cities face pressure to lower taxes without lowering obligations. The burden of funding schools, transit, parks and public safety shifts to those who remain. Established cities and rising stars alike are caught in this trap.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cities cannot simply chase mobile residents by cutting taxes. That is a losing game. National governments are unlikely to solve this problem, and in any case it plays out at a global scale. Cities will have to respond on their own by rethinking what they tax. If income and wealth can move, cities must focus on what cannot: land and property, consumption and entertainment, visitors and tourism, commuters and employment, companies that operate locally and anchor institutions that are rooted in place.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For decades, great cities benefited from a relatively captive tax base. That constraint has now weakened — and in many cases, it has been broken. Cities can respond to this new competition, or they can choose not to. But they cannot opt out.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>--</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Richard Florida is a Distinguished Visiting Professor at Vanderbilt University, a University Professor at the University of Toronto, and a Distinguished Fellow at The Kresge Foundation.

Guidance incorporates assumptions of stable or improving operator performance and no major disruptions, consistent with disclosure standards under NI 51-102 and, where applicable, National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") for technical information.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Attributable Gold Equivalent Ounces (GEOs)</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a royalty and streaming company focused on precious metals, the Company's performance is inherently tied to production volumes and metal prices, which are volatile; accordingly, emphasis is placed on attributable gold equivalent ounces (\"GEOs\") sales as a primary metric to reflect production exposure. For streams, guidance reflects GEOs that have been delivered from the operators of our assets. Our GEO deliveries may differ from operators' production based on timing of deliveries and due to recovery and payability factors. GEO sales may differ from GEO deliveries based on the timing of the sales. For royalties, GEO guidance reflects the timing of royalty payments or accruals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Empress expects attributable GEOs of 7,045 to 7,430 for fiscal 2026. This range represents the Company's diversified exposure across gold and silver calculated using conservative conversion ratios based on assumed commodity prices of $4,000/oz gold and $70/oz silver. GEOs are emphasized as the core metric, as they directly reflect the underlying production from operators and reduce dependency on volatile spot prices for performance evaluation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Assumptions and Basis for Guidance</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The 2026 Guidance is based on public and non-public forecasts, other disclosure by the owners and operators of our assets, internal analysis of historical performance, and management's understanding of the underlying producing assets. Additionally, the Company may receive information from the owners and operators of the properties, which the Company is not permitted to disclose to the public pursuant to the underlying agreement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Key assumptions include:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Annual increases in revenue if metals prices continue to be in the range of $4,000oz gold and $70/oz silver, and/or operating improvements are made at the underlying assets, and/or additional assets are added to the stream and royalty portfolio;</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Production estimates reliant on operator guidance under NI 43-101-compliant reports and other non-public technical information and no material production interruptions;</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>No major new acquisitions or divestitures beyond those already announced, though the Company continues to actively evaluate opportunities; and</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Currency exchange rates and tax considerations consistent with current levels.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Sensitivity</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The success of the Company in 2025 was based on a small number of investments and a significant increasing trend in gold and silver prices. There is no guarantee that this trend will continue in 2026. Given the volatile nature of gold and silver markets, an increase or decrease in gold or silver prices could impact attributable GEO values and related revenue considerably.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Risks and Uncertainties</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Achievement of this guidance is subject to various risks, including but not limited to commodity price volatility (a primary concern given the small number of investments), operator-specific challenges (e.g., production delays), geopolitical factors, and environmental considerations.

The Steiglitz 43-101 Report is also available under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About the Steiglitz Project</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Steiglitz Project is located approximately halfway between Geelong and Ballarat, about 80 km west of Melbourne in Victoria State, within one of Australia's earliest quartz-vein (hard-rock) goldfields. Victoria is the largest gold producing state in Australia, has produced 33% of all gold mined in Australia in history, and currently has 13 goldfields that have each produced over 1 million ounces of gold.(2) </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Steiglitz Project covers Exploration Licence (\"EL\") 6164, encompassing 53 km² across 51 graticular sections. The Steiglitz Project lies in the Bendigo Zone of the Lachlan Fold Belt, host to world-class Fosterville gold deposits. Gold mineralization at Steiglitz occurs as earlier mesozonal quartz veins overprinted by later epizonal quartz veins in tightly folded Ordovician turbidites and is expressed in two principal styles: </span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Numerous high-grade, gold-antimony-arsenic mineralized narrow quartz veins striking north-south parallel to regional folding; and </span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Stockwork zones associated with the northeast striking Hanover Fault, a mineralized shear zone bearing gold-antimony-arsenic assemblages. </span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Both styles of deposits have evidence of epizonal orogenic mineralization due to their gold and antimony association, quartz vein textures and also due to the regional structural geology setting being due south of Agnico-Eagle's epizonal orogenic high grade Fosterville gold mine hosting 1.7 million ounces gold (Proven &amp; Probable Reserves), 1.5 million ounces gold (Measured &amp; Indicated Resources), and 1.8 million ounces (Inferred Resources) in resources.(3)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Steiglitz was a top-ten producer in the historic Bendigo belt, yielding approximately 250,800 oz of gold at a recovered grade of 38 g/t Au between 1855 and 1911.(4) The Steiglitz Project area includes numerous past-producing mines - Alliance, Hanover, and North Birmingham, which operated to relatively shallow depths. The deepest mine was North Birmingham with a shaft to 233m depth, while other mines were generally less than 100m depth, which makes for a set of attractive exploration drilling targets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Modern exploration has included soil and rock-chip geochemistry, IP geophysics, LiDAR, limited RC and diamond drilling (5 holes), and geological mapping. Work to date highlights multiple untested targets along both the Hanover Shear Zone and the north-south vein corridor, with strong gold-arsenic-antimony signatures typical of the region's premier gold systems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About the Pheasant Creek Project</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition to the Steiglitz Project, as part of the Transaction, the Company has an application for an exploration license on the Pheasant Creek Project, which is not a material property for the Company. The Pheasant Creek Project is located approximately 75 km northeast of Melbourne in Victoria State, Australia. The large 232 km2 project is comprised of Exploration Licence 008776. The Pheasant Creek Project occurs within the Melbourne Zone of the Lachlan Fold Belt, which is composed of Siluro-Devonian sediments and Mid-Devonian granitic intrusions. The Pheasant Creek Project lies immediately south of, and in similar geology to, the Sunday Creek discovery of Southern Cross Gold (market capitalization: C$2.8 billion(1)), which is an outcropping orogenic or epizonal dyke-hosted deposit. Southern Cross has drilled 220 holes over 97,553m (as at August 31, 2025) and is allocating A$60 million over a 200,000m drill program to the Sunday Creek Project. At Sunday Creek, there are 75 intersections &gt;50-100 g/t AuEq x width in metres and 70 individual intersections exceeding 100 g/t AuEq x metres, which are globally leading hit rates (as at August 31, 2025).(5) </span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:663.0857142857143px;aspect-ratio:1.1051428571428572\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tmx_newsfile:ef9a87ff4094b-1c293bc4ee70846b49369b79cf336bf1-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tmx_newsfile:ef9a87ff4094b-1c293bc4ee70846b49369b79cf336bf1-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#faf0e2\"/></picture></div></button></figure><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Figure 1 -

Tariffs are pinching margins, federal energy policies are a drag, and demand looks weaker than expected. There are no easy or immediate answers for those problems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Friday, residential solar developer Sunrun  fell 35%. Its decline followed washouts in solar manufacturer First Solar, and equipment companies Array Technologies and Shoals Technologies, which dropped 14%, 34%, and 31%, respectively, after reporting earnings earlier in the week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Invesco Solar exchange-traded fund fell 8% this week, marking its worst five-day performance since June.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bad news comes after a few months of relative calm, and even optimism. Solar stocks had a surprisingly good run in 2025, despite losing key tax credits in the large tax bill Republicans passed last year. President Donald Trump's policies have been negative for most renewable players, but not as negative as feared: the tax bill allowed projects that had already begun construction to receive access to the credits available under prior law, for instance. While homeowners can't get federal credits for putting panels on their roofs, those that lease the panels can still benefit from tax breaks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the solar industry now faces a reckoning from the loss of federal support, consumer reticence, and an increase in costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Residential solar has a particularly bad demand problem. Energy research firm Wood Mackenzie sees installations falling 18% this year across the U.S. The slowdown appears to have already started: Sunrun, which leases panels to homeowners, added 17% fewer subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2025 than it did in the fourth quarter of 2024. The company's leases pay off over time as its customers pay off their bills on a monthly basis. But it's costing Sunrun more to add each new customer — and the net value of each new customer was down 30% in the quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company's guidance for 2026 was also underwhelming. Sunrun's executives appear to be bracing for \"a more prolonged period of market contraction,\" wrote Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith, who downgraded his rating on the shares to Hold from Buy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump's tariffs are also starting to catch up to the industry. First Solar, Array, and Shoals all said tariffs hurt their profit margins.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>First Solar, an industry bellwether because of its size and status as the largest U.S. manufacturer, has been having demand problems, too. Its backlog was down to 50.1 gigawatts at the end of last year, after starting the year at 68.5 gigawatts. The company had more \"de-bookings\" — including terminated or canceled contracts — than new bookings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>First Solar's fourth quarter marked the seventh straight quarter where First Solar's backlog declined sequentially, according to Raymond James analyst Bobby Zolper. \"With respect to 2026 and 2027 guidance, shipment volumes, sales, and [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization], all missed prior views by about 15%, with the stock down by a similar amount,\" Zolper wrote, rating the stock at Market Perform. \"We would prefer to wait out the near-term negatives.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Trump's directive was issued shortly before the Pentagon's deadline for Anthropic to agree to broader military access to its systems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After that deadline passed, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he was designating Anthropic a supply chain risk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has refused to accede to Pentagon demands that would allow its AI tools to be used without the company's restrictions, particularly in scenarios involving lethal force, surveillance, or other high-stakes applications.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump said in a social media post that most federal agencies must immediately cease using Anthropic's technology, and they would have a six-month window to remove the systems where they are already embedded.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic has reportedly won a contract last summer that's worth up to $200 million from the Defense Department, The Wall Street Journal reported last month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic is a private company, so there is no publicly confirmed revenue figure for the firm. But Bloomberg has estimated that Anthropic's revenue run rate exceeded $9 billion at the end of 2025, which makes the loss of a $200 million contract trivial.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the impact of Friday's moves by the U.S. leaders goes well beyond government contracts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A \"supply-chain risk to national security,\" which Hegseth designated Anthropic, is typically applied to foreign companies. Rarely does the U.S. government label a major domestic company this way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the past, the Federal Communications Commission has named China's Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corporation as a national security risk to U.S. communications networks and supply chains.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Being designated a supply chain risk not only means no government contracts for Anthropic, defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman also can't use Anthropic technology.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Neither company immediately responded to a request for comment about their relationship with Anthropic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic,\" wrote Hegseth in the X post.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Traditional defense stocks might not react to the conflict. Investors should keep an eye on Palantir. It is responsible for implementing a lot of AI technology at the Pentagon and has collaborated with Anthropic recently.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Palantir didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Palantir stock was unfazed on Friday, rising 0.9% to $137.20, while the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% and 1.1%, respectively. Palantir shares were down 0.2% in after-hours trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Anthropic conflict could open the door for other AI labs — notably OpenAI, Google's Gemini, and Elon Musk's xAI — to gain additional business with the defense industry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last year, OpenAI was awarded a contract worth up to $200 million to \"develop prototype frontier AI\" tools for military and national security applications. xAI was recently acquired by SpaceX, which already does a lot of business with the U.S. military and NASA.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But they will face the same discussions over terms for classified use of their models.
