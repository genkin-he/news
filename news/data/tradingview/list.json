High-grade gold and silver veins were discovered in the area in the 1880s and were mined mainly in the late 1920s and 1930s. Underground development on the Rosebud property included a 400-foot shaft and approximately 2,500 feet of drifts, raises and crosscuts. The Company believes that further exploration, drilling and sampling along strike and depth extensions of existing and additional vein structures is essential to fully evaluate the project's potential.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>For further information, please contact:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Simon D.
