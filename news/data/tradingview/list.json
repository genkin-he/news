Nelson and Meghan Bobrowsky</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LOS ANGELES — The plaintiff in a landmark trial over whether the design of social-media apps can foster addiction in children told a jury Thursday that using YouTube and Instagram had contributed to her social isolation and mental health issues, including anxiety, body dysmorphia and depression.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The 20-year-old woman, described in court as Kaley G.M., took the witness stand after nearly three weeks of testimony in the civil case. She uses a shortened version of her name in court because the case was filed by her mother when she was a minor.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wearing a pink dress and an oversize pink cardigan, Kaley G.M. told the jury that she started watching YouTube videos at age 6 and made an Instagram account at age 9. She and her attorneys said that she uploaded more than 200 YouTube videos before she turned 10 — and had created 15 Instagram accounts before she turned 15.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mark Lanier, the attorney for the plaintiff, said that on one day as a teenager, Kaley G.M. spent 16 hours on Instagram.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I wanted to be on it all the time,\" she said. \"If I wasn't on it, I felt like I was going to miss out on something.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The lawsuit, filed against Meta, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube in 2023, is the first of more than 3,000 to go to trial in California. The trial's outcome is being closely watched by tech companies and by hundreds of plaintiffs and attorneys involved in similar cases, including some filed by school districts and state attorneys general.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earlier in the trial, Adam Mosseri, the Meta executive tasked with running Instagram, testified that the platform isn't \"clinically\" addictive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Thursday, Kaley said she inflated the number of 'likes' on her posts, \"because it made me look popular.\" She said she felt compelled to check YouTube and Instagram regularly. She bypassed screen-time limits and sneaked out of her bedroom at night to find her phone when her mother confiscated it, she added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Being without it, she said, \"would just send me into a panic.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>TikTok and Snapchat settled with the plaintiff in this trial before it began. The companies are still defendants in other lawsuits, and details of the settlements haven't been disclosed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act shields social-media companies from being held liable for most content posted on their platforms by third parties. The lawsuit being heard in Los Angeles, and other cases recently filed, aim to circumvent Section 230 by arguing that the design of the platforms — rather than the content published there — is what harmed children.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The outcome of the novel argument is expected to set precedent for future cases.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kaley G.M. told the jury that features of both apps, including push notifications for new likes and comments, gave her \"a rush\" and drew her back in when she wasn't supposed to be using her phone. She said that if she got a notification in the middle of the night, she would check her phone and then stay on the app.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kaley said she still sometimes goes to the bathroom during her shift at Walmart, where she works fulfilling online orders, to check her social-media accounts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's too hard to be without it,\" she said. \"Every time I've tried to stop, I've just been unsuccessful.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a teenager, she said, she rarely posted photos of herself without filters to change parts of her appearance that she didn't like. Lanier showed one Instagram photo of a group of five teenage girls with a comment from Kaley G.M. that read: \"We look horrible, just put a filter on it.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>She began cutting herself at age 10 as a coping mechanism for depression, she said, and still struggles with body dysmorphia, a clinical disorder in which \"you see yourself fatter or uglier than you are.\" Kaley said it takes her three to four hours to get ready to leave the house.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The plaintiff's former therapist, Victoria Burke, testified that she diagnosed Kaley with body dysmorphia and social phobia, a type of anxiety disorder, in her early teens.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meta is working to convince jurors that the teenager's struggles were caused not by social media, but by other factors, including bullying at school and tensions at home.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meta lawyer Andrew Stanner said in court that notes from six months of therapy appointments with Burke didn't mention social-media addiction or name any social-media apps. Burke told the court that social-media addiction isn't listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, typically used by clinicians to diagnose mental illness.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Social media could \"make or break\" the teenager's emotional state before a therapy appointment, Burke said in court.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg  testified last week that the social-media company aims to give users something useful, not addict them, and that Meta's policies prohibit users under 13 from using its platforms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We used to give teams goals on time spent [on platforms] and we don't do that anymore because I don't think that's the best way to do it,\" Zuckerberg said. He also said that Meta's platforms continue to evolve.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Laura J.

The stock’s muted response appears linked to accounting changes and near—term EPS adjustments, rather than any deterioration in demand.

There are new purpose-built workers accommodation capacity additions at Westlite Toh Guan and Westlite Mandai in Singapore and purpose-built students accommodation capacity in Sydney. The REIT says it expects continued structural support for its PBWA portfolio, driven by sustained foreign labor demand and constrained supply conditions. The outlook for its U.K. and Australian PBSA portfolio remains underpinned by macro drivers. The brokerage raises the trust's target price to S$1.55 from S$1.23 with an unchanged buy rating.
