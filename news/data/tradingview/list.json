In a new research note titled “Reluctant Bulls: Sentiment vs Positioning”, the bank measures the mood among institutional investors, noting an environment of uneasy participation. As the report’s authors put it, “we have been struck by the nagging concerns related to valuation, bubbles, credit and macros … yet allocations to US large cap equities appear steadfast.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The result, Citi argues, is a market climbing a classic “wall of worry” – and, crucially, one that may still have further to run.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nervous investors, committed capital</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Citi’s strategists – Scott Chronert, Drew Pettit and Patrick Galvin – recently completed a round of client meetings across the US and Australasia. What they found was not a roomful of raging bulls, but an audience quietly fretting about valuations and the sustainability of the AI-fuelled rally.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“Valuation. Bubble. Valuation. Bubble,” the report begins, reflecting the repetitive cadence of investor responses. Even as global stock markets have rallied strongly this year, the conversations keep circling back to the same fears – that AI enthusiasm is overheated, that credit risks are building, and that labour-market resilience may not last.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And yet, despite this laundry list of worries, investors remain heavily allocated to equities. Citi’s own Levkovich Index – its long-running “Panic/Euphoria” gauge – shows positioning euphoria at levels comparable to the post-pandemic rebound. But that stands “in sharp contrast to a more nervous tone evident in our client discussions,” the analysts note. “Thus, the notion of reluctant bulls seems a more appropriate description for many investors in the current market environment.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The underlying reason, Citi argues, is structural. Many global investors have little choice but to remain invested in US stocks. Domestic markets lack depth, liquidity and diversification, and the US still accounts for roughly 63% of the MSCI All Country World Index. For pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, opting out on the basis of one’s fears simply isn’t an option.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That reliance, Citi says, has created a peculiar mix of psychological caution and mechanical commitment – a generation of fund managers haunted by the memory of the tech bubble and GFC, but compelled by mandate to keep buying. “Even as markets have climbed higher,” Citi notes, “we have not seen bullish spikes in survey data … sentiment remains fairly neutral to slightly net bearish despite a solid climb from April lows.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They add that mutual-fund and ETF allocations to US equities remain well above ten-year medians – yet a “barbell” has developed where cash holdings in money-market funds have also risen. In practice, this means investors are both risk-on and risk-averse at the same time: they’re buying the market because they must, but they’re hedging with cash buffers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Citi’s US stock market targets</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So, what does Citi recommend for investors looking to allocate capital to US equities? Despite acknowledging stretched valuations, the bank maintains an overall constructive stance, albeit with an emphasis on quality growth and selective positioning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Base case: S&amp;P 500 at 6,600 by year-end 2025, based on 21.4 times forecast 2026 earnings of US$308 per share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bull case: 7,200, assuming stronger 2026 earnings of US$316 and a richer 23 times multiple.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The S&amp;P 500 closed at 6,890 on Wednesday, so Citi’s forecasts are hardly inspiring. Further, the bank notes the potential for downside should the earnings growth required to keep investors climbing the wall of worry not materialise: “We believe this ‘reluctant bull’ description sets up for a wall of worry whereby incrementally positive fundamentals will be rewarded – but disappointments will be seized upon with selling,” the analysts write.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We are entering a more volatile stage of this bull market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Where Citi is adding and reducing risk now</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beyond short-term targets, Citi’s global asset-allocation team, led by Dirk Willer, has assessed the shifting risk landscape and issued its latest “house view” on where investors should be adding or cutting exposure. The message: stay pro-risk, stay selective, and keep the AI theme central to portfolio construction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adding to equities – particularly the US and China: Citi remains overweight global equities, with a clear preference for the United States and China. The team believes the AI-driven growth story is far from over and that “Fed cuts engineering another soft landing” should extend the cycle into 2026. They call this “early-bubble bullishness” – still supportive rather than speculative. In contrast, the UK remains a key underweight due to its defensive market composition and limited AI exposure</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Staying short credit: Citi continues to view investment-grade credit as a macro hedge, arguing that “credit will benefit much less from a continued AI boom” and offers protection if the U.S. economy slows. Their strategists warn that “recent high-profile credit blow-ups have reaffirmed our view” and that the best risk-adjusted hedge for equity portfolios remains short U.S. and European IG credit</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rotating within commodities: Citi is switching from gold to base metals. After a powerful run-up, Citi has downgraded gold to neutral and upgraded base metals to overweight, citing “debasement fears overdone” and renewed optimism for global growth into 2026. Copper and aluminium are seen as major beneficiaries of the global AI infrastructure build-out, while gold’s “consensus long positioning” makes it vulnerable to profit-taking</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Remaining long emerging markets and emerging market local bonds: Citi prefers emerging-market duration and FX carry trades, where volatility has eased and positioning remains “clean.” With the Fed expected to cut twice more this year, EM local bonds and currencies are expected to outperform relative to developed-market peers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The net result: Citi remains pro-risk but pragmatic – bullish on equities, cautious on credit, constructive on commodities, and patient on duration. In their words, “additional risk should be deployed for year end, if we can have a decent US earnings season.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Wall of Worry</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nervous sentiment, the strategists argue, is not a contrarian signal of imminent collapse but a sign of durability. “Markets will continue to navigate euphoric positioning through the lens of quizzical, unsettled sentiment,” they write. “If incremental fundamentals prove supportive, this may define a classic wall of worry.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For readers unfamiliar with the phrase, it’s often said that “every bull market climbs a wall of worry”. This means prices keep rising not because everyone is confident, but precisely because so many investors are still anxious – about valuations, earnings, geopolitics, or the next downturn. That scepticism prevents markets from overheating too soon and it leaves sidelined cash ready to chase every dip.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The paradox of the reluctant bull is that scepticism itself becomes fuel for the rally. As long as investors doubt its staying power, cash will remain on the sidelines, providing the latent demand required to keep stock prices climbing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In my experience, it’s when confidence turns to complacency that risk truly builds. Citi’s report suggests we’re nowhere near that point yet – today’s investors are not dancing on the table – they’re worrying about valuations, about bubbles, and about history repeating. But they still have to buy – because not buying isn’t an option.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And that’s the cruel irony of professional money management. Sitting in cash during a bull market is a miserable state that no fund manager would wish on their worst enemy! Their job is to invest – and preferably to beat the market. If they don’t invest, they’re not really doing their job. So, reluctantly or otherwise, they will keep buying.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(References: Citi Research, “US Equity Strategy: Reluctant Bulls – Sentiment vs Positioning”, 24 Oct 2025; “Global Asset Allocation: House Views – October 2025”, 23 Oct 2025)</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Richard Rubin</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WASHINGTON — Newly disclosed documents show how immigration officials pressed the Internal Revenue Service earlier this year for quick, expansive disclosures of sensitive taxpayer information such as bank names and employers as the government pursued mass deportations — and how the IRS pushed back.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement triggered months of angst, executive departures and legal debates inside the IRS. The ICE efforts to obtain taxpayer information were reported earlier this year and spurred objections from taxpayer-privacy advocates and Democrats. The documents filed in federal court this week shed new light on months of back-and-forth talks among government officials.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The tax agency moved from flat rejection of February's broad requests to a much narrower August disclosure. The IRS found more than 47,000 matches of name-and-address information from a list of 1.3 million provided by ICE. Immigration authorities haven't said whether or how they are using that information, but up-to-date tax records could help them more easily locate people who have stayed in the country despite deportation orders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Federal courts are reviewing the IRS actions to determine whether the agency complied with taxpayer privacy laws and other requirements. Partially redacted documents released in one case in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia show the tension within the government as the Trump administration tried to break down the typical barriers between agencies and legal restrictions on data sharing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The paper trail starts in mid-February, with IRS Criminal Investigation Chief Guy Ficco alerting senior executives to a call that his chief of staff had received from ICE. The immigration agency, Ficco wrote, was seeking taxpayer information to help locate 700,000 people who were subject to final orders of removal from the U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For decades, the IRS had been encouraging undocumented immigrants to file tax returns to boost tax compliance. The IRS assured people that it wouldn't share that information with immigration authorities. Section 6103 of the tax code protects taxpayers' privacy with criminal penalties for IRS employees who make unauthorized disclosures. It contains limited exceptions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Trump administration, which came into office promising mass deportations, changed the longstanding IRS posture, prioritizing data sharing across agencies and immigration enforcement over those tax compliance goals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After Ficco's staff told ICE that the IRS couldn't comply with the request, an ICE official said the issue would be elevated to the National Security Council, according to the documents. Within three days, then-acting IRS Chief Counsel William Paul wrote a legal memo concluding that the sweeping disclosures ICE wanted weren't allowed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That memo highlighted multiple problems. For one, it said, immigration actions are typically civil, not criminal, so they wouldn't qualify for one of the key exceptions to taxpayer privacy. Second, certain requests to the IRS must include a taxpayer address.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"In short, based on our current understanding of the facts, section 6103 would not permit IRS to disclose the address information sought by ICE to supplement its removal enforcement packages,\" Paul wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>His February objections pointed the path toward the eventual narrower disclosure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the moment, ICE officials were undeterred, according to the documents. In a Feb. 22 email to Treasury officials, an ICE official, Caleb Vitello, detailed the information that the agency wanted for each person on its list of 700,000. ICE sought taxpayers' employers, IP addresses, identification numbers, bank names, known relatives, aliases, phone numbers and emails.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We would like to have this data within two weeks,\" Vitello wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Getting even a small fraction of what ICE wanted took more than five months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The internal debate over the ICE request happened during unusual turnover at the top of the IRS.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In March, Paul was pushed aside as acting chief counsel. Acting IRS Commissioner Douglas O'Donnell retired in late February, just after the first ICE requests. His successor, Melanie Krause, resigned as the IRS-ICE talks continued. The tax agency's chief privacy officer, chief risk officer, chief financial officer and others all left.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By early April, IRS and ICE had reached a far narrower agreement in a memorandum. ICE would focus its requests on people who were subject to criminal prosecution, because they had stayed in the U.S. more than 90 days after a removal order. ICE would send lists of names and addresses, and the IRS would indicate whether its systems had exact matches for each person on the list.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That isn't how this authority had been used before. The IRS-ICE agreement led to legal challenges, including from the Center for Taxpayer Rights, which brought the lawsuit that led to this week's disclosures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"That exception, which allows the IRS to provide information for specific criminal investigations and proceedings, does not apply to the IRS's bulk disclosure of sensitive information, and ICE's request failed on its face to comply with the laws protecting taxpayer confidentiality, \" lawyers for the center wrote in a court filing. \"It is entirely implausible that ICE is conducting bona fide criminal investigations of over 1 million people.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The April agreement didn't lead to a quick transfer. IRS and ICE had to work out technical and legal details of file sharing. According to the documents, IRS and Treasury officials pushed back against ICE files that didn't contain all of the required information for each person, such as an address and specified tax years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As late as June 25, the IRS's acting top lawyer was pointing out multiple shortcomings in an ICE request for 7.3 million records. That request, wrote Andrew De Mello, didn't explain why the information was relevant to a criminal proceeding and didn't include statements from ICE confirming that it wouldn't be used for other purposes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Unfortunately,\" he wrote, \"the IRS is again unable to process this data file in accordance with the\" IRS-ICE agreement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Once ICE complied with those requirements with a request for 1.3 million records, it took another month for the IRS to test and transmit the data. The IRS found matches in fewer than 4% of cases — just 47,289.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By this point, De Mello had been replaced as acting IRS chief counsel by Kenneth Kies, who advised then-IRS Commissioner Billy Long to approve the transfer to ICE.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There is no need for a press release or broad disclosure of the fact that this information is being provided,\" Kies wrote to Long on Aug. 6.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Long, who had a rocky two-month stint atop the IRS, approved the data transfer Aug. 7. The following day, President Trump removed him as IRS commissioner.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Rolfe Winkler</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple reported record sales and said it expects a big December quarter as customers race to upgrade to the new iPhone 17.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company expects total company revenue to increase 10% to 12% in the holiday quarter, Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh said, well ahead of Wall Street analyst expectations for 6%. Powering the jump is an expected \"double-digit\" increase in iPhone sales compared with the prior year period, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>IPhone sales of $49 billion came in slightly behind expectations in the September quarter. Parekh said that the company suffered supply constraints on several models. On Apple's earnings conference call, Chief Executive Tim Cook said the constraints were because of very strong demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple shares rose around 3% in after-hours trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After years of sluggish growth, this is the second consecutive quarter in which iPhone revenue increased compared with the same period last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company said it is increasing investments in artificial intelligence, noting that as a reason why operating expenses in the December period are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion higher than analysts' forecasts. Such spending remains a fraction of rivals' AI investments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total revenue came in at $102.5 billion for the quarter, about 8% higher than the year-ago period and slightly above Wall Street's expectation of $102.2 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before Apple's earnings report, early data pointed to success for the iPhone 17, which customers rushed to buy as soon as it was released last month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a third-party analyst firm, said it observed \"great interest in the Pro and Pro Max models, while the new iPhone 17 Air model showed virtually no sign of traction.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cook declined to answer a question on the earnings call about how the Air is selling relative to other iPhone 17 models. Parekh said that supply constraints in the September quarter affected iPhone 16 and 17 models.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One disappointment from the September quarter was sales in China, which fell compared with the prior year period. Apple has struggled in the region in recent years as rivals have grabbed market share. Cook said the company expects to return to growth in China in the holiday quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple also reached a milestone for its services business, surpassing $100 billion in revenue for the fiscal year that ended in September, the first time it has crossed that mark. Services generate higher profit margins than device sales. They include fees from sales of apps, payments from Google to be the search provider in Apple's Safari browser and various subscriptions including Apple Music and Apple TV.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company dodged a potential threat to its bottom line when a judge ruled that Alphabet's Google could continue paying to have search results displayed in Apple's Safari browser. Google pays Apple more than $20 billion under their contract, nearly all of which falls to Apple's bottom line, meaning the payments account for a fifth of Apple's operating profit, analysts estimate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Services revenue, which includes the Google payments, jumped 15% compared with last year's September quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earlier Thursday, Apple got another bit of good news when President Trump declared that he was halving the 20% fentanyl-related tariffs on China as part of a preliminary trade deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That tariff is the only one Apple pays on products it imports to the U.S., after Trump previously exempted the company from other levies in exchange for its commitment to invest more domestically.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company said it paid $1.1 billion in costs related to tariffs in the September quarter and projected $1.4 billion in such costs in the December quarter, though the projection doesn't take account of Trump's reduced tariffs announced earlier Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Should Trump make the preliminary deal official with an executive order, it could lead to substantial tariff savings on iPhones imported from China, where the company still makes many of its higher-end late model iPhones like the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. Final assembly of lower-end and older iPhones imported to the U.S. has shifted to India, where Apple isn't subject to tariffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Rolfe Winkler at Rolfe.Winkler@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
