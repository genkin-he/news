            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Daqo New Energy posted its first positive EBITDA in six quarters during Q3 2025, reporting $45.8 million in adjusted earnings as polysilicon prices recovered from $4.19/kg to $5.80/kg. The company sold 42,406 metric tons against production of just 30,650 MT, drawing down inventory accumulated during the brutal downturn that saw prices collapse 85% from 2022's $39/kg peak. With zero debt and $2.21 billion in cash and investments, Daqo possesses the balance sheet to outlast weaker competitors. But the company's 40% capacity utilization rate and production costs of $6.38/kg that still exceed selling prices raise fundamental questions about whether this cyclical inflection represents genuine recovery or merely a temporary reprieve in a structurally oversupplied industry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Business Model: Pure-Play Polysilicon Commodity Exposure</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Daqo operates a 305,000 MT annual polysilicon production facility in Xinjiang, China, using the modified Siemens process to produce high-purity silicon for photovoltaic manufacturers. Unlike vertically integrated competitors, Daqo sells exclusively into the spot market with no downstream wafer or cell operations to hedge commodity price volatility. The company has shifted its product mix toward N-type polysilicon, which now represents 70% of production compared to 40% in 2023. N-type material enables higher-efficiency solar cells and commands premium pricing, with Q3 2025 transactions ranging from RMB 49-55/kg versus RMB 32-35/kg for P-type material.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The polysilicon production process is energy-intensive, requiring 52-55 kilowatt-hours per kilogram at Daqo's facilities. This positions the company well below China's new mandatory energy consumption standard of 64 kWh/kg-Si, which took effect in September 2025. Producers exceeding this threshold must implement corrective improvements or face production restrictions. Industry estimates suggest 20-30% of older capacity may struggle to meet this standard, though the actual enforcement timeline and impact remain unclear. For Daqo, the regulation reinforces its cost advantage rather than creating immediate capacity rationalization. For Daqo, this regulation transforms a cost advantage into a regulatory moat.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Q3 2025: First Positive Quarter After Six Quarters of Losses</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Q3 2025 results marked a decisive turning point. Revenue jumped to $244.6 million from $75.2 million in Q2, driven by a 134% increase in sales volume and a 38% recovery in average selling prices. Gross margin turned positive at 3.9% compared to Q2's negative 108%, reflecting higher prices, lower production costs, and the benefit of inventory impairment write-downs taken earlier in the cycle. EBITDA margin reached 18.7%, up from Q2's negative 64%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The cost structure improved meaningfully. Cash costs declined to $4.54/kg from $5.12/kg in Q2, representing an 11% sequential improvement and the lowest in the company's history. Total production costs fell to $6.38/kg from $7.26/kg. Operating at 40% capacity utilization, Daqo produced 30,650 MT while selling 42,406 MT, depleting inventory by roughly 11,750 MT to reach what management termed \"healthy levels.\" This inventory drawdown was strategicDaqo capitalized on favorable pricing to monetize stockpiles accumulated when prices traded below cash costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, the company still reported a GAAP net loss of $14.9 million, driven by operational losses of $20.3 million and an operating margin of negative 8.3%. Adjusted net income of $3.7 million excluded $18.6 million in non-cash share-based compensation, underscoring that profitability remains fragile even at the elevated Q3 price levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Per-Kilogram Economics: The Unit-Level Profitability Challenge</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Understanding Daqo's economics requires dissecting costs and revenues at the per-kilogram level. In Q3 2025:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Average Selling Price</span></strong><span>: $5.80/kg</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Cash Cost</span></strong><span>: $4.54/kg</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Total Production Cost</span></strong><span>: $6.38/kg (cash cost + $1.84/kg depreciation)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Gross Margin</span></strong><span>: 3.9% (boosted by inventory write-off reversals)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Normalized Gross Margin</span></strong><span>: Negative when excluding inventory accounting benefits</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Cash costs of $4.54/kg represent a 78% cash recovery rate against the $5.80/kg ASP, leaving $1.26/kg in gross cash generation before depreciation. This $1.26/kg must cover $1.84/kg in depreciation plus all corporate overhead. With Q3 SG&amp;A of $32 million spread across 42,406 MT sold, overhead adds another $0.75/kg, bringing total cost to roughly $7.13/kg against $5.80/kg revenuea $1.33/kg shortfall.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company's full-year 2025 guidance of 121,000-124,000 MT production implies annualized capacity utilization of approximately 40%. At this utilization rate, Daqo's fixed cost burden remains elevated. Depreciation of $1.84/kg reflects assets designed for 305,000 MT annual output, meaning each kilogram of actual production must absorb 2.5x its proportionate share of fixed costs. Idle facility maintenance cost $0.16/kg in Q3, further eroding economics.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For Daqo to achieve sustainable profitability, one of three conditions must occur:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Polysilicon prices rise to $8.50-9.00/kg (47% above Q3 levels)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Cash costs decline below $4.00/kg (12% further reduction)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Utilization rates approach 75-80% to spread fixed costs</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Owner Economics: What Does Owning This Business Actually Mean?</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Viewing Daqo through an owner's lens reveals uncomfortable truths about commodity manufacturing businesses with high fixed costs and no pricing power. An outright owner of Daqo effectively purchases $6.7 billion in gross property, plant and equipment (depreciated to $2.8 billion net book value) operating at 40% capacity in a market where oversupply is forcing coordinated production cuts. The owner's return depends entirely on the polysilicon spot pricea variable beyond management's control.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consider the cash generation profile. At Q3's 40% utilization and $5.80/kg pricing, Daqo generates $53 million in quarterly gross cash ($1.26/kg 42,406 MT), or roughly $212 million annualized. Corporate overhead of $128 million annually ($32M 4 quarters) reduces owner cash flow to $84 million before taxes, maintenance capex, and working capital swings. This represents a 3.8% cash-on-cash return on the $2.2 billion market capitalizationworse than U.S. Treasury bills.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The asset turnover is equally concerning. Daqo generated $244.6 million in Q3 revenue (~$978 million annualized) against $2.8 billion in net PP&amp;E, implying 0.35x asset turnover. Best-in-class manufacturers target 1.0-1.5x turnover, but commodity businesses operating below 50% utilization structurally cannot achieve this. An owner is thus paying for dormant capacity that may never generate returns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The cyclical asymmetry compounds the problem. During upcycles, polysilicon prices mean-revert from oversupplied lows toward marginal cost, allowing efficient producers like Daqo to earn attractive returns for 12-18 months. But during downcycles, prices can trade below cash costs for years, as occurred from Q1 2024 through Q3 2025. The owner must fund cumulative losses during prolonged troughs, which can exceed the profits earned during brief peaks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Daqo's debt-free balance sheet and $2.21 billion in liquid assets provide crucial optionalitythe owner can survive extended downturns and potentially acquire distressed capacity. But this cash represents 98% of the current market capitalization, implying the market values the operating business at just $440 million ($2.64B market cap - $2.21B cash). Stated differently, investors are paying $1.44/kg of annual capacity ($440M 305,000 MT) for a business generating $1.26/kg in gross cash at 40% utilization.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The owner's worst-case scenario involves permanent demand destruction or technological substitution. If fluidized bed reactor processes mature to produce N-type material at meaningfully lower costs, Daqo's Siemens-based assets could become stranded. The owner would face a binary outcome: operate at cash-burning levels to maintain optionality, or permanently idle facilities and crystallize losses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Through-Cycle Economics: What Does Daqo Actually Earn?</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking at Q3 2025 in isolation misses the point. The real question for long-term owners is what Daqo earns across a full polysilicon cycle, not just at the inflection point.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Polysilicon completed a full cycle from June 2020 ($6.75/kg) to August 2022 ($39/kg) and back to late 2023 ($6.75/kg again). The upcycle lasted roughly 18 months while the downturn lasted about 16 months. Based on this pattern, here's what normalized economics look like:</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Mid-Cycle Assumptions:</span></strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Polysilicon price: $12-14/kg (midpoint between trough of $7/kg and sustainable high of $18-20/kg)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Capacity utilization: 65% (190,000 MT annually vs 305,000 MT nameplate)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Cash costs: $4.75/kg (modestly higher than Q3's $4.54/kg due to input inflation)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Total production costs: $6.25/kg (includes depreciation)</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Mid-Cycle Economics:</span></strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Revenue: 190,000 MT $13/kg = $2.47 billion</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Gross profit: 190,000 MT ($13 - $6.25) = $1.28 billion (52% gross margin)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Less SG&amp;A: $128 million</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>EBITDA: ~$1.15 billion (47% EBITDA margin)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Less depreciation: ~$300 million</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Operating income: ~$850 million</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>After-tax: ~$640 million (25% tax rate)</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>At $2.64 billion market cap with $2.21 billion in cash, the operating business trades at $440 million enterprise value. Mid-cycle normalized earnings of $640 million imply a 1.5x P/E on the operating assetsattractive if you believe mid-cycle conditions persist for 2-3 years out of every 5-year cycle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The problem is cyclical asymmetry. During 18-month upcycles at $18-20/kg pricing, Daqo might generate $1.2-1.5 billion in cumulative earnings. But during 24-month downturns at $5-7/kg pricing, the company burns through $200-400 million in cumulative losses. The fortress balance sheet matters because it funds the losses during troughs, but the operating business itself doesn't compound valueit redistributes it from weak cycles to strong ones.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the current $32.95 ADS price to work, you need to believe either: (1) this cycle's peak lasts longer than historical 18-month upcycles, or (2) industry consolidation permanently reduces capacity enough that mid-cycle prices settle at $14-16/kg instead of $12-14/kg. Neither seems obviously true based on China's track record of production discipline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Visualizing the Profitability Window</span></strong></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:993.2203389830509px;aspect-ratio:1.655367231638418\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/gurufocus:9f93845bc094b-0052b6c1a2b11e2bdea94467198cc4de-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"2023315380109484032.png\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/gurufocus:9f93845bc094b-0052b6c1a2b11e2bdea94467198cc4de-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#fafafa\"/></picture></div></button></figure><p class=\"\"><span>The polysilicon price cycle over the past five years tells the story clearly. Prices started at $6.75/kg in June 2020, surged to $39/kg by August 2022, then collapsed back to $4.19/kg by Q1 2024 before recovering to current levels around $8.30/kg. Plotting Daqo's cash costs ($4.50-5.00/kg range) and total production costs ($6.25-7.25/kg range) against this price history shows how narrow the profitability window actually is. The company operated below cash costs for four consecutive quarters in 2024, meaning every kilogram produced burned cash. Even at today's $8.30/kg price, Daqo barely covers total costs including depreciation. The chart makes obvious what the financials confirmthis business only generates attractive returns during brief 12-18 month windows when prices spike above $15/kg, which happened for maybe 15 months out of the past 60. The other 45 months were either marginal or cash-burning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Comparative Analysis: Daqo vs. Tongwei vs. GCL Technology</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Daqo's position becomes clearer when benchmarked against the industry's top two producers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Tongwei</span></strong><span> (910,000 MT capacity, 3.0x Daqo's size):</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Vertically integrated across polysilicon, wafers, cells, and modules</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Operated at 100% capacity utilization even during downturn due to internal consumption</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>H1 2025: RMB 4.96 billion net loss on RMB 40.5 billion revenue</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Q3 2025: Reduced losses to RMB 315 million from RMB 2.36 billion in Q2</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Cash costs estimated at RMB 35/kg (~$4.90/kg), slightly above Daqo's $4.54/kg</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Tongwei's vertical integration provides natural hedgingwhen polysilicon prices collapse, downstream wafer and cell margins expand. However, it also constrains strategic flexibility. Tongwei cannot easily curtail polysilicon production without disrupting its own wafer supply chain, forcing it to operate at higher utilization rates even at losses. This makes Tongwei the price-setting marginal producer; its cash cost of ~$4.90/kg effectively establishes the floor price below which the industry sheds capacity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>GCL Technology</span></strong><span> (480,000 MT capacity, 1.6x Daqo's size):</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Second-largest pure-play polysilicon producer</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Q3 2025: PV materials business returned to profitability with RMB 960 million profit vs. RMB 1.81 billion loss in Q3 2024</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Less transparent cost reporting, but industry sources suggest cash costs of RMB 40-45/kg (~$5.60-6.30/kg)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Operating rates between 30-60% during downturn</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>GCL's faster return to profitability compared to Daqo in Q3 suggests either superior cost structure or more aggressive inventory drawdowns. However, GCL's larger capacity and higher estimated cash costs mean it faces steeper challenges sustaining profitability if prices retreat from current levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Daqo's Competitive Position</span></strong><span>: At $4.54/kg cash costs, Daqo ranks among the global cost leaders, trailing only Tongwei's estimated $4.90/kg and well below the industry average of $5.50-6.50/kg. This cost advantage is criticalin commodity businesses, low-cost producers survive downturns while high-cost capacity exits. China's 6.4 kg/kg-Si energy consumption standard reinforces Daqo's position by forcing inefficient producers to either improve or shut down.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, Daqo's pure-play exposure means it absorbs full commodity price volatility. While Tongwei loses money on polysilicon during downturns, it partially offsets losses through downstream margins. Daqo enjoys no such buffer. The company's smaller scale also limits negotiating power with suppliers of silicon metal and electricity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Supply Chain and Input Cost Dynamics</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Polysilicon production requires three critical inputs: silicon metal, electricity, and coal. The math on input costs isn't encouraging.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Silicon metal represents the primary raw material at roughly $1.40-1.60/kg currently. It takes 3.5-4.0 kg of silicon metal to produce 1 kg of polysilicon, implying $4.90-6.40/kg in raw material costs. Forecasts project Northeast Asian silicon metal prices rising 7% annually, adding $0.35-0.40/kg to Daqo's cost structure by 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Electricity costs run $5.88-6.22 per MWh in Xinjiang, contributing roughly $0.60/kg to polysilicon production at 52-55 kWh per kg consumption rates. Daqo benefits from abundant coal-fired and renewable generation in Xinjiang, but seasonal variations affect pricing. A 2% annual electricity cost increase adds another $0.01-0.02/kg.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The compounding effect matters. With 7% annual silicon metal inflation plus 2% electricity inflation, Daqo faces ~$0.40/kg in cumulative cost headwinds by 2027. If selling prices stay flat at $8/kg while costs rise from $6.38/kg to $6.78/kg in 2026 and $7.18/kg in 2027, the already-thin margins evaporate. This is why the through-cycle analysis mattersinput cost inflation runs 5-7% annually while polysilicon prices historically mean-revert, creating a margin squeeze during the back half of every cycle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Valuation and Investment Framework</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>At $32.95 per ADS ($2.2 billion market capitalization), Daqo trades at 0.63x book value of $3.5 billion. This discount reflects the market's assessment that the company's assets cannot generate returns commensurate with their carrying valuea judgment supported by the operating reality. At 40% utilization and $5.80/kg pricing, return on assets approximates 1.3% ($84M owner cash flow $6.7B gross PP&amp;E), well below any reasonable cost of capital.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company's $2.21 billion in cash and investments represents 98% of the market capitalization, implying investors value the operating business at just $440 million. Stated differently, the market prices Daqo's production capacity at $1.44/kg of annual nameplate capacity ($440M 305,000 MT)a business generating $1.26/kg in gross cash at 40% utilization.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For Daqo to generate acceptable owner returns, the investment thesis requires belief in three sequential developments:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>First, polysilicon prices must sustainably exceed $8.00/kg to cover total costs including depreciation and overhead. Current prices of $8.30/kg represent meaningful improvement from Q3's $5.80/kg, but whether this level persists depends entirely on industry production discipline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Second, capacity utilization must approach 65-75% to spread fixed costs appropriately. At 40% utilization, each kilogram of production absorbs 2.5x its proportionate share of depreciation and overhead. Higher utilization dilutes this burden, but requires either Daqo taking market share from competitors or industry-wide demand growth outpacing supply additions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Third, input costs must remain stable or decline. With silicon metal prices forecast to rise 7% annually and electricity costs growing 2% annually, the cost structure faces $0.40-0.50/kg in cumulative headwinds by 2027. Unless production efficiencies offset these increases, margins compress even if selling prices hold steady.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Historical polysilicon cycles suggest prices above $9.00/kg attract new capacity within 18-24 months, limiting the duration of high-margin periods. Conversely, prices below $6.00/kg force capacity rationalization but inflict cumulative losses during extended troughs. The question for potential owners is whether Daqo's cost leadership and balance sheet strength position it to capture disproportionate value during the next upcycle relative to the losses absorbed during downturns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Risk/Reward Assessment</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The skew of outcomes favors caution. Bull case requires near-perfect execution of industry consolidation, sustained demand growth, and stable input coststhree conditions that must align simultaneously. Base case requires only moderate improvement from current state but offers limited upside given current valuation. Bear case requires merely a return to early-2025 conditions if consolidation efforts fail.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Polysilicon prices as of early January 2026 have continued recovering, reaching RMB 59,200/MT ($8.30/kg) with new orders above RMB 60,000/MT ($8.40/kg). This represents a 45% increase from Q3 2025's $5.80/kg and suggests the industry's coordinated capacity cuts are having near-term effects. However, sustainability remains questionable. The China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association projects January 2026 production could fall to 60,000-80,000 MT (from 115,000 MT in December 2025), but industry analyst Johannes Bernreuter cautions that Chinese polysilicon and wafer producers have historically failed to maintain production discipline once prices recover.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Conclusion</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Daqo New Energy has executed well within its controlachieving industry-leading cash costs, maintaining a fortress balance sheet, and surviving a brutal two-year downturn that forced weaker competitors into bankruptcy. The Q3 2025 inflection point demonstrates the company's operational excellence and cost discipline. However, Daqo cannot control polysilicon prices, which remain the dominant variable determining shareholder returns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The fundamental challenge is that Daqo operates a capital-intensive, commodity manufacturing business in a structurally oversupplied industry where China's top four producers control 65% of global capacity and built two-thirds of new capacity between 2020-2024. For shares to deliver attractive long-term returns from current levels, polysilicon prices must sustain $8.00-9.00/kg for multiple yearsa scenario that historically attracts new capacity and triggers the next downcycle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The current price recovery to $8.30/kg provides a tactical window for Daqo to rebuild margins and cash generation. Whether this represents a genuine inflection or merely a cyclical bounce will be determined by whether Chinese producers can enforce production discipline once prices reach profitable levels. History suggests they cannot. For investors willing to underwrite commodity cycles and bet on Daqo's survival as a low-cost producer, current valuations may offer value. For those seeking stable, predictable returns, the risk/reward profile warrants caution until multiple quarters of sustained profitability demonstrate the inflection is real rather than transitory.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Suddenly, what's old is new again.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> There's a popular trade sweeping Wall Street that's offering an old world solution to the threat of AI disruption: \"HALO,\" or \"Heavy Assets, Low Obsolescence.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> What that means is that more investors are betting that companies with hefty real assets such as grids, pipelines and heavy machinery are the ones least likely to be replaced by artificial intelligence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> \"I've come up with a term for the types of stocks that have run away with the stock market's gains this year. They are the HALO part of the market,\" investor Josh Brown wrote for CNBC earlier this month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> \"They have risks, but not AI risks. In fact, in many cases, AI will probably enable them to become even more profitable than they are today,\" Brown continued. \"So they actually go up as the LLMs advance.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> That idea is central to why many real world sectors are outperforming this year, even as the overall market and especially tech stocks have floundered. The two top-performing sectors are energy and materials, which are surging more than 23% and 15%, respectively. The third best-performing sector, consumer staples, has rallied more than 14%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Compare that to the market cap weighted S&amp;P 500, which is just slightly higher year to date.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Or even more worryingly, tech stocks. Only two of the \"Magnificent Seven\" names are higher this year, failing to rally even off the back of Nvidia's earnings beat, as investors worry their massive capex spending may not be justified.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Software stocks are lost in a bloodbath amid fears that advances coming out of Anthropic around agentic AI will cripple an industry reliant on scalability and high fees. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) is down more than 22% this year, and more than 30% off its recent high.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> And financials and commercial real estate are two other areas that have been hurt.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> The term has been quickly adopted on other parts of the Street. A note from the Barclays' trading desk last week said \"HALO\" names have benefited from the \"violent\" move into the more defensive parts of the market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Goldman Sachs' Guillaume Jaisson said that markets have been rewarding HALO, saying a basket of its capital intensive names have outperformed capital light stocks by 35% since 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> A note from the sales desk at Bank of America said HALO is a way for investors to avoid near-term volatility by taking advantage of a secular rotation into old economy cyclicals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> To be sure, there are many who worry that the panic selling that has defined the market as of late has been indiscriminate. As an example, some expect software stocks could be nearing a bottom, with some even emerging as winners despite the cascade of advances out of Anthropic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> In fact, tech is now about as cheap as consumer staples, suggesting the growth names are not nearly as overvalued as investors feared.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> \"The test for investors going forward will be whether [HALO] remains the correct investment as the AI narrative once again evolves, especially as the capex hump of hyperscalers is passed,\" read a note last week from the Barclays' trading desk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Yet the HALO crowd have reason to believe the trade is sustainable. Outside of a desire to escape the market's next AI victim, many HALO stocks have room to run after years of underperformance, can benefit from easier monetary policy and fiscal stimulus, and could even realize improved margins from AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Here are some of the HALO beneficiaries that Bank of America's sales desk identified.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple is just one of two Mag Seven companies that has eked out a gain this year, with the other advancer being Nvidia. The iPhone maker underperformed its cohort last year, yet investors are hopeful that the tech giant's foray into AI tied to its devices will revive the stock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Chevron is another example. The oil and gas giant, which is up more than 20% this year, was recently upgraded to buy at Melius Research because of an expected pickup in exploration.</span></p></span></div></div>",

The strait is crucial because it allows cargo ships to pass the Persian Gulf,  the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, facilitating the production and flow of crude oil from the Middle East. The region is home to five of the world's top 10 biggest producers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"So far, there is no clarity on the magnitude of any energy disruptions, but there has been some disruption of shipping in the Strait of Hormuz,\" said Matt Gertken, chief geopolitical and U.S. political strategist at BCA Research. \"It is too soon to gauge the impact on the oil market, but the intensity of the military operation implies high odds of a major oil supply disruption\" of 5 million barrels per day or more, he told MarketWatch on Saturday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. and Israel strikes on Iran targeted its leadership and military assets, The Wall Street Journal reported. The move followed failed negotiations between the U.S. and Iran to reach a deal to limit Iran's nuclear program.

So far, there has not been any official closure announcement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'Iran understands that sealing Hormuz is the economic equivalent of pulling the fire alarm in a crowded theatre and locking the exits for Middle East oil exports.'Stephen Innes, SPI Asset Management</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran, however, \"understands that sealing Hormuz is the economic equivalent of pulling the fire alarm in a crowded theatre and locking the exits for Middle East oil exports,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. \"It would hit not only Western consumers but also China and regional buyers. It is a blunt instrument.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Developments in the region are sure to impact oil prices as soon as trading resumes late Sunday and into early Monday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oil prices will continue to rise on speculation that the war will expand and that infrastructure will be hit, said BCA Research's Gertken. U.S. global benchmark Brent crude (BRN00) could reach $90 per barrel without significant physical disruption, he said. That would be a more than 20% rise from Friday's settlement of $72.87 for the May contract (BRNK26).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If there is physical disruption, then it can rise above $100 per barrel - \"potentially well above\" that, said Gertken.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Strait of Hormuz: A staggering chokepoint</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Just how much oil could be involved when it comes to the Strait of Hormuz and to the broader region is staggering.

Over 90% of that oil typically heads to Asia, around 4% to Europe, 4% to the Americas and the rest to Africa, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Four countries - China, India, Japan and South Korea - account for nearly three-quarters of the crude barrels that pass through the Strait of Hormuz, so they would feel the most significant impact, said Smith.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Middle East is home to half of the world's top 10 oil producers - Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Iran and Kuwait, according to the International Energy Agency.

DBV Technologies is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies, which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies, including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT), the VIASKIN® Patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV Technologies is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of the VIASKIN® Peanut Patch in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon, France, with North American operations in Warren, NJ.
