The economy contracted in August after growth was revised up a touch in July, and September looks to be on track for slight growth. Holt says that what comes out in the wash is that 3Q GDP is tracking at about 0.4% growth annualized, in touch with the Bank of Canada's just released forecast for a 0.5% expansion. And Holt notes the central bank forecast and the tracking estimate are rooted in different concepts, so you can't definitively that the Bank of Canada's estimate is off.

Revenue totaled $85.3 billion, falling short of Wall Street's call for $86.5 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But profit declined to $7.55 billion from $8.61 billion as the price of crude weakened and costs rose. Oil futures have declined 16% this year, and falling prices have weighed on Exxon's results.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, daily production rose to 4.77 million barrels from 4.58 million barrels a year ago. Analysts had expected 4.7 million barrels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We delivered the highest earnings per share we've had compared to other quarters in a similar oil-price environment,\" said CEO Darren Woods, referring to periods in the last decade when prices ranged from $65 to $75 a barrel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The stock was off 2.1% in premarket trading. It has risen 6.6% this year as of Thursday's close.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Peer Chevron traded slightly higher. The energy giant posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue in its third quarter, even as profit took a from lower oil prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is breaking news. Read a preview of Exxon's earnings below and check back for more analysis soon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Exxon Mobil is growing its oil production at a time of falling oil prices — a decision that has historically led to problems for energy companies. The wisdom of that strategy could be tested when the company reports third quarter earnings on Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So far, Exxon's moves have paid off. The oil giant has invested to expand production during good times and bad over the past few years, and investors have mostly rewarded the decision. Its oil-equivalent production — a metric that includes products like natural gas — is on track to grow to 5.4 million barrels a day by 2030, from 4.3 million in 2024. Shares are up 6.6% this year even though oil prices are down.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company is expected to report $1.82 of earnings per share, down from $1.92 in the same quarter last year. Results should be hurt by low oil prices, but helped by strong refining margins.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Exxon may need to make some tough decisions if international oil prices fall into the $50 range, however. They have dropped about 14% this year to a recent $64 per barrel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Photos of Huang sharing beers and fried chicken with Samsung Electronics (SSNLF) Chair Jay Y. Lee and Hyundai Motor Executive Chair Chung Euisun at Kkanbu Chicken went viral this week, setting off a speculative buying frenzy across South Korea's retail-heavy market. While Kkanbu itself isn't listed, investors rushed into anything that even smelled of chicken Kyochon F&amp;B soared as much as 20%, poultry processor Cherrybro hit its daily 30% limit with trading volumes nearly 200 times average, and robot maker Neuromeka jumped sharply. It's the latest reminder that in Korea, virality can move markets faster than fundamentals ever could.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But behind the viral moment sits a deeper play. Huang's trip to Seoul wasn't just about beer and banter it was about business. Nvidia has been pushing to expand its presence in South Korea, a crucial supply chain hub as the company faces tighter export restrictions in China. During his visit, Huang announced fresh AI chip deals with Samsung and Hyundai moves that could strengthen Nvidia's foothold in memory and automotive computing. For the Korean conglomerates, closer ties with Nvidia could mean a steadier supply of the high-end GPUs that power next-generation artificial intelligence systems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Huang's influence has become something of a phenomenon in its own right. Over the past year, several smaller AI firms have seen their shares surge after he casually name-dropped them in presentations. Now, his simple dinner outing has triggered a similar reaction only this time, it's a fried chicken rally. As Huang told reporters outside the Seoul restaurant, I love fried chicken and I love beer and I love fried chicken and beer with my friends. For investors watching the AI boom unfold, it could be another sign that Nvidia's reach cultural or commercial is still expanding.</span></p></span></div></div>",

The Riksbank looks set to leave rates unchanged at Wednesday's meeting and for a prolonged period after cutting rates by 25 basis points to 1.75% in September, he says. For the krona, good Swedish growth should make up for sub-2% interest rates, he says. As a risk-sensitive currency, it should also benefit from improved liquidity conditions when the Federal Reserve cuts rates, he says. \"Our target for mid-2025 is 10.50 for euro-krona.\" The euro rises 0.1% to 10.9256 krona.
