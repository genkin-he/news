There were 37.7% fewer homes sold this year than during the middle of the pandemic buying frenzy in 2021 and 31.2% fewer homes sold than during the last pre-pandemic year in 2019. Homes are turning over at historically low rates because of affordability challenges, sellers are unwilling to give up their low mortgage rates, and economic uncertainty.

Futures on the London Metal Exchange are down 0.8% to $10,843 a metric ton after climbing above the $11,100 mark earlier this week. The U.S. dollar index--which measures the greenback against a basket of other major currencies--is up 0.3% to 99.81, making dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for international buyers. The pullback comes as traders assess the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone on December rate cuts and the U.S.-China trade agreement. Yet, copper is still headed for a weekly gain of more than 5%, supported by concerns over global supply following a series of disruptions at major mines this year. Investors will be watching upcoming sentiment indicators from China due early next week for signals on demand.

Still, a 0.3% decline in August GDP \"certainly raises the odds of a technical recession,\" Davenport says. Oxford says it expects Canada's economy to struggle to grow in the coming months and remain vulnerable to further trade-related disruptions. Davenport says there's \"a chance\" of further Bank of Canada rate cuts should GDP and labor data weaken more than anticipated. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0932 ET - Disappointing monthly Canada GDP data won't prompt a change of course for the Bank of Canada, says Benjamin Reitzes, economist at BMO Capital Markets. However, Reitzes says the surprise 0.3% drop in August does reinforce BMO's belief that the risks remain skewed to the downside. The firm believes another quarter-point cut, in early 2026, is possible due to softness in the labor market, which would take the BOC's policy rate to 2%. BMO notes the wholesaling sector was particularly weak, down 1.2% in August, while the trade-exposed factory sector declined 0.5%.

The more credible next month's budget ends up being, there will be a corresponding increase in headwinds for the U.K. economy as a result of fiscal tightening, he says. That, alongside recent lower-than-expected U.K. inflation data, suggests an increased volume of Bank of England interest rate cuts, he says. This \"more than offsets any impact of risk premia being priced out of the currency.\" Sterling falls to a six-and-a-half-month low of $1.3099, LSEG data show. The euro rises 0.2% to 0.8817 pounds, matching the two-and-a-half-year high reached Wednesday. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0909 ET - Canada GDP data for August exposes the economy's weak underbelly, but the softness likely won't be enough to get the Bank of Canada to change course after signaling its easing cycle is done after this week's quarter-point cut, says Tiago Figueiredo, economist at Desjardins. GDP on an industry basis surprisingly fell 0.3% in August, and the early estimate is for a 0.1% gain in September--which Figueiredo estimates puts 3Q GDP largely in line with the BOC forecast for 0.5% annualized growth. Only 43% of sectors tracked have posted positive growth over the past 3 months, or well below the historical average of about 60%, the economist says. Still, \"we don't yet see enough weakness for central bankers to cut rates any further,\" Figueiredo says. (paul.vieira@wsj.com, @paulvieira)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0905 ET - The shock 0.3% decline in Canadian GDP in August isn't quite as bad as it looks, given temporary factors and an upward revision to growth in July, Capital Economics' Stephen Brown says. The advance estimate is that GDP inched up 0.1% on-month in September, which implies growth of 0.4% annualized for the third quarter. That is only trivially weaker than the Bank of Canada's 0.5% growth estimate, Brown says. But he says that does tilt the odds toward 4Q growth being weaker than the central bank's forecast of 1%. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0904 ET - Canadian output in August was much weaker than consensus, and the advance estimate for September indicates soft momentum at the end of 3Q. This bears watching, says CIBC Capital Markets, as the Bank of Canada predicts a pickup in growth in 4Q. All told, Canada GDP in August fell 0.3%, versus an estimate for a flat reading. Statistics Canada's early estimate for September is that GDPedged upward by 0.1%. That would translate into a 0.4% annualized 3Q gain, or slightly below the Bank of Canada's forecast for 0.5% jump. \"The lack of momentum towards the end of the quarter may spook policymakers somewhat,\" says CIBC economist Andrew Grantham. The BOC cut its policy rate this week, to 2.25%, and signaled it would stay there so long as the economy unfolds as forecast.

Chair Powell has dimmed the prospect of a cut in December and the government shutdown is depriving analysts of their usual signposts. Next week's Fedspeak includes Governor Cook on Monday, Vice-Chair for Supervision Bowman on Tuesday and Governor Miran on Friday. Trump is urging Republican senators to end the filibuster and reopen the government without support of Democrats. The 10-year yield is at 4.097% and the two-year at 3.609%.

A lower U.K. risk premia is likely to push gilt yields lower, Gkionakis says. \"Potential for reduced spending in the Autumn budget may cause yields to fall due to pricing out of risk premia.\" In addition, recent U.K. jobs, inflation and GDP data indicate that the economy is slowing, raising the possibility of the BOE cutting rates in the coming months, he says. Two-year gilt yields last trade at 3.762%. They fell to 3.744% on Tuesday, just shy of a 14-month low, Tradeweb data show. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0844 ET - Canadian GDP fell 0.3% on-month in August, a much weaker performance than the flat GDP economists expected. It comes after GDP expanded an upwardly revised 0.3% in July, the first growth in four months. The weakness in August was marked by a fifth contraction in goods-producing industries since the start of the year, including the first decline in mining and oil and gas extraction in three months and a slump in utilities activity thanks to worsening drought conditions. Services-producing industries also edged lower, the first decline in six months in part thanks to a flight attendants strike that weighed on air travel and the first fall in wholesale trade in four months. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0840 ET - Canada's economy tracking toward a modest recovery for 3Q. Industry-level GDP fell a sharper-than-expected 0.3% on-month in August following upwardly revised growth of 0.3% in July. Statistics Canada's advance estimate indicates GDP increased 0.1% in September. Based on that, the economy is headed for a 0.4% drop in GDP on an annualized basis for the 3Q after shrinking 0.7% on the same basis the prior quarter. More fulsome expenditure-based data will only be released late next month, but as it stands the economy tracking in line with the modest 0.5% growth the Bank of Canada forecast for 3Q.

Revenue came in at $4.55 billion compared with expectations of $4.35 billion. On an unadjusted basis, LPL reported a net loss of $30 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Like other wealth management companies, LPL is benefiting from the bull market that has enticed investors to trade stocks and add new funds to their brokerage accounts. LPL said total advisory and brokerage assets increased 45% year over year to $2.3 trillion. Total organic net new assets came in at $33 billion, representing 7% annualized growth, according to the company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Commonwealth update. San Diego-based LPL has been growing steadily through acquisitions and recruiting of financial advisors. LPL's acquisition of Commonwealth, which closed over the summer, has been closely watched in the wealth management industry because LPL competitors have been trying to recruit Commonwealth advisors. When advisors switch firms, they typically take most of their clients with them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While some Commonwealth advisors have left to open independent practices or join rivals such as Raymond James Financial, LPL executives provided a reassuring update during the company's earnings call late Thursday. LPL said it is on track to meet its 90% retention target; advisors representing nearly 80% of assets have agreed to stay with LPL.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Putting all of that retention aside, we feel over the moon with this transaction. Cultural alignment and complementary capabilities are creating a combined firm that is far stronger than the sum of the parts, \" CEO Rich Steinmeier told analysts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LPL anticipates converting Commonwealth advisors and assets to its platform in the fourth quarter of 2026. As LPL meets its retention target, that should free up staff and resources to devote to external recruiting efforts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"While organic growth has been below normal recently due to lower advisor movements and a reallocation of resources to Commonwealth, this should turn when macro uncertainty improves and Commonwealth is integrated,\" Jeff Schmitt, analyst at William Blair, wrote in a research note on Friday. \"The company is on pace for 22% EPS growth this year, and we believe it can maintain EPS growth around the 20% level through 2027.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Schmitt rates LPL stock Outperform.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Andrew Welsch at andrew.welsch@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jason Zweig</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tina is back.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tina stands for \"there is no alternative.\" Years ago, when interest rates were near zero and investors were acting as if stocks were the only choice, market strategist Jason Trennert of Strategas Research Partners popularized the term \"the Tina market.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The latest argument for Tina comes from a newly updated analysis by a team of researchers who find that retirement savers shouldn't own any bonds at all.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Instead, according to this line of reasoning, investors should keep one-third of their savings in U.S. stocks and two-thirds in international stocks. The researchers advocate that you should hold all stocks, all the time â€” not only when you're young and saving for retirement, but even after you retire, for as long as you live.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If only stocks were a sure thing. In financial markets, nothing ever is. You can't just take an analysis of the past, no matter how careful it is, and assume you can extrapolate it into the future.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To reach their conclusion, Scott Cederburg, a finance professor at the University of Arizona, and his colleagues Aizhan Anarkulova at Emory University and Michael O'Doherty of the University of Missouri, analyzed stock and bond returns from 39 countries from 1890 through 2023, taking the longest available period during which each was classified as a developed market. That's up to 134 years for such markets as the U.S. and the U.K., and as short as four years for Colombia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Their central finding, across the decades and around the globe: Bonds have historically tended to go up and down in sync with stocks over long periods, making them poor diversifiers â€” while offering low returns, to boot.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For that full sample, after inflation, Cederburg and his colleagues determined that bonds earned 0.95% annually â€” far below the 7.74% on U.S. stocks and 7.03% on international stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That means that most people who save for retirement in target-date funds that hold a gradually tapering mix of stocks, bonds and cash could come up short, Cederburg and his co-authors say.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This message comes at a time when investors are already taking Tina to the limit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the S&amp;P 500's record close of 6890.89 on Tuesday, U.S. stocks were valued at 40.5 times their long-term earnings, adjusted for inflation. According to data from Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Shiller of Yale University, that's the highest ratio in a quarter century â€” since the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"With valuations where they are, this may just be a tougher investment environment for current retirement savers,\" Cederburg tells me.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We're not trying to pretend that putting all your retirement money into stocks isn't risky,\" he adds. \"It's an incredibly risky proposition.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In fact, in earlier research, Cederburg and his colleagues looked at more than three dozen global markets back as far as 1841. Over all possible 30-year horizons, investors in those markets who held a domestic all-stock portfolio underperformed inflation 12% of the time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What about in the U.S.? Edward McQuarrie is an emeritus business professor at Santa Clara University who has studied long-term asset returns back to the 18th century. He found that U.S. stocks outperformed inflation in every 30-year period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, they did underperform bonds in 25% of all 30-year stretches, although many of those periods overlapped and most â€” but not all â€” were in the 19th century.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All this should point you toward an inescapable but often overlooked fact: Stocks are likely to be the best-performing asset, but even a high likelihood isn't the same thing as certainty. The odds are in your favor, but you will need luck on your side. We all will.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consider two hypothetical investors, each with $1 million invested in the S&amp;P 500. They both withdraw 4% a year, in equal monthly installments, for the next 20 years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One retires on Dec. 31, 1999, right before the bear market of 2000-02; the other on Dec. 31, 2002, shortly after that nightmare ended and a new bull market began.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The first investor would have a little more than $890,000 left after 20 years, calculates financial planner Allan Roth of Wealth Logic in Colorado Springs, Colo.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The second investor would have more than $4 million. (These hypothetical results don't count fees, taxes and inflation.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you happen to retire into a bull market, you could end up with more money every year even after you withdraw to support your spending. If you have the bad luck to retire into a bear market, you could end up running out of money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's why I still own some bonds ( in my case, inflation-protected Treasurys), and I think you should, too. The historical odds, and current government policy, are against them. But stocks also are far from a sure thing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tina feels friendly right now as stocks flirt with record highs. But over a lifetime, as I've written before, investing as if there is no alternative to stocks will demand that you have the patience of a tortoise and the emotions of a stone.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here's the ultimate trouble with Tina. Let's say the odds that stocks will outperform bonds in the future â€” if, but only if, the future resembles the past â€” are something like five out of six.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As investing author William Bernstein points out, \"That is also how often you win at Russian roulette.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Jason Zweig at intelligentinvestor@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
