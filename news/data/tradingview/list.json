Overall deliveries increased during the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period of 2024. Boeing 737 deliveries were significantly higher year-over-year due to the delay in deliveries during 2024 caused by the joint product verification process initiated by Boeing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Spirit's backlog at the end of the third quarter of 2025 was approximately $52 billion, which includes work packages on all commercial platforms in the Airbus and Boeing backlog.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earnings</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Operating loss in the third quarter of 2025 increased compared to the same period of 2024, primarily due to higher changes in estimates charges and lower program margins on Boeing programs, partially offset by lower excess capacity charges and a reversal of accrued liabilities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total changes in estimates in the third quarter of 2025 included net forward losses of $585 million and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $14 million. The forward losses in the third quarter were primarily driven by the Boeing 737, Boeing 787, Airbus A220 and Airbus A350 programs, largely due to supply chain and production cost growth. Unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were primarily driven by increased production costs on the Boeing 737 and 777 programs. Excess capacity costs during the third quarter of 2025 were $55 million. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2025, the Company reversed $48 million of accrued liabilities related to the favorable resolution of litigation with a former CEO. In comparison, in the third quarter of 2024, net forward losses were $217 million, unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were $26 million, and excess capacity costs were $70 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Third quarter 2025 EPS was $(6.16), compared to $(4.07) in the same period of 2024. Adjusted to exclude the incremental deferred tax asset valuation allowance, third quarter 2025 adjusted EPS* was $(4.87), compared to $(3.03) in the third quarter of 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cash</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cash from operations and free cash flow* usage during the third quarter of 2025 improved compared to the same period of 2024, largely resulting from the timing of working capital driven by higher Boeing 737 deliveries. The Company's cash balance at the end of the third quarter of 2025 was $299 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Developments in 2024 resulted in significant reductions in projected revenue and cash flows over the next twelve months. These developments include production and delivery process changes implemented by Boeing, lower than planned 737 production rates and the lack of price increases on Airbus programs. Although the customer advances received in 2024 and 2025 have provided essential operational liquidity, there can be no assurance that Spirit will be able to obtain additional advances from customers, repay current advances on the specified due dates, renegotiate the due dates or otherwise obtain additional liquidity as needed under acceptable terms or at all. We will need to obtain additional funding to sustain operations, as we expect to continue generating operating losses for the foreseeable future.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Management has developed a plan designed to improve liquidity. These plans are dependent upon many factors, including, among other things, the outcomes of discussions related to customer advances including the timing or amounts of repayment for certain such advances, achieving forecasted 737 deliveries, the timing and expected proceeds received from certain divestitures and the expected timing and outcome of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement with Boeing and the stock and asset purchase agreement with Airbus. Management is also evaluating additional strategies intended to improve liquidity to support operations, including, but not limited to, additional customer advances and restructuring of operations in an effort to increase efficiency and decrease expenses. However, there can be no assurance that these plans or strategies will sufficiently improve our liquidity needs or that we will otherwise realize the anticipated benefits. Accordingly, substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern exists.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pending Boeing Acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On June 30, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with The Boeing Company (the \"Merger Agreement\"). Upon completion of the merger, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Company would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to the completion of the divestiture of certain portions of Spirit's business related to the performance by Spirit and its subsidiaries of their obligations under their supply contracts with Airbus SE and other closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. In connection with the proposed merger, Spirit and Boeing have each received a request for additional information (\"second request\") from the Federal Trade Commission as part of the regulatory review process under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \"HSR Act\"). The second request extends the waiting period imposed by the HSR Act until 30 days after Spirit and Boeing have substantially complied with the requests or the waiting period is terminated sooner by the Federal Trade Commission.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Subsequent Events</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On October 13, 2025, the European Commission approved the proposed acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. by The Boeing Company. The European Commission had concerns that the transaction, as initially notified, would have significantly reduced competition in the global markets for aerostructures and large commercial aircraft. To address the European Commission's concerns, Boeing offered to divest (i) all Spirit's businesses that currently supply Airbus with aerostructures, including all necessary assets and personnel, to Airbus; and (ii) Spirit's site in Malaysia, which supplies, among others, Airbus with aerostructures, to Composites Technology Research Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (\"CTRM\"). The European Commission concluded that the transaction, as modified by the commitments, would no longer raise competition concerns, and approved of Airbus and CTRM as suitable buyers for the divested business. The decision is conditional upon full compliance with the commitments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Segment Results</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Commercial</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Commercial segment revenue in the third quarter of 2025 increased from the same period of the prior year, primarily due to higher production activity on Airbus programs. Operating margin for the third quarter of 2025 decreased compared to the same period of 2024, primarily driven by higher changes in estimate charges recorded in the current period compared to the same period of 2024. In the third quarter of 2025, change in estimates for the segment included $578 million of net forward losses and $11 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2025, the Commercial segment included excess capacity costs of $43 million. In comparison, during the third quarter of 2024, the segment recognized $213 million of net forward losses, $38 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, and excess capacity costs of $66 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Defense &amp; Space</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Defense &amp; Space segment revenue in the third quarter of 2025 increased from the same period of the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher activity on the Boeing P-8 program.  Operating margin for the third quarter of 2025 decreased compared to the same period of 2024, primarily due to higher unfavorable changes in estimates recorded on the KC-46 Tanker and Boeing P-8 programs, as well as higher excess capacity costs. During the third quarter of 2025, the segment recorded net forward losses of $8 million, unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $4 million and excess capacity costs of $12 million. In comparison, during the third quarter of 2024, the segment recorded net forward losses of $4 million, favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $12 million and excess capacity costs of $4 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aftermarket</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aftermarket segment revenue in the third quarter of 2025 increased from the same period of the prior year, primarily due to higher spare part sales as well as higher maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) activity. Operating margin in the third quarter of 2025 was consistent with the third quarter of 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financial Outlook</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In light of the Merger Agreement, and consistent with customary practice during the pendency of such transactions, Spirit will not provide guidance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Additionally, due to the Merger Agreement, no conference call will be held in conjunction with this release. Full details of the Company's financial results are available in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>* Non-GAAP financial measure, see Appendix for definition and reconciliation</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements You should read the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements appearing in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

information using U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), management believes that certain non-GAAP measures (which are indicated by * in this press release) provide investors with important perspectives into the company's ongoing business performance. The non-GAAP measures we use in this press release are (i) adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share and (ii) free cash flow, which are described further below. The Company does not intend for the information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Other companies may define and calculate the measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measures for comparison with other companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share. To provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share (Adjusted EPS). This metric excludes various items that are not considered to be directly related to our operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EPS as a measure of business performance, and we believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of our results. The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings (loss) per share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Free Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is defined as GAAP cash provided by (used in) operating activities (also referred to herein as \"cash from operations\"), less capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Management believes Free Cash Flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for stockholders, debt repayments including capital leases, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long-term value creation. Free Cash Flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures. The most comparable GAAP measure is cash provided by (used in) operating activities. Management uses Free Cash Flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The tables below provide reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures.</span></p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><span> </span><br/><span>                             Adjusted EPS </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>                                    3rd Quarter        Nine Months </span><br/><span>                                   2025     2024      2025      2024 </span><br/><span>                                  -------  -------  --------  -------- </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>GAAP Diluted (Loss) Earnings Per </span><br/><span> Share                            ($6.16)  ($4.07)  ($16.75)  ($12.93) </span><br/><span>        Deferred Tax Asset </span><br/><span>         Valuation Allowance </span><br/><span>         (a)                       1.29     1.04      4.28      3.24 </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Adjusted Diluted (Loss) Earnings </span><br/><span> Per Share                        ($4.87)  ($3.03)  ($12.47)  ($9.69) </span><br/><span>                                  =======  =======  ========  ======== </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Diluted Shares (in millions)       117.6    117.2    117.5     116.7 </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>(a) Represents the deferred tax asset valuation allowance (included in </span><br/><span>Income tax provision) </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>                    Free Cash Flow </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>                        3rd Quarter      Nine Months </span><br/><span>                       --------------  ---------------- </span><br/><span>($ in millions)         2025    2024    2025     2024 </span><br/><span>                       ------  ------  ------  -------- </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Cash from Operations   ($187)  ($276)  ($750)  ($1,258) </span><br/><span>Capital Expenditures     (43)    (47)   (144)     (107) </span><br/><span>                       ------  ------  ------  -------- </span><br/><span>Free Cash Flow         ($230)  ($323)  ($894)  ($1,364) </span><br/><span>---------------------  ------  ------  ------  -------- </span><br/><span> </span></pre><p class=\"\"><span>View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spirit-aerosystems-reports-third-quarter-2025-results-302601403.html</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SOURCE Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>(20:15 GMT) </span></strong><span>*Spirit Aerosystems 3Q Rev $1.59B &gt;SPR</span></p></span></div></div>",

Apple shares slip 0.4% despite reporting record sales. Major indexes extend their monthly winning streak as Fed rate cuts, hopes for trade deals and solid earning outweigh worries about any fallout from the government shutdown. DJIA gains 40 points, or 0.1%, to 47562, the S&amp;P 500 rises 0.3% to 6840 and the Nasdaq climbs 0.6% to 23724.

As the data drought continues, Fedspeak is likely to be closely monitored for hints on what lies ahead. Four Fed officials today expressed unease with interest rate cuts, worried about sticky inflation. Meanwhile, the Chicago Business Barometer rises more than expected, to 43.8, a number that still indicates contraction in the regional activity. The 10-year yield is down for the third consecutive month, falling 0.049 percentage point in October, to 4.100%. The two-year rises 0.003 p.p. to 3.605%.

EIA weekly reports show U.S. crude oil output at a record high above 13.6 million barrels a day. Ritterbusch sees OPEC's output increases, aside from regaining market share, as an effort to curb non-OPEC production in areas such as Guyana, Brazil and the U.S. \"But if WTI can occasionally lift back to above the $60 threshold, the oil rig count could remain stable.\" Natural gas rigs rose by four this week to 125, the most since August of 2023.(anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1302 ET - CIBC Capital Markets chief economist Avery Shenfeld says perhaps the Bank of Canada should have remained silent on what marks an appropriate interest-rate level, given the weak state of the Canadian economy. \"Has the Bank of Canada really run out of options, and does the patient really need to hear that just yet?,\" Shenfeld writes in his week-ending note to clients. The BOC cut its policy rate this week, and signaled that the easing cycle might be done. The BOC's forecast anticipates weak growth, and therefore sets a high bar for additional cuts, Shenfeld says. Yet the BOC forecast justifies an additional cut given the slow absorption of spare capacity, he adds. (Paul.Vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1255 ET - Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic says that he backed the Fed's quarter-point rate cut this week--a second straight rate reduction--only because he still thinks that the reduction leaves the Fed's monetary stance in a restrictive position that is leaning against rising prices. \"I was able to get behind it,\" Bostic says at a conference in Dallas. He acknowledges that earlier in the year, he had projected that the Fed should only cut once this year. But Bostic says he judged that the Fed's stance is still working to corral inflation, making him comfortable that the Fed would still be working against price increases even after this week's cut. \"I still think we're in restrictive territory,\" he says. Bostic isn't a voter on the Fed's policy committee this year.

At the same time, though, there is relatively low unemployment and higher-priced personal care categories are performing well. \"Against that mixed backdrop, our categories are growing at around 2%, which was pretty consistent with what happened in Q2,\" he says.

The Canadian railroad says 3Q revenue of C$4.2 billion was driven by an 11% increase in intermodal transport, which are containers that can be transferred between trains, trucks, and ships. Metals and minerals, as well as forest products were down, 6% and 4%, respectively, due to the effect of tariffs. Grain and fertilizers were down 2%, but CN expects a record 2025-2026 Canadian crop which came in later than usual. Shares are trading 3% higher.

Those trends plus a stagnant home sales market led to a decline in same-store sales. Taylor says consumers aren't trading down and haven't pulled back due to higher prices. \"They're buying the more expensive products and the better products. They're just doing less square footage and less projects,\" he says.

Newell Brands, the maker of Yankee Candle and Sharpie, says that consumer demand fell in 3Q in response to some of its price hikes. Newell Brands plunges 34% to $3.11.

Wall Street craves labor data to determine the likelihood of another interest rate cut by the Fed in December. An official tally will probably be missing next week because of the shutdown. Based on available data issued by states, Citi estimates that continuing jobless claims are increasing, suggesting that hiring remains low. \"We will be watching if continuing claims start to stabilize more in November and December,\" the economists say. A continued increase \"would suggest employment data may not stabilize in Q4/Q1 like last year,\" they say.

GDP in August fell 0.3%, or the largest single-month contraction since late 2022 and the biggest miss against market consensus in over four years. There was some so-called noise in the report, TD notes, such as the impact of a flight attendants' strike and drought conditions hampering electricity generation. Still, the August GDP data \"does not leave much buffer against a technical recession in September,\" and underscores to broadening of headwinds in 3Q.
