But Circle is basically a money-market fund with tech wrapping. If they're holding $500 billion to $1 trillion in Treasurys and rates move 100 basis points, that's a massive duration risk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We lived through Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). I watched \"safe\" Treasury positions blow up when liquidity disappeared. Why wouldn't Circle face the same disaster if they scale to Fed infrastructure levels? Or are you assuming they'd have Fed backstop facilities similar to the discount window?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Also, political question: Can you imagine [Sen.] Elizabeth Warren's reaction when a private crypto company becomes systemically important to U.S. banking?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Patricia</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dear Patricia,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You're asking the right question, which is why you're in finance and not a crypto influencer with a YouTube channel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yes, Circle faces duration risk if it scales to the $500 billion to $1 trillion range. And yes, SVB should terrify anyone paying attention. But here's the critical difference: SVB was a bank pretending to be a tech company. Circle is a tech company that would become, if my thesis plays out, a systemically important financial institution - whether they want to or not.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Circle gets Fed backstop facilities, discount-window access, FDIC insurance on USDC (or something functionally equivalent) and enough regulatory scrutiny that its compliance department becomes larger than its engineering team. It becomes a boring utility that happens to process a trillion dollars in settlements annually.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Will Circle's executives like this? Probably not. Will they have a choice? No.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Your political instinct is correct. Pick any regulator - they'd all lose their minds. But here's the beautiful irony: The solution to \"private crypto company becomes systemically important\" is to wrap it in so much regulation and government backstop that it becomes de facto nationalized.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Circle becomes the post office of digital money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Circle becomes the post office of digital money. Boring, essential, quasigovernmental and impossible to kill. Its executives will spend more time in Senate hearings than in board meetings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As for duration risk: If Circle reaches Fed infrastructure scale and doesn't have sophisticated risk management, it deserves what happens. But unlike SVB, it won't be allowed to fail quietly. Too many banks depend on it by that point. The Fed either backs it or admits the system was always a house of cards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I know which way I'd bet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Charlie</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>P.S. Somewhere in Circle's San Francisco office, there's a founder who dreamed of disrupting banking. That person is now filling out their 47th regulatory filing of the week. This is what winning looks like.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dear Charlie,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You explained Fed policy, made me laugh and validated my rage all in one article. That line - \"And you wonder why nothing works anymore\" - should be on a T-shirt.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>My insurance premiums are up 40%, my grocery bill is insane, and now I find out the Fed is losing $200 billion annually on a problem they created?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the Fed is this incompetent with banking system liquidity, why should I trust them with anything? Shouldn't I buy silver, gold and bitcoin and give up on the dollar entirely?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Peter</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dear Peter,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Should you trust the Fed? Of course not. They pay banks $200 billion a year not to use something banks actually need. Then everyone stands around, confused about why the system doesn't work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But distrusting the Fed and abandoning the dollar are completely different moves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Your landlord doesn't accept silver. Your insurance company doesn't take bitcoin. And the IRS will hear your theory about returning to the gold standard - right before they garnish your wages.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Fed deserves every bit of your skepticism. Your grocery bill proves it's either lying or incompetent, possibly both. But being angry at the system and having a workable alternative to the system are two completely different problems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One is easy. The other requires moving to El Salvador.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Charlie</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>P.S. I agree about the T-shirt. If I make one, I'll send you the first copy. Won't fix your grocery bill, but at least you'll look good being angry about it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dear Charlie,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Futures prices are already anchored in the stock markets, even without the eight-hour funding rate settlement. Technically, perpetual futures should function efficiently without the need for periodic settlements or payouts every eight hours.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Also, regarding the discussion about bank leverage, reserves, clearing and liquidity - it seems there could be a more robust approach. For instance, banks could provide security against the leverage they extend, drawing from their reserves, assets and collateral they receive from borrowers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Leverage providers could be incentivized throughout an ongoing perpetual-futures trade by receiving a nominal, dynamically adjusted fee based on the trade's duration. That would create a simpler, more transparent and self-sustaining system without generating systemic stress.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Patrick</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We're stuck with eight-hour settlements because changing requires admitting we were wrong, and financial people would rather eat glass.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dear Patrick,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You've stumbled onto something embarrassing: The entire financial system is running on technology designed by people who thought eight-hour intervals were sophisticated because they could divide 24 by three.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Perpetual futures don't need eight-hour cycles. BitMEX picked eight hours in 2016 because it was tidy, not because physics demanded it. It's the QWERTY keyboard of crypto - we're stuck with it because changing requires admitting we were wrong. Financial people would rather eat glass.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The funding rate simply needs to keep futures prices honest by making arbitrage attractive. DeFi protocols figured this out years ago. Perpetual Protocol does it every block - constantly funding settles in seconds. No more timing games. No more sophisticated traders opening positions after funding and closing before the next one, like teenagers sneaking home after curfew.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Why haven't Binance and Bybit adopted this? Because they're making money on the current stupidity. Never interrupt an enemy when he's making a mistake - especially when you're the one collecting fees.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now for the truly hilarious part: U.S. banks get free intraday overdrafts from the Fed. Zero cost. Just post some collateral and overdraw all you want, as long as you're square by 6 p.m.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Before 2008, banks paid market rates for intraday liquidity. This created what economists call \"discipline\" and normal people call \"not being morons.\" After 2008, the Fed decided to give away the store. Massive reserves, free overdrafts, zero price signals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The result? Banks are sitting on trillions in unproductive reserves because they have no idea what liquidity costs. Neither does anyone else.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Fed's own economists admit intraday credit has real value, but refuse to charge for it. It's like running a bar where the drinks are free, but you need a credit card on file. Everyone gets drunk and nobody learns anything.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Your proposal - dynamic fees based on duration, real collateral, transparent pricing - isn't radical. It's how perps already work. Crypto traders in 2025 have better risk management than Bank of America.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Banks could do continuous settlement. They could price intraday credit dynamically. They could manage collateral instead of tracking it in Excel like it's 1987. Technology exists. What's missing is the willingness to admit that the current system is a tire fire wrapped in compliance theater.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So yes, your idea works. And yes, it'll happen. Either because banks wise up, or because the next crisis forces regulators to stop pretending that free liquidity and moral hazard are sound public policy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I'm betting on the crisis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yours in fiscal anarchy,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Charlie</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>P.S. The really depressing part? Someone at the Fed likely has already written a paper explaining all of this. It's sitting in a drawer somewhere, gathering dust next to the report about how maybe we shouldn't have bailed out everyone in 2008.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Charlie Garcia is founder and a managing partner of R360, a peer-to-peer organization for individuals and families with a net worth of $100 million or more.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Agree?

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Gregory Makoff</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About the author: Gregory Makoff is the author of Default: The Landmark Battle over Argentina's $100 Billion Debt Restructuring. He writes the Substack ne wsletter Fool Me Twice.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That Argentine President Javier Milei's right-wing party, La Libertad Avanza, swept parliamentary elections on Oct. 26 is a blessing to many. For U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, it means that a big gamble paid off. For U.S. taxpayers, it means that a $20 billion loan will probably get repaid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It might be an early death rattle for Argentina's Peronists, however. The populist, nationalist political bloc, which led the country into decades of economic crises, is officially waning. That will bring relief to investors and the many Argentine citizens who despise the hold the party has long held over the nation's political and economic life.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Argentina's history of default is well-known. Practically since it gained independence in 1816, it has been caught in an endless loop of boom, bust, devaluation, default, and inflation. Less appreciated is that Argentina is periodically gripped by an urge to reform its ways.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the global depression of the 1930s, Argentina's federal government managed not to default when many others did. In the 1990s, President Carlos Menem successfully lowered inflation and privatized many industries. After defaulting on foreign debt in 2001, the government managed to run fiscal surpluses for six years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But in each case, the Argentina people reverted to voting for politicians who overspent — and crisis returned. It happened again in 2019, when the reformist government of President Mauricio Macri was replaced with Peronist politicians. Argentina defaulted for a ninth time in mid-2020.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Milei, a former economist, promised to end this cycle. Running for election in 2023, he said: Don't believe politicians who blame our problems on foreign creditors, adding: We spend too much and print too much money. And then, waving around a chain saw, he said: The solution is to cut government.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Inflation was nearing 200%, and the country was exhausted by financial chaos. For the first time in my memory, the Argentines didn't vote for a good-looking candidate promising handouts. They voted for a scruffy guy in a leather jacket promising pain now, gain later.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There certainly has been pain. Milei's austerity plan hasn't had long to work. He has dramatically cut inflation, but growth and investment are trailing. There isn't yet light at the end of the tunnel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So, Milei and his supporters were fearful of this fall's election. In particular, they were afraid of a repeat of 2019, in which a bad showing of Macri's party in primary elections cratered financial markets, virtually handing the victory to his Peronist opposition before the actual vote. To eliminate this risk, Milei got Congress to suspend the primary. But Axel Kicillof, the Peronist governor of the very Peronist province of Buenos Aires, had a move of his own: He shifted his province's provincial elections up to Sept. 7 — seven weeks before the national midterms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kicillof's move had its desired effect. In the Buenos Aires election, the leading Peronist party, the Justicialists, won 47% of the popular vote. Milei's LLA party won just 33%. Markets panicked like it was 2019. The Argentine peso dropped more than 5%, Argentine 2035 sovereign bond yield rose 15%, and the country's flagship stock index, the Merval, dropped 10%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Enter grandmaster Bessent. Either Argentina would deplete its foreign reserves, free its currency into a huge devaluation, and the Peronists would win the midterm election, or the U.S. would lend Argentina sufficient currency to head off a shock devaluation. Bessent's bet — a $20 billion swap line — was risky. Milei might lose, and the U.S. might not get repaid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But Milei crushed the Peronists in the midterms. It was a reverse of the Buenos Aires vote: Milei's party won more than 40% of the vote and the Peronists just over 30%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Peronists are now at their weakest point in recent history. At their peak after the 2007 elections, they occupied the presidency and held about 60% of the seats in both chambers of Congress. They are now down to less than 40%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But a grim outcome for the Peronist movement bodes well for investors — and for the U.S. and the International Monetary Fund, each of which has tens of billions of dollars on the line.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For stock, bond, and foreign direct investors, Argentina now presents a wide-open field. The looming problem since 2023 has been the potential that the Peronists would come back and overspend, confiscate private businesses, extend capital controls, and default on debts. As these fears dissipate, asset prices, foreign investment, and gross-domestic-product growth should rise. In turn, the probability that Milei's reform program will be completed is much higher. A virtuous cycle has been unlocked.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nobody can say for sure if this is all sustainable. But one optimistic thought is that the Peronist party's collapse in October could be a failure from which it may never come back. It isn't dead yet: Too many individuals and organizations are wedded to its beliefs. But, for the first time, we can contemplate its slow relegation to political irrelevancy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What would cement the case for that would be for Milei to triumph at the ballot box in 2027. Investors in Argentine assets should hope for that.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors from outside the Barron's newsroom.

The new Design Center expands that support by giving designers a space to feature their completed projects, turning inspiration into opportunity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"For decades, we have worked behind the scenes to help professionals bring their visions to life,\" said Randy Schuster, co-owner and partner of Vickerman. \"Now, we are giving those designers a platform to showcase their artistry directly to the people who want to hire them. It's about helping our partners grow their businesses while giving consumers access to proven, creative talent.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Design Center functions as a digital portfolio. Each designer can upload images of their projects, whether a 50-foot tree in a hotel lobby or a series of custom wreaths for a boutique retailer, and create a profile that reflects their style. Consumers browsing the site can view these portfolios, compare styles, and even filter by location to find professionals in their area. For national designers, the platform provides exposure to clients across the country who may want to fly them in for high-profile installations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>(Source: Vickerman)</span></em></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is not just a gallery; it's a matchmaking tool,\" Schuster explained. \"If a hotel in Chicago wants a designer who specializes in oversized commercial décor, they can now find them on our site. If a homeowner in Florida wants to replicate a project they saw online, they can connect with the designer who created it. That level of access has never been available in our industry before.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The launch of the Design Center builds on Vickerman's existing suite of digital tools created for professional efficiency and sustainability. The company's popular Ornament Calculator and Wreath Calculator allow designers to determine the exact number of ornaments needed for a given project, ensuring precision while reducing unnecessary waste. Ornament color sample kits help decorators present ideas to clients, while the project management feature allows designers to organize items for multiple installations and place orders only when they are ready to execute.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Everything we do is about saving designers' time, money, and resources,\" Schuster said. \"By ordering only what they need and being able to manage projects online, decorators work smarter and more sustainably. Now, with the Design Center, they can also promote the results of that work and attract new clients.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For consumers, the platform creates a more transparent and engaging experience. Instead of guessing what a decorator's work might look like, they can browse real-world examples, view multiple projects by the same designer, and make more informed decisions about who to hire. For designers, the exposure to Vickerman's web traffic, which tends to peak during the holiday season, represents a major marketing opportunity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is a big step forward for our industry,\" Schuster emphasized. \"We see ourselves as partners, not just suppliers. The Design Center is the ultimate tool to help our designers succeed, gain visibility, and grow their client base while continuing to bring holiday magic to life.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By launching the Design Center, Vickerman continues its legacy of combining tradition with innovation. The platform highlights the artistry of professional holiday decor while giving consumers direct access to the experts behind the designs, ensuring that every season shines brighter than the last.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Media Contact</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Name: Sam Schuster</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Email: sam@vickerman.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Source: The Newsdesk</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/272760</span></p></span></div></div>",
