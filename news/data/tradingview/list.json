The central bank on Friday said it would cut the risk reserve requirement ratio for financial institutions conducting foreign-exchange forward trading to zero from 20%. The move makes \"it less punitive for market participants to bet against the yuan,\" Maybank analysts say in a forex research and strategy report. The PBOC also set the USD/CNY fixing at 6.9228 today, much higher than median estimate of 6.8435, the analysts note. \"Along with the fix, it is clear that [the] PBOC wants the yuan appreciation pace to slow,\" they add.

Rapidus meanwhile is focused on the even more ambitious goal of making 2-nanometer logic chips.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To further safeguard its investment in the state-backed venture, the government will hold a so-called \"golden share\" in Rapidus, granting it veto power over board decisions to protect against economic security risks and foreign influence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A combined $1.07 billion investment pledge in Rapidus from 32 companies reflects renewed interest from the private sector too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The investment pool, which includes contributions from a broad range of domestic industry leaders, surpassed the government's initial projections for private funding.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The capital commitment \"exceeds the initial target of 130 billion yen,\" a sign that \"expectations for the project are clearly mounting\", Akazawa said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Yang Jie at jie.yang@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Ethereum has managed to reclaim the $2,000 level following a market bounce observed on Wednesday, providing temporary relief after weeks of persistent selling pressure. While the recovery remains tentative, holding above this psychological threshold may help stabilize short-term sentiment, particularly if broader crypto market conditions continue to improve. However, the sustainability of this rebound will depend largely on liquidity conditions and follow-through demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Recent CryptoQuant data adds an important structural dimension to this move. Ethereum’s 30-day Realized Volatility indicator on Binance has surged sharply, now approaching 0.97 — its highest reading since March 2025. This metric measures the magnitude of price fluctuations over time, and such an elevated level indicates that daily price ranges have expanded considerably.</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1066.6666666666667px;aspect-ratio:1.7777777777777777\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:889063fbf094b-4b208627a556f9bb9c52cc08b2d5a522-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"Binance ETH Volatility | Source: CryptoQuant\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:889063fbf094b-4b208627a556f9bb9c52cc08b2d5a522-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#f7e5d7\"/></picture></div></button></figure><p class=\"\"><span>Higher realized volatility typically reflects a market undergoing repricing rather than steady trend formation. Wider price swings can attract short-term trading activity but also increase risk, particularly in leveraged environments. Historically, volatility spikes often accompany transitional phases where markets search for equilibrium.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Volatility Signals Potential Inflection Point</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Elevated volatility during price stabilization often suggests that both buyers and sellers are aggressively defending key levels rather than a clear trend already being established.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From a structural standpoint, volatility spikes frequently occur when markets exit consolidation phases. Increased price dispersion indicates that capital is reallocating, derivatives positioning is adjusting, and liquidity is being tested across spot and futures venues. If this process continues alongside sustained demand, it can precede a decisive directional move as uncertainty resolves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, volatility alone does not guarantee trend continuation. In some instances, prolonged high volatility without a breakout simply reflects indecision, producing extended sideways ranges while participants wait for stronger macro or liquidity signals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At present, Ethereum appears to be near such an inflection zone. Historical patterns suggest that similar volatility regimes have occasionally preceded upward expansions, yet confirmation would require sustained price acceptance above key resistance and evidence of renewed capital inflows rather than purely speculative repositioning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Ethereum Tests Critical Support After Prolonged Downtrend</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ethereum remains under pressure despite a recent bounce toward the $2,000 area, with the chart showing a clear medium-term downtrend following the rejection near the $4,800 peak. Successive lower highs since late 2025 confirm a persistent bearish structure, while the price continues trading below the 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages. This alignment typically reflects sustained selling dominance rather than a transitional consolidation phase.</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:939.8907103825137px;aspect-ratio:1.5664845173041895\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:889063fbf094b-9aabf1ce500e103dcbe16565487f5dc6-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"ETH testing critical price level | Source: ETHUSDT chart on TradingView\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:889063fbf094b-9aabf1ce500e103dcbe16565487f5dc6-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#1b1e29\"/></picture></div></button></figure><p class=\"\"><span>The recent rebound above $2,000 appears technically modest so far. Volume expanded during the selloff earlier in the year, suggesting strong distribution, while the latest recovery lacks comparable conviction. Unless follow-through demand emerges, this type of bounce often functions as short-term relief rather than a trend reversal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From a structural perspective, the $1,800–$2,000 zone is becoming a critical support cluster. Repeated tests of this area indicate buyers are defending it, yet each rebound has weakened in amplitude. Persistent pressure near support increases the probability of a breakdown if macro liquidity conditions remain tight.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Conversely, reclaiming the descending moving averages — particularly the 100-day and 200-day — would be necessary to shift sentiment. Until then, Ethereum appears locked in a corrective phase where rallies are vulnerable, and downside risks remain structurally present.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com </span></p></span></div></div>",

It was also among the top trending tickers on Stocktwits as retail sentiment around the company improved to ‘extremely bullish’ from ‘bullish’ over the past day and chatter jumped to ‘high’ from ‘normal’ levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“MARA is no longer simply a Bitcoin miner. We’re building an energy-dominant digital infrastructure platform,” CEO Fred Thiel said on the company’s earnings call. He even invoked CEO Jensen Huang’s “compute equals revenue” line from Nvidia’s (NVDA) latest earnings call.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company announced that it completed its acquisition of Exaion, first announced in August last year alongside its pivot away from Bitcoin (BTC) mining.

It reported $202.3 million in revenue, below the consensus forecast of $251 million, and a loss of $4.07, well above the analysts' anticipated loss of $0.03.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“Having Bitcoin mining at the site allows us to act as a load balancer,” Thiel said. “We mine whenever power isn’t being used — at preferential prices.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Why Did MARA Partner With Starwood?</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to Thiel, the decision to partner with Starwood wasn’t about capability, but about credibility. “Hyperscalers typically do not award large-scale AI workloads to first-time developers without institutional backing,” he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He also said that the partnership gives MARA an edge over peers, who are building data centers but don’t necessarily have a client in hand. “You don't turn a spade until you have a tenant typically signed because that tenant has a specific use for the site,” he stated. “They [clients] work with Starwood to design, get it permitted, and build as opposed to building and hoping somebody will come, like some of our peers have done.”</span></p><div class=\"blockquote-xrkxvh37\"><p class=\"\"><span>“We are very focused on rapid execution with a lot of certainty.” </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>– Fred Thiel, Chairman and CEO, MARA Holdings</span></p></div><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, its acquisition of Exaion is meant to help MARA Holdings lock in clients in Europe, especially those seeking to work with companies not subject to the U.S. Cloud Act.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>What Is Retail Saying?</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>One user on the platform anticipates larger gains after the stock’s price hits $10, citing data that would force short sellers to cover their calls. They added that if MARA’s stock gets support from a Bitcoin (BTC) rally, it could push the stock price as high as $12.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>https://stocktwits.com/Kheldar/message/646064513</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another user said that MARA’s stock price could rally to $30 if Bitcoin’s price hits $100,0000.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>https://www.stocktwits.com/Ajuntimes/message/646056998</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MARA’s stock has fallen over 8% this year.
