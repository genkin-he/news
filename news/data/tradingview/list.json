The desert’s extreme heat, dust, and soiling challenges make design here uniquely complex — but they also inspire innovation. This is the region where gigawatt-scale hybrid projects integrating solar, wind, and BESS are redefining what’s possible.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At SgurrEnergy, we apply advanced analytics, thermal simulations, and materials science to mitigate soiling and temperature effects. We see the region pioneering next-generation innovations — such as dust-resistant PV modules, smart cleaning systems, and BESS-backed hybrid dispatch models — that will set new global benchmarks for renewable energy performance in harsh climates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>Arif Aga, Director, SgurrEnergy</span></em></p><p class=\"\"><span>SgurrEnergy has supported major developers like ACWA Power across Saudi Arabia and beyond.

We’ve had the privilege of supporting leading developers like ACWA Power, Elsewedy, Alfanar, Tarshid, Al Jomaih, and many more on landmark projects in the region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Currently, our team is engaged in several of Saudi Arabia’s major renewable projects — including advisory roles in Saad 1 and Saad 2 projects - both are now commissioned - which form part of the Kingdom’s 130 GW clean energy roadmap.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We’re also expanding our presence in the UAE and other GCC nations, focusing on solar + BESS projects designed to deliver RTC renewable power and manage peak load shaving for utilities and industries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>How is SgurrEnergy leveraging its global expertise — including work on large-scale solar plants in India — to support the region’s utility-scale and hybrid renewable projects?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our approach combines advanced technical advisory with smart design optimisation to lower project costs, enhance energy yield, and improve overall project performance. Our expertise extends beyond solar into solar + BESS, wind + storage, and hybrid grid solutions, where we combine advanced technical advisory with precision engineering to maximise yield and reliability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We’ve introduced several innovations — such as optimised DC system design, aluminium cabling, and high-voltage 1500 V architecture — which now underpin efficient hybrid design. Through our data-driven yield assessments and energy dispatch optimisation, we help clients achieve 1–2 percent higher energy yield and 10–15 percent lower LCOE.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our hybrid project experience ensures that solar + BESS systems can sustain HVAC and commercial loads year-round, providing reliable, clean energy even during non-solar hours - a critical step toward RTC renewable generation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What are some of the key technical and performance risks developers face in mega renewable energy projects, and how are these being mitigated?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The challenges are multiple - from dust-induced yield losses and grid integration issues to dispatch unpredictability in hybrid systems. In MENA’s extreme climates, the risks are magnified.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At SgurrEnergy, we mitigate these risks through precision engineering and predictive performance modelling. Our approach integrates soiling loss analysis, cleaning optimisation, grid stability simulation, and thermal stress management - ensuring system resilience and consistent energy delivery.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For hybrid projects, we model BESS dispatch profiles for peak shaving and energy shifting, ensuring dependable power for HVAC and industrial applications even during night or low irradiance periods. Our asset management and predictive maintenance strategies further enhance uptime, safety, and long-term returns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In short, we de-risk renewable portfolios by designing climate-resilient, storage-integrated systems that perform safely and sustainably throughout their lifecycle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With plans to establish offices in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, what opportunities and challenges do you see in expanding your footprint across the Gulf?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The region’s strong pipeline of solar, wind, and hybrid + storage projects presents an enormous opportunity for sustainable growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our goal is to bring our global expertise in RTC and hybrid engineering closer to regional developers — supporting them in designing solar + BESS systems capable of peak load shaving, grid balancing, and round-the-clock clean power.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We also plan to invest in local talent development and collaborative innovation hubs that strengthen the region’s technical capabilities in hybrid and battery storage integration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While regulatory and supply chain challenges exist, the momentum toward energy storage-backed renewables far outweighs the obstacles. We’re committed to playing an active role in this transformation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Finally, how do you envision SgurrEnergy’s role in enabling the region’s net-zero transition over the next decade?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our focus will be on seamlessly integrating solar, wind, and battery systems to deliver dispatchable green power, ensuring grid stability and round-the-clock clean energy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These hybrid systems not only help shave peak demand but also sustain critical HVAC and industrial loads throughout the year. With advanced AI, digital twins, and data-driven asset management, we aim to make renewable infrastructure smarter, more efficient, and more resilient.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ultimately, our mission extends beyond technology — we’re building local capacity, enabling job creation, and helping nations across the region move decisively toward a low-carbon, energy-secure future powered by renewables that never sleep.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(Reporting by SA Kader; Editing by Anoop Menon)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(anoop.menon@lseg.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Subscribe to our Projects' PULSE</span></strong><span> newsletter that brings you trustworthy news, updates and insights on project activities, developments, and partnerships across sectors in the Middle East and Africa.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Retail groups recently told Reuters that they are frustrated by the lack of guidance from the Trump administration and lawmakers, forcing them to round down to avoid angering customers and violating laws in some states — potentially costing high-volume businesses significant money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The National Retail Federation said the dearth of pennies has hit retailers in urban and rural areas, with no clear geographic pattern. Members of some state restaurant associations have voiced concerns about penny shortages. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“Any merchant that accepts cash is grappling with this,” said Dylan Jeon, senior director of government relations with the National Retail Federation, whose members include Walmart </span><span>, Target </span><span>, Macy’s </span><span>, and Old Navy. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some major convenience chains have already begun warning customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sheetz, a family-owned convenience store, posted signs at one of its Pennsylvania stores that read: “The U.S. Mint will no longer produce pennies, so we are short on change!” The signs encourage customers to use cashless payment options, round up purchases to support charity, or exchange $1 in spare pennies for a free self-serve drink.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kwik Trip, the convenience store chain based in La Crosse, Wisconsin, announced that its 850 stores across the Midwest would round cash transactions down to the nearest nickel. At a Dallas location, a sign warns customers: \"The US Treasury has stopped making pennies and we may experience shortages.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kroger </span><span>, one of the largest U.S. grocery chains, told Reuters it is still assessing the impact of the penny shortage. Many of its 2,700 locations have displayed signs asking customers for exact change.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Individual stores with other large chains have done the same, such as a CVS in Alexandria, Virginia, that posted a notice asking for exact change because of a \"penny shortage.\"  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Treasury did not respond to multiple requests for comment. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Several countries, including Canada, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand, have phased out their lowest-value coins, rounding cash transactions up or down to the nearest five cents while keeping electronic payments exact. The moves cut minting costs and simplified cash handling for retailers. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the U.S., phasing out pennies would require similar rounding practices at stores, adjustments to registers, and clear communication to consumers, but could deliver comparable savings and efficiency gains. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Several states, including California, New York and Illinois, however, have consumer protection laws that require retailers to provide exact change on cash transactions, creating legal uncertainty as pennies disappear from circulation. Retail groups say those rules make it difficult to adjust prices or round totals without risking fines or customer complaints.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LOOKING FOR CONSISTENT RULES</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While Trump’s directive initiated the end to production, Congress retains authority over coinage, meaning legislation may still be required for a permanent discontinuation. The NRF has been lobbying the Trump administration and Congress to provide consistent guidance, particularly around rounding transactions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“What’s most helpful in the near term is clarity on rounding practices — whether retailers can round up or down on transaction totals or change,” Jeon said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A group of trade organizations that include gas stations, convenience stores, travel centers and grocery stores warned in a September 30 letter to congressional leaders that \"if these remedies are not addressed in short order, it will be challenging to legally engage in cash transactions with customers in growing swaths of the country.\" </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Love’s Travel Stops, which operates more than 640 locations in 42 states, said the phaseout of penny production is affecting its retail operations. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“If one of our stores runs out of pennies, all change on cash transactions will be adjusted in the favor of the customer and Love’s will cover the difference,” a company spokesperson said. “This is a temporary measure while we work toward a long-term solution.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Months after Trump ordered a halt to production of pennies, the Treasury Department in May placed its final order for blank penny planchets. Several Federal Reserve Bank sites, which distribute coins to banks and credit unions, have already stopped fulfilling orders for pennies. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Producing a penny currently costs more than its face value — about 3.69 cents per coin in recent years. The government now projects savings of roughly $56 million annually by ending penny minting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are about 114 billion pennies currently in circulation in the United States, but they are greatly underutilized, the Treasury says. The penny was one of the first coins made by the U.S. Mint after its establishment in 1792.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Supporters of the penny argue it helps keep consumer prices down and is a source of income to charities. For its critics, the coin is a nuisance that ends up being discarded in drawers, ashtrays and piggy banks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I can't even tell you the last time I carried pennies — even loose change — when I left the house,\" said Pennsylvania resident Sandy Berger, 45. \"I really don't think people will care to see them gone.\"</span></p></span></div></div>",

Enrollees on average will see premiums rise about 114%, with the impact varying among the 22 million people who receive subsidies, according to research firm KFF.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Austin Jeha, a 24-year-old medical billing professional from San Ramon, California, relies on insurance to help pay for specialty care for his ulcerative colitis. Jeha’s new monthly premium is set to rise to $436 from $215.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jeha regularly receives treatment from a specialist, handing over an $85 co-pay. “You're at a higher risk of colon cancer,\" he said, so doctors \"want to check in to see if you're in remission or not.” </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jeha has reached out to his representative in the U.S. Congress, Democrat Mark DeSaulnier, and is waiting to see if an agreement in Washington would cut his costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CAUGHT UP IN THE SHUTDOWN </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Large swaths of the U.S. government have been shut since October 1, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal workers without pay and disrupting a wide range of services, from financial oversight to medical research.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Democrats say any package that would reopen the government must also extend ACA subsidies. Republicans say they are open to addressing that issue, but insist Congress must first vote to restore government funding.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Residents in Florida, Texas and Georgia are among those who will be most affected. In these and seven other Republican-led states, Medicaid is limited to the poorest residents, leaving many low-income families to seek out ACA plans because of the subsidies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Scott Darius, executive director of nonprofit Florida Voices for Health, said working-class residents and small business owners have come to rely on these plans at a time of persistent inflation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"That's who will suffer with the expiration of these tax credits. It's people who are working really hard, sometimes working multiple jobs, just jobs that don't provide health coverage,\" Darius said in an interview. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When the subsidies sunset, those with incomes over 400% of the federal poverty level will no longer be eligible.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In every congressional district across Florida, enrollees over age 60 with incomes just above 400% of the federal poverty level — roughly $84,600 for a couple — will see 2026 average premiums at least four times more expensive, according to a KFF analysis of government data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Department of Health and Human Services declined to comment, pointing to a fact sheet that said enrollees this year will have access to, on average, plans with lower premiums after tax credits and more plan choices overall.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dr. Mehmet Oz, who oversees the program, recently said the premium for the average person enrolled would rise about $13 to $50 monthly. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>HOLDING OFF AND MAYBE DROPPING OUT</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The likelihood that enrollment will be unaffected by the fight over subsidies - whether they are extended or not - is slim. Subsidized enrollees are expected to see an average premium increase to $1,904 a year from $888 in 2025, KFF said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Consumers are going to consume differently because of the various price points that they're being told,” said Shawn Martin, CEO of the American Academy of Family Physicians.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Four insurance industry experts told Reuters enrollment will fall even if there is an extension of the subsidies after enrollment begins. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“If somebody logs in during open enrollment and sees their premium payment doubling and then walks away and decides not to purchase their plan anymore, that damage has already been done,” said Cynthia Cox, a vice president at KFF.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to a Congressional Budget Office estimate, over 4 million Americans would become uninsured if Congress does not extend these credits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even before calculating subsidies, health insurance prices have risen, as insurers like CVS Health's </span><span> Aetna have exited the ACA market. Departures and higher healthcare costs have contributed to price increases on average of 26%, KFF said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Timothy McCann, a 42-year-old financial professional based in Elmwood Park, New Jersey, expects his monthly insurance premium to increase to $1,851 from $1,517, according to the Healthcare.gov website. McCann purchased the insurance to cover treatments for him and his wife, who both have autoimmune diseases, and kidney surgery for his three-year-old son.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“We need constant visits, so it’s probably a net gain at the end of the day. But it’s still a crazy amount of money to spend,” said McCann, whose total out-of-pocket medical expenses reached $33,000 this year.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Two federal judges on Friday ruled that the administration cannot block November SNAP benefits and must use about $5 billion in agency contingency funds to pay for them, requiring updates by Monday on compliance with their rulings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     The U.S. Department of Agriculture did not respond to questions about how it will react to the ruling or share any details of a plan to pay benefits.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     In the meantime, just five states, Delaware, New Mexico, Louisiana, Virginia and Vermont, and the District of Columbia have said they will pay for some or all of the November food aid, according to a Reuters review of state websites and public statements. The rest have said they will not pay for the benefits due to technical or cost barriers, or provided no explanation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The USDA said in an October 24 memo that it will not reimburse states if they cover the cost of benefits. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most states balance their budgets annually or biennially, and the increased uncertainty of federal funding for healthcare, education and other key resources has added layers of risk to state finances, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Every year we have significant budget shortfalls and are working to balance the budget,\" said Christine Woody, food security policy manager at Empower Missouri, a social justice organization. \"We don’t have $130 million to put towards this without any assurance.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A USDA spokesperson called the shutdown an \"inflection point for Senate Democrats.\" The agency has repeatedly blamed the aid lapse on Democrats, most of whom have withheld their votes on a spending bill in an effort to keep healthcare costs from spiking for many Americans. Democrats have criticized the USDA for not using agency contingency funds to partially fund the November benefits.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MULTI-MILLION-DOLLAR GAPS</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>States receive huge monthly sums from the federal government for SNAP benefits, ranging from $4.9 million for Wyoming to more than $1 billion for California, according to USDA data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To distribute those benefits, states contract with third-party processors who add the money to recipients' Electronic Benefit Transfer cards. Some states have said they cannot make the technical changes needed to get money to recipients themselves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Tennessee is unable to utilize state dollars to provide the benefit, as states do not have a mechanism to load benefits onto customer cards,\" said Governor Bill Lee in an October 24 statement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Others said the sums are simply too large to accommodate. \"SNAP brings in more than $210 million monthly in federal funding.

The nine justices will be hearing arguments in the case called Learning Resources v. Trump, along with two related cases in which plaintiffs also argue that the Republican president's tariffs are unlawful. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of the related cases was filed by Oregon and other Democratic-led states. The other was brought by the Liberty Justice Center, a libertarian nonprofit, on behalf of five small businesses, including a wine distributor called V.O.S. Selections and another educational toy company called MicroKits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the court typically takes months to issue rulings after hearing arguments, the Trump administration has asked it to act swiftly in this case.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LARGE COMPANIES ON THE SIDELINES</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Large U.S. companies have stayed on the sidelines of the tariffs litigation. They did not bring lawsuits and have not filed amicus - or friend-of-the-court - briefs offering their views. Such briefs are commonly used by companies to highlight the importance of cases brought by other litigants.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By contrast, about a dozen small businesses have agreed to serve as plaintiffs in a batch of separate lawsuits brought by nonprofits challenging the tariffs that are still playing out in lower courts, in addition to the businesses involved in the Supreme Court litigation. And another 700 signed onto an amicus brief filed by We Pay The Tariffs, an advocacy group, against Trump's action.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump's tariffs have hit small- and medium-sized businesses particularly hard because they \"don't have the same flexibility as large companies to manage the impact,\" said John Horn, a professor at the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Large companies have more cash on hand, Horn said, so they were better able to stock up on inventory before the tariffs took effect. They can also better manage prices and supply chains, Horn added. One reason large companies are not suing to challenge Trump's tariffs is that they are more focused on lobbying efforts, Horn said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Large businesses have the flexibility of lobbying the government for exemptions,\" Horn said. \"Small businesses don't have that.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Woldenberg said his legal bills have been in the millions of dollars, but he felt suing was a necessary cost.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is certainly not for everyone,\" Woldenberg said of his legal advocacy. \"Hundreds of thousands of businesses in the United States are similarly situated to ours, but to my knowledge I'm the only person in the United States - a country of 300 million people - who has chosen to sue on their own resources.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'CAN'T PLAN AHEAD'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At issue before the Supreme Court on Wednesday are tariffs Trump imposed using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA. These tariffs thus far have netted about $100 billion for U.S. coffers. This law was meant for use during national emergencies. Trump deemed the U.S. trade deficit a national emergency even though the United States has run trade deficits every year since 1975.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On April 2, as part of his \"Liberation Day\" announcement, Trump imposed a baseline tariff of 10% on virtually all countries, with higher tariffs - anywhere from 11% to 50% - on dozens of countries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The lawsuits before the Supreme Court argue that Congress did not intend for IEEPA to authorize presidents to impose tariffs. Three lower courts have ruled against Trump's tariffs, saying they exceeded his lawful authority under IEEPA. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The IEEPA tariffs are paid by U.S. importers like Learning Resources, which manufactures most of its educational toys in Asia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In his inauguration speech in January, Trump said tariffs will allow the United States to become a \"manufacturing nation once again.\" Importers have said they want to move manufacturing to the United States, but the parts and services they need are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CUTTING BACK</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In response to Trump's tariffs, Learning Resources cut back expansion plans to keep more cash on hand, Woldenberg said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Woldenberg canceled a building project that would have added 600,000 square feet (55,700 square meters) of warehouse and office space for the 500 employees of Learning Resources and a related toy company, hand2mind, that he runs. Woldenberg also abandoned plans to hire about 30 more employees in 2025, and cut back on other expenditures like marketing and training for workers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When Trump's tariffs hit, \"I predicted we'd be smaller and make less money,\" Woldenberg said. \"And both of those things are true.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Woldenberg's frustrations are shared by David Levi, founder of MicroKits, a smaller toy company in Charlottesville, Virginia, that serves as a plaintiff in the parallel case at the Supreme Court.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MicroKits sells electronic instruments, including a synthesizer called the Synth-a-Sette that teaches children about conductivity. Levi imports small electronic parts, mostly from China, then assembles his products in Virginia along with the help of a part-time employee. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Levi said that, when Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports spiked above 100% this spring, he temporarily stopped importing and slowed down production so he would still have work for his part-time employee. Levi reduced the employee's weekly schedule from 25 hours to 15 hours, and assembled thousands of fewer toys than anticipated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MicroKits, which Levi founded in 2020 after working at large toy companies Hasbro and Mattel, was growing 30% a year and was aiming to hit $1 million in revenue in 2025. Instead, because of the tariffs, revenue will be around $400,000 this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Levi said consumer-grade electrical clips he needs for his products are not being manufactured in the United States in any meaningful way. Domestically made clips are designed for aerospace and medical uses and would cost at least 10 times more than consumer-grade ones from Asia, Levi said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Levi expected to pay tariffs and other taxes when he founded MicroKits, but was not prepared for the constant uncertainty caused by the Trump administration adjusting tariff rates with little public notice.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"In a world where tariffs can go above 100% and then back down again, you're just trying to guess what happens next and can't plan ahead,\" Levi said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'OVERWHELMING RESPONSE'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Levi said he came across a webpage where Liberty Justice Center was encouraging businesses to join its lawsuit. The public interest law firm is representing him and four other businesses at no cost.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"After we issued a public call for plaintiffs, we received an overwhelming response from small businesses nationwide,\" said Jeffrey Schwab, a lawyer at Liberty Justice Center. \"Our team spoke with dozens of owners and selected five whose experiences best illustrate the broad harms caused by the tariffs and who were prepared to accept the responsibilities and public attention of litigation.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Victor Schwartz is the founder and president of Manhattan-based wine distributor V.O.S. Selections, one of those five.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Schwartz said he felt a \"moral imperative\" to challenge Trump's tariffs, which he said have cost his company about $200,000. The tariffs have hit wine importers particularly hard as they contend with inflation, a weakening dollar and declining U.S. alcohol consumption.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I was shocked that those with much more power and money did not step up,\" Schwartz said.</span></p></span></div></div>",

The major point of interest lies at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, where the last rejection occurred.

The current local weakness has put a strain on the support, and if $3,900 fails completely, the next major support lies below $3,400, more specifically at $3,385. This will serve as the next stronghold for the bulls to make their move.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“From a structural perspective, Ethereum’s inability to sustain momentum signals growing bearish pressure across lower timeframes,” the crypto analyst explained.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The Case For ETH Bulls</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the mounting bearish pressure, there is still the possibility that the Ethereum price could break out of this downtrend.

Likewise, if you are legitimately in trouble and need to call a loved one for help, say the code word so your relative knows it's really you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>People who haven't implemented a family code word have been burned by bad actors. I wrote earlier this year about a Colorado woman who received a call from a young woman who she said sounded just like her daughter. Only after wiring $2,000 to protect her daughter from danger did she learn the whole thing was a scam.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's easy to see how someone can be fooled. My colleagues recently created deepfakes of several Wall Street Journal staffers' voices, including my own, and it was hard to tell the human voices from the clones.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here are some tips on how to create and manage a family code word:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Keep it simple but strong. The code word (or phrase) should be easy to remember and something only family members would know. Criminals can find out a lot about you online, including on social media and publicly available databases. Don't use a word they could guess, such as the name of your street or pet, says Liz Hamburg, chief executive of Candoo Tech, which provides tech support and training for older adults. Instead, choose from family anecdotes, like an inside joke or your baby's first word — if it was something other than \"Dada.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Keep it safe. If you worry you'll forget the code word, you could store it in a password manager. If you write it down, hide the paper. (Don't stick it on your fridge where an unscrupulous repair person or more distant relative could see it.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Keep the circle tight. Only share the code word with close and trusted family members, and do it in person or over the phone. \"The wider the circle, the riskier it gets,\" Hamburg says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Have a Plan B. Some families prefer to have a code question to which only a family member would know the answer. Vince Martino, a certified fraud examiner in Downingtown, Pa., came up with some for his mother, who once received a call from someone pretending to be him (she didn't fall for it). He suggests pairing questions and answers that aren't available publicly, such as, \"What was the name of the motel we went to at the beach when I was growing up?\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the event that a caller could guess the right answer, Martino suggests having a backup question as well — a type of two-factor authentication.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The caveat. There are situations where a code might not be appropriate. People who have dementia might not be able to remember the word or think to ask for one. In that case, it's probably best to limit calls by blocking unknown numbers or following some of the other steps I included here, such as locking down social-media accounts and texting the loved one who is supposedly on the line.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Don't change the code word unless you need to. A shift in family dynamics — such as a relative getting divorced from a spouse who knew the code — could warrant a change. But if you're confident there's no breach in the tight circle of code-word holders, there's no need to change it. Introducing a new word could cause confusion, like forgetting which is the latest version.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jesse Ohlsson, a retired Air Force senior master sergeant in Carthage, N.Y., has had the same \"oddball\" code word with his two grown sons since they were young boys, when he came up with the word to ensure they didn't go off with an unauthorized adult.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's never been compromised,\" he says. \"It exists only in our memories.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Julie Jargon at Julie.Jargon@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

He stunned observers with a commanding victory in the June primary election.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>His chief opponent, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, is running as an independent and trailing in the polls. With both candidates facing off in a rematch of their bruising Democratic primary clash and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa refusing calls to drop out, the race has become one of the wildest in the city's history.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here is what to know about the general election:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Who are the candidates?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Zohran Mamdani</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The 34-year-old assemblyman has vowed to lower the city's cost of living. In addition to taxing the wealthy and freezing some rents, he has pledged to offer free buses and child care and raise the hourly minimum wage to $30. His proposals shocked the city's corporate elite and minted him a new leader of the progressive movement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mamdani has racked up support from establishment Democrats including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. He would be the city's first Muslim and first socialist mayor. He has vowed to stand up to President Trump.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Andrew Cuomo</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The state's former governor, who lost in the Democratic primary to Mamdani, is banking on support from voters who oppose a socialist mayor. He has built his independent campaign around public safety and has proposed hiring more police officers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The 67-year-old resigned from the governor's office in 2021 after facing sexual-harassment and misconduct allegations, which he has denied.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Curtis Sliwa</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The 71-year-old Republican has defied calls to drop out of the race from critics who fear he could siphon votes from Cuomo. The beret-wearing Sliwa is best known for patrolling the subways in an effort to lower crime.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Who is leading in the polls?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mamdani has had a double-digit lead in the polls for months. Among likely voters, 43% supported Mamdani compared with 33% for Cuomo and 14% for Sliwa, according to a Quinnipiac University poll in the final days of the race. Quinnipiac reported that Mamdani's support dropped 3% in recent weeks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Young voters overwhelmingly back Mamdani, while Cuomo has polled well with Jewish voters and Republicans. Cuomo has been gaining a little ground in recent weeks since Mayor Eric Adams dropped out.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What has Trump said about the race?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump has privately told allies he thinks Mamdani can't be beat. Publicly, the president has threatened to pull billions in federal funding from New York City if Mamdani is elected and enacts policies the White House doesn't like.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Remember, he needs the money from me, as President, in order to fulfill all of his FAKE Communist promises. He won't be getting any of it, so what's the point of voting for him?\" Trump said on social media, one of several times he has mischaracterized Mamdani's political identity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What have been the major issues this election?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mamdani has focused on affordability and taxing the rich. Cuomo centered his campaign around public safety and his governing experience. Both have vowed to defend the city from Trump.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What happened at the debates?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mamdani, Cuomo and Sliwa faced off  in two debates last month. Mamdani and Cuomo sparred over how they would take on Trump and staff the city police department. Mamdani brought up Cuomo's handling of nursing homes during the Covid-19 pandemic. Cuomo said Mamdani refused to denounce Hamas and criticized him for living in a rent-stabilized apartment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Why isn't Eric Adams running?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The current mayor ended his re-election campaign in September after business leaders called on him to drop out and clear the field for Cuomo. Adams had been polling in fourth place and struggling to fundraise. He endorsed Cuomo last month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adams has been ensnared in multiple scandals since taking office in 2022. Federal authorities have probed several of his aides over possible corruption. A judge tossed corruption charges against Adams earlier this year. Justice Department officials requested the dismissal because they said the charges interfered with Adams's ability to cooperate with Trump's immigration enforcement. Adams has called the charges baseless.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When and where can I vote?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Early voting started Oct. 25 and ends Sunday. Early-voting locations are usually different from Election Day sites. Voters can find their polling centers and opening hours by entering their address on the city Board of Elections' website. Each borough has customized early-voting stickers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Election Day Tuesday, the polls are open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. Voters waiting in line when the polls close are still allowed to cast a ballot.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oct. 25 was the last day to register to vote in the general election or to request a mail-in ballot.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This explanatory article may be periodically updated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Alyssa Lukpat at alyssa.lukpat@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Anna Wilde Mathews</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For around 24 million people enrolled in Affordable Care Act plans, things are about to get crazy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Enrollment for next year's coverage starts Saturday, and virtually everything is changing all at once. Premiums for many plans are shooting upward. The federal subsidies that most enrollees use to pay for their insurance are set to shrink, though Congress might still reverse that in coming weeks. New rules will add additional wrinkles, including the risk of higher tax bills.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The upshot: If you have Obamacare, you really need to dig in and be careful about what you choose during the open enrollment period, which begins Saturday and lasts until Dec. 15, for coverage that starts Jan. 1.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you don't, you could get hit with huge bills next year. You could also be locked into health insurance you can't afford.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is the most extreme pricing change we've seen,\" said Jeff Grant, a former official with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees federal ACA implementation. \"Nobody can understand what this means until they go shop.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here's what ACA enrollees need to know to navigate this year's hazards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Getting started</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You can start the shopping process on HealthCare.gov, the federal insurance marketplace that serves 30 states for 2026. If you don't live in one of them, it will bounce you to your state's website.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You should consider getting advice from an expert, perhaps someone recommended by a friend or relative. HealthCare.gov includes a \"find local help\" button that leads to advisers. Groups representing brokers and agents also offer directories.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many Obamacare insurance premium hikes for next year are well into double-digit percentages. Most enrollees don't pay the full premium, but declining federal subsidies will still leave them with far higher monthly bills.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The pain will be spread unevenly. Its impact will depend on factors like your income level, your age and what plans are sold in your area. Health research nonprofit KFF offers an explainer on how the subsidies work here, but the best thing to do is to get on your government marketplace for a reality check.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some of the biggest increases, in dollar terms, will hit people who make slightly over 400% of the federal poverty level, which is about $62,600 for an individual. Many of those people qualified for a subsidy this year, but they won't get any help at all next year because enhanced federal payments are set to lapse. You can find federal poverty level cutoffs for different family sizes here.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bigger bills</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kevin Foster, 64, a retired business consultant in Lafayette, Calif., logged on to the state marketplace recently to check his rates for next year and couldn't believe what he saw. Eligible for a subsidy in 2025, he and his wife are slated to lose it in 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The couple's monthly insurance bill of about $580 will shoot up to more than $3,200, or an annual cost of more than $38,000. The 2026 version of their plan comes with a family deductible of $14,400, pushing the total past $50,000.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It was really just pure shock,\" he said. \"I was like, 'Are you kidding me?'\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He's likely to have to tap his savings until he can get Medicare, he said, but he's also trying to find a cheaper plan, or an alternative like purchasing travel health insurance and temporarily relocating abroad.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For other enrollees, the rising costs are leading to wrenching choices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jordan Euckert and her husband currently pay $129 a month, after a subsidy, to cover their family of six in Bedford, Texas. Next year, the cheapest plan that includes the children's hospital and doctors their kids need will set them back about $550 a month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Euckert, 31, who works for a small construction firm, said the family probably can't afford that. Now, she's wondering if the couple should go uninsured, while keeping their children covered. Though both spouses are healthy, her husband's job as a roofer poses a constant risk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's just like all those what ifs, like what if I got sick, what if my husband got sick — what would we do?\" she said. \"I don't know.\" She is hoping the couple's agent can come up with a better solution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ACA enrollees said they are still hopeful that Congress might restore the bigger federal subsidies that are in effect this year. Democrats and Republicans have been clashing over the issue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Keep an eye on things, watch the news coverage,\" said Cynthia Cox, a vice president at KFF. If Congress does vote to block next year's drop-off in the payments, you will want to take another look at your insurance choice, because different 2026 plans might suddenly be more affordable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Limited options</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For most enrollees, the main option to hold down monthly costs will be choosing skinnier ACA plans, with higher deductibles and other out-of-pocket charges.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some enrollees are looking at other choices. Scott Leavitt, an insurance broker in Boise, Idaho, said a married pair of his clients who own their own firm are considering switching to a small-business plan, or coverage purchased for an employer, rather than an individual or family.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some ACA enrollees can join a spouse's employer plan, or might be forced to look for a job that comes with health benefits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Agents say ACA enrollees should be careful about products that don't carry the same protections as Obamacare plans. Short-term medical plans, for instance, can refuse to cover pre-existing illnesses, as well as drugs and other types of medical services. So-called healthcare-sharing ministry plans aren't regulated as insurance, and can have similar limits and shortfalls.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another type of product, known as fixed indemnity plans, will pay out a set amount for certain medical services, but their setup can leave patients on the hook for whatever a healthcare provider bills above that amount, potentially tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Once that $15,000 or $10,000 is done, there's no more coverage,\" said Heather Stone, a health-insurance broker based in Fort Myers, Fla. \"If you need chemo, it's not going to cover anything like that.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other wrinkles</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the ACA-subsidy sticker shock is hard to miss, many enrollees may not be aware of other new rules that could affect them this year. Here's a helpful tipsheet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For one thing, lower-income enrollees in the past could sign up for new ACA plans year-round, a loophole that has now closed. \"They are not going to let you find out you have an illness in April and then come back and enroll into a major medical plan,\" said Johnny Wallin, chief operating officer of Marketplace Insurance Exchange, a health-insurance brokerage.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of the biggest changes might not surface until tax season in 2027. When enrollees sign up for their 2026 plans, they have to estimate their income for that year. If they end up making more money than they estimated, they get too much subsidy, and they have to pay back the difference when they file their taxes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the past, the law capped how much most enrollees would have to repay, but that limit is now gone. So the tax bill could be thousands of dollars for some people.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After Ja'Net Adams chooses an ACA plan this year, she plans to meet with her accountant to plan for the tax implications. \"We're going to have to sit down in December and say 'What do we need to make sure happens in 2026 so that we don't have a big tax bill because of this?'\" said Adams, 44, who owns a financial consulting firm in Kernersville, N.C.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at Anna.Mathews@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
