            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. appears to be positioning additional Murban crude into the market for April, a move that could reinforce the growing narrative of strengthening Middle Eastern supply just as investors look ahead to this weekend's OPEC+ meeting. According to people familiar with the plans, the state producer has offered extra volumes to partners in the United Arab Emirates' onshore concession, with some of those barrels already sold on the spot market. The development comes as Saudi Arabia and Iran have reportedly accelerated shipments in recent weeks, amid concerns that tensions between Washington and Tehran could potentially disrupt exports.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The precise scale of the incremental Murban supply has not been disclosed. Adnoc holds a 60% stake in the onshore concession, which has the capacity to produce about 2 million barrels per day of Murban, while TotalEnergies, BP </span><span>, China National Petroleum Corp., Inpex, Zhenhua Oil and GS Energy own the remainder. Some of the added cargoes have weighed on Murban's relative performance this week, with the grade slipping against Brent and Dubai benchmarks as additional barrels were offered. At the same time, Brent futures touched $72.61 a barrel on Thursday, the highest intraday level since last July, underscoring that benchmark pricing dynamics remain firm even as regional supply signals build.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ahead of the OPEC+ gathering, some delegates have indicated they expect the group could agree to resume modest output increases from April. Adnoc has previously adjusted volumes in response to shifts in OPEC+ quotas aimed at managing prices or reclaiming market share, suggesting that the latest move may align with broader policy adjustments. For energy-focused investors, the combination of firmer Brent pricing and indications of rising Middle Eastern exports could introduce near-term volatility as the market awaits clearer guidance on production strategy.</span></p></span></div></div>",

That gap tells a story about where some investors are choosing to put — or keep — their money right now.</span></p><div class=\"container-n2KCMK3i\" data-qa-id=\"tweet-widget-container\"><blockquote class=\"blockquote-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"header-n2KCMK3i\"><span class=\"profile-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"avatar-n2KCMK3i\"></div><div class=\"name-n2KCMK3i\">Xaif Crypto🇮🇳|🇺🇸</div><div class=\"username-n2KCMK3i\">@Xaif_Crypto</div></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"logo-n2KCMK3i\" role=\"img\"><svg height=\"28\" viewbox=\"0 0 28 28\" width=\"28\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M19.75 5h3.07l-6.7 7.62L24 23h-6.17l-4.84-6.3L7.46 23H4.4l7.17-8.16L4 5h6.33l4.37 5.75L19.75 5Zm-1.24 16h1.7L9.54 7H7.7l10.8 14Z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path></svg></span></div><div class=\"description-n2KCMK3i\"><p class=\"\"><span>🚨 BREAKING: Canary Capital CEO just dropped something the market isn't ready for.</span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XRP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$XRP</a><span> quietly absorbing capital while BTC &amp; ETH see outflows.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even on red days.

Bitcoin and Ethereum investment products together shed $250 million in outflows. XRP, meanwhile, pulled in $3.5 million. Modest in size, but striking given the conditions surrounding it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Steady Inflows Since Launch</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reports say XRP ETFs got off to a strong start when the first spot product was listed on Nasdaq in mid-November last year. From that point through January 7, 2026, inflows came in consistently without a single day of net outflows — an unbroken streak that lasted nearly two months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That first outflow day in January was an exception to an otherwise clean run. Since then, XRP funds have largely held their footing while competing products struggled.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The cumulative result of that run: $1.24 billion in total net inflows, with assets under management now sitting at a little over $1 billion. Among the individual products, the Canary XRP ETF leads with $280 million in net assets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bitwise’s XRP ETF trails narrowly at $278 million — a gap thin enough that the rankings could easily shift with a few strong trading days.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have faced sustained selling pressure for months. New buyers have been hard to come by. XRP funds stepping into that environment and continuing to attract capital — rather than lose it — is a departure from what most of the market has been experiencing.A Shift In Where Investors Are Looking </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reports from Canary Capital suggest the pattern reflects something more than short-term trading behavior. Investors appear to be reallocating toward assets they see as having specific utility, with XRP’s established role in cross-border payments drawing attention from both institutional and retail buyers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>Featured image from Vecteezy, chart from TradingView</span></em></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Megan Leonhardt</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Federal Reserve officials and politicians like to trumpet the fact that inflation has cooled dramatically from its peak of nearly 9% in June 2022. But for those of us who buy groceries or pay utility bills, that's small consolation. Have you seen the price of a skirt steak, or even ground beef these days? It's enough to consider becoming a vegetarian.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>President Donald Trump attempted to assuage consumers' concerns last Tuesday night during his State of the Union address, citing the \"roaring\" economy and plummeting prices. \"The cost of chicken, butter, food, hotels, automobiles, rent is lower today than when I took office, by a lot, and even beef, which was very high, is starting to come down significantly,\" Trump said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the president is right that prices for some items, such as eggs and gasoline, have fallen from a year ago, inflation hasn't been tamed. Official measures indicate that it's still well above the Fed's 2% annual target. Friday's release of the producer price index reading for January showed that wholesale inflation rose by a higher-than-expected 0.5% month over month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The president called out the price of eggs, which he noted are down 60% from their high. While he got the direction right, the consumer price index indicates that the average price of a carton of large Grade A eggs has fallen by 48% since Trump took office in January 2025. Prices plummeted last year as a bird flu outbreak eased, but the pace of cooling has slowed in recent months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gasoline prices, which Trump also highlighted, fell significantly over the past year. Prices at the pump were $2.98, on average, this past week, according to AAA. That's down from $3.14 a year ago.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump touted that inflation averaged 1.7% in the final three months of 2025. The administration's measure, which it has used before, is based on the average of the annualized rates of the monthly CPI change during specific periods — for example, from the start of Trump's second term or in the final three months of the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Official calculations, considered standard by economists, tell a less celebratory story. The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the change in the consumer price index compared with one year earlier. By that measure, inflation rose 2.4% year over year in January. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, rose 2.9% in December, the latest data available.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sticky inflation has been driven by rising prices for a range of goods and services. Beef costs, for example, rose substantially in the past year. Ground beef prices were up 22% in January from a year earlier, and steak prices rose about 12% year to year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Electricity costs, which Trump didn't mention, were up 6.3% year over year in January on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to the BLS.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Price trends like this help to explain why surveys show that consumers remain focused on inflation, prices, and affordability. Consumer confidence improved slightly in February, but is still down by almost 9% from a year ago and remains at historically low levels, according to the latest report, released this past week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Regarding the impact of tariffs, Trump said that \"there was no inflation, tremendous growth.\" But there is mounting evidence that tariffs are increasing prices, even if not by the levels that economists initially assumed. Core goods inflation was unchanged in the January CPI report, largely due to a sizable drop in used-car prices. But core goods excluding autos rose 0.36% in the month, and at a 4.4% annualized rate, according to Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Prices for household furnishings, personal-care products, and electronic devices such as computers, tablets, and smart-home assistants all rose sharply in January.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Supreme Court recently struck down the tariffs that the Trump administration issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, but consumers are unlikely to see any relief in prices. If refunds are issued, companies aren't likely to pass those savings along to consumers. And, the White House has already implemented workarounds to keep tariffs in place.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Trump gave no indication he would relent from his tariff agenda,\" said Thierry Wizman, global foreign-exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That alone suggests consumers shouldn't expect price growth to ease soon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Megan Leonhardt at megan.leonhardt@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
