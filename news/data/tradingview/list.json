Apple shares slip 0.4% despite reporting record sales. Major indexes extend their monthly winning streak as Fed rate cuts, hopes for trade deals and solid earning outweigh worries about any fallout from the government shutdown. DJIA gains 40 points, or 0.1%, to 47562, the S&amp;P 500 rises 0.3% to 6840 and the Nasdaq climbs 0.6% to 23724.

(patrick.sullivan@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Treasurys end the month not too far from where they started, following ups and downs caused by the government shutdown and Chair Powell's hawkish comments after this week's interest rate cut. As the data drought continues, Fedspeak is likely to be closely monitored for hints on what lies ahead. Four Fed officials today expressed unease with interest rate cuts, worried about sticky inflation. Meanwhile, the Chicago Business Barometer rises more than expected, to 43.8, a number that still indicates contraction in the regional activity. The 10-year yield is down for the third consecutive month, falling 0.049 percentage point in October, to 4.100%. The two-year rises 0.003 p.p. to 3.605%.

EIA weekly reports show U.S. crude oil output at a record high above 13.6 million barrels a day. Ritterbusch sees OPEC's output increases, aside from regaining market share, as an effort to curb non-OPEC production in areas such as Guyana, Brazil and the U.S. \"But if WTI can occasionally lift back to above the $60 threshold, the oil rig count could remain stable.\" Natural gas rigs rose by four this week to 125, the most since August of 2023.(anthony.harrup@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1302 ET - CIBC Capital Markets chief economist Avery Shenfeld says perhaps the Bank of Canada should have remained silent on what marks an appropriate interest-rate level, given the weak state of the Canadian economy. \"Has the Bank of Canada really run out of options, and does the patient really need to hear that just yet?,\" Shenfeld writes in his week-ending note to clients. The BOC cut its policy rate this week, and signaled that the easing cycle might be done. The BOC's forecast anticipates weak growth, and therefore sets a high bar for additional cuts, Shenfeld says. Yet the BOC forecast justifies an additional cut given the slow absorption of spare capacity, he adds. (Paul.Vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1255 ET - Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic says that he backed the Fed's quarter-point rate cut this week--a second straight rate reduction--only because he still thinks that the reduction leaves the Fed's monetary stance in a restrictive position that is leaning against rising prices. \"I was able to get behind it,\" Bostic says at a conference in Dallas. He acknowledges that earlier in the year, he had projected that the Fed should only cut once this year. But Bostic says he judged that the Fed's stance is still working to corral inflation, making him comfortable that the Fed would still be working against price increases even after this week's cut. \"I still think we're in restrictive territory,\" he says. Bostic isn't a voter on the Fed's policy committee this year.

At the same time, though, there is relatively low unemployment and higher-priced personal care categories are performing well. \"Against that mixed backdrop, our categories are growing at around 2%, which was pretty consistent with what happened in Q2,\" he says. Shares rise 6.5%. (connor.hart@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1155 ET - CN Rail's volume growth was driven by intermodal recovery after last year's labor related disruptions. The Canadian railroad says 3Q revenue of C$4.2 billion was driven by an 11% increase in intermodal transport, which are containers that can be transferred between trains, trucks, and ships. Metals and minerals, as well as forest products were down, 6% and 4%, respectively, due to the effect of tariffs. Grain and fertilizers were down 2%, but CN expects a record 2025-2026 Canadian crop which came in later than usual. Shares are trading 3% higher.

(nicholas.miller@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1108 ET - Homeowners are scaling back remodeling projects, says Floor &amp; Decor Chief Executive Thomas Taylor on the company's earnings call. \"We continue to see a shift towards smaller projects such as tile focused bathroom projects, kitchens and restoration work,\" Taylor says. Those trends plus a stagnant home sales market led to a decline in same-store sales. Taylor says consumers aren't trading down and haven't pulled back due to higher prices. \"They're buying the more expensive products and the better products. They're just doing less square footage and less projects,\" he says. (nicholas.miller@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1039 ET - Newell Brands Chief Executive Chris Peterson says that low-income and young consumers are spending less on general merchandise purchases. \"Low-income consumers remain under a lot of pressure and their purchase behavior in general merchandise is down significantly versus year ago,\" Peterson says. \"Those [aged] 18 to 24 also are pulling back significantly on general merchandise purchases.\" Peterson says that those trends have been present for a while and are relatively stable. Newell Brands, the maker of Yankee Candle and Sharpie, says that consumer demand fell in 3Q in response to some of its price hikes. Newell Brands plunges 34% to $3.11.

Wall Street craves labor data to determine the likelihood of another interest rate cut by the Fed in December. An official tally will probably be missing next week because of the shutdown. Based on available data issued by states, Citi estimates that continuing jobless claims are increasing, suggesting that hiring remains low. \"We will be watching if continuing claims start to stabilize more in November and December,\" the economists say. A continued increase \"would suggest employment data may not stabilize in Q4/Q1 like last year,\" they say.

GDP in August fell 0.3%, or the largest single-month contraction since late 2022 and the biggest miss against market consensus in over four years. There was some so-called noise in the report, TD notes, such as the impact of a flight attendants' strike and drought conditions hampering electricity generation. Still, the August GDP data \"does not leave much buffer against a technical recession in September,\" and underscores to broadening of headwinds in 3Q.

In the Transaction, Rumbu purchased all of the issued shares of Warren &amp; Son held by the Vendors utilizing funds from the previously announced lending facility of the Company with the Bank of Montreal and through the issuance of Promissory Notes to the Vendors in the aggregate amount of $500,000 CDN. The Promissory Notes are repayable in five (5) years from the Closing Date of the Transaction. The Sale Agreement also provides for a conventional adjustment of the Working Capital after Closing. Rumbu has retained most of the current staff of Warren &amp; Son and will continue to operate the funeral home and business acquired in Swift Current, Saskatchewan. The acquisition is neither a Non-Arms Length nor a Related Party Transaction. The Company plans to lead the way in assisting funeral home owners to transition their businesses to current employees or aspiring funeral home directors who are looking to operate in rural or mid market communities.
