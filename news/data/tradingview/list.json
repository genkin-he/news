I believe the answer is both,” he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The executive said that firms operating as transactional middlemen and commoditized insurance product lines “should be concerned.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But for his firm he described AI as a “step-function multiplier,” enabling significant gains in productivity and enhancing organizational speed and agility. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This includes in personal lines, which comprises 38% of Baldwin’s total pro forma revenue. Around 80% of this revenue emanates from embedded insurance, which its CEO said represents “one of the ultimate moats in this environment.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“While the market is worrying about consumers asking a chatbot for insurance in our embedded businesses, we are focused on being the insurance solution of convenience sold through a trusted partner alongside a primary transaction such as buying a home, securing a mortgage or renting an apartment,” he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The executive said Baldwin’s Westwood platform, which is inclusive of business acquired from Hippo, generated $190 million in pro forma revenue in 2025 and “seamlessly embeds directly into the home-buying experience for 20 of the top 25 homebuilders in the United States.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Baldwin onboarded 12 new partners on the platform in 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company this week signed a 10-year exclusive agreement with Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation, the sixth largest independent mortgage lender in the U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“We currently expect to go live with Fairway on our Coverage Navigator platform in the second quarter,” Trevor Baldwin said. “The growing momentum here is palpable and will drive deeper moats around our embedded business.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Baldwin’s renters insurance platform, which wrote over $280 million of premium in 2025, embeds directly into property management software, allowing a renter to purchase an insurance policy at point of lease in under 60 seconds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“100% of the premium flowing through this channel is into our own proprietary products built and managed by our MGA platform, MSI. Overall, these embedded solutions are easier, more intuitive and more seamless than initiating a separate process with a stand-alone AI agent,” Trevor Baldwin said.</span></p></span></div></div>",

OpenAI said that with the changes, it would have referred the account belonging to Jesse Van Rootselaar to police if it was discovered today. Police have identified Van Rootselaar as the suspect in a deadly school shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia that left eight dead and dozens injured.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Wall Street Journal has reported that OpenAI considered alerting Canadian law-enforcement authorities about interactions between Van Rootselaar and ChatGPT. OpenAI shut down Van Rootselaar's ChatGPT account after detecting a violation of its policy but didn't notify police.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Solomon said he's also scheduled to speak to OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman next week.

British Columbia Premier David Eby said he's also set to speak to Altman, and Eby added he wants the CEO to be cognizant of the pain that families in Tumbler Ridge are feeling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Online platforms have long debated how to balance questions of privacy with public safety in their decisions to alert law enforcement about certain users. That debate has now pulled in the AI companies that power the chatbots to which people are confiding the most intimate details of their private thoughts and lives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In its letter to Solomon, OpenAI divulged that Van Rootselaar had a second ChatGPT account. Among OpenAI's pledges is a commitment to strengthen detection systems to prevent efforts to evade safeguards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Taylor Owen, a public-policy professor at Montreal's McGill University with a specialty in media and ethics, said OpenAI has now publicly acknowledged its previous safety protocols were inadequate, and that Van Rootselaar's ability to create a second account discloses a previously unknown system error.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It means the threshold that governed the original decision, the one that resulted in Canadian police not being contacted about violent content flagged by the company's own systems, was one the company itself now considers inadequate,\" Owen said.

A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that a shareholder invested in a Fund is paid back to them. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\" The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations.

Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after December 31, 2026 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV early in 2027.

The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund's common shares, but there is no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the Plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate.

No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's distributions or from the terms of the Fund's Plan. The Board of Trustees (the \"Board\") may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to Fund shareholders. No level of distribution can be guaranteed. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's common shares.

A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that a shareholder invested in a Fund is paid back to them.

The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations.

Shareholders should refer to their Form 1099-DIV for the character and amount of distributions for income tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after December 31, 2026 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV early in 2027.

Thus, the distribution amount shown excludes special dividends (which are not paid pursuant to the plan). The Fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund's Plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund's common shares, but there is no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the Plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate.

No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's distributions or from the terms of the Fund's Plan. The Board of Trustees (the \"Board\") may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to Fund shareholders. No level of distribution can be guaranteed. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's common shares. The Plan is subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the annual minimum fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Past Performance is No Assurance of Future Results. Investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investors should consider the investment objective, risks and expenses carefully. You can obtain the Fund's most recent periodic reports and filings by visiting https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=826020&amp;owner=exclude.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other Information and Certain Risk Factors: The Fund's investment objective is to provide investors with a high level of current income, with a secondary goal of capital appreciation. There can be no assurance that the Fund will meet its investment objective. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing globally in debt and equity securities of public and private companies, which includes, among other things, investments in closed--end funds, special purpose acquisition companies (\"SPACs\"), reinsurance, and public and private debt instruments. The Fund also may utilize derivatives including but not limited to total return swaps, credit default swaps, options and futures, in seeking to enhance returns and/or to reduce portfolio risk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The value of the Fund's investments in equity securities of public and private, listed and unlisted companies and equity derivatives generally varies with the performance of the issuer and movements in the equity markets more generally. As a result, the Fund may suffer losses if it invests in equity instruments of issuers whose performance diverges from the Fund's investment manager's expectations or if equity markets generally move in a single direction and the Fund has not hedged against such a general move. The Fund invests in closed-end funds and SPACs, which are subject to additional risks and considerations. The performance of reinsurance-related securities and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various triggering events, including but not limited to weather, natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.), non-natural large catastrophes and other specified events causing physical and/or economic loss. To the extent the Fund invests in reinsurance-related securities for which a triggering event occurs, losses associated with such event could result in losses to the Fund's investment, and a series of major triggering events affecting a large portion of the reinsurance- related securities held by the Fund could result in substantial losses to the Fund's investment. The Fund may invest in high yield securities, which are speculative in nature and are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default, illiquidity of the security, and changes in value based on changes in interest rates. Changes in short-term market interest rates may directly affect the yield on the Fund's common shares. If such rates fall, the Fund's yield may also fall. If interest rate spreads on bonds and loans owned by the Fund decline in general, the yield on the bonds and loans will likely fall and the value of such bonds and loans may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short-term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on bonds and loans in the Fund's portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for certain bonds and loans, the Fund's ability to sell such securities in a timely fashion and/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new bonds and loans acquired by the Fund, and it may also increase the price of bonds and loans purchased by the Fund in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for bonds and loans may adversely affect the price of bonds and loans in the Fund's portfolio, which would cause the Fund's net asset value to decrease. The Fund's use of leverage, if any, through borrowings or issuance of preferred shares can adversely affect the yield on the Fund's common shares. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including but not limited to potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Fund may engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge, as closely as practicable, all of the economic impact to the Fund arising from foreign currency fluctuations. Other risks include, but are not limited to, the use of derivatives, the potential lack of diversification in the Fund's portfolio, and the fact that the Fund's portfolio may be concentrated in a small group of industries or industry sectors from time to time. Investors should consult the Fund's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the materials on the Fund's website for a more detailed discussion of these or other risk factors that affect the Fund.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About Saba Capital Income &amp; Opportunities Fund.

We were thrilled to have the opportunity to present this technology and the trial design to leaders in the field at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, where we received positive feedback and encouraging interest.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"ATR-04 has previously been granted Fast Track designation from the FDA, signaling the potential for this candidate to help the approximately 150,000 people in the United States annually who are impacted by major dermatologic toxicities associated with EGFR inhibitor treatments. Though an impactful treatment for various serious cancers, EGFR inhibition can result in adverse skin reactions that can make it difficult for patients to stay on these effective therapies.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mr. Salva added: \"For our lead program, ATR-12, we continue to be encouraged by the promising safety data generated thus far in our Phase 1b trial and are optimistic that this candidate has the potential to be a life-changing innovation for people with Netherton syndrome, a rare, autosomal recessive disease, a chronic condition characterized by severe inflammation, pruritus, scaling, red, and dehydrated skin with no known cure and limited treatment options.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mr. Salva continued: \"Also in 2025, we presented positive preclinical data for our ATR-01 program targeting ichthyosis vulgaris. Impacting approximately 1.3 million in the United States with no treatment options beyond symptom management, ichthyosis vulgaris, is an autosomal semidominant genetic disorder caused by missing or abnormal filaggrin levels. The condition is characterized by generalized xerosis and fine, white to gray scales that are prominent on the abdomen, chest, and extensor surfaces of the extremities.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mr. Salva concluded: \"2026 promises to be an important year for Azitra with several anticipated milestones including topline data for both our Phase 1b study in Netherton Syndrome and the Phase 1/2 study in EGFRi-associated rash. We also look forward to completing IND-enabling studies for ATR-01. We remain excited and optimistic as we work towards these key events, which we believe can help build significant value for our shareholders in 2026, while we progress innovative and potentially transformative treatments for patients with severe and life-altering dermatological conditions.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pipeline Achievements and Upcoming Milestones</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ATR-12 - Advancing Phase 1b Clinical Trial in Netherton Syndrome</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>In June 2025, Azitra reported promising safety data with 50% of patients   enrolled.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>ATR12-351, a live precision dermatology therapeutic candidate has been   generally safe and well-tolerated with occasional, transient, mild to   moderate symptoms at application site to date.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Topline data from the Phase 1b trial is anticipated H2 2026. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>ATR-04 — Addressing an Unmet Need for Cancer Patients in a Multi-billion Dollar Market Opportunity</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Dosed first patient in Phase 1/2 Trial for ATR-04 program targeting   oncology patients with EGFRi-associated rash in Q3 2025.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Topline data from first cohort of Phase 1/2 trial expected around   mid-2026. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>ATR-01 — Targeting Ichthyosis Vulgaris Which Impacts 1.3 million in the United States</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Announced positive preclinical data for ATR-01 program in Q3 2025,   demonstrating delivery of active, functional filaggrin through human   stratum corneum and repair of damaged model skin   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>IND-enabling studies continue in 2026. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2025</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Research and Development (R&amp;D) expenses: R&amp;D expenses for the year ended   December 31, 2025, were $4.8 million compared to $4.7 million for the   fiscal year 2024.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>General and Administrative (G&amp;A) expenses: G&amp;A expenses for the year   ended December 31, 2025, were $6.2 million compared to $6.3 million for   the fiscal year 2024.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Net Loss was $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2025, compared   to $9.0 million for the fiscal year 2024.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Cash and cash equivalents: As of December 31, 2025, Azitra had cash and   cash equivalents of $2.1 million. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>About Azitra, Inc.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Azitra, Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative therapies for precision dermatology. Azitra's lead program, ATR-12, uses an engineered strain of S. epidermidis designed to treat Netherton syndrome, a rare, chronic skin disease with no approved treatment options. Netherton syndrome may be fatal in infancy with those living beyond a year having profound lifelong challenges. The ATR-12 program includes a Phase 1b clinical trial in adults with Netherton syndrome. ATR-04, Azitra's additional clinical program, utilizes another engineered strain of S. epidermidis for the treatment of EGFR inhibitor (\"EGFRi\") associated skin toxicity; a Phase 1/2 clinical trial has been initiated for this program. Azitra has received Fast Track designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration for this program to treat EGFRi associated rash, which impacts approximately 150,000 people in the United States. The ATR-12 and ATR-04 programs were developed from Azitra's proprietary platform of engineered proteins and topical live biotherapeutic products that includes a microbial library comprised of approximately 1,500 bacterial strains. The platform is augmented by artificial intelligence and machine learning technology that analyzes, predicts, and helps screen the library of strains for drug like molecules.

The acquisition of Evans Bancorp, Inc. in 2025 expanded its presence in Western New York, but also introduced integration risks and potential asset quality issues.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Macroeconomic Risks:</span></strong><span> The company faces significant risks from macroeconomic conditions, including consumer confidence, unemployment, and interest rate changes, which can impact consumer spending and demand for credit. The reliance on interest and fees from loan receivables makes it sensitive to economic volatility. Additionally, the company is exposed to risks from severe weather and climate change, which could affect its branch locations and customer properties.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Commercial Lending Risks:</span></strong><span> The company’s focus on commercial lending, which constitutes 56% of its loan portfolio, exposes it to higher risks of non-payment and loss compared to residential mortgages. The allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, posing a material risk to financial condition.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Regulatory Risks:</span></strong><span> Regulatory risks are heightened due to the company exceeding $10 billion in total consolidated assets, subjecting it to increased capital, leverage, liquidity, and risk management standards. Compliance with these requirements may necessitate significant resources and could impact financial results.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Operational Risks:</span></strong><span> Operational risks include reliance on third-party vendors for key business infrastructure, which could affect service delivery if these vendors face disruptions.
