Earlier this week, Warner's board said an improved bid from rival Paramount Skydance \"could reasonably be expected to lead\" to a proposal superior to Netflix's signed agreement. However, a further bid from the streaming giant is expected, Badcock says. Moreover, it isn't clear that Paramount will be able to return with a higher offer, Badcock adds. \"They seem to have passed the ability to pay, but they don't seem to have run out of willingness to pay.\" (josephmichael.stonor@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

French artificial-intelligence startup Mistral AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The stock was up about 6% at $202.98 in midday trading. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the agreement, Accenture will gain access to Mistral AI’s models for use across its consulting and technology services. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financial terms were not disclosed. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The companies said Accenture professionals will be able to use tools such as Mistral AI Studio, which allows users to test and refine models before deploying them at scale within business operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Accenture said the partnership will help it advise clients on how to integrate AI more deeply into workflows, automate repetitive tasks and accelerate project delivery. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The firm has increasingly positioned itself as a bridge between experimental AI tools and large-scale enterprise deployment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Mistral deal part of broader AI push</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Mistral AI deal is the latest in a series of partnerships Accenture has struck with leading AI developers. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earlier this week, the consultancy was named among a small group of companies partnering with OpenAI to gain early access to its Frontier agentic AI platform.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In December, Accenture also announced a three-year partnership with Anthropic to help businesses move from pilot projects to full AI deployment. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic said at the time that Accenture had become one of its three largest enterprise customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chief executive Julie Sweet has repeatedly described AI as a central growth engine for the firm, urging employees to rapidly build expertise in the technology. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Accenture has said it has already trained a significant portion of its roughly 780,000 employees in AI tools, while warning that those unable to adapt could face exit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>How does Mistral gain?</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>For Mistral AI, the partnership brings a high-profile client at a critical stage in its expansion. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Paris-based startup has been building a network of alliances as enterprises and governments seek alternatives to US-based AI model providers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to its website, Mistral AI’s models are already used by companies including IBM, Cisco Systems, SAP, Stellantis and ASML Holding.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last year, ASML led a funding round that injected more than $1.5 billion into Mistral AI for roughly an 11% stake, valuing the startup at close to $14 billion. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mistral AI has also secured partnerships with several European governments, as well as Singapore and Morocco.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Investor debate over AI impact</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Accenture’s shares have struggled in recent months as investors debate whether generative AI will reduce demand for consulting services by automating tasks traditionally performed by large teams. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company’s stock is down more than 21% so far this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, some analysts remain optimistic. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>UBS recently maintained a Buy rating on Accenture with a $320 price target, implying nearly 50% upside from current levels. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bank argues that generative AI is more likely to increase demand for transformation projects than replace Accenture’s role entirely.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>UBS estimates that generative AI could add 250 to 300 basis points to Accenture’s annual growth rate, supporting roughly 6% revenue growth through 2030. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It also points to the firm’s growing share of fixed-price contracts, now about 60% of revenue, which could help cushion margin pressure from AI-driven pricing changes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Valuation and outlook</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Valuation has become part of the bull case. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Accenture trades at around 14 times its two-year forward earnings, its lowest multiple in more than a decade and a discount to the S&amp;P 500. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Management has also guided to at least $9.3 billion in capital returns in fiscal 2026, representing more than 90% of projected free cash flow.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While questions remain over the pace of AI adoption and its impact on consulting economics, Accenture’s growing list of partnerships suggests the firm is determined to position itself at the centre of enterprise AI deployment rather than be sidelined by it.</span></p></span></div></div>",
