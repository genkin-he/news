            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Dominic Green</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is not true that political scientists have no sense of humor. They even have a joke: \"Political science is not about politics and it's not a science.\" Social science has become a joke, though sociologists take themselves too seriously to admit it. Sociology is supposed to supply quantifiable kinds of self-knowledge about life in the mass, but it led the academic drift from describing social behavior to pathologizing political wrongthink. Yet as Kwame Anthony Appiah, a professor of philosophy and law at New York University, observes in the thoughtful and entertaining \"Captive Gods,\" founders of modern sociology such as Émile Durkheim, Georg Simmel and Max Weber were \"preoccupied with religion.\" Though religion generates quantifiable social activities, it begins and ends in unquantifiable personal experiences. No wonder sociologists prefer to focus on the other subject we must avoid in polite society: politics.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Captive Gods\" describes how the \"emerging science of society became at the same time a science of religion.\" Our concepts of society and religion were born, Mr. Appiah writes, as \"twins.\" The study of society emerged like Jacob after Esau, clutching the heel of the \"secular study of something called religion.\" Though religion was the firstborn, religion as we understand it arrived late. To the Romans,  religio meant correct public practice. To Cicero it meant \"rules or strictures\"; following him, Mr. Appiah writes, St. Augustine observed that it refers not only to worship but to \"the observance of duties in human relationships.\" For Aquinas, it meant monastic life. Our idea of religion is a by-blow of the Reformation, a Protestant concept foregrounding a personal state of mind and creedal beliefs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, Scottish Enlightenment thinkers such as David Hume and Adam Ferguson discovered society. The French Revolution then dynamited Europe's old order and dynamized society as a collective organism, evolving in a \"quasi-biological and determinate way.\" A cohort of German Protestant thinkers such as Friedrich Schleiermacher theorized religion similarly — change was now progress, and liberal society clearly the heir to medieval religion. The march of science required a band, so a technocratic Catholic liberal, Auguste Comte, coined \"sociology.\" Comte's Religion of Humanity had a priesthood of experts and a science-worshipping liturgy. Today, his gospel hides in plain sight in our faith in technology and in the Comtean motto on the Brazilian flag, \"Order and Progress.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The first of Mr. Appiah's modern \"creators of 'religion'\" is Edward Burnett Tylor (1832-1917), the first Oxford professor of anthropology. In \"Primitive Culture\" (1871), Tylor used a German concept, \"culture,\" to explain the progress of religious belief from what he called animism — the tendency of the \"lower races\" to impute spirits to inanimate objects — to a monotheistic apogee that happened to resemble his Quaker upbringing. Tylor's contemporary William Robertson Smith (1846-94) disagreed. The \"antique religions,\" Robertson Smith wrote, weren't built on beliefs and creeds but \"institutions and practices\" that created a \"solidarity of the gods and their worshippers as part of one organic society.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tylor and Robertson Smith agreed, however, that what Tylor called the \"essential rationality of primitive peoples\" linked the savage past and the civilized present. This implied that the religious traffic ran in both directions. For Sigmund Freud religion is a personal projection in which primitive impulses crack the crust of civilized manners. For Durkheim (1858-1917), religion exercises a similar \"constraint over the individual.\" But it is a  représentation collective, one of the \"social facts\" through which society shapes and understands itself. In \"The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life\" (1912), Durkheim wrote that religions create a \"moral community\" by dividing life into the sacred and the profane. Through religious ideas, people \"represent to themselves the society of which they are members.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Durkheim argued that the symbolic content of religion conveys the deep truth about society. Simmel (1858-1918) thought that Durkheim dodged the \"concrete reality\" of faith and experience. In \"Sociology\" (1908), Simmel called religion \"an attitude of the soul,\" a \"certain state of being\" that cannot be disproved by science unless it becomes \"rigidified into a system of knowledge that somehow imitates\" science. The power of religious ideas lies in their \"subjective, emotional value.\" Society mobilizes that power for collective ends, creating conflict between individuals, inside groups and between different groups.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"For Durkheim, the content of religion was society; for Simmel, the form of religion was society,\" Mr. Appiah writes. For Simmel's friend Weber (1864-1920), however, religions and societies were distinct and plural entities. They shared common origins in \"orgiastic\" rites but developed differently; it took a Protestant ethic to arouse the spirit of capitalism. Weber's yardstick of religious development was sociological rationalization: taking the magic out of religion (\"disenchantment\"), generating a coherent worldview and defining religion's ethical stance on worldly matters. In 1917, during World War I, Weber detected an upsurge of irrationality that suggested sociology cannot master religion — the return of the ancient gods as disenchanted \"impersonal forces,\" notably in the impolite social form of politics.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sociology began, Mr. Appiah writes, by \"explaining itself in the effort to explain religion.\" Weber closed the circle by explaining social life as mythical combat. Much subsequent sociology has run around this Weberian circuit, powered by new techniques such as quantitative modeling and evolutionary biology. Mr. Appiah summarizes the struggle to rationalize a coherent image of Weber-world, the endless debate on whether sociology can separate itself from religion (it clearly cannot), and the emerging awareness that secularization was a future that came and went. We now inhabit, Mr. Appiah writes, an \"epistemologically fallen world\" of competing \"stakeholders.\" The Victorians worried about a \"world denuded of larger significance,\" but we suffer from both material surfeit and spiritual abundance, and are captive to a surplus of competing and increasingly angry gods. It really is beyond belief.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Mr. Green is a Journal contributor and a fellow of the Royal Historical Society.</span></li></ul></span></div></div>",

She added that she has a close eye on recent layoff announcements and noted that a sudden drop in the stock market and a longer-than-expected government shutdown could pose risks to spending and economic activity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But \"the remaining risks to employment are ones we can monitor closely and respond to if they are becoming more likely to materialize, not ones that currently warrant further preemptive action,\" Logan said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>She added that inflation is too high and too slow to return to the Fed's 2% target.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Logan is not a policy-voting member this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>FINANCIAL MARKETS STILL EXPECT RATE CUT IN DECEMBER</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Schmid, who does have a vote on the policy-setting committee this year and dissented on this week's move, explained on Friday in a written release that he, like Logan, feels the labor market is largely in balance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Any weakness, he said, is \"more likely than not\" due to structural changes in technology and demographics rather than slowing underlying demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Judging from healthy consumer spending and business investment, the economy still has momentum, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I do not think a 25-basis-point reduction in the policy rate will do much to address stress in the labor market,\" Schmid said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A cut, however, \"could have a longer-lasting effect on inflation if the Fed's commitment to its 2% inflation target comes into question,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fed Governor Stephen Miran also dissented this week, but in favor of a larger half-percentage-point cut. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financial markets pared expectations on a rate cut in December after Powell signaled it could be in doubt, but are still betting two-to-one the central bank will cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point at its final meeting of the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even with the U.S. government shutdown and the lack of official economic data creating uncertainty about current conditions - one reason Powell gave for a possible pause in December - Logan said she feels she has visibility into the state of the economy.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Peter Cozzens</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Lakota chief Sitting Bull and his starving band of followers ended nearly two decades of intermittent warfare with the United States on July 20, 1881, when they surrendered at Fort Buford, in Dakota Territory. Sitting Bull had not wanted war. Like the other traditionals among the Cheyennes and Lakotas, he had desired simply to follow the old way of life — hunting buffalo, raiding tribal enemies and camping where he wished.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. government had other plans for the northern Plains Indians. By the end of 1875, the federal government had successfully cajoled or coerced all but the followers of Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, together with a few hundred roaming Cheyennes and a handful of Arapahos, onto reservations where they were expected to abandon tradition and take up farming. In 1876 President Ulysses S. Grant ordered the Army to subjugate the traditionals. The American Indians had done nothing to warrant war, but white trespassers had discovered gold in the sacred Black Hills, a mountain range in what is now western South Dakota and northeastern Wyoming. At the time these lands were a part of the Great Sioux Reservation, guaranteed to the Lakotas in perpetuity. The traditionals had refused to permit its sale, and for that they would be made to pay.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sitting Bull embodied Lakota and Cheyenne resistance to reservation life. He believed his purpose was to ensure the welfare of his people. No threats, no bribes, no offers of annuities or gifts, no peace overtures could sway him from fighting for them, their land and their traditional way of life. When he spoke, his people listened.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sitting Bull also spoke to Wakan Tanka, or Great Mystery, the sacred spiritual power revered by the Lakotas. On June 6, 1876, we are told, Sitting Bull had a great vision. After performing the Sun Dance and staring into the sun, he fell into a trance. When he awoke, he recounted his vision: Just below the sun, he had seen many soldiers and horses plunging from the sky like so many grasshoppers into a village; there were some of his people falling headfirst too. These soldiers \"have no ears,\" a numinous voice told Sitting Bull. \"They are to die.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sitting Bull's vision electrified the village. The meaning was clear: The Lakotas and the Cheyennes would soon win a spectacular victory.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nineteen days after Sitting Bull's prophecy, the American Indians won the Battle of Little Big Horn. The annihilation of George Armstrong Custer and the larger part of his Seventh Cavalry steeled the U.S. Army to greater efforts, however. Torn between fighting and the need to feed their families, the American Indian warriors could not sustain a prolonged war. In spring 1877, Crazy Horse capitulated; Sitting Bull led his followers into Canadian exile, where they would remain for four years until hunger drove them back across the border.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This tragic epoch is the subject of Paul L. Hedren's \"Sitting Bull's War: The Battle of Little Big Horn and the Fight for Buffalo and Freedom on the Plains.\" Mr. Hedren tells the story, from the American Indians' perspective, of a conflict that \"ended a unique lifeway for all time, a lifeway once marked with untold richness and freedom on the buffalo prairie of old.\" In the wake of the Great Sioux War — or Sitting Bull's War, as Mr. Hedren refers to it — there would come an \"unimaginable future of continued privation, death, a duplicitous government, land theft, the complete annihilation of the last of the once mighty buffalo herds, and Indian lives inexorably transformed.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Left Hand, an Arapaho veteran of Little Big Horn, later reflected on this transformation. \"The Indian is like a prisoner on his reservation. . . . The buffalo are all gone, the antelope are gone, and now we old men can only sit by the fire, sing our war songs and dream of the past.\" Left Hand's musings are but one of a multitude of native sources in \"Sitting Bull's War.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mr. Hedren is at his best when he relates the American Indian versions of the 1876 battles of the Rosebud and Little Big Horn, the two principal clashes of the Great Sioux War. A deep sense of the ultimate catastrophe these battles wrought for the victors is evident. Of the aftermath of Little Big Horn in the American Indian camps, Mr. Hedren writes, \"the anguish was widespread and palpable. Burial details varied. Already some of the deceased were interred in rocky crevices west of the village while a few others were lofted to scaffolds in the riverside tree cover. Still others were placed in funerary lodges. . . . Soldiers in the distant army circle saw burial pyres and heard the rhythmic drumming and singing of mourning songs. They interpreted it as a night of revelry.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>No other historian has mined American Indian accounts — written, oral and pictographic — of a war with the U.S. government more thoroughly than Mr. Hedren has here. The book could have been enriched with substantial material on Lakota and Cheyenne cultures, as well as detailed maps of both battles to help readers trace movements and understand clashes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As an encyclopedic recounting of the battles, skirmishes and other encounters of the Great Sioux War and of its antecedents, however, \"Sitting Bull's War\" succeeds admirably, and is a worthwhile addition to the literature on the Indian Wars of the West that students of that era will welcome.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Mr. Cozzens is the author of \"Deadwood: Gold, Guns, and Greed in the American West.\"</span></li></ul></span></div></div>",

That builds on an existing partnership with the lab, but Ramaco said it would also work with other Energy Department laboratories on rare earths.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The amount of money that might be spent wasn't covered in the news release. Ramaco didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Next, Ramaco said that Goldman Sachs will \"act as the exclusive structuring agent in connection with its previously announced initiative to establish a Strategic Critical Minerals Terminal at Ramaco's Brook Mine facility in Wyoming.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The terminal is a Ramaco idea to reduce America's dependence on supplies of Chinese rare-earth products. It could serve as a strategic stockpile where Ramaco and other producers could store the metals. Eventually, it could become a center for trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China dominates the global rare-earth market with an estimated 85% of global processing capacity. Rare-earth materials end up in everything from electronics to electric vehicles to wind turbines to fighter jets. Their use has almost quadrupled over the past 10 years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The move caps a wild month for Ramaco and other rare-earth shares. Coming into Friday trading, shares had traded as high as $57.80 and as low as $27.24. Catalyzing the volatility was a threat from China to restrict rare-earth exports. Chances of the country making good on that threat diminished as trade talks with the U.S. advanced.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All the volatility left Ramaco stock down 11% month to date and off 27% since China's threat in early October. The declines left Ramaco stock up 189% year to date.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The trading pattern has been similar for shares of MP Materials and USA Rare Earth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MP stock was down 3.3% in early trading. USA Rare Earth shares were down 2.6%. Coming into Friday trading, MP stock was up 316% year to date. USA Rare Earth shares were up 71%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors might believe the Ramaco news represents competition for the other two, but the stock moves also might just be trading-related volatility. There is plenty of rare-earth business to go around.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MP, the largest of the three, makes only a fraction of the rare earths used by American businesses annually. USA Rare Earth and Ramaco don't have rare-earth revenue yet. USA Rare Earth is developing a mine in Texas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MP signed a blockbuster deal with the Defense Department in July that included an equity stake, a price floor for rare-earth materials, and a guaranteed customer for rare-earth magnets from production infrastructure the company is building.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deal reshaped the U.S. rare-earth industry, creating the frenzy investors have been dealing with for months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
