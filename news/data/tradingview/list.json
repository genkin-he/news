The program includes the introduction of a recurring annual $500 million buyback as announced late last year, plus the $1 billion top up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The stock climbed around 5% in early trading to hit its highest level since before a December investor day that had weighed on shares.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>J.P. Morgan analysts described the unexpected extra buyback as \"the culmination of a number of resilience building activities and strong [Swiss Solvency Test ratio].\" The move reflects a pattern of proactive capital management often seen as pricing cycles soften, where underwriters prioritize capital returns over chasing volume, Jefferies wrote in a note to clients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods struck a more cautious note and questioned the sustainability of such payouts as the total capital return slightly exceeded net operating capital generation for the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the full year, Swiss Re reported a 47% jump in net profit to a record $4.8 billion, beating its own guidance of more than $4.4 billion for 2025. The increase was driven by disciplined underwriting and a benign catastrophe environment in its property and casualty units, which helped offset a weaker showing in its life and health business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Performance in the last three months of the year was more nuanced. Swiss Re's net income reached $717 million, beating the company-compiled consensus of $687 million but falling sharply from the $1.05 billion recorded a year earlier. The top-line was also softer as insurance revenue slipped 6% to $11.14 billion while its investment result fell 12% to $966 million, with both metrics trailing consensus expectations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The quarterly print was weighed down by a review of underperforming life and health portfolios in Australia, Israel and South Korea. Swiss Re had warned this would shave off $250 million from its fourth-quarter earnings, leading it to miss its the division's annual profit target. While the review is now completed, analysts remain divided with some noting that the managed impact should reassure while others cautioned it may take some quarters of clean results to believe the issues are in the rearview mirror.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"All three of our business units are positioned to deliver consistent results,\" Chief Executive Officer Andreas Berger said. The company maintained its $4.5 billion net profit target for 2026, which includes a $1.7 billion contribution from the rehabilitated life and health business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition to the buybacks, the board proposed a 9% increase to its annual dividend to $8.0 per share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Elena Vardon at elena.vardon@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

Debt is above 100% of output across most rich economies and set to rise given ageing population costs, interest bills and pressure to spend more on defence and climate change. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. policymakers are already optimistic on AI-driven growth and economists say the technology has the potential to shake the world out of a post-2008 productivity slump by boosting workers' efficiency and freeing them to focus on more productive tasks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Higher economic growth would make government spending and debt loads potentially more manageable and help fend off scrutiny from bond vigilantes. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To sketch the impact on public finances if AI does boost labour productivity over the long term, the OECD and three high- profile economists shared early estimates with Reuters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>        Filiz Unsal, the OECD's deputy director of economic policy and research, said an AI productivity surge, were it to increase employment, would lower debt across OECD countries, from the U.S. to Germany and Japan, by 10 percentage points from the roughly 150% of output the organisation expects in 2036.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That would still be a sharp rise from 110% currently. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>        Much will depend on whether job creation eventually outweighs any job losses from automation, as well as whether firms pass on higher profits by raising wages and how governments manage their overall spending. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>        In the United States, two of the other economists projected debt rising more slowly to roughly 120% over the next decade from around 100% of output now in their best-case scenarios. One saw little change.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Productivity is like magic... It helps the fiscal dynamics dramatically,\" said Idanna Appio, one of the economists, who was previously at the New York Federal Reserve and is now a fund manager at First Eagle Investment Management.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"But our fiscal problems are well beyond what productivity can fix,\" Appio said.</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:820.8092485549132px;aspect-ratio:1.3680154142581888\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2026:newsml_L1N3ZN0CW-b9583ac1711c566bbbe86da702c367d2-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"The line chart shows the debt-to-GDP ratios for G7 countries which have risen sharply in recent decades.\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2026:newsml_L1N3ZN0CW-b9583ac1711c566bbbe86da702c367d2-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8\"/></picture></div></button><figcaption class=\"caption-CvWHk7Ya\"><span class=\"copyright-CvWHk7Ya\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-CvWHk7Ya\">Debt levels have risen sharply across developed economies</span></figcaption></figure><p class=\"\"><span>        DEMOGRAPHICS TO LIMIT AI IMPACT</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For now, ratings agency S&amp;P assumes no major public finance impact by the end of the decade. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The one (path) that the (U.S.) administration is hoping for would be you get saved by the bell,\" said Mark Patrick, head of macro and country risk at Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, but added: that isn't \"something we can set our clocks by.\" </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The economists did not provide estimates for other countries. However, AI could boost productivity in Britain in line with the U.S., but by half as much in Italy and Japan due to lower adoption rates and smaller sectors that could benefit from AI, OECD research has found.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ultimately, fiscal dynamics will determine how much AI-driven productivity can counterbalance rising debt. Demographics is the biggest challenge. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The root of the debt issue is with ageing demographics and the entitlements that are tied to that,\" said Kevin Khang, who heads global economic research at Vanguard, the world's second- largest asset manager. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Addressing it \"requires getting the fiscal house in order and (AI is) just buying us the time,\" he said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Khang sees a scenario where AI boosts U.S. growth to average 3% through 2040 as most likely.

That's much lower than the 180% he foresees - higher than others - if AI disappoints, growth slows and market pressure raises borrowing costs. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bond investors have been quick to punish governments for fiscal largesse ever since bond yields rose sharply after the pandemic across rich economies. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Appio said declining U.S. immigration added to the demographic challenge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The labour shock offsets any (AI) productivity growth,\" she said, but added she would be much more worried without AI. </span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:916.1290322580645px;aspect-ratio:1.5268817204301075\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2026:newsml_L1N3ZN0CW-abbf70b05b44f8982b1df5f5ed229de2-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"Benchmark 10-year government bond yields in the G7\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2026:newsml_L1N3ZN0CW-abbf70b05b44f8982b1df5f5ed229de2-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#f2f0f0\"/></picture></div></button><figcaption class=\"caption-CvWHk7Ya\"><span class=\"copyright-CvWHk7Ya\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-CvWHk7Ya\">Benchmark 10-year government bond yields in the G7</span></figcaption></figure><p class=\"\"><span>UNCERTAINTY AROUND TAX, SPENDING</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Economy-wide productivity gains should raise revenues.

Domestic demand remains lackluster despite a pick up in consumption during the Lunar New Year holiday, Cui says. \"The persistently slack job market in recent years is the primary reason that household income growth is relatively weak, and a key reason that anxious households are saving more,\" he says. Investors will be closely watching China's job-market data in the coming months, as some labor-market indicators have been pointing to an improvement since late 2025.

Still, signs of retail-trader bullishness have re-emerged as SNAP heads for its second straight weekly gain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Two senior Snap, Inc. senior leaders sold company shares recently, disclosures on Thursday showed. Chief Business Officer Ajit Mohan 119,339 shares for about $561,060, while Zachary Briers, Snap’s general counsel, sold 203,325 shares for about $958,120. Following the trades, Mohan and Briers own 5.2 million shares and 2.8 million shares of Snap, respectively.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The transaction comes just as Snap stock shows a nascent rebound, catapulting it to the top of retail investors’ radars. </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SNAP\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">SNAP shares</a><span> rose 3.8% on Thursday, their best move in over a month, and have gained in six of the last seven sessions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Several users on Stocktwits noted that the stock could be at an inflection point after a sharp slide in recent months. “I really think profitability will change everything from now on.
