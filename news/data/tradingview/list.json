            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Giulia Petroni</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies meet Sunday with a familiar dilemma: add barrels to the market or continue holding back against a fragile geopolitical backdrop.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OPEC+, the alliance led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, decided to keep output steady in the first quarter after a series of production increases last year. Analysts say the group is now expected to resume hikes, starting with a modest increase of 137,000 barrels a day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An output boost would signal the alliance is restarting the gradual rollback of voluntary cuts of around 1.65 million barrels a day originally set to remain in place through the end of 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some analysts expect the remaining curbs to be unwound within six months, while others see the process stretching to year-end. Many warn, however, that only about half of any quota increase typically translates into actual output, as some members face capacity constraints.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OPEC didn't respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The oil market should be able to absorb further barrels,\" said Giovanni Staunovo, strategist at UBS. The ICE Brent forward curve remains in backwardation--meaning near-term oil prices are higher than future prices--suggesting the market is tight in the short term.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Goldman Sachs sees OPEC+ positioned to raise production modestly from April to June after a series of supply disruptions earlier this year, particularly in Kazakhstan, and due to lower-than-expected inventories in OECD countries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Much of the anticipated surplus remains outside major pricing hubs, with Russian, Iranian, and Venezuelan barrels accumulating on tankers at sea. Meanwhile, geopolitical concerns are keeping front-month prices supported.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In midmorning European trading Friday, Brent traded around $71 a barrel, while WTI was above $65 a barrel. A February survey of major Wall Street banks compiled by The Wall Street Journal showed Brent crude is expected to average at around $61 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at $58 in the second quarter--above previous projections by around $1, but still below 2025 levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The resumption of output hikes would come as markets closely monitor developments in the Middle East, wary that any escalation between the U.S. and Iran could disrupt energy flows in the oil-rich region. The two countries are expected to resume discussions next week after the latest round of talks wrapped up on Thursday without a deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Any escalation of conflict is likely to see OPEC step in to calm the market,\" said Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari, commodity analysts at ANZ Research. If disruptions occur, OPEC+ is expected to tap spare capacity--with most of it sitting in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Giulia Petroni at giulia.petroni@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The unemployment rate fell relatively little to just above 3 million, with the adjusted rate staying at 6.3%. However, this stabilization continues to be driven by a major structural change in employment, he says. In the figures for December, 180,000 jobs were lost in the manufacturing sector compared with the previous year, offset by growth in the public sector and in health and nursing, among other areas, Schattenberg says.

That growth is set to continue, as the company said it closed $64 billion in AI-optimized server orders in the last quarter.

It feels like it's waiting for its next real catalyst,\" City Index market strategist Fiona Cincotta said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You've got headwinds - concerns about policy uncertainty, tariffs and the lack of clarity there. Tailwinds - you've got the prospect of the Fed just keeping interest rates on hold for longer; you've got that slight safe-haven demand from geopolitical concerns,\" she said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"But it doesn't feel like there's anything that's sort of really just driving the moves right now.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The dollar has gained around 0.6% against a basket of currencies this month, helped by Federal Reserve policymakers signalling that more rate cuts were not necessarily a given and several expressed their openness to rate hikes if inflation remains elevated. Traders expect two more rate cuts this year, but not until at least June. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>YUAN PAUSES</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The yuan took a breather from a 10-day-long rally, after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) moved on Friday to slow the pace of the rise. It said it would scrap the foreign exchange risk reserves for some forward contracts - seen as a way to encourage dollar buying.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That, alongside a weaker-than-expected yuan midpoint fix, sent the onshore yuan </span><span> down 0.2% to 6.8553 per dollar. It has still gained around 2% so far this year, after appreciating more than 4% in 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It is clear that the PBOC wants the yuan appreciation pace to slow,\" said analysts at Maybank.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They said that its recent gains could reflect the view that China has gained leverage after the U.S. Supreme Court quashed President Donald Trump's tariffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The prospect of a divergence in global interest rates has driven much of the currency market action this month. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Aussie dollar was up 0.12% at $0.7115. It is the best-performing G10 currency this year, with a gain of 6%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Bank of Japan is also set to raise rates, though that has done little to help the yen </span><span> as domestic politics complicate the rate outlook, despite BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda signalling openness to a near-term hike. The Japanese currency has weakened throughout February, allowing the dollar to gain nearly 0.9%. On Friday, it traded at 156.17 yen. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sterling </span><span> was steady at $1.348, and set to snap three straight months of gains with a 1.4% fall in February. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A local election in Manchester on Thursday delivered a landslide victory to Britain's Green Party, in a blow to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour party, whose popularity has slid sharply in the past year. Sterling is fairly sensitive to domestic politics, but with a number of risk events ahead, such as next week's budget update from finance minister Rachel Reeves, any volatility was contained. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Whilst it gives us a lot of interesting information about where Labour sits, it's not sufficient to really put Keir Starmer on a path to the door out,\" City Index's Cincotta said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The euro </span><span> was stable, trading around $1.18, set for a monthly loss of 0.4%.</span></p></span></div></div>",
