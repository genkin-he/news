This year, it’s being held in Belem, a port city in Brazil’s lower Amazon region between November 6 and November 21.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Brazil was also in the spotlight this week due to one of its bloodiest police operations, which killed at least 132 people.

The company is seeking to block the enforcement of the laws.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In North Dakota, State District Judge James Gion reduced the $667 million in damages awarded against Greenpeace for its role in Dakota Access Pipeline protests. The amount owed to Energy Transfer is now capped at $345 million, with the judge ruling some damages were excessive or duplicative.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, the European Court of Human Rights sided with Norway’s government in a climate case brought by young activists who argued Arctic oil exploration endangered their future.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What to Watch​</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Click here for a brief video explainer on how climate change is impacting hurricanes and typhoons, as scientists say that oceans have absorbed about 90% of the warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions over the last 40 years.
