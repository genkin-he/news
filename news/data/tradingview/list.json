            "title": "Trump's Demands Throw Wrench Into Delicate Shutdown Talks — WSJ",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Lindsay Wise, Brian Schwartz and Siobhan Hughes</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WASHINGTON — President Trump's demand that Republican senators bypass Democrats to reopen the federal government risked upsetting delicate negotiations on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers were finally making progress toward a deal to end the monthlong impasse and head off more pain for American households.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Optimism had been growing among Republican and Democratic senators involved in talks over recent days, with hopes that a resolution could be reached in the week ahead, people familiar with discussions said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But Trump's new demand in a social-media message late Thursday to eliminate the Senate filibuster rule could complicate the path forward. Meanwhile, food aid is at risk of lapsing for millions of people, the nation's airports are increasingly snarled, and Affordable Care Act health-plan enrollees are confronted with sharply higher premiums.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump has been frustrated with Democrats over the shutdown, and for weeks he has been considering the idea of eliminating the filibuster to try to expedite a reopening, according to a senior White House official. After returning from a weeklong trip to Asia, he finally \"pulled the trigger\" in the Truth Social post, the official said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The filibuster rule requires most bills to get 60 votes to advance in the Senate, giving the minority party significant power to block or shape legislation. Since September, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has demanded talks to extend expiring enhanced ACA subsidies before Democrats will provide the votes for a GOP bill to reopen the government. Republicans have a 53-47 majority, and so far, only three senators who caucus with Democrats have crossed the aisle in more than a dozen failed votes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In remarks Friday on his way to Florida, Trump didn't mention his filibuster demand, but reiterated that he was willing to talk with Democrats if they would provide votes to reopen the government.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Let them open up the country, and we'll meet,\" he said. \"It's so easily solved.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A White House spokeswoman said that if Democrats don't work with Republicans to reopen the government, then the \"nuclear option\" of ending the filibuster will need to be used.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump's stance is at odds with that of many Senate Republicans. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R., S.D.) has pledged to protect the longstanding rule, and a spokesman said Friday that his position hadn't changed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rising pressure</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Recent days have been marked by flight delays across the country — including at Reagan National Airport, which held up senators' trips home Thursday. The delays were in part due to absenteeism among air-traffic controllers who have been working without pay.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Friday's disruptions to air travel were among the most widespread since the shutdown began. The Federal Aviation Administration issued ground delays for flights out of airports including those in New York, Boston, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston. Federal officials have warned that the shutdown's impact on the aviation system could worsen over the weekend.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Saturday, the lapse in funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program serving more than 40 million lower-income and disabled people could start hitting households and the businesses where they shop. Money is also running out for an aid program for pregnant women and infants, as well as federally funded Headstart child-care centers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While SNAP has enrollees in red and blue states, Democrats have been the fiercest defenders of the program. In his comments Friday, Trump cast it as largely a Democratic issue. \"When you're talking about SNAP, if you look it's largely Democrats, they're hurting their own people,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Democrats have charged that the Trump administration is withholding money from a contingency fund that could be used to fund SNAP. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Friday that was \"absolutely false,\" maintaining that the law doesn't allow the use of the fund during a shutdown — and wouldn't be sufficient to cover the full cost in any case.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Friday, two federal judges said the Trump administration must use emergency funds to keep paying federal food-assistance benefits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unions and airline executives have urged Congress to pass Republicans' stopgap bill to reopen the government, putting more pressure on Democrats. Many government workers missed their first full paychecks in the past week, even as the administration has scraped together funds to keep troops paid.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This weekend also brings open enrollment for next year's ACA health coverage, and many consumers are facing sticker shock. Enhanced subsidies passed by Democrats during the Covid-19 pandemic are expiring at the end of the year. Republicans didn't extend the temporary subsidies in Trump's \"big beautiful\" tax-and-spending law.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>New optimism on Capitol Hill</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While lawmakers said any deal would take some time and wouldn't come before the weekend deadlines, there had been signs of progress Thursday, the last day of this past week's session.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The conversations that I've been in with my colleagues, I think this week have been more productive than any other week so far,\" Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D., Nev.) said in an interview Thursday. \"You're seeing both Democrats and Republicans feeling the impacts from their own constituents.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Thursday, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.), Angus King (I., Maine) and Maggie Hassan (D., N.H.) could be seen heading into Schumer's offices. After they left, they streamed into a basement hideaway, where Sens. Jacky Rosen (D., Nev.) and Gary Peters (D., Mich.) joined them. Peters and Shaheen are preparing to retire and are seen as being at the crux of any deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thune expressed hope Thursday that the outcome of elections Tuesday would shake loose more members who might be willing to negotiate, describing them as a possible \"inflection point\" to reopen the government. Virginia and New Jersey have competitive governor races, while New York City is voting for mayor.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Maybe that'll free some people up to be able to vote yes,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump's call to end the filibuster puts Democrats in an awkward spot. When they were in the majority, they moved to weaken the rule, saying it grew out of past efforts to block civil-right laws. But defections kept them short of the 51 votes needed. Now, with Republicans in charge, Democrats are using the same rule to block the GOP.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.) said Friday on CNN that Republicans \"don't work for the American people, they work for Donald Trump.\" He didn't weigh in on whether the Senate should keep the filibuster. \"It is a Jim Crow relic, but ultimately it is their decision, \" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Support for the filibuster among Republican senators is widespread, but some have floated ideas to change or eliminate the rule to end the shutdown.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If Democrats don't stop playing games, it's time to blow up the filibuster,\" Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R., Ala.) said on X.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ending it now would clear the way for Republicans to reopen the government with a party-line vote, but it would dramatically reshape the way the Senate operates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The filibuster has traditionally been viewed as a very important safeguard,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson (R., La.). \"If the shoe was on the other foot, I don't think our team would like it.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Lindsay Wise at lindsay.wise@wsj.com, Brian Schwartz at brian.schwartz@wsj.com and Siobhan Hughes at Siobhan.hughes@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The sudden decline followed an initial post-Fed volatility spike, as traders reacted to the US Federal Reserve’s 25bps rate cut and announcement of an impending end to quantitative tightening. With uncertainty still lingering, BTC briefly slipped into a risk-off spiral, testing investor conviction and flushing out leveraged positions in the process.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the market turbulence, several analysts argue this move may represent a classic shakeout, rather than the beginning of a larger breakdown. Historically, Bitcoin has often seen sharp pullbacks immediately before renewed upside momentum, especially during early liquidity-expansion phases.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For now, all eyes are on whether Bitcoin can stabilize and reclaim the $110K zone, a level that has repeatedly acted as a pivot throughout the past month. As markets digest the Fed’s decision, the focus turns to whether Bitcoin can wake up from this sudden sell-off and reclaim strength heading into November.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>PoC Becomes Critical Battleground as Market Signals Indecision</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to top analyst On-chain Mind, Bitcoin’s current price structure is being defined by a major volume cluster centered around $117,000, which now serves as the Point of Control (PoC) in the local market profile.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This level represents the price zone with the highest traded volume in the recent range — effectively the point where buyers and sellers have shown the strongest interest and where the market has spent considerable time balancing liquidity.</span></p><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1066.6666666666667px;aspect-ratio:1.7777777777777777\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:e92173991094b-2ed44111565e8dc3ed9d7deb8c167e04-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Bitcoin OCM Local Volume Profile | Source: On-Chain Mind\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:e92173991094b-2ed44111565e8dc3ed9d7deb8c167e04-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#1b1d20\"/></picture></div></figure></span><p class=\"\"><span>In practical terms, the PoC functions as a fair value zone for market participants. When the price trades below it, bulls need to reclaim the level to regain trend strength; when the price trades above it, the zone tends to act as support. Today, BTC remains beneath the $117K PoC, signaling that the market has yet to re-establish bullish dominance after the recent shakeout.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On-chain Mind notes that reclaiming $117K would likely trigger renewed momentum, opening the door for a retest of the $120K–$123K range. Until then, however, the structure remains indecisive, with price hovering in a neutral zone where neither bulls nor bears hold a clear advantage. This aligns with broader market behavior: reduced leverage, mixed sentiment, and trader caution following aggressive liquidations earlier in October.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The market is digesting macro shifts, recalibrating position sizes, and waiting for a clearer signal. If Bitcoin can stabilize above recent support and begin rotating back toward the PoC, reclaiming $117K could mark the moment the next leg up begins.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Bitcoin Attempts Rebound Above $110K</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading near $110,180 on the 4-hour timeframe, attempting to stabilize after yesterday’s sharp drop. The price managed to reclaim the $110K level, suggesting buyers stepped in at intraday lows around $108,500, an important local demand zone that has repeatedly supported the price since mid-October.

            "title": "Vail's CEO Has Transformed Skiing, Whether You Like It or Not — WSJ",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Allison Pohle</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rob Katz knows some skiers don't like him. But the chief executive of Vail Resorts has dramatically changed the ski industry over the past two decades — and that's usually worked out well for his business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Katz, 58, is plunging into one of Vail's toughest seasons since he began working with the resort company more than three decades ago. Last winter, visits to Vail's 37 North American resorts declined, even though the number of U.S. skiers hitting the slopes increased overall. Sales of Vail's flagship product, its all-access Epic Pass, have been going downhill. The company's stock price is down more than 50% since its peak in 2021.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That was the year Katz stepped down from his first stint as Vail's CEO after 15 years in the role. Over that time, he presided over an acquisition spree and the launch of the Epic Pass, which revolutionized the ski business by offering a single lift ticket for unlimited access to dozens of Vail properties around the world. Last spring, Vail pulled him off the bench, hoping he could steady its business and help the company recover from a series of missteps.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vail's rise has made the company — and Katz himself — a social-media punching bag for skiers and snowboarders who take issue with Vail's takeovers of smaller resorts, interminable lift lines and the escalating costs to eat and ride the lift. One barb often circulated online skewers Katz with the ultimate diss for clueless interlopers: \"Rob Katz skis in jeans.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Katz has seen the criticism. As the biggest player in skiing, he says Vail gets more than its fair share, but it's important to pay attention.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I would rather be in an industry and be selling a product that matters greatly to people and take on that responsibility for delivering on that, \" Katz said in an interview. \"Understanding, sometimes we won't get it right,\" he said, adding that the company needs to learn from the feedback it gets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This season, Vail will run more promotions to get skiers and snowboarders to their local Vail-owned hill for a single day of skiing, and Epic Pass holders will be able to bring friends at a steep discount. Tech upgrades will help smooth out customers' experience, he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Katz has warned investors that Vail expects visits to be down slightly this season compared with last year, mainly due to lower Epic Pass sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Heading west</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here's the thing: Katz really used to ski in jeans.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a 10-year-old kid growing up in New Rochelle, N.Y., Katz's introduction to the slopes was far from Vail's legendary powder. He grew up scraping icy turns at Hunter Mountain in upstate New York, wearing gaiters on his boots — and jeans. (It was the '70s.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business in 1988, Katz joined Apollo Management, where a company called Gillett Holdings came onto the newly established private-equity firm's radar.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gillett owned some television stations and a meat-processing plant, but Katz was interested in the company's ski-resort holdings in Colorado — Vail Resort and nearby Beaver Creek. Apollo began purchasing some of Gillett's outstanding loans and helped develop a debt-reduction plan, with Katz focused on Vail.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Katz joined its board of directors in 1996, and the company went public the following year. When Vail's CEO exited in 2006, other members of the board asked Katz if he'd be interested in taking over. He assumed the role in March 2006 at 39 years old.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As he settled into the job, countless people told Katz his job was \"snow farming\" — business waxed or waned depending on the snowfall.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company had a \"Colorado Pass\" in the early 2000s that gave access to several mountains. Even out-of-state skiers would fly in to wait in line to purchase it, a clue that demand was there for a multi-resort pass.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vail's solution was the Epic Pass, an industry-defining model that other companies have copied. For a steeply discounted price, pass holders get access not just to their local mountain, but all of the legendary resorts that Katz started bringing under Vail's banner after taking over: Park City in Utah, Stowe in Vermont, Whistler in Canada and more. When it was introduced, the idea was controversial. Skiers needed to purchase the pass ahead of the season, before they knew the conditions. The board questioned whether the pass would be the biggest mistake the company had ever made.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Today, skiers get access to more than 90 properties with the unlimited pass — including Hunter Mountain, which Vail acquired in 2019.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Epic Pass helped Vail multiply its season pass holder count from about 200,000 to about 2.3 million last season. This ski season, the unlimited pass started at $1,051. It's also inspired competitors, including the Ikon Pass from privately held Alterra Mountain Co. and the Indy Pass, which offers access to many smaller, locally owned resorts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alterra Mountain's CEO, Jared Smith, said the multi-mountain pass was a game changer for the ski industry, creating a more stable revenue stream and giving companies cash ahead of the season to invest in new lifts and terrain expansions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now, operating expenses are on the rise. Skiers are worried they might see more snafus, like last year's 12-day ski-patrol strike at Park City Mountain Resort. And more skiers are flocking to smaller mountains domestically — or even traveling to Europe or Japan instead. Vail must figure out how to grow its skier numbers without diminishing the on-mountain experience with longer lift lines or more crowded slopes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After a 3 1/2 -year stint as CEO and 14 years with the company, Katz's successor, Kirsten Lynch, was pushed out in the spring.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Getting back up</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of Katz's main tasks is getting more skiers to choose Vail's slopes, and he says that in pushing people to buy passes ahead of the season, Vail neglected its walk-up ticket strategy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On peak days, like holidays or weekends, individual lift tickets can cost upward of $300 at resorts like Park City or Breckenridge in Colorado.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company this season has introduced \"Epic Friend Tickets,\" a 50% discount from the single-day ticket price. The catch: The \"friend\" skis with a pass holder. The redeemed friend ticket can be put toward the cost of an Epic Pass next season.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vail has lowered lift ticket prices at certain resorts, including Keystone Resort in Colorado, where the season has already started. Prices will be 11% to 12% lower on some nonpeak days, and Katz says improvements to Vail's app are coming, including real-time ski lesson updates and the ability to use Apple or Google Pay, an improvement planned for next ski season.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He hopes to improve Vail's rental program, My Epic Gear, including tailored recommendations based on past preferences.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One thing that's not changing: Vail's core model. \"Our resorts aren't for sale,\" Katz says. But the company does plan to change its marketing to highlight what makes each resort special, rather than sell the entire Epic Pass network.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lynanne Kunkel, the company's chief human resources and chief transformation officer, has worked with Katz during both his CEO stints. He is an introspective person, she says, and is willing to challenge his own ideas, including the ones he put forth when creating the company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In meetings, she says, he pushes the leadership team to think about the future of the sport.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shifting Vail into its next phase will take time, Katz said. He points to Jake Burton, a pioneering maker of snowboards — an innovation that took years to be widely embraced, but ultimately brought more people to the mountains.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The same was true for passes like Epic, Katz says. \"In the end it turned out to be a real positive, so I think we need to be open for innovation and I think we need to be open for new ideas as a sport.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Speaking of ideas: In an upcoming episode of his \"Epic by Nature\" podcast, Katz discusses his long-held belief that making the sport more welcoming starts with dropping judgments about appearances. That's true, he says, about gear, skill level — or jeans.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Allison Pohle at allison.pohle@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Pamela Paul</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a \"very, very effeminate boy\" growing up in Baltimore, Ben Appel was teased mercilessly. At school, where he was regularly bullied, the other kids called him \"Bengay.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It was awful,\" Appel, now 42 and married to another man, recalled. \"I realized I wasn't going to survive, so I made it my full-time job to defeminize myself as a form of self-protection.\" In his 20s, Appel lobbied for gay marriage, and in 2017 he interned at Glaad, an LGBTQ advocacy group, determined to fight on behalf of kids like him.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But when Appel later enrolled at Columbia University, eager to learn about the theories behind his activism, the rhetoric he encountered felt more like dogma than inquiry. \"According to queer theory, if you're a man who behaves in 'unmasculine' ways or wears eyeliner you must be a woman inside, which I thought was regressive,\" Appel, who graduated in 2020, recalled. \"Saying that those superficial attributes are what make women women, and that any variation on the rough he-man stereotype means you're not a man, reinforces these rigid sex roles, and I thought we were supposed to be against those.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In his book \"Cis White Gay: The Making of a Gender Heretic,\" which comes out next week, Appel argues that gender ideology is \"illiberal, regressive and anti-gay\" — as much a cult as Lambs of God, the fundamentalist sect in which Appel was raised — and one that he and an increasingly vocal group of gay men, lesbians and bisexual people reject.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>More than three dozen in-depth interviews with gay men, lesbian women, bisexuals and transgender people, along with surveys and several new books, including \"The End of the Gay Rights Revolution\" by Ronan McCrea, also coming out next month, reveal a complicated — and contentious — relationship between the LGB and TQ+ components of what advocacy organizations and the Democratic party refer to as \"LGBTQ+ people.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While gay and lesbian people emphasized that they oppose discrimination and harassment of transgender adults, they resent being \"force teamed,\" \"taken over\" or \"erased\" by trans and queer ideologues, especially when gay people constitute 90% of those Gallup categorizes as LGBTQ+ . In private chat groups and burgeoning LGB organizations and on podcasts, many question whether same-sex attracted people should have allied themselves with trans and queer identities in the first place. To most LGBTQ+ groups this attitude is nothing short of trans exclusion and antithetical to their principles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These disagreements stem from radically different ways of viewing identity. Gay people typically see their homosexuality as fundamentally grounded in biology and based on attraction to people of the same sex. Transgender people instead prioritize gender identity, defined by the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, as \"one's innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither.\" Meanwhile, queer theory argues that both sex and gender exist on a spectrum and are often fluid, allowing for labels like nonbinary and genderqueer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There have always been fault lines within the rainbow coalition. But in the past 10 years, ever since the right to gay marriage was secured in 2015, further divisions have emerged and expanded, along with growing rancor and vitriol. All of which belies the overriding image of inclusion touted by advocacy groups.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"For those of us who work in this field as advocacy-focused political activists, these are hard conversations we have to have as a movement,\" said Cathy Renna, communications director for the National LGBTQ Task Force, which was founded in 1973 as the National Gay Task Force. \"To me, this is often about fear of the other, and nobody understands that better than queer people.\" As for gay people who don't believe in gender identity, Renna says, \"It's fine not to believe in it, but why do you have to impose what you believe on everyone else?\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Blowups regularly erupt over these conflicts. In August, for example, John Boyne, author of the bestselling \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,\" was boycotted by more than 800 writers when his new novel, which addresses homophobia and sexual assault, was shortlisted for the Polari Prize, a literary award for gay British authors. Boyne had publicly stated that he supports transgender rights except when they come into conflict with women's rights, for example in prisons and domestic violence shelters. His fellow nominees removed themselves from contention in protest. The prize was canceled, and Polari vowed to \"increase the representation of trans and gender non-conforming judges on the panels.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'None of this makes sense'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For LGBTQ advocates, solidarity has been the dominant strategy, one that often requires tamping down on conflicts, especially in the face of what most consider hostile rhetoric and policies from the Trump administration. In the aftermath of Trump's reelection, with its powerful \" Kamala Harris is for they/them\" ad campaign, when the Democratic congressman Seth Moulton  voiced reservations about trans-identified girls playing on girls' sports teams, he was excoriated by LGBTQ+ groups for \"harmful\" speech, and one of his top staff members quit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Everyone is hellbent on sticking together because they think there's strength and validation in numbers, but that's not true,\" says Arielle Scarcella, a 39-year-old Brooklyn-based YouTuber who frequently posts videos critiquing gender theory and trans activism to her 800,000 followers. \"I think there's safety in sanity, because people can understand things that make sense, and none of this makes sense. You now have straight people calling themselves queer because they have purple hair and are non-monogamous.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To Jose Arango, immigrating to America at 17, after growing up in \"conservative, religious homophobic\" Colombia, felt like a liberation. \"I threw myself into everything gay,\" said Arango, now 27. He became president of the Pride club at Miami-Dade Community College's Wolfson campus. He was awarded an LGBT scholarship from the Point Foundation. For the first time, he felt not only loved but celebrated. He had found his community. Though confused by people using what seemed to him \"eccentric pronouns,\" he figured, \"I'm in this new country where things are more advanced. I didn't really question it.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the more he read about queer theory, the more Arango rejected the concept of gender identity. \"It was all based on stereotypes,\" he said, and anathema to gay kids like himself who were teased for not being \"manly\" enough. When Arango began expressing these views in 2022, his boyfriend dumped him and denounced him as a \"transphobe.\" He lost most of his friends. What he had originally understood as a welcoming LGBTQ+ community now felt exclusionary and hostile.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There's a 'Don't be ungrateful' tone especially aimed at gays who never knew a gay world before gender ideology took over,\" Arango explained. \"My view is that it's they who have betrayed us — insisting there are lesbians with penises and gay men with vaginas and that any straight person calling themselves nonbinary somehow belongs.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many gays and lesbians say gender identity strips same-sex attraction of its meaning. \"Transgender and queer activists have disappeared the idea of sex, and that means getting rid of the idea of sexual orientation and the whole basis of being gay,\" says Ann Menasche, 72, a civil-rights lawyer and lifelong gay rights activist based in San Diego. \"I'm on the far left, but this really is not progressive.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2022 Menasche was fired from her job at Disability Rights California after objecting to the omission of the word \"women\" in a statement her employer put out in favor of abortion rights and speaking out about sex-based rights. \"I was called a bigot and a transphobe and such a danger to staff that I was refused unemployment,\" she said. (She filed a lawsuit, and the matter was litigated and resolved out of court. Disability Rights California did not respond to requests for comment.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Menasche was one of several interviewees who lost jobs for expressing similar views. \"What we're seeing is a witch hunt against lesbians,\" she said. For their part, trans advocates argue that trans women can also be lesbians and that it is lesbians who are being exclusionary. \"Efforts to exclude trans women and non-binary people from lesbian and feminist communities are ahistorical, morally wrong and go against the founding values of those movements,\" the National Center for LGBTQ Rights wrote in a statement issued during Lesbian Visibility Week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A battle over basic rights</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Barney Frank, the first openly gay member of Congress, has been in this fight for a long time. In 2007, he sponsored the End Discrimination Now Act, which would have ended workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation. He had enough Republican votes to pass it, but transgender activists excoriated him for not including gender identity as well. Frank added it to the bill, dooming it to failure; it would be another 13 years before both classes would win protection.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Certain disagreements within the movement are substantive, Frank conceded in an interview. \"A lot of gay people don't buy into this notion that there is no such thing as biological gender or support the insistence that male to female transgender people should be granted entry to women's-only spaces without clothing,\" Frank said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite recent polls showing waning support for gay marriage, Frank said he believes the real threat right now is toward transgender people. Most gay people, he said, support their basic rights, including official documents that reflect a person's gender identity and access to gender reassignment treatments for minors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But even what Frank refers to as \"basic rights\" are fiercely disputed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Every gay and lesbian person interviewed agreed that transgender people should be free from discrimination and harassment in housing and employment, as decided by the Supreme Court in the 2020 case, Bostock v. Clayton County, which extended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to sexual orientation and gender identity. But when it comes to altering the sex indicated on a birth certificate or passport, which 66% of Americans oppose, many raised objections.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You can't undo the fact of how you were born or that you're male or female,\" said Arianne Geringer, 36, an investor in San Francisco and secretary for the LGB Alliance USA, a volunteer organization founded in 2020. \"It would be much harder to enforce single-sex spaces for women if you have no documentation to back it up,\" Geringer said. One viable alternative to changing a person's birth sex on official documents, she suggested, would be an additional gender-identity category.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For transgender people, it's not necessarily so simple. Brianna Wu, a 48-year-old Democratic operative, says the Trump administration's efforts to eliminate gender identity on passports would be a nightmare for people like her who have undergone gender reassignment surgery. \"The deal was that if I did that, I got to be legally female,\" she said. \"Trump rolling that back has been a horrific attack on not just my civil rights, but also my dignity.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For many gay people, the LGBTQ+ movement's overwhelming support for pediatric gender transition is their biggest point of difference. They consider this a kind of conversion therapy akin to conservative efforts to \"treat\" gay youth by suppressing their sexual desires and becoming straight. (Research shows the majority of kids seeking gender transition report same-sex attraction.) In state houses from Georgia to California, some of the most vocal opponents to what proponents call gender-affirming care for minors are gay and lesbian adults. They fear that America is inadvertently following the homophobic biases of countries like Iran, where homosexuality is illegal and gay people are forced to choose between prison or gender transition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Out of the closet</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nevline Nnaji, a 35-year-old artist who blogs about race, gender and creativity under the name N3VLNN, has lost friends and relationships as a result of her outspoken rejection of gender ideology and her insistence on lesbian and sex-based rights. She also resents some LGBTQ+ advocates' comparisons of transgender oppression to racial oppression, which she sees as illogical.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I have walked through fire and I continue to walk through fire in my personal life with friends saying, 'I can't hang out with you anymore because you said XYZ' or that they're afraid to be seen in my presence,\" Nnaji told me.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2023, she lost the Instagram account she used as her professional platform after expressing support for black lesbian detransitioners, formerly trans people who revert to their birth-sex identity. Nnaji repeatedly tried to have her account restored to no avail. A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment but pointed out that Meta's hate-speech policy has since evolved. In January, the company lifted previous restrictions on topics that are \"part of mainstream discourse.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For LGB dissenters, many of whom grew up closeted and relied on acceptance among their peers, being excoriated by their gay and lesbian communities is particularly painful. It runs against the outspoken activism that is often core to their identity. Many compared the way their own community treats them to being put back in the closet again.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Two prominent organizations that advocate for trans rights, Lambda Legal and the Trevor Project, did not respond to requests for interviews. Several gay people interviewed expressed hope that despite — or perhaps in response to — government headwinds, institutional intransigence and political polarization, speaking out may be getting easier. Recent data also suggests that after a decade of dramatic increases, fewer young people are identifying as trans or nonbinary.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earlier this month, a widely circulated post on the Gender Crossroads Substack, \"A Plea to My Fellow Trans People,\" declared the \"honeymoon phase for trans acceptance\" to be over. It read in part, \"Part of me can't help feeling that we as a community have brought some of this on ourselves, by refusing to talk with people who hold different beliefs from our own (the 'no debate' policy so common among trans activist circles), and by insisting that anyone who might have questions about the recent proliferation of gender identities is a transphobe.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"To say this one narrative is the true narrative and anybody that says anything else is a bigot is not a very helpful strategy,\" the post's author, Stefan, a 46-year-old trans man who transitioned in his 20s, said in an interview. \"It doesn't really show much empathy for other people.\"</span></p></span></div></div>",
