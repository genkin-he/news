The investment bank's analysts tell clients in a note that Coles' 4.6% comparable sales growth over its fiscal first quarter was indicative of further market-share gains. Growth was two or three times the pace at which Woolworths grew sales over the same period, they observe. The analysts say that Coles' stores appear to be benefiting from the company's investment in fulfillment centers. They will be keen for industry feedback through the key Christmas trading period. Macquarie lifts its target price by 2.8% to A$26.10 and maintains an outperform rating. Shares are down 1.0% at A$21.89. (stuart.condie@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
