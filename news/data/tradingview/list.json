CIBC Capital Markets economist Andrew Grantham says 4Q weakness was driven mostly by businesses drawing down on inventories. Grantham says household spending rebounded, exports recovered and business investment eked out a small increase. He adds GDP in December advanced 0.2% from the prior month, which means there's some momentum heading into 1Q of 2026. The positive composition of Q4 GDP, despite the headline drop, and solid December reading should comfort Bank of Canada policymakers about their on-hold stance, Grantham says.
