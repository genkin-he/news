            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Andrew Bary</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire Hathaway's operating profits after taxes fell 30% in the fourth quarter to $10.2 billion, depressed by a drop of more than 50% in insurance underwriting profits and lower insurance investment income.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company bought back none of its own stock in the period, continuing a trend that began in May 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire's cash and equivalents stood at $373 billion at the end of 2025, down from a peak of $381 billion at the end of September.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusting for the timing of some Treasury bill purchases at the end of the third quarter, Berkshire's cash levels were higher at year-end than on Sept. 30.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire took a non-cash writedown of its equity stake in Kraft Heinz of $4.5 billion in the fourth quarter, capping a total of $8.3 billion of writedowns on that equity stake during 2025. Berkshire was carrying the 27% stake in Kraft Heinz at $8.6 billion at year-end 2025. That's close to the current market value of around $8 billion. The writedowns reflected the weakness in Kraft stock during 2025, when it fell about 20%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire filed earlier this year to potentially sell some or all of that Kraft interest, but has not made any sales yet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire's operating earnings after taxes per share fell 30% to about $7,093 per class A share in the fourth quarter relative to the year-earlier period. That fell well short of the FactSet consensus of $8,400 per A share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The lack of stock buybacks in the fourth quarter is a mild disappointment to Berkshire investors, but not a surprise. Analysts hadn't expected the company to repurchase shares during Warren Buffett's final three months as CEO. He was succeeded at the start of 2026 by Greg Abel, while Buffett remains chairman.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire also wasn't a buyer of its stock during January, Barron's calculates, based on the share count on Jan. 31 disclosed in Berkshire's 10-K report released Saturday. There were about 1.438 million shares of class A equivalent shares outstanding at year-end with class B shares converted to an equivalent amount of class A stock. Only about 35% of Berkshire's stock is now in the original class A shares.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The lack of stock buybacks indicates that the company doesn't view the stock as cheaply valued; Berkshire will repurchase its shares when it views them trading as a discount to the stock's intrinsic value \"conservatively determined,\" Abel said in his shareholder letter released Saturday morning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire's book value rose about 3% during the fourth quarter to about $499,000 per class A share, Barron's calculates. Berkshire stock now trades for about 1.5 times year-end 2025 book value, in line with its average price/book ratio in the past few years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire's total after-tax earnings in the fourth quarter were down about 2% to $19.2 billion. That figure reflects both operating income of Berkshire's businesses, and investment gains, mostly unrealized.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire chairman Buffett tells investors to focus on the operating profits, due to variability of investment gains from quarter to quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The drop in Berkshire's fourth-quarter operating profits is somewhat overstated, because the company includes in operating earnings non-cash currency swings mostly related to the company's yen-denominated debt that funds its equity ownership of five Japanese trading companies. Adjust for the currency swings, and the drop in earnings was about 28%. There were about $600 million of currency gains in the fourth quarter against $1.2 billion in the year-earlier period. Berkshire generates those non-cash gains when the dollar rises relative to the Japanese yen.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What Berkshire calls other income, which includes the currency swings, was down to $159 million in the fourth quarter from $1.8 billion in the prior period. Strip out the other incom, and operating profits after taxes would have been down about 20% year over year, Barron's calculates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Insurance underwriting results fell 54% to $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Insurance investment income was down 25% to $3.1 billion in the period. The decline in insurance investment income overstates the drop in Berkshire's total investment income, because the company has shifted a significant chunk of investments to the parent company from the insurance units.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The parent company had about $127 billion of cash and equivalents at year-end 2025, up from around $96 billion a year earlier. Having cash at the parent company gives Berkshire more financial flexibility, since insurance regulators can limit cash that can be upstreamed from insurance units.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire's parent-company investment income roughly doubled in the fourth quarter to $927 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire held a total of $321 billion of Treasury bills at year-end 2025, making it one of the largest holders in the world.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earnings at the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad rose 7% to more than $1.3 billion in the period, while profits after taxes at Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the company's big utility unit, were down 5% in the fourth quarter to $691 million. Profits rose 3% to $3.4 billion at the company's diversified manufacturing service and retailing segment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Insurance float stood at $176 billion at year-end, up $5 billion during 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire was a net seller of stocks for the third straight year in 2025, as Buffett and his investment managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs (Combs left Berkshire in December) found few major opportunities. The company was a net seller in the fourth quarter of about $3.5 billion of equities, selling $7 billion and buying $3.5 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the year, Berkshire was a net seller of about $14 billion of stocks in 2025, $134 billion in 2024 (when it unloaded much of its Apple equity stake) and $24 billion in 2023, Barron's calculates based on data in the 10-K released Saturday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire's equity portfolio stood at about $298 billion at year-end, and more than $315 billion when including the company's equity interests in Kraft Heinz and Occidental Petroleum.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire's class A shares finished Friday at $757,000 and the class B stock at $504.95. The A shares are up 0.3% so far in 2026, slightly behind the S&amp;P 500 index's total return of about 0.6%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "title": "The Closest Thing to a Time Machine: My Top 3 Reasons I Love Earnings",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>I was ten years old the first time I saw Back to the Future in a movie theater.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It was the summer of 1985. I remember sitting in that red fabric seat, feet barely flat on the floor, popcorn and Coke balanced carefully in my lap – no cup holders back then. The lights dimmed, the projector hummed, and for the next two hours I was somewhere else entirely.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There’s a lot to like: the iconic car and soundtrack, the fantastic performances and sharp humor. But the thing that burned into my brain wasn’t the car or the jokes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It was the clock tower. What a great scene…</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The storm is rolling in. The cable is stretched across the street. Doc is shouting at Marty that lightning would strike at exactly 10:04 p.m. Not maybe. Not possibly. Exactly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a kid, that idea felt – well, electric. Lightning — something wild and uncontrollable — suddenly had a schedule. A time. A place. All you had to do was be standing in the right spot with the right mechanism, and you could harness it to change the course of your history.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I didn’t know it then, but that scene lodged itself somewhere deep.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Years passed. School, college, careers. The movie became a cultural touchstone for a generation. But the idea stayed with me — the idea that chaos isn’t always chaos. Sometimes it’s structured. Sometimes it’s scheduled.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fast forward to my early days as a trader.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Instead of a movie screen, I was staring at price charts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Markets are loud. There’s always a headline, always a hot take, always someone shouting about the next big thing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You turn your screen on and a stock is up 18% on some headline you didn’t see coming. Another one gaps down 12% overnight. By the time you read the news and understand what happened, the move is over and it feels like the ship has already sailed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It can feel random. It can feel unfair. It can feel like everyone else knew something you didn’t.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But then I realized something that took me back to that theater in 1985…</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Not all volatility is random.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some of it is scheduled.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some of it comes with a timestamp.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And if you know when and where the lightning is going to strike — if you build the right mechanism in advance — you don’t need to control the storm.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You just need to be ready for it…</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Very early in my career I developed a deep love and appreciation for the simple earnings trade.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They represent one of the rare moments in the market where uncertainty becomes structured. Sitting at the intersection of expectation, volatility, and psychology, they channel forces that drive price movement more than any headline ever could.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And just like that clock tower scene – when you approach it correctly, it transforms what feels like chaos into potentially life-changing opportunities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So today I’m going to share with you the three biggest reasons earnings setups are some of my favorite trades a person can take.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>No. 1 – We Know When Volatility Will Hit</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you’ve made it this far, then you’ve probably already figured out that I love earnings trades because they answer two of the toughest questions a trader can face: “Where” and “when.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most market volatility feels random. A Fed comment hits the tape. A geopolitical headline breaks. A CEO says something off-script on television. You’re reacting after the fact.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With earnings we’re a lot like Doc and Marty – we know exactly where and when that lightning-fast volatility is set to hit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So now that we have the earnings date, we know the right time and the right place. What we still need is the right mechanism.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>No. 2 – High Probability Trade Setups</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the movie, knowing where the lightning will strike isn’t enough. They have to capture it and direct it into the flux capacitor. So they build a wiring rig — a cable system designed to channel 1.21 gigawatts of raw energy into the back of the DeLorean.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In earnings trades, that wiring rig is the trade structure itself — specifically, straddles and strangles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When traders think about earnings, most of them immediately start debating direction. “They’re going to beat. Guidance will be strong. Buy calls!” “This one looks weak. Buy puts!”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The problem is that the market is already debating those things, too. Expectations are baked into the price before the company ever reports. A “beat” doesn’t guarantee a rally. A “miss” doesn’t guarantee a drop. What matters is how reality compares to what was already priced in.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Early on, I realized that trying to outguess Wall Street on direction wasn’t a consistent edge. What was more interesting was how options were priced relative to the stock’s historical post-earnings moves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That’s where straddles and strangles come in.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A straddle involves buying a call and a put at the same strike price and expiration. You’re positioned for a significant move either up or down, because one side gains value as the stock moves sharply away from that strike.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A strangle is similar, but the call and put are purchased at different strike prices — typically out of the money. This structure usually costs less upfront than a straddle, but still benefits if the stock makes a large enough move in either direction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In both cases, the goal isn’t to predict where the stock goes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It’s to position for how far it moves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Instead of betting on up or down, we structure trades that benefit from movement itself. If history shows a stock regularly moves 8%, 10%, sometimes 15% after earnings, but the options market is pricing in a much smaller move, that’s a pricing discrepancy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now we’re not asking, “Will they beat?”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We’re asking, “Is this move underpriced?”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That shift changes everything. It removes the emotional tug-of-war of being right or wrong on direction and replaces it with a probabilistic framework focused on volatility — the kind of preparation that turns our lightning strike into something useful.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>No. 3 – Repeatable Process</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>My third and final reason I love earnings trades is that they’re not a one-off opportunity. This isn’t about catching a single lucky move.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earnings season starts all over again each quarter. Four times a year, the entire cycle repeats itself. Expectations build. Companies report. Volatility expands.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It’s the next best thing to having a time machine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And because we have a battle-tested approach we’ve spent the past two years putting together some of the best trades of my career.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We can scan for names with a history of large post-earnings moves, compare implied volatility to those historical moves, and structure defined-risk trades that align with that data. And we can size them in a way that assumes some losses are part of the distribution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then we do it again next quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This isn’t about hitting a grand slam every time. It’s about operating with a framework that gives us a statistical edge over a series of trades.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That’s how professionals think. They don’t rely on one outcome. They rely on process.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That’s the Power of Earnings</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When probabilities move, but price and volatility haven’t caught up yet, that gap becomes actionable. That’s where opportunity lives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earnings season is where this strategy really shines. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So far this quarter, my closed trades are running at a 60% win rate, with an average return of 85.76% over roughly 31 days. And just last week, we closed out a 300% win on our Fastly (FSLY) earnings strangle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That’s when expectations collide with reality. When analyst forecasts meet hard numbers. When hype either gets validated — or breaks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And when expectations are even slightly misaligned, stocks can move violently.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So far this season, we’ve already captured multiple double- and triple-digit percentage gains by focusing on one thing: Real money flow, not headlines.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We look for moments when institutional positioning and probability signals start to diverge from consensus expectations. Then we structure trades around that gap.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I’ve already used these signals to identify rapid moves in stocks like:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>SunRun (151% in 2 days)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>BHP (189% in 17 days)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Alphatec Holdings (213% in 2 weeks)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Fastly (300%+ in just over a month)</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Snap (375%+ combined in about 2 months)</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>That’s the repeatable edge we exploit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And right now, another setup is forming at the intersection of prediction-market probability shifts and under-the-radar earnings catalysts. In a new presentation, I’m walking through three high-conviction opportunities developing in sectors most investors aren’t paying attention toyet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the market has ever felt random to you, this will show you that it doesn’t have to be.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Watch the presentation and see how we position ourselves when we know exactly where — and when — the lightning is going to strike.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Remember, the creative trader wins.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>More from InvestorPlace</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/smartmoney/2026/02/invest-smart-market-loses-mind/?utm_source=tradingview&amp;utm_medium=editorial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">How to Invest Smartly When the Market Loses Its Mind</a></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/smartmoney/2026/02/markets-move-on-belief-not-facts/?utm_source=tradingview&amp;utm_medium=editorial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Markets Move on Belief – Not Facts</a></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/smartmoney/2026/02/biggest-tech-winners-rarely-look-obvious/?utm_source=tradingview&amp;utm_medium=editorial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Why the Biggest Tech Winners Rarely Look Obvious at First</a></li></ul></span></div></div>",

The most advanced clinical program, bezuclastinib, is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is designed to potently inhibit the KIT D816V mutation as well as other mutations in KIT exon 17. KIT D816V is responsible for driving systemic mastocytosis, a serious disease caused by unchecked proliferation of mast cells. Exon 17 mutations are also found in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), a type of cancer with strong dependence on oncogenic KIT signaling. The company also has an ongoing Phase 1 study of its novel internally discovered FGFR2/3 inhibitor. In addition, the Cogent Research Team is developing a portfolio of novel targeted therapies to help patients fighting serious, genetically driven diseases targeting mutations in ErbB2, PI3Kα, KRAS and JAK2.

Instead, the letter is authored by Berkshire's new CEO, 63-year-old Greg Abel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This year's letter comes in at 18 pages, significantly longer than Buffett's letters, which tended to run 10-15 pages. In it, Abel lays out what he considers to be Berkshire's company culture and he walks shareholders through its operating businesses. The comprehensive nature of the report might reflect Abel's desire to show investors he is fully knowledgeable of Berkshire's ins and outs — and that he has a firm grip on his remit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I am actually pretty impressed,\" says Macrae Sykes, a longtime Berkshire watcher and portfolio manager at Gabelli Financial Services Opportunities ETF (GABF). \"I give him a gold medal for laying out the technical aspects of the company. The letter is very comprehensive, his knowledge is incredible which is not a surprise, but still impressive to see.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For decades, Buffett, 95, wrote what became a much-anticipated and much-pored over communication, highly-valued both for its analysis of Berkshire, markets, and sometimes even humanity, as well as its folksy wisdom. Though Buffett remains company chairman, he stepped down as CEO on Jan. 1. In a November news release, Buffett noted that he \"will no longer be writing Berkshire's annual report.\" (A February communication confirmed \"the annual report will include Greg Abel's first annual letter to shareholders.\") And so what was long \"the chairman's letter\" at Berkshire has been replaced, for the time being at least, by the CEO's letter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Expectations have been high amongst Berkshire watchers over this year's letter, with two broad and obvious questions front and center: Exactly which company and business issues will Abel address in his first letter, and how is the tone, style, and even length of the letter different from Buffett's?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>First question first. What did Abel focus on? He begins the letter not surprisingly with a tribute to Buffett, writing that Buffett \"is arguably the greatest investor of all time, with generations benefiting from his investment acumen. He has also been a remarkable CEO... (To Warren's great frustration, this letter begins with these observations — yet we all know they are true.)\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the company culture section, Abel cites a letter he sent to employees \"emphasiz[ing] that Berkshire's culture and values remain unchanged and will continue into perpetuity.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here, Abel also points to the company's decentralized model, its integrity, financial strength, and capital discipline. In the latter section, Abel says the company may make share repurchases — but would not be paying a dividend at this time, which some investors had anticipated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sykes notes, though, that Abel says this is subject to board review. \"That leaves the door open,\" Sykes says. In the letter, Abel also speaks to the company's risk management, and name-checks that unit's top executive, Ajit Jain, 74. He makes no mention of Jain retiring, which some investors wondered about, but says Jain would be on stage with the CEO at the company's annual meeting in Omaha in May.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Next Abel speaks to Berkshire's performance, walking investors through the health of the company's operating business units. As for its investment portfolio, where investors might be seeking clarity as to who is directly overseeing it going forward, Abel writes that \"equity investments are fundamental to our capital allocation activities; responsibility ultimately resides with me as CEO. Ted Weschler manages about 6% of our investments, including a portion of the portfolio formerly overseen by Todd Combs. Ted's impact extends beyond these investments, as he continues to play a broader role in assessing significant opportunities, providing valuable input on our businesses, and supporting Berkshire in various other ways.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As part of the letter, Abel also welcomes new CFO Chuck Chang, succeeding Marc Hamburg, and Mike O'Sullivan as Berkshire's first general counsel. The letter closes with Abel describing the upcoming annual meeting, stressing continuity with previous ones.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The letter's last line — \"We move forward with great intent and purpose\" — resonated with Sykes. \"I love how he concluded,\" Sykes says. \"It's a wonderful way to end the letter, and gives you lots of confidence.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There were items that Abel does not address. The letter does not speak directly to any plans he might have concerning Berkshire's massive cash trove of $373 billion as of 2025 year-end, more than any other American company's. Nor does he say will buy stock Berkshire stock for himself, as his ownership of company stock is tiny compared to Buffett's $150 billion stake in the company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stylistically, Abel's letter differs from Buffett's in ways one might expect. It contains fewer of the homilies or folksy tales for which Buffett was famous. (Not even any metaphors about ice hockey, a sport with which the Canadian-native Abel is enamored.) Nor are there any stories about Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger, who passed away in late 2023.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another changed facet is that veteran business journalist, Carol Loomis, is no longer editing Berkshire's letter to shareholders, as she did for Buffett beginning in 1977. Loomis, 96, and Buffett, who still play bridge together online, would go back and forth for weeks as part of the editing process before the letter came out. Those days are no more, though, and as Buffett no longer writes the letter, Loomis no longer edits it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Berkshire letter to shareholders is Greg Abel's baby now.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Andy Serwer at andy.serwer@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The uptick in oil prices combined with the Trump administration's aggressive approach to tariffs is putting upward pressure on inflation, complicating any Fed rate cut, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Over the past several months, the Fed has struggled to tamp down inflation amid pressure from the White House and the markets to cut rates.

The Fed's target for inflation is 2%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Any $10 increase in crude-oil prices is estimated to raise consumer-price inflation by 0.2% to 0.4% over the coming year, Anderson said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WTI crude-oil futures (CL00) (CLJ26) are up about 16% year to date, or $10 per barrel since the beginning of the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Just the growing risk of a conflict with Iran is already impacting energy markets and prices, adding to U.S. inflation pressures and creating major headwinds for further Fed rate cuts,\" Anderson said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A prolonged conflict might raise the possibility that the central bank's next move would be to raise interest rates, he added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You're really talking about problems for the Fed in terms of putting a lid on inflation,\" Bethune said. \"In this situation, the Fed can't lower rates.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Traders in derivate markets still expect two quarter-point rate cuts this year, with the first coming in June and the second in September.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both tariffs and oil prices are supply shocks, raising the costs of inputs into production of the economy, which are very hard for the Fed to cool.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Fed's interest-rate tool works more on the demand side of the economy, by either spurring companies and consumers to spend or nudging them to pull back.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Military action in Iran is likely, analysts say</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oil prices are expected to spike if there is any attack on Iran, with the only debate about how long the higher prices might last.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Analysts see a very high potential for some kind of military strike on Iran in the coming weeks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There has been a \"slow-motion effort\" to get U.S. military assets in the Middle East region since January, said Suzanne Maloney, director of the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. military action against Iran \"seems more likely than not,\" said Christopher Granville, managing director of TS Lombard, a macroeconomic forecasting consultancy firm based in London.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Granville said a military confrontation between the U.S. and Iran is unlikely to send the global economy into a full-blown oil crisis and stagflationary shock. Still, it's possible we'll face an \"oil squall\" similar to what happened after Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022, when oil prices surged over $100 a barrel and remained high for six months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That so-called squall was enough to fuel inflation in the U.S., with the core PCE price index rising at an annual pace of 5.6% in September 2022, the highest rate in almost 40 years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, many economists say it's hard to forecast the future in the Middle East and how any confrontation would impact oil prices.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Bitcoin’s higher-timeframe structure is in an interesting state, according to crypto analyst Crypto Patel, who is of the notion that the cryptocurrency has officially entered bearish territory after breaking a long-term support level at $107,000. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Technical analysis of price action on the weekly candlestick price chart shows Bitcoin is now in this bearish territory, with a projection of a deeper correction to as low as $35,000 in 2026. The outlook is based on Fibonacci retracement levels that could determine Bitcoin’s next price move.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Bearish Territory Kicked In After Breakdown Below $107,000</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The outlook of this technical analysis is based on the premise that Bitcoin entered into bearish territory after the price broke down below a major higher-timeframe ascending trendline around $107,000. This trendline, which is visible on the weekly chart shared by Crypto Patel, acted as dynamic support throughout much of the 2023 to 2025 rally. It connected a series of higher lows and helped sustain the broader bullish structure that ended with Bitcoin reaching a peak price of $126,080.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The chart shows the breakdown zone with a red circle, indicating where the price decisively lost that upward support. After the breach, Bitcoin entered into a changed momentum and began printing lower highs. According to Patel, that trendline was the line in the sand, and losing it was when Bitcoin officially entered bearish territory. The market now needs a healthy correction before the next leg up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Fibonacci Levels Point To $44,000 And $35,000</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bitcoin has been on a downward path since the beginning of the year, and the projection is that this will continue until it bottoms out around $35,000. This outlook is based on how much the Bitcoin price corrected in previous cycles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For instance, the 2018 bear market saw an approximately 84% decline from peak to trough. Similarly, the 2022 correction erased roughly 77% from its cycle high. In both instances, these deep retracements came before the next major rally. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Based on that historical perspective, a move below $50,000 from the current price level would not be unprecedented. Instead, it would fit within Bitcoin’s established cycle behavior.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The projected downside targets are derived from Fibonacci retracement levels drawn from the October 2025 all-time high. Two levels stand out clearly on the chart. The first level is the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement, which is currently around $44,000. The 0.5 Fibonacci retracement is a mid-cycle pullback level and has always attracted strong buying interest in previous corrections, making it a possible stabilization point if selling pressure slows down.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Should Bitcoin fail to find support near $44,000, then the next level is the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement around $35,000. The expectation is that Bitcoin will eventually bottom at $35,000 even if it fails to hold above $44,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $63,740, down by 6% in the past 24 hours.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Oil prices are likely to remain elevated as production and passage remain prone to attacks and disruptions. OPEC may be under pressure to raise production to try and offset.

The immediate reaction function is fairly predictable: safe-haven assets such as gold are likely to see an upside gap, while oil prices may also firm on supply-disruption concerns.

Initial oil market reactions will price in higher risk of various scenarios that may disrupt supply, from a more modest disruption to 2mmbbld of Iranian exports, to attacks on regional oil infrastructure, through to disruption of passage through the Strait of Hormuz in the most extreme scenario. This could add several dollars more to oil, poised for even higher price spikes is the conflict escalates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"A full prolonged closure of the Strait of Hormuz is unlikely.
