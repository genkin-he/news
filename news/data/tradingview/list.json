Hormel additionally logged higher transportation costs during F1Q, driven largely by adverse winter weather, Kuehneman notes.

Demand for compute extends well beyond Nvidia's current Blackwell generation to Hopper and Ampere, which are still highly utilized across hyperscaler and neocloud platforms, the analysts say. \"We are simply not seeing demand slowing down for compute for the foreseeable future,\" they say, as models continue to grow more intelligent each week.

The buyback replaces all unused authorizations, which Luria estimates was about $18 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. While Luria views the buyback as a positive testament to management's belief in long-term growth, he questions if this is the optimal use of capital.

That data is helping drive its AI product Agentforce, which is continuing to build incremental momentum, they say.

He notes that the company cut its full-year outlook for the second time in six months, even despite broadly positive sentiment around artificial-intelligence businesses. The company's 26% global layoffs also increases execution risks, including weaker pipeline creation, slower product introductions, and weaker morale driving attrition. \"The business is clearly in a major transition,\" Ikeda writes. \"And with total revenue set to decline by nearly 25% this year, we think execution needs to improve significantly for multiple quarters before investor sentiment begins to budge higher.\" (elias.schisgall@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1207 ET - UBS analysts expect Nvidia's revenue growth to start to re-accelerate in the second half of the year, providing a catalyst the stock needs, they say in a note.

Nvidia shares will also likely get a boost as growth at investor favorites - like memory, optical and semiconductor capital equipment companies - start to decelerate, they say. \"At the end of the day, it is hard to see how the stock continues to languish,\" the analysts say.

Discovery's streaming and studio businesses, Neuberger Berman's Sean Badcock says. Earlier this week, Warner's board said an improved bid from rival Paramount Skydance \"could reasonably be expected to lead\" to a proposal superior to Netflix's signed agreement. However, a further bid from the streaming giant is expected, Badcock says. Moreover, it isn't clear that Paramount will be able to return with a higher offer, Badcock adds. \"They seem to have passed the ability to pay, but they don't seem to have run out of willingness to pay.\" (josephmichael.stonor@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

French artificial-intelligence startup Mistral AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The stock was up about 6% at $202.98 in midday trading. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the agreement, Accenture will gain access to Mistral AI’s models for use across its consulting and technology services. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financial terms were not disclosed. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The companies said Accenture professionals will be able to use tools such as Mistral AI Studio, which allows users to test and refine models before deploying them at scale within business operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Accenture said the partnership will help it advise clients on how to integrate AI more deeply into workflows, automate repetitive tasks and accelerate project delivery. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The firm has increasingly positioned itself as a bridge between experimental AI tools and large-scale enterprise deployment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Mistral deal part of broader AI push</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Mistral AI deal is the latest in a series of partnerships Accenture has struck with leading AI developers. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earlier this week, the consultancy was named among a small group of companies partnering with OpenAI to gain early access to its Frontier agentic AI platform.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In December, Accenture also announced a three-year partnership with Anthropic to help businesses move from pilot projects to full AI deployment. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic said at the time that Accenture had become one of its three largest enterprise customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chief executive Julie Sweet has repeatedly described AI as a central growth engine for the firm, urging employees to rapidly build expertise in the technology. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Accenture has said it has already trained a significant portion of its roughly 780,000 employees in AI tools, while warning that those unable to adapt could face exit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>How does Mistral gain?</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>For Mistral AI, the partnership brings a high-profile client at a critical stage in its expansion. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Paris-based startup has been building a network of alliances as enterprises and governments seek alternatives to US-based AI model providers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to its website, Mistral AI’s models are already used by companies including IBM, Cisco Systems, SAP, Stellantis and ASML Holding.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last year, ASML led a funding round that injected more than $1.5 billion into Mistral AI for roughly an 11% stake, valuing the startup at close to $14 billion. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mistral AI has also secured partnerships with several European governments, as well as Singapore and Morocco.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Investor debate over AI impact</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Accenture’s shares have struggled in recent months as investors debate whether generative AI will reduce demand for consulting services by automating tasks traditionally performed by large teams. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company’s stock is down more than 21% so far this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, some analysts remain optimistic. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>UBS recently maintained a Buy rating on Accenture with a $320 price target, implying nearly 50% upside from current levels. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bank argues that generative AI is more likely to increase demand for transformation projects than replace Accenture’s role entirely.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>UBS estimates that generative AI could add 250 to 300 basis points to Accenture’s annual growth rate, supporting roughly 6% revenue growth through 2030. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It also points to the firm’s growing share of fixed-price contracts, now about 60% of revenue, which could help cushion margin pressure from AI-driven pricing changes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Valuation and outlook</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Valuation has become part of the bull case. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Accenture trades at around 14 times its two-year forward earnings, its lowest multiple in more than a decade and a discount to the S&amp;P 500. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Management has also guided to at least $9.3 billion in capital returns in fiscal 2026, representing more than 90% of projected free cash flow.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While questions remain over the pace of AI adoption and its impact on consulting economics, Accenture’s growing list of partnerships suggests the firm is determined to position itself at the centre of enterprise AI deployment rather than be sidelined by it.</span></p></span></div></div>",

We trust our grievance and the subsequent review will ensure that the State Bar's high standards are firmly upheld.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The State Bar of Texas has confirmed that the matter is under active investigation. GVA will cooperate fully with the involved authorities and will be forthcoming with relevant documentation until the review process has concluded.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About GVA Property Management</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>GVA is a commercial real estate operator and investor specializing in multifamily apartment communities across the Southeastern United States and Texas markets.
