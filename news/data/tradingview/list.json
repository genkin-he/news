In this spending round, Meta is building out infrastructure, which the company can use to build its advertising business as well as develop its AI goals, analyst Benjamin Black says. This creates a back-up plan if the AI strategy doesn't pay off. \"Some will argue that META has yet to scale any real tangible scaled new products from this growing investment cycle. We argue that the infrastructure is somewhat fungible and can be leveraged to scale the ad platform even faster in a worst case scenario,\" Black says.

The oil giant topped third-quarter profit forecasts despite softer crude prices, leaning on stronger trading and a timely boost from its new LNG project in Canada. Adjusted net income came in at $5.43 billionabout 10% lower than last year but comfortably ahead of estimateswhile net debt fell to $41.2 billion. CEO Wael Sawan's two-year push for leaner operations and cleaner balance sheets is starting to pay off, with the company keeping its $3.5 billion quarterly buyback intact. Shares have gained 16% in London this year, outpacing peers and closing some of the valuation gap with U.S. rivals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After a post-pandemic boom, the oil majors are tightening their belts again. Crude is down roughly 14% this year, and Shell's CFO Sinead Gorman said market fundamentals could tip toward oversupply by 2026. That's forced the industry to pull back on costs, trim investments, and in some cases scale down buybacks. Yet Shell's performance stood out, driven by what RBC's Biraj Borkhataria called strong operational indicators. The chemicals business remains the weak link, weighed by thin margins in both the U.S. and Europe, where high energy costs continue to squeeze producers. Shell is exploring options to divest some U.S. chemicals assets but cautioned that such moves will take time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sawan's approach is less about chasing size and more about discipline. While Exxon and Chevron bulked up with big acquisitions, Shell is taking a more selective route, watching for deals that fit its advantage. The strategy could be paying off: steadier cash flow, lower debt, and consistent returns are slowly turning Shell's results into what analysts have dubbed boringly strong. In a volatile energy world, that kind of predictability could be the company's most valuable asset.</span></p></span></div></div>",
