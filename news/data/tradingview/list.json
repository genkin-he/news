            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Suddenly, what's old is new again.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> There's a popular trade sweeping Wall Street that's offering an old world solution to the threat of AI disruption: \"HALO,\" or \"Heavy Assets, Low Obsolescence.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> What that means is that more investors are betting that companies with hefty real assets such as grids, pipelines and heavy machinery are the ones least likely to be replaced by artificial intelligence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> \"I've come up with a term for the types of stocks that have run away with the stock market's gains this year. They are the HALO part of the market,\" investor Josh Brown wrote for CNBC earlier this month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> \"They have risks, but not AI risks. In fact, in many cases, AI will probably enable them to become even more profitable than they are today,\" Brown continued. \"So they actually go up as the LLMs advance.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> That idea is central to why many real world sectors are outperforming this year, even as the overall market and especially tech stocks have floundered. The two top-performing sectors are energy and materials, which are surging more than 23% and 15%, respectively. The third best-performing sector, consumer staples, has rallied more than 14%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Compare that to the market cap weighted S&amp;P 500, which is just slightly higher year to date.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Or even more worryingly, tech stocks. Only two of the \"Magnificent Seven\" names are higher this year, failing to rally even off the back of Nvidia's earnings beat, as investors worry their massive capex spending may not be justified.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Software stocks are lost in a bloodbath amid fears that advances coming out of Anthropic around agentic AI will cripple an industry reliant on scalability and high fees. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) is down more than 22% this year, and more than 30% off its recent high.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> And financials and commercial real estate are two other areas that have been hurt.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> The term has been quickly adopted on other parts of the Street. A note from the Barclays' trading desk last week said \"HALO\" names have benefited from the \"violent\" move into the more defensive parts of the market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Goldman Sachs' Guillaume Jaisson said that markets have been rewarding HALO, saying a basket of its capital intensive names have outperformed capital light stocks by 35% since 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> A note from the sales desk at Bank of America said HALO is a way for investors to avoid near-term volatility by taking advantage of a secular rotation into old economy cyclicals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> To be sure, there are many who worry that the panic selling that has defined the market as of late has been indiscriminate. As an example, some expect software stocks could be nearing a bottom, with some even emerging as winners despite the cascade of advances out of Anthropic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> In fact, tech is now about as cheap as consumer staples, suggesting the growth names are not nearly as overvalued as investors feared.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> \"The test for investors going forward will be whether [HALO] remains the correct investment as the AI narrative once again evolves, especially as the capex hump of hyperscalers is passed,\" read a note last week from the Barclays' trading desk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Yet the HALO crowd have reason to believe the trade is sustainable. Outside of a desire to escape the market's next AI victim, many HALO stocks have room to run after years of underperformance, can benefit from easier monetary policy and fiscal stimulus, and could even realize improved margins from AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Here are some of the HALO beneficiaries that Bank of America's sales desk identified.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple is just one of two Mag Seven companies that has eked out a gain this year, with the other advancer being Nvidia. The iPhone maker underperformed its cohort last year, yet investors are hopeful that the tech giant's foray into AI tied to its devices will revive the stock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Chevron is another example. The oil and gas giant, which is up more than 20% this year, was recently upgraded to buy at Melius Research because of an expected pickup in exploration.</span></p></span></div></div>",

The strait is crucial because it allows cargo ships to pass the Persian Gulf,  the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, facilitating the production and flow of crude oil from the Middle East. The region is home to five of the world's top 10 biggest producers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"So far, there is no clarity on the magnitude of any energy disruptions, but there has been some disruption of shipping in the Strait of Hormuz,\" said Matt Gertken, chief geopolitical and U.S. political strategist at BCA Research. \"It is too soon to gauge the impact on the oil market, but the intensity of the military operation implies high odds of a major oil supply disruption\" of 5 million barrels per day or more, he told MarketWatch on Saturday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. and Israel strikes on Iran targeted its leadership and military assets, The Wall Street Journal reported. The move followed failed negotiations between the U.S. and Iran to reach a deal to limit Iran's nuclear program. Iran has responded with strikes across the Middle East.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read: Trump calls for regime change after U.S.-Israel attack on Iran. Markets should brace for more than June's brief military campaign.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Several news reports Saturday indicated that passage through the Strait of Hormuz has been curtailed. An official from the European Union's naval mission Aspides told Reuters that vessels have been receiving VHF transmission from Iran's Revolutionary Guards saying that no ship is allowed to pass the Strait of Hormuz. So far, there has not been any official closure announcement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'Iran understands that sealing Hormuz is the economic equivalent of pulling the fire alarm in a crowded theatre and locking the exits for Middle East oil exports.'Stephen Innes, SPI Asset Management</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran, however, \"understands that sealing Hormuz is the economic equivalent of pulling the fire alarm in a crowded theatre and locking the exits for Middle East oil exports,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. \"It would hit not only Western consumers but also China and regional buyers. It is a blunt instrument.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Developments in the region are sure to impact oil prices as soon as trading resumes late Sunday and into early Monday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oil prices will continue to rise on speculation that the war will expand and that infrastructure will be hit, said BCA Research's Gertken. U.S. global benchmark Brent crude (BRN00) could reach $90 per barrel without significant physical disruption, he said. That would be a more than 20% rise from Friday's settlement of $72.87 for the May contract (BRNK26).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If there is physical disruption, then it can rise above $100 per barrel - \"potentially well above\" that, said Gertken.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Strait of Hormuz: A staggering chokepoint</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Just how much oil could be involved when it comes to the Strait of Hormuz and to the broader region is staggering. Kpler provided a snapshot Saturday of oil and oil-product tankers in the Strait of Hormuz.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This map is a snapshot of the oil and oil-product tankers currently in and around the Strait Hormuz. Green tankers are loaded, while red ones are in \"ballast,\" or essentially empty.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Around 20% of the global petroleum liquids the world uses transits through the strait each day. Last year, just over 14.5 million barrels per day of crude and crude condensate exports passed through the strait, said Matt Smith, U.S. head analyst at Kpler.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From the archives: Strait of Hormuz, the world's biggest oil chokepoint, in focus as U.S.-Iran tensions flare</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Saudi Arabia accounted for around 5.5 million daily barrels, Iraq 3.25 million, UAE 1.97 million, Iran 1.59 million, Kuwait 1.55 million, and Qatar 0.72 million, said Smith. Over 90% of that oil typically heads to Asia, around 4% to Europe, 4% to the Americas and the rest to Africa, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Four countries - China, India, Japan and South Korea - account for nearly three-quarters of the crude barrels that pass through the Strait of Hormuz, so they would feel the most significant impact, said Smith.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Middle East is home to half of the world's top 10 oil producers - Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Iran and Kuwait, according to the International Energy Agency. In 2022, the region accounted for more than four in 10 barrels of global oil exports, it said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet the oil market's biggest risk isn't the Strait of Hormuz being closed, said Kpler's Smith. It's that \"Iran's retaliation leads to broader unrest in the region, putting supply at risk,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran alone produces 3.2 million daily barrels of crude oil, with around 2 million of that primarily exported to China for refining, according to OPIS, a unit of Dow Jones, the publisher of MarketWatch.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran's proven crude oil reserves are estimated at 208 billion barrels, according to OPIS.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There have been reports of explosions Iran's Kharg Island, a key export terminal roughly 15 miles off the coast of Iran, OPIS's Denton Cinquegrana and Tracy Cui wrote in a report Saturday. It is still too early to tell what kind of damage, if any, has been done to export infrastructure on Kharg Island, they said, but about 90% of Iran's exports go through it.

DBV Technologies is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies, which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies, including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT), the VIASKIN® Patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV Technologies is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of the VIASKIN® Peanut Patch in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon, France, with North American operations in Warren, NJ.

This shift suggests the start of an impulsive wave, signaling potential strong upside momentum. Traders should watch for confirmation above key levels as the path for the next leg up begins to take shape.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Wave 3 In Motion: Preparing For A Strong Upside Move</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Charting an expected path for Ethereum on the 4-hour timeframe, Elliott Waves Academy has revealed a significant opportunity to ride a new bullish wave. The price appears to be preparing for a powerful upward surge following a successful breach of its corrective price channel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The technical structure indicates that Ethereum is likely forming Wave 3 of (3), with current projections showing the asset reaching a minimum 161.8% extension. However, the internal momentum suggests the potential for the move to extend further, signaling that a major impulsive rally is now officially underway.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From a strategic standpoint, any temporary bearish corrections would be viewed as high-probability opportunities for long re-entries. These minor pullbacks serve to reset local indicators while the primary trend remains firmly higher. Traders are currently eyeing the $2,624.14 level as a primary target, with the possibility of a move toward the 261.8% extension if the positive momentum remains sustained.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To validate and maintain this bullish scenario, it is critical to see a confirmed breakout and sustained trading above the previous price channel. Staying above this structural boundary will reinforce the upward outlook and provide the necessary support for the next leg of the rally. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Ethereum Sweeps Range High: Buyers Step In</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to Lennaert Snyder, Ethereum recently reached its all-time high and liquidity, setting the stage for a notable bounce after testing the extremes of its current range. This move reflects a strong recovery following aggressive price action and shows that buyers are actively defending key levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For traders looking at local setups, caution is advised. Given the recent massive displacement, it’s best to wait for clearer directional signals before entering positions, ensuring trades align with confirmed momentum rather than chasing volatility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That said, the liquidity captured during this sweep opens up opportunities for hedge strategies. For example, a short position on the opposite side could help mitigate risk while waiting for the market to stabilize. Specific levels, such as the 50% wick fill around $2,110, may present interesting shorting opportunities after a bearish MSB forms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Additionally, similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum left a significant Fair Value Gap (FVG) during the aggressive leg higher, with the 50% level of this gap near ~$1,970. Should the price retest this FVG, it could provide a favorable setup for long entries following a reversal, highlighting potential areas for strategic accumulation.</span></p></span></div></div>",
