Launched in March 2019, it intends to revolutionize the video streaming landscape by addressing issues like centralization, inefficient infrastructure, and high costs that detriment both viewers and content creators. The initiative is endorsed by industry stalwarts, including Steve Chen, the co-founder of YouTube, and Justin Kan, the co-founder of Twitch.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Theta’s primary objective is to decentralize video streaming, edge computing, and data delivery. This decentralization seeks to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and create a more equitable ecosystem for all stakeholders in the industry. At its core, Theta runs on its native blockchain. It employs a two-token system: THETA and Theta Fuel (TFUEL). The decentralization process rewards viewers with a superior streaming experience, allows content creators to boost their revenues, and helps video platforms save on infrastructure costs while potentially increasing ad and subscription incomes. Users are incentivized to consume content and share resources, with rewards dispensed in TFUEL tokens. Additionally, Theta supports developers aiming to deploy decentralized applications (DApps) on its EVM-compatible Smart contract platform.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The THETA token is integral to the Theta network, carrying out various governance roles. Prominent enterprises such as Google, Binance, Sony Europe, Samsung, and others serve as Enterprise validators, supplemented by a vast Guardian network of community-operated nodes.
