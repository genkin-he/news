The company's net income rose by 28% to $128 million, translating to an earnings per share (EPS) increase of 30% to $1.92. Adjusted EPS, which excludes non-ordinary-course litigation costs, saw a 4% rise to $1.62.

Aptar Pharma's reported sales increased by 6%, driven by higher volumes in prescription drugs, injectables, and active material science solutions. However, consumer healthcare sales declined by 11% due to softer demand in nasal and cold products, especially in Europe.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aptar Beauty's reported sales increased by 8%, with a 4% benefit from currency changes and a 4% contribution from acquisitions. However, core sales remained flat. Aptar Closures saw a 1% increase in reported sales, but core sales decreased by 1% due to lower tooling sales and pass-throughs of lower resin pricing.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>During the third quarter, Aptar returned $70 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The company repurchased 286,000 shares for $40 million. Additionally, Aptar's Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.48 per share, payable on November 13, 2025.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Management's Perspective</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>Stephan B. Tanda, Aptar's President and CEO, commented, \"Aptar delivered solid third quarter results with strong product volume growth in Pharma and Closures. As we anticipated, we are seeing the steady ramp in sales in our injectables division, which grew 18% in the third quarter, indicating an expected strong finish to the year for elastomeric components. Our continued focus on innovation, operational excellence, and disciplined capital deployment positions us well to deliver sustainable value for our customers and shareholders, while expanding our third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin.\"</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Future Outlook</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>Looking ahead, Aptar expects its Pharma pipeline to remain strong, contributing 7% to 10% of revenue annually. The company anticipates continued growth in injectables, driven by accelerating demand for GLP-1, Annex-1, and biologics applications. However, Aptar expects lower revenue from emergency-use delivery systems in 2026 compared to 2025. The company currently projects adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2025 to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.28, based on an effective tax rate range of 19.5% to 21.5%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Original SEC Filing: </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896622/000089662225000031/atr-20251030.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">APTARGROUP, INC.
