            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Heather Gillers</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a 17% increase in quarterly earnings after its insurance business bounced back from a year ago.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire, whose businesses include insurer Geico and railroad BNSF Railway, posted a net income of $30.8 billion, or $21,413 per Class A share equivalent, in the third quarter. That compared with a net income of $26.3 billion, or $18,272 a share, in the year-earlier period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Operating profits from insurance underwriting more than doubled from a year earlier. A mild hurricane season in the U.S. during August and September helped reinsurance firms like Berkshire hold on to premiums. Berkshire's results have also benefited from a turnaround at its auto insurer, Geico.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire's cash including equivalents rose to a record $358 billion, after accounting for a payable for purchasing some short-term government debt, from $344 billion at the end of June. Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its own shares during the three months ending in September, marking the fifth-straight quarter in which it has passed on buying back any stock. The company was a net seller of stocks for a 12th straight quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire is nearing a monumental handoff. Buffett, 95 years old, will step down as CEO at the end of the year and hand the reins to Greg Abel, his handpicked successor. The company's shares have faded this year, underperforming the S&amp;P 500, as shareholders wrestled with what the transition to the Abel era would mean for Berkshire's businesses, its investment portfolio and its eye for acquisitions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In October, Berkshire agreed to pay $9.7 billion to buy Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical business, OxyChem. It was the company's biggest deal since acquiring insurance conglomerate Alleghany in 2022.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Operating earnings, which exclude some investment results, rose 34 % to $13.5 billion from $10.1 billion a year earlier. Results from the company's BNSF railway remained in line with last year despite tariff pressures on consumer goods and other products transported by rail. Income from the insurance business fell, a likely result of slightly lower short-term interest rates relative to last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Buffett has said that operating earnings are the better measure of the company's performance. Accounting rules require Berkshire to include unrealized gains and losses from its giant investment portfolio when it reports net income, meaning that short-term fluctuations in the stock market can cause big swings in quarterly income.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Heather Gillers at heather.gillers@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Robyn A. Friedman</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Q:  What's the most unusual request you've ever received from a client?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Karen Wilder, real-estate agent, Mott &amp; Chace Sotheby's International Realty, Charlestown, R.I.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In November 2023, I listed a three-bedroom, ranch-style home in Barrington. The owner was a dog lover who had an adorable 12-year-old, tan-and-white Shih Tzu mix named Cookie, and I ended up with the listing because I lived in that neighborhood, where I was known as \"the crazy dog lady\" due to my involvement with animal rescue and fostering dogs. A few years earlier, I had fostered a blind and deaf dachshund named Ruby, and I used to carry her around in a Moby Wrap, a baby carrier that wraps around your chest and allows you to swaddle the dog. I would wear Ruby wherever I went, including showing properties, so I got a reputation for being the agent who wears a dachshund strapped to her chest.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fast forward to this listing. While I had it, the owner had to go into the hospital, and she told me that Cookie would not be comfortable with strangers coming into the home while she wasn't there. She asked me to hold the dog whenever there were people in the house, but the idea of holding her for two hours at a time for each of the open houses seemed too difficult. So, I suggested the Moby Wrap instead, and I wore that dog through two open houses and at least half a dozen private showings. She was a very cute dog. She looked like a little Muppet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cookie seemed to enjoy the experience, fortunately, and I think she actually helped me sell the house, for over ask, to a family with two dogs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mike Fabbri, real-estate agent, The Agency, New York City</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the spring of 2023, I worked with a couple who wanted to purchase an apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, but they wanted their Pokemon-obsessed 6-year-old son to have a say. How? By playing Pokemon in each neighborhood before his parents would commit to a purchase. We spent an afternoon covering four neighborhoods as the child played the game and caught Pokémon characters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It turns out that Central Park West was a hot spot for Pokémon GO characters that day, and after we toured a two-bedroom co-op that was listed for about $2 million, the child ended up catching a Snorlax as soon as we stepped inside Central Park. A Snorlax is a blue-green character that looks like a bear and is apparently extremely rare to find because it spends the majority of its life asleep. The child was screaming and jumping up and down. He was so excited to find it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Although my clients looked at seven other apartments that day, no other area came close in terms of Pokémon action, so they knew that apartment was the one. They wrote up an offer that same day for the full asking price.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gerard Splendore, associate broker at Coldwell Banker Warburg, New York City</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I took a listing for a three-bedroom co-op in a landmarked Art Deco building in Brooklyn Heights in September 2022. It sold in April 2023 for just below the $1.795 million asking price, but before the closing I received a request from the sellers: They insisted that I pay $20,000 for them to lease a temporary residence until they could move into their home upstate, where there were tenants for another three months after our closing. While I have been generous in the past — paying for an air conditioner or to have a place cleaned, for example — $20,000 was almost the full commission.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The sellers were aware of the timing issue when they accepted the buyer's offer, but they didn't mention it until just before the closing. The buyers needed to get out of their place, so they couldn't delay moving in. The contract had firm dates, and you can't bring up issues like this after the fact.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I want to be on good terms with my buyers and sellers. I want people to say nice things about me, and I was worried they might kill the deal. Until you're handed a commission check at closing, you keep thinking you have to do whatever you can to keep the deal moving forward. So, I went to management for an objective third-party opinion, and the principals of my firm were equally flabbergasted. They drafted a succinct and clear email to the sellers saying we will help them find a rental to live in, but in no way are we responsible to pay their rent.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In my 25-year career, I've never had anybody ask for something like this. Luckily, the sellers ended up dropping their demand, they moved out on time and they left a very clean apartment. The deal closed, and the buyers moved in on time. I was very relieved that it ended so cleanly.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Edited from interviews by Robyn A.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jackie Snow</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Forget teaching robots to think like humans. A field called swarm robotics is taking inspiration from ants, bees and even slime molds — simple creatures that achieve remarkable feats through collective intelligence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unlike traditional robots that take orders from a central computer, swarm robots work like ant colonies. No single robot is in charge, but the swarm accomplishes complex tasks through simple interactions between neighbors. Each robot interacts only with those nearby, sometimes communicating with sounds or chemical signals in particles they release.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Researchers say this approach could excel where traditional robots fail, like situations where central control is impractical or impossible due to distance, scale or communication barriers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For instance, a swarm of drones might one day monitor vast areas to detect early-stage wildfires that current monitoring systems sometimes miss. Hundreds of drones could be continuously patrolling, able to detect fires within minutes of ignition. If some drones fail, others would continue monitoring.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A human operator might set parameters like where to search, but the drones would independently share information like which areas have been searched, adjust search patterns based on wind and other weather data from other drones in the swarm, and converge for more complete coverage of a particular area when one detects smoke.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In another potential application, a swarm of robots could make deliveries across wide areas more efficient by alerting each other to changing traffic conditions or redistributing packages among themselves if one breaks down.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Robot swarms could also manage agricultural operations in places without reliable internet service. And disaster-response teams see potential for swarms in hurricane and tsunami zones where communication infrastructure has been destroyed. At the microscopic scale, researchers are developing tiny robots that could work together to navigate the human body to deliver medication or clear blockages without surgery.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Teaming up</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Part of what has kept swarm robotics in research instead of real-world applications has been cost. But the economics of the field have shifted in recent years, according to Sabine Hauert, a professor of swarm engineering at the University of Bristol in England. Cheaper sensors, batteries and processors have made it possible for a much broader range of researchers to build and test robot swarms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In recent demonstrations, teams of tiny magnetic robots — each about the size of a grain of sand — cleared blockages in artificial blood vessels by forming chains to push through the obstructions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The robots navigate individually through blood vessels to reach a clog, guided by doctors or technicians using magnetic fields to steer them, says researcher J.J. Wie, a professor of organic and nano engineering at Hanyang University in South Korea. When they reach an obstruction, the robots coordinate with each other to team up and break through.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wie's group is developing versions of these robots that biodegrade after use, eliminating the need for surgical removal, and coatings that make the robots compatible with human tissue. And while robots the size of sand grains work for some applications, Wie says that they will need to be shrunk to nano scale to cross biological barriers, such as cell membranes, or bind to specific molecular targets, like surface proteins or receptors on cancer cells.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On their own</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other researchers are exploring what happens when swarms move beyond any human-designed coordination. The phenomenon is known as emergent intelligence — when simple machines, following only a few local cues, begin to organize and act as if they share a mind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In one experiment, a group of robots were programmed with just three abilities — move forward, emit sound and listen to neighbors — then placed in a space with various obstacles and given no further instruction. They spontaneously linked together to form chains that slithered through some obstacles and surrounded other objects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Each robot has minimal functionality,\" says Igor Aronson, an engineer at Pennsylvania State University who led the project. \"But together, they show behaviors that look intelligent.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The research draws inspiration from single-celled slime molds that self-organize when starving. While the molds use chemical signals to coordinate, Aronson and his collaborators chose acoustic communication instead, since sound waves travel faster than chemical signals, making the approach more practical for robotic applications.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The work suggests that sophisticated coordination might not require sophisticated machines. Intelligence, in this case, isn't coded in advance but emerges from the way simple parts interact. And as those parts grow slightly more capable — say, with improved sensors or processing power — the behavior could evolve too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If you add a little bit more complexity,\" Aronson says, \"you would expect even more intelligence to emerge.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jackie Snow is a writer in Los Angeles.

It's called \"coherence.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unfortunately, such alignment is rare in the real world.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Too often, the organization's strategy gets diluted by internal politics, pressure to produce good quarterly results or a fear of saying no. A hospital, for instance, will hire a new tech vendor whose product conflicts with the hospital's model of patient-centered care. Or a business school gives the green light to a donor's idea that doesn't fit the school's mission. Everyone sees the drift, but no one stops it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I believe, though, that a solution to this coherence gap is in sight — thanks to AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Call it a \"coherence prompt.\" Trained on an organization's purpose and strategy, this AI tool wouldn't make decisions for leaders, but it would act as a kind of strategic conscience, flagging drift, pointing out disconnects and helping people think about their organization's strategy at every level. It would ask and help assess every project with four simple questions:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Does this project or investment fit the strategy we've committed to --   and the value we've promised to deliver?   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Does it build on the capabilities we've said we want to lead with?   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Are we focusing our time and investment where it matters most?   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Does this reflect our culture -- and what we've learned from experience? </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>These prompts aren't new. They're grounded in a body of published, peer-reviewed research and strategy work that's been tested across industries for decades. What's new is that — thanks to AI — we can now apply them consistently, dispassionately and at scale, right when decisions are being made.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Staying true to a strategy requires constant vigilance. A dispassionate prompt — one that reminds leaders of what they have agreed to — can make a real difference by highlighting disconnects and asking, \"Are you OK with that?\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And the best part? It's simple to implement. Large organizations already run on structured processes — investment committees, resource allocations, budget reviews. You don't need to reinvent the system. Just add the coherence prompt to the steps that already exist, and let it test the logic before decisions are locked in.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is how we used to support clients as consultants — by bringing an outside perspective to help ensure strategy and execution were in alignment. But we couldn't stay in the room forever. Now, organizations can build something better.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Leadership will always be human.

While the leading altcoin notably showed a significantly volatile price action, bearish sentiments reigned supreme, resulting in a net 4.37% loss. Interestingly, popular expert Ali Martinez has highlighted a critical price level for Solana investors’ attention amid the current market uncertainty. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>To Fly Or Crash? Solana Future Rests On Key Price Point </span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a recent X post, Martinez dives into the present Solana market structure, highlighting several potential developments tied to the $180 price level. Notably, the daily chart reveals that Solana has been strictly trading in an ascending channel since May 2025, with zero deviations recorded. Importantly, the altcoin has been moving near the lower boundary of this channel, currently around $180, which acts as a pivotal support. This price point also aligns with the 200-day simple moving average, thereby reinforcing its validity.</span></p><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:864.8878107944208px;aspect-ratio:1.441479684657368\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:fde2b621c094b-258dfc1271944df7dbbcdbdc2efe9062-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Solana\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:fde2b621c094b-258dfc1271944df7dbbcdbdc2efe9062-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f7f7f7\"/></picture></div></figure></span><p class=\"\"><span>Furthermore, on-chain data from the leading analytics platform Glassnode shows that 24.5 million SOL were purchased at this level, reflecting a high market demand that will likely prevent further price incursion upon a retest. Looking at Martinez’s analysis, a consistent price hold above $180 retains the validity of the ascending channel and presents a setup for a potential price gain to $230, with further price targets at $290. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, if an overwhelming bearish pressure pushes Solana below $180, investors can expect a further decline to around $115, while a potential crash to $50 is also feasible. Therefore, Solana’s behavior at $180 presents a possible 56% gain or 72% loss from current market prices. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Solana Market Overview </span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>At press time, Solana (SOL) is trading at $185, up 4.57% over the past 24 hours. Despite the daily rebound, its monthly performance remains negative, with a 14.27% decline highlighting the broader weakness seen in the last week. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a notable development, Bitwise launched the first-ever Solana Spot ETF on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) this week, marking a major milestone for altcoins. The achievement was quickly followed by Grayscale, which introduced its own Grayscale Solana Trust, further signaling growing institutional interest in Solana.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This week’s events represent a significant step toward broadening institutional access to Solana and other altcoins, paving the way for deeper market participation beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to SoSoValue data, the two newly launched ETFs have already attracted strong demand, recording $154.73 million in net inflows and $439.97 million in net assets within the first three trading days. Meanwhile, several other Solana-linked ETFs are reportedly in the pipeline, including the Canary Solana ETF, VanEck Solana Trust, and CoinShares Solana ETF, all currently awaiting SEC approval.</span></p></span></div></div>",

However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned investors against assuming another rate reduction will follow in December, saying it's \"not a foregone conclusion\".</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a result, investors have scaled back expectations for a December rate cut, with fed-funds futures traders on Friday only pricing in a 69% chance of a rate reduction at the end of the year, down from 90% before the October policy meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See: Here's what a government shutdown means for markets - and your wallet</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Of course, investors can't ignore the political storm clouds gathering in Washington.

It culminates efforts New Mexico has made to expand access to free child care since the governor and state legislature created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department in 2019. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The launch comes as other Democratic-run states, cities and counties eye a step popular among working families. Connecticut recently passed a bill making child care free for those families earning under $100,000 per year and no more than 7% of income for those earning more. New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has proposed no-cost universal child care.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>BIG SAVINGS FOR FAMILIES</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Taos special education teacher Allyson O'Brien expects to save around $12,000 a year in child care bills for her son Otis, who is nearly 2-1/2. She and her husband Shawn O'Kelly, a truck driver, earn a fraction above New Mexico's previous income cap for free child care, which was about $129,000 per year for their family of four.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We'll be able to go on vacation, we won't have to decide what bills we're going to pay, like, are we going to do propane or the mortgage?\" O'Brien said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To achieve a fully universal system, New Mexico must create nearly 14,000 more child care slots and recruit 5,000 educators, according to its Democratic-run government. The state is establishing a $12.7 million low-interest loan fund to construct and expand child care facilities. It is also increasing reimbursement rates to providers that pay entry-level staff a minimum of $18 per hour, above the state's $12 hourly minimum wage, and offer full-time care.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alison McPartlon, director of the University of New Mexico-Taos Kids' Campus child care center, said her waiting list is so long some children do not get in before they start kindergarten. She said higher reimbursement rates will help her retain and recruit educators.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There will be more centers coming up,\" said McPartlon, describing the shift to universal child care as \"incredible.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ADDRESSING POVERTY</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham told reporters child care was \"the backbone of creating a system of support for families that allows them to work, to go to college, to do all the things they need to do to continue to lift New Mexico out of poverty.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nearly 18% of New Mexicans live below the poverty line, according to the U.S. Census, making it one of the poorest states. Slightly larger in area than the United Kingdom, with only 2.1 million people, New Mexico is paying for universal child care primarily through funds generated by its oil and gas sector, the second-biggest of any state.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Research shows quality child care lifts education outcomes, especially among low-income families, according to Philip Fisher, a professor of early childhood learning at Stanford University.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reading levels of New Mexican students fall far below the national average when children are first tested around age 8 or 9, according to studies by Neal Halfon, professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Los Angeles. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Annie E.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Mark A. Jamison</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About the author: Mark A. Jamison is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and the director and Gunter Professor of the Public Utility Research Center at the University of Florida's Warrington College of Business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI looks like a circular money machine. Microsoft owns a major stake in OpenAI, which in turn invests in AMD. Nvidia puts billions of dollars into OpenAI and holds equity in CoreWeave, one of Microsoft's cloud suppliers. The same dollars are simply bouncing between balance sheets, rather than creating new economic activity. Equity markets are soaring, paying little mind to this web of financing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So alarmists say. But the evidence suggests something different, a powerful technological transformation that remains grounded in fundamentals. There is little reason to panic about an AI bubble — at least not yet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A bubble requires euphoric overvaluation and a disconnect between price and performance. Today's AI boom shows neither. The market is concentrated in highly profitable incumbents with real earnings, strong cash flows, and global-scale innovation. There is plenty of excitement, but that is different from irrational exuberance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is true that AI-related companies, specifically those in the Magnificent Seven, account for roughly three-quarters of S&amp;P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth, and 90% of capital-spending growth since late 2022. No wonder more than half of fund managers surveyed by Bank of America called AI stocks a bubble and ranked an AI-driven equity bubble as the biggest risk facing markets. This seems doubly alarming given the financial links between these firms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet these links are more likely just signs of evolving corporate strategies and risk management. AI is still sorting out its business models. Partial equity stakes allow companies to share risks and profits as they figure out how to leverage layers of the AI stack — chips, data, software, or applications — to deliver the most value. Antitrust regulators likely would have blocked full mergers, so looser forms of vertical integration may be the only practical way for these firms to innovate across corporate boundaries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Global spending on AI is expected to top $375 billion this year. Spending on data centers alone could hit $3-4 trillion annually by 2030. Some see echoes of the late-1990s telecom and internet boom, when fiber-optic firms were valued by the number of cities they promised to serve, not the profits they actually earned.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI companies are different. Most AI-related capital spending is financed through free cash flow, not debt. The Mag 7 have strong balance sheets, post average returns on equity near 46%, and trade at roughly half the earnings multiples of dot-com era darlings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>James Pethokoukis, my colleague at AEI, has noted that today's valuations reflect solid profits, \"fortress-like balance sheets,\" and disciplined forecasts, not blind exuberance. The AI capital expenditure boom looks more like a race than a bubble — one fueled by genuine technological advances and intense global competition, particularly with China.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unlike the internet bubble, where clicks stood in for cash, AI is already producing measurable economic gains. Small businesses using AI see productivity gains approaching 40%. AI systems have long powered Amazon's logistics, Netflix's content suggestions, and Meta's advertising efficiency. Generative tools are cutting costs in design and coding. And large-language-model users are beginning to bypass traditional search engines entirely, creating new advertising markets for AI companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, investors and policymakers should keep an eye on a few pressure points. First, profitability. Some firms experimenting with AI are falling short. Many by now are familiar with the MIT study that found 95% of organizations report earning zero return on investment on their AI projects, largely from their failure to make meaningful change.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Power is another problem. Data centers are already straining U.S. electric grids. Their power needs are expected to triple by 2028. Yet some utilities hesitate to expand capacity without support of federal regulators, who are worried about impacts on rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Third, regulation: Europe is trying to stymie U.S. AI companies with a regime of fines, and China is a politically risky market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The real test for AI will be in how firms respond to disruption — whether by shrinking from it, as the MIT study found, or by embracing it, as Amazon and Goldman Sachs have done.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For now though, what we are witnessing doesn't look like a bubble. It looks, to me, more like the early stage of a decades-long technological supercycle. The challenge isn't unrealistic dreams, but too little electricity to power them and too much regulation that squelches them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's newsroom.
