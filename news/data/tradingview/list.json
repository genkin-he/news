The third quarter of 2024 included other revenue of $251.2 million which represents revenue from the Company's divestiture of the majority of its Grain &amp; Protein business as shown in the regional net sales table. Reported net income was $4.09 per share for the quarter and adjusted net income(1) was $1.35 per share. These results compare to reported net income of $0.40 per share and adjusted net income(1) of $0.68 per share for the third quarter of 2024.

At the same time, we have responded decisively with disciplined production cuts, aggressive cost management, and accelerated strategic restructuring initiatives.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hansotia continued, \"While political shifts and global trade tensions weighed on farmer sentiment especially in North America, AGCO's diversified global footprint and Farmer-First strategy helped mitigate regional disruptions.

While elevated government payments in North America are supporting farm income, crop margins remain constrained. These economic challenges have weakened demand for farm equipment in North America and Europe. Still, farmers continue to invest in precision technologies to boost productivity and profitability. In Brazil, sentiment is improving largely due to record soybean yields, though rising input costs, recent trade tensions, high interest rates and political uncertainty are dampening purchasing activity. In Europe, confidence varies by region, with Western farmers benefiting from favorable yields, while Southern and Eastern areas have been impacted by adverse weather. Dairy and livestock producers have benefited from strong prices and steady demand. While traditional equipment sales remain under pressure, we see a clear transition toward smarter, more efficient solutions as farmers seek to protect margins and manage ongoing volatility.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>North American industry retail tractor sales declined 10% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 with the steepest drops occurring in higher horsepower categories — particularly in recent months. Combine unit sales fell 29% year-over-year during the same period. Ongoing uncertainty around grain export demand and elevated input costs are expected to continue weighing on industry demand throughout 2025, especially for larger equipment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Brazil industry retail tractor sales rose 3% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, driven primarily by demand for smaller and mid-size tractors coupled with favorable trade dynamics. Despite record soybean harvests and potential trade benefits, demand for larger equipment has yet to show meaningful improvement. High financing costs and political uncertainty are expected to continue to constrain demand in 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Western Europe industry retail tractor sales declined 8% during the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 with double digit percentage decreases across most markets except Spain, which saw strong growth. Demand is expected to remain soft throughout the remainder of the year, as lower income levels weigh on arable farmers.

Softer industry sales and under-production of end-market demand contributed to lower sales. The most significant sales declines occurred in high-horsepower tractors, sprayers and combines. Income from operations for the third quarter of 2025 decreased $56.4 million compared to the same period in 2024 and operating margins remained negative. The decrease was primarily a result of lower sales and production volumes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>South America</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>South American net sales decreased 9.5% during the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024, excluding the impact of favorable currency translation. Weaker industry demand drove most of the decrease with lower sales across the majority of the product categories. Income from operations for the third quarter of 2025 decreased $22.6 million compared to the same period in 2024. This decrease was primarily a result of lower sales and production levels and the impact of modestly negative pricing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Europe/Middle East</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net sales in the Europe/Middle East region increased 20.3% during the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024, excluding the impact of favorable currency translation. This reflects a recovery in production levels and corresponding sales following extended plant downtime last year. Increases were largest in high-horsepower and mid-range tractors. Income from operations increased $163.1 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. This increase was primarily a result of significantly higher sales and production volumes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Asia/Pacific/Africa</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Asia/Pacific/Africa region net sales decreased 5.2%, excluding unfavorable currency translation impacts, during the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024 due to weaker end market demand and lower production volumes. Lower sales across most of the Asian markets were partially offset by higher sales in Australia and Africa. Income from operations increased $0.9 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by lower sales volume.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Outlook</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AGCO expects full-year 2025 net sales of approximately $9.8 billion. Adjusted operating margins are projected to be approximately 7.5%. Lower production volumes are expected to be partially offset by cost controls and stable engineering expenses. Based on these assumptions, full-year earnings per share are targeted at approximately $5.00. These estimates incorporate the expected impact of tariffs in effect as of October 31, 2025, along with AGCO's mitigation strategies. Any changes to tariff policies or related responses could affect these projections.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>* * * * *</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AGCO will host a conference call with respect to this earnings announcement at 10 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday, October 31.

The following are among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in or implied by the forward-looking statements.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Our financial results depend entirely upon the agricultural industry, and   factors that adversely affect the agricultural industry generally,   including declines in the general economy, adverse weather, tariffs,   increases in farm input costs, lower commodity prices, lower farm income   and changes in the availability of credit for our retail customers, will   adversely affect us.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>We maintain an independent dealer and distribution network in the markets   where we sell products. The financial and operational capabilities of our   dealers and distributors are critical to our ability to compete in these   markets. Higher inventory levels at our dealers and high utilization of   dealer credit limits as well as the financial health of our dealers could   negatively impact future sales and adversely impact our performance.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On April 1, 2024, we completed the acquisition of the ag assets and   technologies of Trimble through the formation of a joint venture, PTx   Trimble, of which we own 85%. Financing the PTx Trimble transaction   significantly increased our indebtedness and interest expense. We also   have made various assumptions relating to the acquisition that may not   prove to be correct, and we may fail to realize all of the anticipated   benefits of the acquisition. All acquisitions involve risk, and there is   no certainty that the acquired business will operate as expected. Each of   these items, as well as similar acquisition-related items, would   adversely impact our performance.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>A majority of our sales and manufacturing takes place outside the United   States, and many of our sales involve products that are manufactured in   one country and sold in a different country. As a result, we are exposed   to risks related to foreign laws, taxes and tariffs, trade restrictions,   economic conditions, labor supply and relations, political conditions and   governmental policies. The recent announcements of significant trade   policy and tariff actions by the U.S. government, including but not   limited to tariffs on imported steel and aluminum products, tariffs on   certain imports from China, tariffs on certain imports from Canada and   Mexico, announced trade deal between the United States and European Union   of baseline tariffs on certain imports from the European Union, and   baseline tariffs on most imports from most other countries, continue to   create significant uncertainty and potential risks for our business.   These announcements in some cases were followed by delays and changes in   implementation, and the ultimate tariff structures are unclear at the   current time. Depending on the countries affected, increases in tariffs   have raised the costs of inputs used in manufacturing our products, which   in turn has impacted our cost of goods sold. Additionally, higher tariffs   may lead to increased after-tariff sales prices for the products we sell.   The impacts of the tariffs may be partially mitigated as a majority of   our sales and manufacturing takes place outside the United States. While   we are actively exploring opportunities to mitigate these increased costs,   there can be no guarantee that we will be able to fully offset the impact   of these tariffs. Furthermore, the imposition of retaliatory tariffs from   other countries on our exported products could negatively affect our   sales and marketplace access in those countries. Moreover, the   uncertainty of the tariff changes and any future trade policy changes has   adversely impacted, and is expected to continue to adversely impact, our   sales.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>We cannot predict or control the impact of the conflict in Ukraine on our   business. Already it has resulted in reduced sales in Ukraine as farmers   have experienced economic distress, difficulties in harvesting and   delivering their products, as well as general uncertainty. There is a   potential for natural gas shortages, as well as shortages in other energy   sources, throughout Europe, which could negatively impact our production   in Europe both directly and through interrupting the supply of parts and   components that we use. It is unclear how long these conditions will   continue, or whether they will worsen, and what the ultimate impact on   our performance will be. In addition, AGCO sells products in, and   purchases parts and components from, other regions where there could be   hostilities. Any hostilities likely would adversely impact our   performance.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Most retail sales of the products that we manufacture are financed,   either by our joint ventures with Rabobank or by a bank or other private   lender. Our joint ventures with Rabobank, which are controlled by   Rabobank and are dependent upon Rabobank for financing as well, finance   approximately 50% of the retail sales of our tractors and combines in the   markets where the joint ventures operate. Any difficulty by Rabobank to   continue to provide that financing, or any business decision by Rabobank   as the controlling member not to fund the business or particular aspects   of it (for example, a particular country or region), would require the   joint ventures to find other sources of financing (which may be difficult   to obtain), or us to find another source of retail financing for our   customers, or our customers would be required to utilize other retail   financing providers. As a result of the recent economic downturn,   financing for capital equipment purchases generally has become more   difficult in certain regions and in some cases, can be expensive to   obtain. To the extent that financing is not available or available only   at unattractive prices, our sales would be negatively impacted. In   addition, Rabobank also is the lead lender in our revolving credit   facility and term loans and for many years has been an important   financing partner for us. Any interruption or other challenges in that   relationship would require us to obtain alternative financing, which   could be difficult.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Both AGCO and our finance joint ventures have substantial accounts   receivable from dealers and end customers, and we would be adversely   impacted if the collectability of these receivables was less than   optimal; this collectability is dependent upon the financial strength of   the farm industry, which in turn is dependent upon the general economy   and commodity prices, as well as several of the other factors listed in   this section.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>We have experienced substantial and sustained volatility with respect to   currency exchange rate and interest rate changes, which can adversely   affect our reported results of operations and the competitiveness of our   products.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Our success depends on the introduction of new products, particularly   engines that comply with emission requirements and sustainable smart   farming technology, which require substantial expenditures; there is no   certainty that we can develop the necessary technology or that the   technology that we develop will be attractive to farmers or available at   competitive prices.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Our expansion plans in emerging markets, including establishing a greater   manufacturing and marketing presence and growing our use of component   suppliers, could entail significant risks.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Our business increasingly is subject to regulations relating to privacy   and data protection, and if we violate any of those regulations, or   otherwise are the victim of a cyberattack, we could be subject to   significant claims, penalties and damages.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Cybersecurity breaches including ransomware attacks and other means are   rapidly increasing. We continue to review and improve our safeguards to   minimize our exposure to future attacks. However, there always will be   the potential of the risk that a cyberattack will be successful and will   disrupt our business, either through shutting down our operations,   destroying data, exfiltrating data or otherwise.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>We depend on suppliers for components, parts and raw materials for our   products, and any failure by our suppliers to provide products as needed,   or by us to promptly address supplier issues, will adversely impact our   ability to timely and efficiently manufacture and sell products. In   addition, the potential of future natural gas shortages in Europe, as   well as predicted overall shortages in other energy sources, could also   negatively impact our production and that of our supply chain in the   future. There can be no assurance that there will not be future   disruptions.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Any future pandemics could negatively impact our business through reduced   sales, facilities closures, higher absentee rates and reduced production   at both our plants and the plants that supply us with parts and   components. In addition, logistical and transportation-related issues and   similar problems may also arise.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>We recently have experienced significant inflation in a range of costs,   including for parts and components, shipping and energy. While we have   been able to pass along most of those costs through increased prices,   there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so. If   we are not, it will adversely impact our performance.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>We face significant competition, and if we are unable to compete   successfully against other agricultural equipment manufacturers, we would   lose customers and our net sales and performance would decline.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>We have a substantial amount of indebtedness (and have incurred   additional indebtedness as part of the PTx Trimble joint venture   transaction), and, as a result, we are subject to certain restrictive   covenants and payment obligations, as well as increased leverage   generally, that may adversely affect our ability to operate and expand   our business. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Further information concerning these and other factors is included in AGCO's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and subsequent Form 10-Qs.

RESTRUCTURING AND BUSINESS OPTIMIZATION EXPENSES</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On June 24, 2024, the Company announced a restructuring program (the \"Program\") in response to increased weakening demand in the agriculture industry. The Company estimates that it will incur charges for one-time termination benefits of approximately $150.0 million to $200.0 million in connection with the initial phase of the Program, primarily consisting of cash charges related to severance payments, employees benefits and related costs. The Company incurred the majority of the charges in 2024 and expects to incur the remaining charges in 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As of December 31, 2024, accrued severance and other related costs primarily associated with the Program were approximately $136.2 million.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company recognized approximately $4.5 million and $31.4 million, respectively, of business optimization expenses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>5.      SEGMENT REPORTING</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company has four operating segments which are also its reportable segments which consist of the North America, South America, Europe/Middle East and Asia/Pacific/Africa regions. The Company's reportable segments are geography based and distribute a full range of agricultural machinery and precision agriculture technology. The Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\"), Eric P. Hansotia, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, evaluates segment performance primarily based on income from operations. The CODM utilizes income from operations to evaluate each segment's performance including the allocation of resources. Sales for each segment are based on the location of the third-party customer. The Company's selling, general and administrative expenses and engineering expenses are generally charged to each segment based on the region and division where the expenses are incurred. As a result, the components of income (loss) from operations for one segment may not be comparable to another segment.

The portfolio comprises roughly 237,000 ha across multiple underexplored 100% owned and Cosa-operated joint venture projects in the Athabasca Basin region, the majority of which reside within or adjacent to established uranium corridors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In January of 2025, the Company entered a transformative strategic collaboration with Denison Mines that has secured Cosa access into several additional highly prospective eastern Athabasca uranium exploration projects. As Cosa’s largest shareholder, Denison gains exposure to Cosa’s potential for exploration success and its pipeline of uranium projects. Cosa’s award-winning management team has a track record of success in Saskatchewan. In 2022, members of the Cosa team were awarded the AME Colin Spence Award for the discovery of the Hurricane uranium deposit. Cosa personnel led teams or had integral roles in the discovery of Denison’s Gryphon deposit and 92 Energy's GMZ zone and held key roles in the founding of both NexGen and IsoEnergy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company’s focus throughout 2026 is drilling at the Darby and Murphy Lake North projects in the eastern Athabasca Basin. Both projects are operated by Cosa and are 70/30 joint ventures between Cosa and Denison respectively. Drilling at Darby is planned to test priority targets identified by thorough review of historical data and drill core and will target areas with anomalous uranium, clay alteration, and historical mineralization intersected nearby. Drilling at Murphy Lake North will follow up 2025 drilling which intersected broad zones of structurally controlled alteration over roughly 2 kilometres of strike length.</span></p></span></div></div>",

The company was founded in Lund in 2005, based on more than 30 years of research in clinical psychoacoustics at the Department of Neuroscience at Lund University. Initially, the focus was on patients with schizophrenia, as auditory hallucinations are a common symptom of the disease. However, today, the company offers a variety of other services within the product areas of screening, diagnostics, medication, and health. The products are used in both private and public healthcare and schools, as a screening and complement to other observations in ADHD, schizophrenia, and autism assessments, in measuring the effects of medication, and in hearing screening.
