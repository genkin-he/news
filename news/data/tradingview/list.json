Discovery after Netflix said it wouldn't match the David Ellison-led company's latest offer for the iconic Hollywood property.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix pulled the plug on its deal soon after the Warner board of directors said it determined Paramount's $31-per-share offer for the entire company was superior to Netflix's bid for Warner's movie and television studios and HBO Max streaming service. Paramount is now poised to take control of the entertainment company home to properties and brands including HBO, Superman and Harry Potter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We've always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match,\" Netflix Co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement. \"This transaction was always a 'nice to have' at the right price, not a 'must have' at any price,\" the pair said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pending regulatory approval, Paramount will own not only Warner Bros. and HBO, but also many popular cable networks including CNN, TNT, TBS and Food Network.

After multiple unsolicited bids from Paramount last year, Warner opened a sale process that ended with Netflix as the winning suitor. Netflix in December signed a deal to buy Warner's studios and HBO Max for $27.75 a share, or $72 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shortly after, Paramount launched a hostile takeover effort, going directly to shareholders with a $30-per-share bid for the whole company, including the cable networks Netflix didn't want.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When Ellison's Skydance Media acquired control of Paramount last August, going after Warner became his top priority. Paramount was seen as too small to compete against deep-pocketed giants such as Disney, Netflix and Amazon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Joe Flint at Joe.Flint@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The bank is encouraged by Supercheap Auto's positive momentum, with like-for-like sales accelerating to 5% in the key holiday period across November and December. That's a solid result in a highly promotional and competitive market, analyst Tom Kierath says. \"However, Rebel still seems a work in progress given supply chain challenges and stock loss issues which will take some time to resolve,\" he says of Super Retail's sports equipment and clothing brand.

All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate\", \"budget\", \"plan\", \"endeavor\", \"continue\", \"estimate\", \"evaluate\", \"expect\", \"forecast\", \"monitor\", \"may\", \"will\", \"can\", \"able\", \"potential\", \"target\", \"intend\", \"consider\", \"focus\", \"identify\", \"use\", \"utilize\", \"manage\", \"maintain\", \"remain\", \"result\", \"cultivate\", \"could\", \"should\", \"believe\" and similar expressions (including negatives and variations thereof). Lycos believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date hereof, but no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to be correct and such forward-looking statements should not be unduly relied upon. Without limitation, this press release contains forward-looking statements pertaining to Lycos' business strategy, objectives, strength and focus. Statements relating to production, reserves, recovery, replacement, costs and valuation are also deemed to be forward-looking statements, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and that the reserves can be profitably produced in the future. The forward-looking statements and information are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by Lycos, including expectations and assumptions concerning Lycos' ability to execute its plans and strategies. Although Lycos believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements and information are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements and information because Lycos can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. By its nature, such forward-looking information is subject to various risks and uncertainties, which could cause the actual results and expectations to differ materially from the anticipated results or expectations expressed.

A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet per barrel (6 Mcf/bbl) of natural gas to barrels of oil equivalence is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.

All reserves values, future net revenue and ancillary information contained in this press release are derived from the Reserves Report unless otherwise noted. All reserve references in this press release are \"Company gross reserves\". Company gross reserves are the Company's total working interest reserves before the deduction of any royalties payable by the Company. Estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same level of confidence as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties, due to the effect of aggregation. There is no assurance that the forecast price and cost assumptions applied by McDaniel in evaluating Lycos' reserves will be attained and variances could be material. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All evaluations and summaries of future net revenue are stated prior to the provision for interest, debt service charges or general and administrative expenses and after deduction of royalties, operating costs, estimated well abandonment and reclamation costs and estimated future capital expenditures. It should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented in the tables below represent the fair market value of the reserves. The recovery and reserve estimates of Lycos' crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves provided herein are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. Actual crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil, reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves. The reserve and associated cash flow information set forth herein are estimates only.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves. Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves. Proved developed producing reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate. These reserves may be currently producing or, if shut-in, they must have previously been on production, and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty. Undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure (e.g., when compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to render them capable of production. They must fully meet the requirements of the reserves category (proved, probable, possible) to which they are assigned.

But if you think the global AI story has a long runway - and Nvidia's latest bumper sales and outlook suggest it does - then this reallocation away from the U.S. makes strategic sense. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And it may make financial sense too.

The median forecast from a Wall Street Journal poll of nine economists is for a 25.6% on-year increase in shipments overseas, following a revised 33.8% rise in January. Imports likely rose 13.6% on year in February, resulting in a $10.10 billion trade surplus--wider than the prior month's revised $8.72 billion surplus, the poll shows. Early February trade data showed chip exports are on track for a monthly record. \"A semiconductor export boom is underway, with memory prices climbing faster than expected,\" Hana Securities' Chun Kyu-yeon says.
