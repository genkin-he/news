In this spending round, Meta is building out infrastructure, which the company can use to build its advertising business as well as develop its AI goals, analyst Benjamin Black says. This creates a back-up plan if the AI strategy doesn't pay off. \"Some will argue that META has yet to scale any real tangible scaled new products from this growing investment cycle. We argue that the infrastructure is somewhat fungible and can be leveraged to scale the ad platform even faster in a worst case scenario,\" Black says.

The oil giant topped third-quarter profit forecasts despite softer crude prices, leaning on stronger trading and a timely boost from its new LNG project in Canada. Adjusted net income came in at $5.43 billionabout 10% lower than last year but comfortably ahead of estimateswhile net debt fell to $41.2 billion. CEO Wael Sawan's two-year push for leaner operations and cleaner balance sheets is starting to pay off, with the company keeping its $3.5 billion quarterly buyback intact. Shares have gained 16% in London this year, outpacing peers and closing some of the valuation gap with U.S. rivals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After a post-pandemic boom, the oil majors are tightening their belts again. Crude is down roughly 14% this year, and Shell's CFO Sinead Gorman said market fundamentals could tip toward oversupply by 2026. That's forced the industry to pull back on costs, trim investments, and in some cases scale down buybacks. Yet Shell's performance stood out, driven by what RBC's Biraj Borkhataria called strong operational indicators. The chemicals business remains the weak link, weighed by thin margins in both the U.S. and Europe, where high energy costs continue to squeeze producers. Shell is exploring options to divest some U.S. chemicals assets but cautioned that such moves will take time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sawan's approach is less about chasing size and more about discipline. While Exxon and Chevron bulked up with big acquisitions, Shell is taking a more selective route, watching for deals that fit its advantage. The strategy could be paying off: steadier cash flow, lower debt, and consistent returns are slowly turning Shell's results into what analysts have dubbed boringly strong. In a volatile energy world, that kind of predictability could be the company's most valuable asset.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Excluding the impact from revenue recognized over time, quarterly revenue was USD 228.9 million, which is well above the guidance of USD 215-225 million.

Third quarter industrial revenue was USD 47.6 million*, up 51% year-on-year and 1% sequentially, reflecting the overall recovery of the industrial end market. The gradual recovery of X-FAB's silicon carbide (SiC) business contributed to this positive evolution. Medical revenue in the third quarter hit a record USD 21.2 million*, up 74% year-on-year and 40% quarter-on-quarter, highlighting the steady growth of X-FAB's medical business. Third quarter growth was mainly driven by contactless temperature sensors, DNA sequencing, and echography applications.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the third quarter, CMOS revenue recorded a growth of 10%* year-on-year and 4%* quarter-on-quarter; microsystems revenue was up 27%* year-on-year and 9%* sequentially. X-FAB's SiC business continued to recover, and revenue grew strongly by 30%* year-on-year and 21%* quarter-on-quarter. The number of SiC wafers produced in the third quarter more than doubled year-on-year. SiC revenue growth is partially diluted by the much higher share of SiC raw wafers being supplied by customers today as compared to a year ago. This results in lower total billing due to less pass-through of substrate costs. The positive trend in the evolution of X-FAB's SiC business is underpinned by increasing bookings attributable to sustained demand from data center, electric vehicle, and renewable energy applications.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Quarterly prototyping revenue was USD 19.7 million*, down 16% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Prototyping and production revenue* per quarter and end market:</span></p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><span> </span><br/><span> in millions </span><br/><span>  of USD         Revenue     Q3 2024  Q4 2024  Q1 2025  Q2 2025  Q3 2025 </span><br/><span> Automotive    Prototyping       9.3      8.9      4.7      5.1      5.5 </span><br/><span>-------------  ------------  -------  -------  -------  -------  ------- </span><br/><span>         Production            136.7    119.7    130.8    138.2    141.4 </span><br/><span> --------------------------  -------  -------  -------  -------  ------- </span><br/><span> Industrial    Prototyping       8.2      9.6      8.8     12.1      9.7 </span><br/><span>-------------  ------------  -------  -------  -------  -------  ------- </span><br/><span>         Production             23.3     26.5     30.5     35.2     37.9 </span><br/><span> --------------------------  -------  -------  -------  -------  ------- </span><br/><span> Medical       Prototyping       3.0      2.3      1.5      1.8      2.8 </span><br/><span>-------------  ------------  -------  -------  -------  -------  ------- </span><br/><span>         Production              9.1     14.2     12.3     13.2     18.4 </span><br/><span> --------------------------  -------  -------  -------  -------  ------- </span><br/><span> CCC           Prototyping       3.0      2.6      1.1      1.7      1.6 </span><br/><span>-------------  ------------  -------  -------  -------  -------  ------- </span><br/><span>         Production             11.3     12.6     12.5     10.5     11.6 </span><br/><span> --------------------------  -------  -------  -------  -------  ------- </span><br/><span> </span></pre><p class=\"\"><span>Operations update</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In September, X-FAB announced the inauguration of its new cleanroom in Malaysia, which will increase the site's manufacturing capacity from 30,000 to 40,000 wafer starts per month. Production at the new facility is being scaled up progressively, with the full increase in capacity anticipated by the fourth quarter of 2026.

The investigational medication works by binding to the C5 protein in the terminal complement cascade, a part of the body’s immune system. When activated in an uncontrolled manner, the complement cascade over-responds, leading the body to attack its own healthy cells. Concurrent binding of gefurulimab to serum albumin provides an extended half-life, enabling once-weekly dosing.

The Dutch lender announced 1.6 billion in new investor payouts and lifted its full-year revenue forecast to about 22.8 billion, from 22.6 billion previously. The return will come via a 1.1 billion share buyback and a 500 million dividendsending the stock up as much as 4.8% in Amsterdam, its biggest jump since May. RBC Capital's Anke Reingen said the raised outlook positions ING well for 2026 and 2027, as management leans on fee growth and disciplined balance-sheet strategy to steady the ship beyond the rate-peak cycle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Quarterly results underscored that pivot. Net income fell 4.9% year-on-year to 1.79 billion but still beat analysts' expectations of 1.65 billion. Fee and commission income jumped 16% to 1.17 billion as the bank expanded investment products and underwriting of larger transactions, offsetting flat net interest income of 3.71 billion. CFO Tanate Phutrakul told Bloomberg TV that after years of excess capital distributions, the bank is now operating at the right level of around 13% capital, suggesting shareholder returns could normalize as ING focuses on stability over sheer payout volume.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That 13% figure isn't arbitraryit marks an increase in the bank's CET1 capital target to meet tighter regulatory demands, up from a prior plan of 12.5%. The adjustment slightly narrows ING's flexibility for future buybacks, but also strengthens its balance sheet against macro headwinds. The latest 1.1 billion buyback is smaller than the one announced in May, signaling a more cautious capital stance. With Ida Lerner set to take over as CFO next year and Ljiljana Cortan stepping up as head of wholesale banking, CEO Steven van Rijswijk's strategy seems aimed at building durable fee-based income growth while keeping investors close through consistent, if measured, returns.</span></p></span></div></div>",
