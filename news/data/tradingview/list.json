With that move, the stock is up about 40% this year, far outpacing the S&amp;P 500's roughly 20% gain. Shares, however, are still down 15% from their all-time high of $270.71 set on Sept. 18, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company solidly beat analyst estimates for both revenue and earnings, which came in at $585 million and 80 cents a share, respectively. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting those numbers to land at $549 million and 52 cents.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the current quarter ending in December, Reddit expects revenue in a range of $655 million to $665 million and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of $275 million to $285 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Daily active users continued their low single-digit increase quarter over quarter at 116 million, versus last quarter's 110 million. The increase from last year of 19% slowed from the 21% gain for the prior quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While most of Reddit's revenue comes from advertising, its other revenue, which includes licensing deals with Google and OpenAI to train their generative artificial intelligence, brought in $36 million. That's a slight increase from last quarter's $35 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The rise of generative artificial intelligence and chatbots doesn't appear to have hurt Reddit, which relies on sharing knowledge through human conversations instead of using AI summaries. Content deals with AI companies have helped, and the company also launched its own Reddit Answers, which uses generative AI to give Reddit users answers based on its own content.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Anita Hamilton at anita.hamilton@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>DUBAI, UAE, Oct. 31, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Bybit, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has released its latest Bybit Crypto Insights Report, analyzing market movements following the much-anticipated October 2025 rate cut and ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's December policy decision.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Key Highlights:</span></strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The Federal Reserve implemented its second consecutive 25-basis-point rate cut, lowering the federal funds target range to 3.75%–4%.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Chair Jerome Powell described the economic outlook as \"driving in the fog,\" citing limited data amid a government shutdown.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Markets reacted unevenly: equities initially rallied before stabilizing, Treasury yields reversed higher, and the dollar weakened modestly.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Bitcoin and Ether saw short-term gains as lower yields and a softer dollar buoyed sentiment, while volatility in crypto markets remained subdued.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Institutional caution persisted due to regulatory uncertainties and tepid ETF flows, with select privacy tokens outperforming on specific catalysts.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>The October rate cut marked a critical juncture in the 2025 monetary policy cycle, signaling a pivot toward growth support amid inflation still above target and growing labor market fragility. The decision, approved by a 10–2 vote, reflected the Federal Reserve's balancing act between addressing economic weakness and maintaining inflation vigilance. Powell underscored that the current policy stance is \"modestly restrictive,\" but refrained from committing to further easing ahead of December's meeting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While risk assets initially welcomed the rate cut, Powell's cautious tone dampened investor enthusiasm. Treasury yields rose after an early dip, and equities moderated as traders reassessed expectations for future policy. In contrast, digital assets experienced a short-lived relief rally, with Bitcoin and Ether briefly extending gains before consolidating. Despite supportive macro conditions, the crypto market's muted reaction highlighted growing structural maturity, as volatility remained contained and option markets priced in continued caution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bybit's analysis concludes that crypto assets are increasingly behaving like high-beta macro instruments—sensitive to liquidity trends but shaped by internal market dynamics. The Federal Reserve's October decision extended the current risk-on environment, but without a clear policy trajectory for December, both traditional and digital markets remain in a holding pattern, awaiting decisive economic signals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The full analysis is available in the Bybit Crypto Insights Report.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>#Bybit / #CryptoArk /#BybitResearch / #BybitLearn</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Bybit</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bybit is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

The USDA's Crop Progress report has not been published since late September, so traders and analysts are unsure of crop conditions through the harvest — which should be mostly complete by now. But the dryness likely hasn't helped the conditions of these finished crops. Most-active CBOT corn is down 0.2%, soybeans fall 0.2%, and wheat is up 0.2%.
