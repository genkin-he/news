Minnesota has passed separate consumer protection laws to stop scams involving cryptocurrencies, in addition to the restitution fund. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Crypto ATM Ban</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bill, HF3642, sponsored by Rep. Erin Koegel, co-chair of the House Commerce Finance and Policy Committee, aims to prohibit the virtual currency kiosks across the state. The state currently has about 350 licensed kiosks operated by eight to 10 companies, according to the Department of Commerce. The bill was introduced on Monday and discussed on Thursday to prevent the rising scams against the elderly of the state. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Police told lawmakers on Thursday that scammers tell victims to put cash into these machines. The money is turned into cryptocurrency and sent to accounts controlled by the scammers. Once sent, it is very hard to track or get back. They added that the scams were mostly hurting senior citizens. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Woodbury Detective Lynn Lawrence told the House that officers once found an older woman confused at a gas station crypto kiosk. She had already made “at least 10 Bitcoin transactions in six months.” Lawrence added that the woman “had been giving 50% of her income per month to the scammers” and was scared she might have to live in her car.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Department of Commerce reported 70 complaints last year totaling $540,000 in losses. Refunds averaged only 16% of total losses. While the discussions are ongoing, the House Commerce Committee has not yet voted on the bill. On Thursday, lawmakers said they may add it to a larger commerce bill later in the session.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Blockchain security firm PeckShield Alert reported that 15 crypto-related hacks were recorded in February alone, totaling about $26.5 million, with funds moving quickly across wallets, making recovery difficult. The top five hacks pointed out were YieldBlox at $10 million, IoTeX Bridge at $8.8 million, CrossCurveFi at $3 million, FOOMCASH at $2.26 million, and Moonwell at $1.8 million. On Sunday, Georgia hosted an event to help users identify crypto scams. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Industry Calls For Regulation, Not Prohibition</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto industry representatives, however, resisted the ban in Minnesota. For instance, CoinFlip general counsel Larry Lipka told lawmakers, “It is inappropriate to ban a legal product because fraud is happening. Not our fault.” He added that machines should not be illegal, since scammers are responsible for the crimes, not the kiosk operators. He said he supports stricter rules and better enforcement instead of a full statewide ban. </span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>BEIJING, Feb 28, 2026 - (ACN Newswire) - Feb 26, Unisound has officially launched its Unisound U1-OCR, the world's first industrial-grade foundation model for document intelligence, a groundbreaking release that ushers in the OCR 3.0 era and sets a new industry standard with five core strengths: SOTA performance, verifiable results, out-of-the-box functionality, efficient deployment, and robust adaptability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Document intelligence leverages AI to automatically read, understand, classify digitized documents and extract key information. OCR 1.0 only enabled basic text recognition, while OCR 2.0 added preliminary layout understanding capabilities. U1-OCR takes a quantum leap to OCR 3.0, moving far beyond layout recognition to deliver deep semantic insight, automatic document classification and business-level information extraction-marking a transformative shift from \"character perception\" to \"document cognition\".</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a SOTA-level document intelligence model, U1-OCR resolves the longstanding bottleneck of traditional models that \"recognize text but fail to grasp layout\", enabling it to interpret complex documents like human experts. It pioneers a \"semantic-driven + dynamic focus\" strategy, first mapping a document's hierarchical structure of headings and structural metadata before extracting content on demand, and builds a semantic map to identify the relationship between titles, charts and text-even in disorganized layouts. Its enhanced spatial alignment module leverages positional data to accurately restore document structure for dense tables and mixed text-image content, effectively mitigating spatial recognition errors. Equipped with Multi-Token Prediction technology and full-task reinforcement learning, it boosts reasoning efficiency by over 80%, ensuring logical coherence for long documents.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trained with multi-task collaborative reinforcement learning and optimized for both semantics and coordinates, U1-OCR suppresses spatial hallucinations for reliable outputs, and achieves SOTA results across major authoritative benchmarks: scoring 95.1 in OmniDocBench V1.5, outperforming leading models like GLM-OCR and Gemini-3-Pro; hitting an F1 score of 90.8 in D4LA and 95.9 in DocLayNet, excelling in table recognition and cross-page association; and outperforming models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash and Qwen-2.5-VL in internal business tests, with standout performance in medical document processing such as admission and discharge records.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Figure: Comparison of Unisound U1-OCR Evaluation Scores on OmniDocBench V1.5</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Built for real-world industrial applications, U1-OCR features four key capabilities that bridge the gap between document understanding and business action. Its proprietary \"coordinate-text-semantics\" architecture enables pixel-level positioning and full evidence traceability, making audit processes transparent and efficient. Integrated with Unisound's industry expertise in healthcare and finance, it achieves over 99% classification accuracy for more than 50 common business documents, supporting cross-field logical verification with zero-shot capabilities. It supports private on-premise and offline deployment while delivering highly efficient document processing, meeting strict data privacy requirements for government, healthcare, and finance sectors while lowering hardware costs. Most notably, it delivers stable, high-precision performance in extreme scenarios-including non-standard photos, blurred documents, complex formatting and multilingual text-freeing businesses from reliance on standardized document formats.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Validated in real-world use cases, U1-OCR enables visual traceability of extracted information, automatic classification of mixed documents, performing intelligent image purification for cluttered layouts, and accurate recognition of complex nested tables with full structural retention.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The launch of U1-OCR marks AI's evolution from simple text recognition to business logic comprehension, a key step for Unisound toward AGI. By taking multimodal documents as a knowledge entry point, Unisound is empowering machines with autonomous reasoning and evidence traceability capabilities, driving AI from perceptual intelligence to cognitive intelligence-with the vision to build a general intelligent agent that reads, thinks and solves complex problems like humans, turning every document into a stepping stone to AGI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CONTACT: june@intelligentjoy.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Source: UNISOUND AI TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Copyright 2026 ACN Newswire .
