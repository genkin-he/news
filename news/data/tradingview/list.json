A weakening dollar, meanwhile, makes non-U.S. assets more appealing, Schurmeier says. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1023 ET - Yields on U.K. government bonds climb, tracking their U.S. peers, as markets revise down their expectations for U.S. interest-rate cuts after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said a follow-up rate reduction in December wasn't a foregone conclusion. On top of that, the European Central Bank left interest rates on hold on Thursday, as expected, and stressed the recent resilience of the eurozone economy despite an uncertain outlook. Ten-year gilt yields rise 3.5 basis points to last trade at 4.430%, Tradeweb data show. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields rise by around the same amount to 4.095%. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1019 ET - The typical U.S. luxury home sold for $1.26 million in September, up 4.8% from a year earlier, Redfin says, a record high for the month. That's more than twice the pace of price growth for non-luxury homes, which rose 1.8% year-over-year to a median of $371,583. The typical luxury home price has climbed about 11% since September 2023, compared with roughly 6% growth for non-luxury homes. People buying at the top end aren't waiting for rates to drop or prices to fall, Redfin says. They have the cash, stock gains, and long-term confidence to act when they see a home they want. Some high-end buyers are using real estate as a safe place to park their money amid economic uncertainty. High-end buyers also tend to pay in cash or take smaller loans, Redfin says. (chris.wack@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1015 ET - The median U.S. monthly housing payment was $2,530 during the four weeks ending Oct. 26, Redfin says, down 1.4% year over year. Monthly payments fell as mortgage rates declined. The weekly average mortgage rate dropped to 6.19% this week, its lowest level in over a year. Falling mortgage rates are enough to push monthly payments down despite rising sale prices. The median U.S. home-sale price rose 1.9% year over year, the second-biggest increase in six months. Pending home sales are up 1% year over year, and mortgage-purchase applications are up 5% week over week. New listings are up 4.6% year over year, the biggest uptick in five months, as sellers hope buyers will pounce on lower rates.

However, activity and inflation data in 2026 could eventually prompt it to cut interest rates, he says. \"The key point is that there is little appetite on the Governing Council to change interest rates in the near term, and we agree with market pricing that the deposit rate is likely stay at 2% over the next six months or so.\" But growth is set to remain subdued and inflation fall further below the 2% target than most anticipate, says Allen-Reynolds, who pencils in two rate cuts next year.

The comment comes after the ECB held rates steady, as expected. Data remain mixed, while the rollout of Germany's fiscal expansion could be slow, reducing growth prospects and providing a counterargument for policymakers who favor keeping rates unchanged, he says. \"December's meeting brings with it 2028 economic projections; if they show inflation undershooting three years in a row, the doves will be pressing the case for a cut sooner rather than later.\" (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0944 ET - Eurozone government bond yields are little moved, staying higher on the day after the European Central Bank left policy rates unchanged, as expected. The 10-year Bund yield last trades at 2.657%, up 3.8 basis points after the decision. Eurozone bond yields have been driven higher by rising U.S. Treasury yields after the Federal Reserve cooled market expectations of another rate cut in December. Meanwhile, the ECB pointed to a resilient economy. \"Despite the U.S. tariffs, despite all the various sources of uncertainty, the European economy continues to eke out some growth,\" says Mark Wall, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. \"Economic 'resilience' is keeping the ECB doves in check, and the policy pause on the rails,\" he says.

The ECB said the economy has continued to grow despite a challenging global environment. It also pointed to a robust labor market, solid private sector balance sheets and past rate cuts as \"important sources of resilience\" but noted that the outlook remains uncertain given global trade disputes and geopolitical tensions. The ECB reiterated a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach to future decisions. The euro falls 0.3% to $1.1564. It hit a two-week low of $1.1546 just before the decision as the dollar strengthened in the wake of the Federal Reserve signalling a December rate cut wasn't a done deal alongside a highly-anticipated 25 basis-point cut on Wednesday.

Bonds are selling off since Fed Chair Powell said that an interest rate cut in December can't be taken for granted. It is unclear whether overnight news of improving U.S.-China trade relations, after the Trump-Xi meeting, is having any impact on FX markets. \"I think it is hard to separate the trade story and Fed hawkish cut in driving [the] dollar,\" Chandler says, adding that markets had already been optimistic about a deal. The Bank of Japan stays put, as expected. The WSJ Dollar Index rises 0.5% as the greenback strengthens 1% versus the yen and 0.5% against the euro.

Compared with a year earlier, payroll employment was up 31,500, or 0.2%. Gains were noted by Statistics Canada in public administration and construction, but declines in retail, wholesale and scientific and technical services. Job vacancies in August fell 2.4% to 457,400, and were 15.2% lower than a year earlier. That meant 3.5 unemployed persons for every job vacancy in August.

Moreover, markets are pricing in too much risk premium ahead of next month's U.K. budget and the rise in Bank of England interest rate cut expectations looks overdone, they say. Finally, the franc has strengthened too much against the euro. Morgan Stanley has a target for sterling to rise to 1.15 francs, with a stop loss of 1.0159 francs. Sterling falls 0.1% to 1.0544 francs, having reached a low of 1.0493 Wednesday, according to LSEG. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0851 ET - Economist David Rosenberg believes the Bank of Canada may eventually have to cut rates again, despite their signal that the easing cycle might be done. The head of Rosenberg Research points to a line from Gov. Tiff Macklem's press conference, in which Macklem suggests tepid growth means \"excess supply is only taken up gradually.\" This indicates a disinflationary environment, he adds, \"and a telltale sign that the BOC is not yet done... Yes, the BOC thinks it has done enough but they are clearly unsure.\" Rosenberg adds the overall tone of the BOC's suite of communications was more dovish than in September \"and rather negative on the economic outlook.\" (Paul.Vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)</span></p></span></div></div>",

Revenue for the quarter reached $102.3 billion, higher than expectations of $99.9 billion, and up 16% on the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Analysts closely watch Alphabet's operating margin, which came in at 30.5% for the third quarter, below analyst estimates and down from 32.3% last year. Excluding a $3.5 billion European Commission fine, the operating margin would have been a healthier 33.9%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alphabet stock was up more than 5% to to $289.38 in early Thursday trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Google once again raised its guidance for 2025 spending on artificial-intelligence data centers for its Google Cloud segment. It now stands at $92 billion, up from the previous $85 billion projection. The company expects a \"significant increase\" in this spending next year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alphabet still gets around 85% of its revenue from high-margin advertising and services, but eyes remain on the cloud because of its fast growth and the extensive investments. Cloud sales growth reached 34% in the quarter. More importantly to some investors, operating profit margins improved to 24% from 17% last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Google's legacy ads and services may be ignored by some in favor of the cloud, but they are still the bulwark of Alphabet's income statement. Google had a standout quarter across these lines, with especially strong momentum in its Android-related businesses. The company continues to deliver double-digit sales growth for both Search and YouTube, Google's core ad properties</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These strong numbers were offset by the Google third-party ad network, where sales continue to decline, along with traffic on the open web. This segment is in danger of being divested in the ongoing antitrust case, U.S. v. Google.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is these legacy assets that mostly support the company's capital expenditures, with operational cash flow topping $150 billion in the last 12 months. But the rapid pace of capex is straining even that; free cash flow in the first nine months of 2025 was flat with last year, despite operational cash flows growing by 30%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Like other big AI spenders, Alphabet turned to debt markets this year, selling $12.5 billion in bonds in May. Alphabet came into the AI race with little debt, so it has a lot more room to borrow, on top of its $98 billion in cash and short-term investments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
