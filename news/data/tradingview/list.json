As the presence of Neanderthal DNA in most present-day people shows, interbreeding occurred, though the circumstances have remained unclear.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>New research focusing on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes, in present-day people and, as revealed by ancient genomes, in Neanderthals is providing insight into who participated in these prehistoric pairings. The genetic analysis backs the conclusion that this phenomenon primarily was driven by sex between Neanderthal men and Homo sapiens women.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The researchers said it is unknown why this occurred, whether by peaceful mating preference, by force or some other scenario.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The preferences of either or both parties could produce these kinds of patterns, with or without the consent of the other,\" said geneticist Alexander Platt of the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, co-lead author of the research published on Thursday in the journal Science.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chromosomes are threadlike structures that carry genetic information from cell to cell. In people, females carry two X chromosomes - one inherited from each parent. Males carry one X chromosome inherited from their mother and one Y chromosome from their father. For the other chromosomes, everyone has two copies - one from each parent, equally distributed across the sexes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most people, with the exception of certain sub-Saharan African populations, carry small amounts - often 1% to 4% - of Neanderthal DNA across much of their genome but have little to none on their X chromosomes. Africans are the exception because their ancestors, having stayed on the continent, never mixed with Neanderthals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The genomes of three Neanderthals showed an excess of Homo sapiens DNA on X chromosomes, a pattern opposite from present-day people and suggestive of male Neanderthal-female Homo sapiens mating. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The researchers also examined genetic data from present-day Africans lacking Neanderthal ancestry to better track gene flow between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals who interbred starting as early as 250,000 years ago. A more recent Homo sapiens migration resulted in additional interbreeding peaking around 47,000 years ago.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Scientists had long assumed the absence of Neanderthal contribution to modern X chromosomes was because some Neanderthal genes were biologically incompatible with Homo sapiens, causing serious health problems, and were purged because offspring failed to reproduce - Darwinian \"survival of the fittest.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the abundance of Homo sapiens DNA in Neanderthal X chromosomes contradicted that notion. Instead, the genetic data, the researchers said, is best explained by Neanderthal men and Homo sapiens women mating, with mathematical modeling confirming this mating bias could reproduce the observed genetic patterns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SIMILARITIES BEYOND THE ANATOMICAL</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Homo sapiens and Neanderthals had a common ancestor until approximately 600,000 years ago. The lineage then split, with Neanderthals evolving in Europe and Homo sapiens in Africa.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Neanderthals, who disappeared roughly 40,000 years ago, and Homo sapiens had similarities beyond the anatomical. Neanderthals, more robustly built and with larger brows, were intelligent, creating art and using complex group-hunting methods, symbolic objects and perhaps spoken language.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The nature of the interaction is difficult to ascertain based on archaeological and genetic evidence, including whether, for example, there were hostilities such as raiding parties by Neanderthal men to abduct Homo sapiens women.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We have no way of knowing if this was a conflict scenario,\" University of Pennsylvania geneticist and study senior author Sarah Tishkoff said, noting the interaction could have been peaceful.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"But we also don't know why this pattern happened of more modern human (Homo sapiens) females mating with Neanderthals - whether it was due to choice or they were forced. This is what makes it so fascinating, and hopefully someday perhaps there will be archaeological and fossil data that will shed further light on the interactions between Neanderthals and modern humans.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At some point after spreading through Eurasia, our species greatly outnumbered the Neanderthals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If you consider that there may have been 10 to 20 times as many Homo sapiens in the area as Neanderthals, the observation that we had as much as 5% Neanderthal ancestry 30,000 to 40,000 years ago suggests it's entirely reasonable to guess that there was simply so much interbreeding that we swamped the gene pool - that Neanderthals didn't actually disappear at all, they just became some of us,\" Platt said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's kind of fun to think that there are currently some six billion people walking around with about 2% Neanderthal genomes,\" Platt said. \"To the extent that that's equivalent to 120 million Neanderthals' worth of genomes, they're doing better than ever.\"</span></p></span></div></div>",

Previous marketing has included outdoor displays mocking the web's \"I'm not a robot\" captcha tests and a campaign lauding humanity's advances like the invention of the airplane. \"In a world of AI,\" the campaign urges, \"be human.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But Tools for Humanity now plans to lean on partnerships with traditional brands like these to handle a large share of the marketing for World ID, said Trevor Traina, chief business officer at the company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I think we're right at the precipice right now of the moment where we don't have to say anything, where our partners are going to do all the talking,\" Traina said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company says its Orbs translate images of a person's face and iris into an anonymized string of numbers to be stored on his or her device, with no data kept by Tools for Humanity. It hopes to generate revenue by charging a fee each time an app uses a person's World ID to confirm that they are human, Traina said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But widespread adoption is the first priority, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition to doling out Worldcoin to new World ID holders, Tools for Humanity awards its cryptocurrency to independent Orb operators in some markets outside the U.S. each time they issue a new ID. Nearly 18 million people have received World IDs, including 1.1 million in North America, according to the company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The reliance on biometrics and cryptocurrency has generated negative publicity and regulatory pushback, however, including headline-making bans in some countries over concerns about data security. Worldcoin arrived in most of the U.S. last year but remains unavailable in New York state because the company hasn't received a license to distribute digital currency from state regulators, according to people familiar with the matter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company is engaged with regulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the world, Traina said. \"It's a constant dance with regulators who, with so many innovations, you know, have to work really hard to stay current on new technologies, and I think it'll always be that way,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tools for Humanity has also moved to address some concerns. It eliminated users' earlier ability to store their biometric data externally, for example, and now only places the data on a user's own device, according to a spokeswoman. Orbs themselves are designed to delete the data immediately, the company says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>World IDs could present tempting targets for theft if they become widely adopted, according to Rory Mir, director of open access and tech community engagement at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights advocacy group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"In the worst-case scenario, potentially fraudulent operators could, you know, full-on take the ID or resell it,\" said Mir. \"You can't change your iris if someone does manage to get ahold of that information.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Tools for Humanity spokeswoman called that scenario speculative.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tools for Humanity hopes that its deals with brands like Tinder will help better explain World ID to skeptics who don't understand the need for a human verification product or suspect that it's really just a crypto play, said Traina.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Marketers see partnering with Tools for Humanity as a way to gain attention, attract new customers and, in the case of Tinder, to help allay consumers' security concerns regarding their products.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gap displayed the Orb to spark interest among the young employees of tech and AI companies who frequent downtown San Francisco, according to a spokesman. Gap will not earn any revenue or WLD Tokens from Tools for Humanity, won't have access to any consumer data gathered by the Orb and does not currently use World ID in its business, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tinder started experimenting with World ID in Japan because dating apps in that market are legally required to verify users' ages, said Yoel Roth, senior vice president of trust and safety at parent organization Match Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"One of the biggest challenges to the internet writ large right now is trust, and for us that really boils down to combating bots and fake accounts,\" said Roth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tinder was attracted to World partly because of how little user data it receives when someone completes the verification, according to Roth. Match Group has not actively marketed the integration but has seen thousands of Japanese users sign up for the ID and is now exploring other markets, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Worldcoin payments card has been delayed from its planned introduction last year, but Visa said it's still in the works. The payment company and Tools for Humanity declined to comment on timing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tinder, Visa and Tools for Humanity declined to comment on any financial arrangements of their contracts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Patrick Coffee at patrick.coffee@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Paul R. La Monica</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jim Paulsen isn't your typical \"retired Grampa,\" even though that's how he describes himself in Paulsen Perspectives, the Substack newsletter that he started writing in February 2024. And even though he has technically been retired since the end of 2022, he is still analyzing the economy and markets, much as he did for 40 years as a chief investment strategist. His career included two decades in the institutional investment unit of Wells Fargo, and another five at the Leuthold Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now that Paulsen has no boss but himself, he has the freedom and flexibility to write about what he chooses. \"I love the interplay between emotions in trading and the math of the economy and markets,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paulsen, who will turn 68 in early March, typically writes two times a week for nearly 7,500 subscribers, with recent posts focusing on bond yields, consumer confidence, and sector rotation. Barron's spoke with him in mid-February about what he's seeing in the markets and the economy, and why he remains largely bullish despite the recent artificial-intelligence and tech-stock pullback.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An edited version of the conversation follows.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Barron's : After three strong years for the stock market, do you worry that 2026 will be a down year?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jim Paulsen: I'm always worried to some degree. But I'm still more in the bullish camp. The biggest thing that keeps me bullish at this point is that Main Street confidence is in the tank, and major players in the private sector are pessimistic and cautious. They're worried about the future. I find that's always a great time to be invested.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is a bearish bull. Gold and stocks usually move in opposite directions. This is the only bull market where gold and stocks have both gone up. Also, the stock market is going up while confidence is deteriorating. This bull market has been led by a small cadre of new-era stocks, and everything else hasn't participated yet. That means there are many stocks that could still participate before the bull run is over.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>How concerned should investors be about the divide in the economy and markets between the haves and have-nots?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most of the economy entered a recession in 2022 and never emerged. But the new-era stocks put up scorching gains through that period. They have become so big [in market capitalization] that they have been wagging the dog in this market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is a reason that people on Main Street have said for years that they aren't feeling good. Weird things are going on. We have a recessionary expansion. People talk about the split of the K-shape economy — rich versus poor. I think it is more of a split between the new era [stocks] and the old era [stocks]. These new-era stocks are looking tired.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Why is that? We have had unconventional and contractionary monetary policy since 2022. This bull market started with worries about inflation and the Federal Reserve tightening. It has persisted mostly through a tightening environment. Bond yields went up and never came down much. The dollar went up dramatically until recently. The yield curve inverted for the longest time ever. The broader market should do better from here than the new-era stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now that the Fed is cutting rates again, you have talked about passing the baton in the market. Where are the new leaders?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The new-era economy has divorced itself from traditional forces. It is driven by its own innovation cycle. Yet, two important things are going on. There is dramatic over-ownership of new-era stocks, but they are no longer outperforming. Also, the Fed has eased monetary policy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Given lower interest rates and a decline in the dollar, the rally has broadened, and more stocks are now doing better. Small-caps, cyclical stocks, international stocks, and the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 index are starting to perform better. We are finally getting policy support for parts of the market that need it to do better.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Also, the capital spending cycle is long in the tooth. Part of the appeal of those winning stocks was their absolute performance, and their relative performance compared with the rest of the market. Things are changing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The broadening trend may be welcome, but will it continue?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the rest of the economy is finally getting policy support, new-era stocks won't be worth as much. They are losing some of their appeal, even if their fundamentals haven't changed much.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In some ways, we now have a bull within a bull. Tech stocks won't die, but other sectors are coming back to life, which is like starting a new bull market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>How different is the AI revolution from the revolution at the dawn of the internet in the late 1990s? Will there be an AI bust? Has it already begun?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is only one way to end a stock market bubble. It has to burst, and the market needs to crash. I'm not sure AI is in a bubble. It doesn't seem nearly as big as the dot-com bubble, and the dichotomies don't seem extreme, as in the 1990s.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When tech stocks peaked in March 2000, the broad market rolled over. The performance of the S&amp;P 500 was tied directly to the internet sector. That hasn't happened this time around. Tech stocks have been relatively weak since the end of October, but the S&amp;P 500 has held its highs, and has even gone up since then. That can happen only because the baton is passing to a broader array of stocks. Their strength is compensating for the weakness in tech.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This sounds like a good argument for diversification.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Almost all investors let their exposure to new-era stocks rise in recent years. We did it purposefully or passively, via index funds. Heck, who could sell these stocks when they outperformed consistently and had such dynamic stories?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I don't advise selling all your tech stocks now. But if you trim your weighting in a sector that accounts for about 40% of the value of the S&amp;P 500, and put your money in something else, such as small-caps, that seems sensible. We don't need to have a tech crash that spells the end of the bull market. The market can keep rising as we find new winners.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Let's switch gears, or assets. The dollar has weakened in the past year. Where does that leave investors?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The dollar's performance has been a big driver of international stocks' outperformance, but it is just one factor. People have an odd emotional reaction to the dollar — to the idea that a strong dollar is good and a weak dollar is anti-American. I never understood that. The dollar is just like interest rates. When it goes up, it can be a restrictive force.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Where should people invest overseas?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A weaker dollar means international stocks should keep winning. I am more intrigued by emerging and frontier markets than developed markets. Emerging markets excluding China look attractive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The pandemic was a disaster for China. It highlighted to every company in the world the need to diversify supply chains. You want to have exposure to places like Vietnam, and Central and South America, as well.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>President Donald Trump has nominated Kevin Warsh as the next Fed chair. What would a Warsh Fed mean for monetary policy?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We don't have an inflation problem, so the Fed doesn't need to raise rates. Also, I am not worried about threats to the Fed's independence. Fed governors are appointed by politicians. There is political bias throughout the Fed. But there is political bias everywhere; that is nothing new.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ultimately, the Fed has a bigger boss: the economy. We have a weird economy now: Gross domestic product is still growing, while the unemployment rate has risen. Some parts of the labor market, such as manufacturing, have seen no job growth in the past year. It will be difficult for the Fed to stand pat. Also, GDP is distorted; the economy isn't doing as well as the numbers suggest. They have been impacted by trade flows and the massive budget deficit. The Fed is going to have to bring more juice [in the form of lower rates] regardless of who is on the Board of Governors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What will that mean for fixed-income investors?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Inflation is heading down closer to the Fed's 2% annual target, but the Fed needs to get rid of that target. Everyone treats 2% inflation as the holy grail. Americans don't like inflation of any ilk, but it is back in the 2% to 3% range, and that has been just fine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I wouldn't be shocked to see the 10-year Treasury yield at 3.25% to 3.5% by the end of the year. Bonds should have a pretty good year, although maybe not as good as stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You have discussed on Substack some of the risks that investors face with gold. Yet, the yellow metal has continued to climb. How much further can this rally go?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I didn't think gold would go up as much as it already has. But there are problems. The surge in gold reflects investors' uncertainty about geopolitics, monetary policy, and the economy. For gold to continue climbing, the level of uncertainty would need to increase.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gold is the thing you buy to protect you from whatever keeps you up at night. But the same things that should lead to improvement in the broader market and economy should also improve consumer confidence. If that happens, that is an enemy of gold. Also, since we don't have an inflation problem, I would take money out of gold.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thanks for your time, Jim.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Paul R.

Setting the scene for the workshop, fellow speakers included Clare Woodford, Alpine Group's vice president of impact and sustainability and Ines Kaempfer, CEO of The Center for Child Rights and Business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the session, Cascale's Saini highlighted the need for greater alignment across the sector to make due diligence workable in practice. She emphasized that focusing only on Tier-1 suppliers is insufficient and risks perpetuating fragmentation and audit fatigue for manufacturers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"For more than 30 years we've been asking suppliers for more and more information, yet we keep duplicating efforts instead of coordinating them,\" said Saini. \"If we want due diligence to work upstream, we have to move beyond Tier-1, align expectations, and stop overburdening suppliers with fragmented requests.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>She noted that collaboration between initiatives, including Fair Wear, the Social and Labor Convergence Program (SLCP), Better Buying and others, together with shared data from tools such as the Higg Index, is essential to support upstream due diligence and credible decent-work outcomes across supply chains.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The workshop featured a discussion-style format with attendees divided into groups after initial firestarter prompts on upstream due diligence. Groups included brands, manufacturers, sustainability initiatives, and trade unions, CSOs, and policymakers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cascale also hosted a virtual side session drawing on insights from the Better Buying Purchasing Practices Index (BBPPI) 2025, \"Sustainable Supply Chains in Turbulent Times: Regional Differences in Suppliers' Experiences of Buyer Purchasing Practices in the Age of Tariffs.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Katie Hess, head of product at Cascale's Better Buying, and Orsolya Janossy, senior sustainability manager at Recover, guided the conversation. The virtual session underscored Cascale's Better Buying data, collected confidentially from suppliers in Spring 2025. It unpacked regional challenges faced by suppliers, the impact of local contexts and business environments on buyer purchasing practices, and how buyer companies can adapt to volatility - while upholding responsible practices during turbulent times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This isn't just a pricing conversation,\" said Hess. \"It comes down to a stability and feasibility issue. When costing isn't realistic, it becomes a due diligence issue. Compliance and decent work are what gets squeezed first.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"What we learned is that responsible sourcing isn't just about auditing compliance or sourcing compliance, it's about building a win-win sustainable partnership,\" said Janossy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>She showcased a case study from Recover's suppliers in Bangladesh, where fire safety often lags. Together, they prioritized long-term stability through shared risk management and improved grievance mechanisms and training.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a separate virtual side session, Cascale's Jeremy Lardeau, senior vice president of the Higg Index, moderated a discussion hosted by The Industry We Want as part of a Retailer Roundtable (RRT). Representatives from Fair Wear, retailers Zalando and Boozt, and brand member Ecco also joined the conversation. The session explored the essential and often overlooked role of third-party retailers in implementing and upholding effective Human Rights and Environmental Due Diligence (HREDD). Using the RRT to foster a pre-competitive space for retailers, the session examined the role of Multi-Stakeholder Initiatives (MSIs) to share and promote best practices. Together, these efforts aim to develop aligned solutions grounded in the OECD Due Diligence for Responsible Business Conduct framework.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition, Gabriele Ballero, public affairs manager at Cascale participated in a multi-stakeholder roundtable co-organized by Policy Hub and SLCP, focused on the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) in the textile sector. The discussion gathered brands, manufacturers, policymakers and civil society representatives to assess the practical implications of the Omnibus changes and priorities for upcoming guidance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Participants emphasized that the sector is not starting from scratch and that implementation should recognize credible existing tools and initiatives rather than create parallel systems. The discussion also highlighted the need for clarity around \"reasonably available information,\" warning that without guidance companies may over-collect data or face legal uncertainty. Stakeholders broadly supported a progressive, risk-based approach, greater interoperability across instruments, and collaboration to address deeper tiers of the supply chain while reducing audit fatigue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Also in attendance were Cascale's Carolina van Loenen, director of stakeholder engagement; Orine Dsouza, senior manager, Higg Facility Tools; and Hanna Griesbeck Garcia, Manager, stakeholder engagement, EMEA. As in years past, the stakeholder engagement team played a leading role in event preparation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Find more stories and multimedia from Cascale at 3blmedia.com.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Contact Info:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Spokesperson: Cascale</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cascale</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Email: info@3blmedia.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>SOURCE:</span></strong><span> Cascale</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire</span></p></span></div></div>",

It averaged 6.76% during the same period a year ago. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     The drop followed a decline in the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield after the     </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/supreme-court-of-the-united-states/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Supreme Court</a><span>     on Friday struck down President Donald Trump's     sweeping tariffs    , which he had pursued under a law meant for use in national emergencies.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span> </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Trump</a><span>     swiftly imposed a 10%     global tariff     for 150 days to replace some of the emergency duties, before raising the rate to 15% over the weekend.

It averaged 5.94% during the same period a year ago.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     SUPPLY IS KEY FOR THE HOUSING MARKET  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     Economists are skeptical that mortgage purchases will significantly improve housing affordability.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     Minutes of the     Federal Reserve's     January 27-28 policy meeting published last week, describing a briefing by a New York Fed official responsible for implementing monetary policy, noted that plans by the administration to buy mortgage bonds had caused \"a notable decline in mortgage-backed securities yields relative to those on comparable-maturity Treasury yields.”  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Despite that move in the market, the official \"observed that the decline was unlikely to result in a material increase in mortgage refinancing because current mortgage rates are well above the weighted average rate of outstanding mortgages,\" the minutes said.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     Trump is under pressure to bring down costs, including for housing, as he and his fellow Republicans face a tough battle to retain control of the U.S. Congress in this year's mid-term elections. Economists and policymakers say a dearth of properties for sale, especially starter homes, was weighing on the housing market.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     The inventory of previously owned houses is well below its pre-pandemic level. Many homeowners hold mortgages with rates below 5%, creating what has been called a rate-lock.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     Though supply improved last year, progress has stalled. There have been reports of homeowners pulling their houses off the market because of lower prices. House prices increased 1.8% in the 12 months through December after climbing 2.1% in November, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said on Tuesday.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     Economists and trade groups say the Trump administration's trade and immigration policies, which have raised prices for building materials and appliances and undercut labor supply, were constraining builders' ability to break ground on new single-family housing projects.

The company's AI platform Agentforce did have a strong showing in 4Q, but still makes up about 2% of total revenue, analysts Karl Keirstead and Dean Marriott say. \"The issue is that the other 98% of revs is under pressure,\" they say. As businesses shift resources to AI, spending is slipping away from software apps. Coupled with a slowdown at Workday reported earlier this week, Salesforce's results don't make a compelling case for investors to jump back into software, the analysts say. Salesforce is up 3.3%.
