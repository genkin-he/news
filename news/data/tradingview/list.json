Amazon will make an initial $15 billion investment, with the remaining $35 billion coming after certain conditions are met.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The partners pledged to create a computing environment powered by OpenAI models that will be available for AWS customers \"to build generative AI applications and agents at production scale.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OpenAI and Amazon also plan to develop customized models that can power Amazon's customer-facing applications. The agreement comes with a pledge from OpenAI to use 2 gigawatts of capacity from Amazon's Trainium chips.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon shares ticked down 0.8% in premarket trading. Futures tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 1.1%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OpenAI said separately Friday that it had closed a $110 billion funding round, more than double its $40 billion raise last year. The figure includes $50 billion from Amazon, $30 billion from SoftBank, and $30 billion from Nvidia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The investment brings OpenAI to a $730 billion pre-money valuation, up from $500 billion in October.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The partnerships with Amazon, Nvidia, and the like \"expand our global reach, deepen our infrastructure, and strengthen our balance sheet so we can bring frontier AI to more people, more businesses, and more communities worldwide,\" OpenAI said in a blog post.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>More importantly for investors, the latest funding arrives before a possible OpenAI initial public offering. The company has been eyed as a candidate to go public, with multiple reports suggesting it could make its trading debut as soon as the second half of the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The developments come at a time when concerns over artificial-intelligence disruption have reached a fever pitch. Software stocks have been hammered in a broad-based selloff that reflects a deflationary spiral in tech valuations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Although Nvidia reported blowout earnings on Wednesday, the results failed to assuage investor concerns over the longevity of the AI boom. Shares of the chip maker suffered their worst single-day drop in nearly a year on Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
