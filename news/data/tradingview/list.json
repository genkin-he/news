He cuts his FY 2025 EPS forecast by 7.5% on the incremental impacts of the charge, which included redundancies and other costs, but tells clients in a note that there is no subsequent material impact. Jefferies trims its target price 0.2% to A$31.60 and stays neutral on the stock, which is down 0.5% at A$36.66. (stuart.condie@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
