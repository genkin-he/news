            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Andy Serwer</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This morning for the first time in 60 years, Berkshire Hathaway shareholders are reading the company's annual stockholder letter — and it isn't written by Warren Buffett. Instead, the letter is authored by Berkshire's new CEO, 63-year-old Greg Abel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This year's letter comes in at 18 pages, significantly longer than Buffett's letters, which tended to run 10-15 pages. In it, Abel lays out what he considers to be Berkshire's company culture and he walks shareholders through its operating businesses. The comprehensive nature of the report might reflect Abel's desire to show investors he is fully knowledgeable of Berkshire's ins and outs — and that he has a firm grip on his remit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I am actually pretty impressed,\" says Macrae Sykes, a longtime Berkshire watcher and portfolio manager at Gabelli Financial Services Opportunities ETF (GABF). \"I give him a gold medal for laying out the technical aspects of the company. The letter is very comprehensive, his knowledge is incredible which is not a surprise, but still impressive to see.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For decades, Buffett, 95, wrote what became a much-anticipated and much-pored over communication, highly-valued both for its analysis of Berkshire, markets, and sometimes even humanity, as well as its folksy wisdom. Though Buffett remains company chairman, he stepped down as CEO on Jan. 1. In a November news release, Buffett noted that he \"will no longer be writing Berkshire's annual report.\" (A February communication confirmed \"the annual report will include Greg Abel's first annual letter to shareholders.\") And so what was long \"the chairman's letter\" at Berkshire has been replaced, for the time being at least, by the CEO's letter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Expectations have been high amongst Berkshire watchers over this year's letter, with two broad and obvious questions front and center: Exactly which company and business issues will Abel address in his first letter, and how is the tone, style, and even length of the letter different from Buffett's?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>First question first. What did Abel focus on? He begins the letter not surprisingly with a tribute to Buffett, writing that Buffett \"is arguably the greatest investor of all time, with generations benefiting from his investment acumen. He has also been a remarkable CEO... (To Warren's great frustration, this letter begins with these observations — yet we all know they are true.)\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the company culture section, Abel cites a letter he sent to employees \"emphasiz[ing] that Berkshire's culture and values remain unchanged and will continue into perpetuity.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here, Abel also points to the company's decentralized model, its integrity, financial strength, and capital discipline. In the latter section, Abel says the company may make share repurchases — but would not be paying a dividend at this time, which some investors had anticipated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sykes notes, though, that Abel says this is subject to board review. \"That leaves the door open,\" Sykes says. In the letter, Abel also speaks to the company's risk management, and name-checks that unit's top executive, Ajit Jain, 74. He makes no mention of Jain retiring, which some investors wondered about, but says Jain would be on stage with the CEO at the company's annual meeting in Omaha in May.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Next Abel speaks to Berkshire's performance, walking investors through the health of the company's operating business units. As for its investment portfolio, where investors might be seeking clarity as to who is directly overseeing it going forward, Abel writes that \"equity investments are fundamental to our capital allocation activities; responsibility ultimately resides with me as CEO. Ted Weschler manages about 6% of our investments, including a portion of the portfolio formerly overseen by Todd Combs. Ted's impact extends beyond these investments, as he continues to play a broader role in assessing significant opportunities, providing valuable input on our businesses, and supporting Berkshire in various other ways.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As part of the letter, Abel also welcomes new CFO Chuck Chang, succeeding Marc Hamburg, and Mike O'Sullivan as Berkshire's first general counsel. The letter closes with Abel describing the upcoming annual meeting, stressing continuity with previous ones.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The letter's last line — \"We move forward with great intent and purpose\" — resonated with Sykes. \"I love how he concluded,\" Sykes says. \"It's a wonderful way to end the letter, and gives you lots of confidence.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There were items that Abel does not address. The letter does not speak directly to any plans he might have concerning Berkshire's massive cash trove of $373 billion as of 2025 year-end, more than any other American company's. Nor does he say will buy stock Berkshire stock for himself, as his ownership of company stock is tiny compared to Buffett's $150 billion stake in the company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stylistically, Abel's letter differs from Buffett's in ways one might expect. It contains fewer of the homilies or folksy tales for which Buffett was famous. (Not even any metaphors about ice hockey, a sport with which the Canadian-native Abel is enamored.) Nor are there any stories about Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger, who passed away in late 2023.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another changed facet is that veteran business journalist, Carol Loomis, is no longer editing Berkshire's letter to shareholders, as she did for Buffett beginning in 1977. Loomis, 96, and Buffett, who still play bridge together online, would go back and forth for weeks as part of the editing process before the letter came out. Those days are no more, though, and as Buffett no longer writes the letter, Loomis no longer edits it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Berkshire letter to shareholders is Greg Abel's baby now.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Andy Serwer at andy.serwer@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The uptick in oil prices combined with the Trump administration's aggressive approach to tariffs is putting upward pressure on inflation, complicating any Fed rate cut, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Over the past several months, the Fed has struggled to tamp down inflation amid pressure from the White House and the markets to cut rates. These latest developments only add to the central bank's challenges.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Prices at the wholesale level started to accelerate in December and are running at a 3% annual rate, frustrating Federal Reserve officials who hoped that the taxes on imports would only have a transitory impact on inflation. It's likely that the increase in producer prices will soon be passed on to consumers, said Ethan Harris, former chief economist at BofA Securities, in a note on LinkedIn.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Inflation is looking like it is heating up in the first quarter, agreed Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets. Core personal-consumption expenditures could rise to 3.1% annual rate in January, the highest rate in two years - and that's before any impact from a potential U.S. strike on Iran. The Fed's target for inflation is 2%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Any $10 increase in crude-oil prices is estimated to raise consumer-price inflation by 0.2% to 0.4% over the coming year, Anderson said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WTI crude-oil futures (CL00) (CLJ26) are up about 16% year to date, or $10 per barrel since the beginning of the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Just the growing risk of a conflict with Iran is already impacting energy markets and prices, adding to U.S. inflation pressures and creating major headwinds for further Fed rate cuts,\" Anderson said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A prolonged conflict might raise the possibility that the central bank's next move would be to raise interest rates, he added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You're really talking about problems for the Fed in terms of putting a lid on inflation,\" Bethune said. \"In this situation, the Fed can't lower rates.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Traders in derivate markets still expect two quarter-point rate cuts this year, with the first coming in June and the second in September.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both tariffs and oil prices are supply shocks, raising the costs of inputs into production of the economy, which are very hard for the Fed to cool.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Fed's interest-rate tool works more on the demand side of the economy, by either spurring companies and consumers to spend or nudging them to pull back.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Military action in Iran is likely, analysts say</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oil prices are expected to spike if there is any attack on Iran, with the only debate about how long the higher prices might last.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Analysts see a very high potential for some kind of military strike on Iran in the coming weeks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There has been a \"slow-motion effort\" to get U.S. military assets in the Middle East region since January, said Suzanne Maloney, director of the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. military action against Iran \"seems more likely than not,\" said Christopher Granville, managing director of TS Lombard, a macroeconomic forecasting consultancy firm based in London.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Granville said a military confrontation between the U.S. and Iran is unlikely to send the global economy into a full-blown oil crisis and stagflationary shock. Still, it's possible we'll face an \"oil squall\" similar to what happened after Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022, when oil prices surged over $100 a barrel and remained high for six months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That so-called squall was enough to fuel inflation in the U.S., with the core PCE price index rising at an annual pace of 5.6% in September 2022, the highest rate in almost 40 years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, many economists say it's hard to forecast the future in the Middle East and how any confrontation would impact oil prices. Bank analysts still expect 2026 average prices to remain around the low $60-a-barrel range.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Karen Young, senior research scholar at the Center for Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, said any price spike depends on whether the Iranian regime strikes oil-production facilities of its neighbors in the Middle East in response to U.S. action.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran also has the ability to disrupt the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial maritime passage connecting the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vali Nasr, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies, thinks it is likely that Iran tries to hit its neighbors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Iranian government's conclusion is that if President Trump calculates that war is cost-free, \"he's going to continue doing it,\" Nasr said during a discussion of the conflict earlier this week sponsored by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Greg Robb</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Bitcoin’s higher-timeframe structure is in an interesting state, according to crypto analyst Crypto Patel, who is of the notion that the cryptocurrency has officially entered bearish territory after breaking a long-term support level at $107,000. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Technical analysis of price action on the weekly candlestick price chart shows Bitcoin is now in this bearish territory, with a projection of a deeper correction to as low as $35,000 in 2026. The outlook is based on Fibonacci retracement levels that could determine Bitcoin’s next price move.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Bearish Territory Kicked In After Breakdown Below $107,000</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The outlook of this technical analysis is based on the premise that Bitcoin entered into bearish territory after the price broke down below a major higher-timeframe ascending trendline around $107,000. This trendline, which is visible on the weekly chart shared by Crypto Patel, acted as dynamic support throughout much of the 2023 to 2025 rally. It connected a series of higher lows and helped sustain the broader bullish structure that ended with Bitcoin reaching a peak price of $126,080.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The chart shows the breakdown zone with a red circle, indicating where the price decisively lost that upward support. After the breach, Bitcoin entered into a changed momentum and began printing lower highs. According to Patel, that trendline was the line in the sand, and losing it was when Bitcoin officially entered bearish territory. The market now needs a healthy correction before the next leg up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Fibonacci Levels Point To $44,000 And $35,000</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bitcoin has been on a downward path since the beginning of the year, and the projection is that this will continue until it bottoms out around $35,000. This outlook is based on how much the Bitcoin price corrected in previous cycles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For instance, the 2018 bear market saw an approximately 84% decline from peak to trough. Similarly, the 2022 correction erased roughly 77% from its cycle high. In both instances, these deep retracements came before the next major rally. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Based on that historical perspective, a move below $50,000 from the current price level would not be unprecedented. Instead, it would fit within Bitcoin’s established cycle behavior.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The projected downside targets are derived from Fibonacci retracement levels drawn from the October 2025 all-time high. Two levels stand out clearly on the chart. The first level is the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement, which is currently around $44,000. The 0.5 Fibonacci retracement is a mid-cycle pullback level and has always attracted strong buying interest in previous corrections, making it a possible stabilization point if selling pressure slows down.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Should Bitcoin fail to find support near $44,000, then the next level is the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement around $35,000. The expectation is that Bitcoin will eventually bottom at $35,000 even if it fails to hold above $44,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $63,740, down by 6% in the past 24 hours.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Oil prices are likely to remain elevated as production and passage remain prone to attacks and disruptions. OPEC may be under pressure to raise production to try and offset. But a 10-25% premium on oil is not outlandish - even without a blockade of the Straits of Hormuz, which is easily a 50% premium risk event.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CHRISTOPHER WONG, STRATEGIST, OCBC, SINGAPORE:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The strike raises geopolitical risk premia as markets head into Monday’s open. The immediate reaction function is fairly predictable: safe-haven assets such as gold are likely to see an upside gap, while oil prices may also firm on supply-disruption concerns.

Today's payment rails and marketplaces were designed for humans, not millions of agents negotiating and settling transactions simultaneously. Traditional blockchains create consensus bottlenecks. Centralized platforms sacrifice trustlessness. Neither scales to the demands of the autonomous economy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Unicity Protocol solves this: a novel peer-to-peer blockchain architecture that eliminates the shared ledger entirely, enabling private negotiation, atomic settlement, and throughput exceeding 300 million transactions per second with 1-second finality and fixed microcent fees.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"India has 63 million SMBs, most of them bandwidth-constrained,\" said Pankaj Thakar, Partner at PadUp Ventures. \"They can't afford sales teams or 24/7 customer support.

A massive, underserved SMB market, deep developer talent across AI and blockchain, rapidly expanding digital payments infrastructure, and established cross-border trade corridors to the UAE, Southeast Asia, and beyond make it one of the highest-potential markets for the autonomous economy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"India doesn't just adopt technology, it scales it,\" said Mike Gault, CEO of Unicity Labs. \"UPI proved that.

When I first started working there, I could feel my boss's eyes on me. I felt like he was gossiping about me to a lot of people, and during one review, it became clear that he was.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I had old clothes from my previous job before the pandemic, and I realized they weren't up to date. I could feel him looking me up and down whenever I walked into the office. He is a white man, and as a Black woman, it was very disheartening. I often felt self-conscious, thinking, \"This man is looking at me like I'm some dirty woman.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During my first review last year, he said, \"I just feel like you don't dress for the occasion.\" Feeling like I'm always being judged and that he is talking about me to other people has made it hard for me to do a good job and learn. How am I supposed to deal with these kinds of comments from my manager and still thrive in my job?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dressed Down</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you're just starting out on your money or career journey and have questions about how to navigate your finances, we want to hear from you. Write to Dollar Signs, MarketWatch's new advice column, at dollarsigns@marketwatch.com.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dear Dressed,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>First of all, I'm so sorry you're dealing with this kind of behavior. That comment is unhelpful and rude. It's also not uncommon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I, too, was given feedback on my appearance during a job review when I was 23. It was my first salaried position, and I was told that I constantly looked like I had \"just woken up from a nap.\" It was jarring, to say the least, and I wasn't exactly sure what to take from an observation like that aside from offense.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Saying that \"you don't dress for the occasion\" is extremely vague. You could ask him what actionable steps you are expected to take, if any. It might also help to ask your colleagues if there is an unwritten dress code. Have they ever gotten similar feedback? What do they think about your attire? What might he be referring to? Perhaps he doesn't like jeans or open-toed shoes, even if they aren't officially banned.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Of course, you cannot unhear hurtful comments, but you can prevent them from impacting your performance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Keita Williams, founder of the career coaching company Success Bully, says she \"wants to extend a virtual hug\" to you, as she has experienced similar treatment in the workplace.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Being a Black woman who is tall, I was viewed as aggressive whether I was aggressive or not,\" Williams says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The key to managing emotions around comments that aren't productive - and, more importantly, aren't about your actual work performance - is to separate who you are from what is being said about you, Williams says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"That's their worldview, and navigating life as a Black woman, you're going to experience micro- and macroaggressions,\" she says. \"They are unavoidable. You cannot internalize them and let them chip away at your self-worth.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crucially, there is a power imbalance here, which threatens your psychological safety at work. The reason you're finding it hard to learn is that you don't feel safe or supported. Does this company have a culture of training on workplace behavior and how to treat employees?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Advocate for yourself</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Next, you need to address the larger issue. Your boss may be bad-mouthing you to others. It might be tempting to confide in colleagues that you're having a hard time connecting with your manager, but that probably isn't a good idea, Williams says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Allow your boss to be the unprofessional one,\" she says. \"If you try to out-petty someone, you only make yourself look worse, not the offender.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A better course of action is to talk yourself up. It sounds like your boss won't be your best advocate, which means you have to be even more vocal about your wins. That project that went smoothly? Mention how crucial you were to its success at the next lunch-and-learn. Did you spearhead a task flawlessly? Make sure those outside your team know about it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Do your own personal PR,\" Williams says. \"Start your own rumor mill of positive news.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I know this can feel uncomfortable, but you know what's even more uncomfortable? Being unemployed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I want to add that if comments about your appearance persist, you might want to consult your employee handbook and ask HR. It likely contains guidelines around dress code, and if your boss isn't adhering to them, you can go to HR.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>His treatment might cross the line into harassment if you feel like it is about your race or gender, says Priya Rathod, the workplace-trends editor at Indeed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"What we always say is conflict is about the task and harassment is about the person behind the task,\" she says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Generally speaking, I don't think HR is always the most helpful arm of any company, as it is designed to protect the company. But technically, it's also supposed to help shield the company from legal jeopardy. That includes protecting employees from discrimination.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If they ignore [your complaint], they could be liable for facilitating a hostile work environment,\" she says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For that reason, it might be worth documenting with them that certain inappropriate comments are being made.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you do want to bring a harassment case against your boss, you'll need to provide documentation of the comments. If snarky remarks are emailed or direct-messaged to you, screenshot and print them out. If the harassment is verbal, record exactly what was said along with the date and time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You cannot help how others perceive or treat you, but you can control how you respond. Yes, it's upsetting to know that your boss is talking to others about something as trivial as your clothing. But ultimately, this is just a job. You need it to pay your rent, travel, and afford the things in life that truly bring you joy. Don't let these comments distract you from securing a consistent paycheck.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most of all, you need to pay attention to your performance. Also, ask him about your goals and make sure that you are hitting them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These observations are a reflection of him, not you. Do your job, talk yourself up, and cash that check.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Dollar Signs at dollarsigns@marketwatch.com.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By submitting your story to Dow Jones &amp; Co., the publisher of MarketWatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Aditi Shrikant</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
