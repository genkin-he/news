The European plane maker dispatched 507 aircraft by the end of September and is targeting roughly 820 deliveries for 2025. The analysts say deliveries hinge on the company receiving and installing engines, which are still affected by supply-chain snags despite recent improvements. Airbus had 32 gliders--aircraft awaiting engines--in inventory at the end of September, they note. However, they say Airbus remains on track to reach its delivery goal. Airbus shares trade 2% higher at 212.65 euros. (mauro.orru@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

The patent defines a new class of graphene-enabled coolants capable of improving energy efficiency across industrial, domestic and digital-infrastructure systems where power densities are increasing sharply.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To accelerate commercial deployment, Haydale has signed an agreement with Liquitherm Technologies Group Ltd, the UK's leading formulator and supplier of specialist heat-transfer fluids, to jointly commercialise the Haydale Technology across domestic, commercial and data-centre applications, including direct-to-chip liquid-cooling circuits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Liquitherm brings over 25 years' experience in mission-critical cooling infrastructure, providing manufacturing capability and access to established HVAC and data-centre customers across the UK and Europe. Through its Thermal Energy Optimisation Programme, Liquitherm manages coolant specification, installation and performance for leading data-centre, renewable-energy and industrial customers, with a proven reputation for technical rigour and reliability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In parallel, Haydale has received a non-binding Letter of Intent from a leading US-based global manufacturer of electric vehicles and energy systems to evaluate the Haydale Technology for advanced thermal-management systems used in next-generation power-device cooling. This engagement underscores rising interest from Tier-1 global manufacturers in Haydale's patented graphene materials platform.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Haydale has also signed two Memoranda of Understanding with UK-based designers of modular and high-performance, energy-efficient data-centre infrastructure to test and validate the Haydale Technology within data-centre cooling systems in South Wales and other UK locations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>South Wales is rapidly emerging as the UK's centre for data-centre and digital-infrastructure investment, with major projects across the Vale of Glamorgan, Cardiff and Bridgend. Within 50 km of Haydale's Ammanford facilities, a new ecosystem - the \"Thermal Valley\" - is forming, linking compute infrastructure, advanced materials and government-backed decarbonisation initiatives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Thermal Enabler of the Next Industrial Revolution</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The industrial cooling sector is one of the largest yet least-recognised levers for global energy efficiency and decarbonisation. Soaring computing-power demand is driving an unprecedented rise in data-centre energy use - with cooling already accounting for up to 40 per cent of total facility power consumption and overall electricity demand forecast to triple by 2030.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The combination of AI expansion, high-performance computing, and growing pressure on electricity grids is creating urgent demand for advanced cooling solutions that can deliver higher efficiency without costly infrastructure upgrades - a challenge directly addressed by Haydale's graphene-enhanced heat-transfer fluid. Infused with plasma-functionalised graphene nanoparticles, the fluid delivers substantially higher thermal-transfer efficiency than conventional coolants, directly reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Simon Turek, CEO of Haydale, commented:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"From graphene to gigawatts, South Wales is quietly building the materials engine of the modern digital economy, and Haydale is proud to be contributing at its centre.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Throughout 2025, we've been developing graphene-enabled solutions that improve the movement and management of heat - first through JustHeat™ and now through advanced cooling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Just as silicon enabled computing, graphene will enable the next generation of high-performance systems. Our technology closes the thermal gap that silicon opened.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Outlook</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With JustHeat and now its graphene-enhanced heat-transfer fluid, Haydale has established the two core pillars of its commercial platform - heating and cooling - each built on its scalable HDPlas® technology. As compute loads surge and energy efficiency becomes a global priority, Haydale's fluid enters the market at a time when demand for energy-efficient cooling is increasing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While these agreements are not expected to generate immediate commercial revenues, they represent the next phase in the disciplined commercialisation of the Haydale Technology - moving from successful laboratory validation into controlled field trials with commercial partners. These programmes are designed to demonstrate real-world performance and scalability, but there can be no assurance of success or of future revenues arising from them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This launch therefore marks another measured step in Haydale's long-term strategy to build a scalable, graphene-enabled technology platform delivering practical decarbonisation solutions and foundational materials for the global energy-efficiency transition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For further information</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Haydale Graphene Industries plc</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Simon Turek, Chief Executive Officer                                               Tel: +44 (0) 1269 842946</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gareth Kaminski-Cook, Non-Executive Chair</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Patrick Carter, Chief Financial Officer</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>www.haydale.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser &amp; Broker)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Julian Blunt / Edward Whiley / Trisyia Jamaludin                              Tel: +44 (0) 20 7220 0500</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Corporate Finance</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Andrew Burdis, ECM</span></p><span>This information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
