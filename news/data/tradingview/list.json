It's the first time that threshold has been passed since July 2024. President Trump posted on Truth Social that he \"had a truly great meeting with President Xi of China,\" mentioning that China agreed to purchase \"massive amounts of Soybeans, Sorghum, and other Farm products.\" Further details were scant throughout the day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>INSIGHT</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Different Scenario: China isn't looking to build its livestock herds, but instead move more animals through its meat-processing pipeline. That may become a big factor influencing how CBOT soybeans trade, more so than promises made during this week's meetings between the U.S. and China. \"Amid a massive liquidation of their hog herd, [we doubt] that China wants to import greater tonnages of soybeans in 2025/26,\" AgResource said in a note. The firm also adds that Brazilian prices remain more competitive, making the U.S. a less-favored alternative until margins ease.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Delayed Reaction: Aid payments that have been directed to farmers in the wake of U.S. trading disputes with numerous partners may be slowing down what would otherwise be a necessary change in the input costs for farmers to plant every spring. In a report this week, analysts with Rabobank said payments coming from the Trump Administration may be creating this delay. If land values alone were to backtrack from current levels, then the price competitiveness of U.S. soybeans would be closer to par with that of soybeans out of Brazil's Mato Grosso region, Rabobank said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AHEAD</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Note: The government shutdown is impacting the timing of USDA reports and data releases.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>AGCO Corp. will release its third quarter earnings report at 7:30 a.m. ET Friday.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Zoetis Inc. will release its third quarter earnings report at 7 a.m. ET Tuesday.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Mosaic Co. will release its third quarter earnings report after the  stock market closes on Tuesday.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

This decrease was due to principal payments and amortization of $4.8 million and a decrease in unrealized losses of $2.0 million.

The yield on net loans increased 16 bps to 6.28% for the third quarter of 2025 from 6.11% for the second quarter of 2025 due to loan mix, higher yields on new originations, and repricing higher on existing portfolio rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interest expense on deposits increased $140,000 during the third quarter of 2025 compared to the second quarter of 2025 due to an increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits of $24.4 million.

OPEC+ is widely expected to agree at the weekend to unwind another 137,000 barrels of output cuts in December. Reports that Russia may push back against further increases as the country faces U.S. sanctions is something to consider, says Rebecca Babin of CIBC Private Wealth US. \"I see the 137,000 coming, but I'm not saying there's no chance you'll see a pause,\" she says.
