The Company's lead product candidate is MOLBREEVI (also referred to as \"molgramostim\"), an inhaled granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. MOLBREEVI is in a Phase 3 IMPALA-2 pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (\"aPAP\"), a chronic and debilitating rare lung disease characterized by the abnormal build-up of surfactant in the alveoli of the lungs. Savara has consistently represented that, based on investments in MOLBREEVI and its purported \"track record of strong fiscal discipline,\" the Company is \"sufficiently capitalized\" as early as through 2026 and as late as into the second half of 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In December 2024, Savara began a rolling submission of a Biologics License Application (\"BLA\")-</span><em><span>i.e.</span></em><span>, a submission requesting approval to distribute a biologic product across state lines-to the United States (\"U.S.\") Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") for MOLBREEVI for the potential treatment of aPAP (the \"MOLBREEVI BLA\"). In a press release announcing the submission, the Company touted that, \"given the positive results of the pivotal, Phase 3 IMPALA-2 trial, we believe MOLBREEVI demonstrates a favorable benefit-risk profile and could fundamentally change the way aPAP is treated,\" and that \"initiation of the [MOLBREEVI] BLA is an important milestone in potentially addressing the unmet need in aPAP, for which there are no approved medicines in the U.S. and Europe.\" Moreover, Savara represented that it \"expect[ed] to complete the submission of the rolling [MOLBREEVI] BLA by the end of [the first quarter of] 2025.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To obtain FDA approval of the MOLBREEVI BLA, Savara must submit, among other things, information regarding MOLBREEVI's chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (\"CMC\"). Specifically, the CMC section of a BLA must provide a detailed account of a product's manufacturing process-including process validation runs, stability testing, and analytical method validation-and detailed descriptions of facilities, equipment, and quality control procedures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the MOLBREEVI BLA lacked sufficient information regarding MOLBREEVI's chemistry, manufacturing, and/or controls; (ii) accordingly, the FDA was unlikely to approve the MOLBREEVI BLA in its current form; (iii) the foregoing made it unlikely that Savara would complete its submission of the MOLBREEVI BLA within the timeframe it had represented to investors; (iv) the delay in MOLBREEVI's regulatory approval increased the likelihood that the Company would need to raise additional capital; and (v) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On May 27, 2025, Savara issued a press release \"announcing that the Company received [a refusal to file] letter from the FDA for the [MOLBREEVI BLA] as a therapy to treat patients with [aPap].\" Specifically, Savara revealed that \"[u]pon preliminary review, the FDA determined that the [MOLBREEVI BLA] was not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review and requested additional data related to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC).\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Market analysts were quick to comment on the Company's announcement. For example, on May 27, 2025, Guggenheim published a report (the \"Guggenheim Report\") revising its price target for Savara to $8.00, down from the previous $9.00. Guggenheim stated that it \"do[es] not expect Savara to be profitable on a continuing basis until 2028 and expect[s] the company may raise additional capital, potentially through a secondary stock offering that could dilute the holdings of current investors.\" In addition, the Guggenheim Report noted that the \"CMC Delay Could Lead to Change in Molbreevi Manufacturing Strategy,\" predicting a delayed market launch sometime in early 2027, a year later than initially expected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On this news, Savara's stock price fell $0.90 per share, or 31.69%, to close at $1.94 per share on May 27, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then, after the end of the Class Period, on August 13, 2025, Savara issued a press release announcing the Company's financial results for the second quarter of 2025. Among other things, the press release revealed that, contrary to the Company's prior representations that it would complete its rolling submission of the MOLBREEVI BLA in the first quarter of 2025, Savara now \"plan[s] to resubmit the [MOLBREEVI] BLA in December [2025].\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Weston Blasi</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One sportsbook had 96.7% of World Series bets on the Dodgers to beat the Blue Jays once the matchup was finalized</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most sports bettors want the Dodgers to win the World Series. Sportsbooks are praying for the Blue Jays.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tonight, the Toronto Blue Jays are hoping to win their first MLB World Series since 1993. And U.S. sportsbooks hope that the Blue Jays win, too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's because the Los Angeles Dodgers were heavily favored to beat Toronto in the series. In fact, once this year's World Series matchup was finalized, almost every single bet (96.7%) made on ESPN Bet over which team would win the World Series was made in favor of the Dodgers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The wagers have been driven by the Dodgers' popularity as reigning champions and as home to one of the best players in baseball, Shohei Ohtani. And this type of overwhelming liability could lead to a bad outcome for sports-betting companies if the Blue Jays don't win and the sportsbooks have to pay up - again.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Betting companies are already coming off a football season where FanDuel owner Flutter (FLUT) took a $370 million hit on NFL games after casual bettors benefited from some of the most \"customer-friendly\" betting outcomes that online sportsbooks have ever seen. So while a Toronto win would mean paying out some long-shot futures, it would still be a far better result for the betting operators than another Dodgers victory - which would trigger huge payouts on the most bet-on team all season.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sportsbooks typically favor outcomes that go against the majority of wagers placed on a sporting event, which is why nearly all of them are pulling for the Blue Jays right now.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Before the World Series began, the Blue Jays winning it all was a good outcome for the sportsbook,\" Seamus Magee, trading manager at BetMGM, told MarketWatch in an email.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Dodgers can still give them a run for their money, though. \"Toronto is still the preferred winner, but we wouldn't mind seeing a Game 7,\" Magee added. The series is currently 3-2 in favor of Toronto, and sportsbooks generally prefer longer series because more games equals more bets - and more juice for sportsbooks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, the Blue Jays winning the whole thing would provide a lifeline to betting companies. \"We definitely need the Blue Jays. Toronto winning would be a strong result for us,\" Caesars Sports head of baseball trading Eric Biggio said to Fox. \"If you know of any Blue Jays backers with deep pockets, you can send them our way.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The two most popular individual prop bets on BetMGM for Game 6 on Halloween night are Toronto's Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hitting over 0.5 home runs (+400), and Ohtani hitting over 0.5 home runs (+195). The biggest liability for World Series MVP - as in, the players who sportsbooks least want to see win the award - are Ohtani, Guerrero Jr. and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, in that order.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition to ESPN Bet (DIS), BetMGM (MGM) and Caesars (CZR), other U.S. sportsbooks were also showing an overwhelming amount of bets on the Dodgers heading into Game 6. But it's not just bets that were made in the days leading up to the World Series; fans have been backing the Dodgers all year long.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From the archives: How does a gambling site lose money? DraftKings just lost $250 million in revenue - mostly on NFL games.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Toronto opened the season at +6000 odds to win the World Series before the season (1.6% implied probability of winning), while the Dodgers went into the season at roughly +750 odds. In other words, expectations were low for Toronto heading into the year, and high for the Dodgers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even with those long-shot odds for Toronto, sportsbooks would rather pay out those bets than face the heavy losses that would occur with a Dodgers series win. That's because the Dodgers were the most wagered-on team in terms of total futures bets, and in total money at nearly every major sportsbook.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to betting data from DraftKings (DKNG), at the start of the MLB playoffs, 36% (or over 1 in 3) of all World Series winner bets were made for the Dodgers - more than triple the amount of bets on the next most wagered-on team. The Dodgers also had 22% of all money wagered (otherwise known as handle) to win the World Series.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>More bets were on the Los Angeles Dodgers than any other team to win the 2025 World Series.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's not clear exactly how much sportsbooks would lose if the Dodgers were to win, as the ones mentioned in this story declined to comment on potential loss amounts or betting figures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Several members of the r/BlueJays subreddit have begun sharing that they placed small wagers on their team to win the World Series at long odds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"That $20, +6000 bet I put pre-season on winning the WS is looking a lot more realistic,\" one Reddit user posted before the playoffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I grabbed it at +7500!\" another user wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sportsbooks typically profit from the \"vig,\" their commission on each bet. However, their strategy involves more than just balancing wagers. When a popular team, such as the Dodgers or Yankees, is heavily favored, sportsbooks adjust the odds to encourage betting on the underdog to minimize their risk. Despite this, sometimes bettors still take the favorite - and win.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unfavorable sports-betting outcomes can really hurt sportsbooks' bottom lines. For example, FanDuel, the Flutter Entertainment sportsbook, took a $74 million loss during a regular-season NFL game between the Detroit Lions and San Francisco 49ers, which ended in a 40-34 win for the favored Lions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For sportsbooks, the stakes are high and their rooting interest is clear: They're all in on the Blue Jays.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See: Sportsbooks were called 'victims' in new NBA gambling probe. Here's what DraftKings, FanDuel have to say.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Weston Blasi</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

But those bottom-line figures are always distorted by the current value of Berkshire’s massive investment portfolio and any stock sales, which this year added $17.3 billion to the company’s profits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That’s why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire’s operating earnings to get a sense of how its many operating companies are performing, including well-known insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On that measure, Berkshire’s operating profit jumped to $13.485 billion, or $9376.15 per Class A share, thanks to a strong rebound in its insurance companies. A year ago, Berkshire reported operating earnings of $10.09 billion, or $7,023.01 per Class A share. The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted Berkshire would report operating earnings of $8,573.50 per Class A share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Berkshire said fewer catastrophic losses from hurricanes this year, compared to when Hurricane Helene ravaged the southeast a year ago, helped its insurance underwriting profit jump $1.6 billion to $2.369 billion. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bottom line was also helped by $331 million in gains on debt held in foreign currencies this year, compared to a $1.1 billion loss on those holdings a year ago.

The transitional phase began in 2016, with Boursa Kuwait officially assuming the responsibilities and operations of the Kuwait Stock Exchange, replacing it with an official license in the same year after the successful completion of the transitional phase. This ensured that Boursa Kuwait developed the infrastructure and operated according to best practices and international standards. It commenced the creation of an advanced, reliable trading platform built on efficiency, credibility, and transparency to serve all asset classes with a focus on the interests of traders and the national economy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Boursa Kuwait has undertaken various market reforms as part of its comprehensive plans to enhance it in several stages. It succeeded in introducing innovative investment tools, enhancing transparency, and restructuring the market to increase its liquidity and competitiveness, based on its mission-focused strategy, which emphasizes developing the market to meet international standards. The company's developmental and improvement efforts have also contributed to the reclassification of the Kuwait market as an «emerging market» among key global index providers, enhancing Kuwait's position as a leading regional financial center.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a pioneering step in Kuwait's privatization field, the privatization of Boursa Kuwait was successful, conducted in two stages. The first stage was in February 2019 when a consortium of Kuwaiti investment companies and a global exchange operator won the privatization bid, acquiring a 44% stake in the company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In December 2019, the privatization process was completed through the public offering of a 50% stake owned by the Capital Markets Authority to Kuwaiti citizens, with the offering oversubscribed by more than 850%. Boursa Kuwait is listed on the «Premier Market» under the name «Boursa».</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For further information, please contact:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ahmad Rashed Alowaish</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>PR and Media Manager - Boursa Kuwait</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Email:              aalowaish@boursakuwait.com.kw</span></p><span>Send us your press releases to pressrelease.zawya@lseg.com</span><p class=\"\"><span>Disclaimer: The contents of this press release was provided from an external third party provider.

Last week, Trump threatened to terminate trade negotiations with Canada over the ad, claiming it misrepresents Reagan's comments, and was being used to influence the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of a hearing on the administration's tariffs next month.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>A discussion has surfaced within the crypto community regarding the reasoning behind XRP’s fixed supply of 100 billion tokens. For years, enthusiasts and investors have questioned why Ripple opted for such a large figure when most cryptocurrencies operate with far smaller caps. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, recently addressed the question on the social platform X, shedding light on the considerations that guided the early design of the XRP Ledger.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Technical Foundations Behind XRP’s 100 Billion Supply</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>David Schwartz was one of the original architects behind XRP and the XRP Ledger in 2012, and as such, he possesses unmatched insight into the cryptocurrency’s tokenomics and the rationale that shaped its design. His response to the question regarding XRP’s 100 billion supply design revealed that the decision was rooted in technical precision and deliberate effort to balance the functionality of the token’s architecture.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The first layer of reasoning behind XRP’s supply lies in its technical design. According to Schwartz, the developers of the Ledger sought a number that would provide adequate divisibility for the token. This level of divisibility allows XRP to be functional across both high-value institutional payments and smaller, everyday transactions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Equally important was the need for the total supply to fit cleanly within a 64-bit integer, a standard data type used in computing to store numerical values efficiently. This decision minimizes the risk of overflow errors or arithmetic inconsistencies in the ledger’s codebase. A supply as large as 100 billion allows the system to handle every transaction amount accurately while preserving performance and compatibility with conventional software frameworks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Usability And Design Simplicity</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aside from the technical justifications, the choice of 100 billion was also made with human usability in mind. As noted by Schwartz, the third reason for XRP’s 100 billion circulating supply is that the number is easy for humans to remember. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ripple’s architects wanted a total supply that was easy to communicate, recognize, and remember. A round, memorable number like 100 billion conveys clarity to users and traders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Although XRP has a maximum supply of 100 billion tokens, not every token is currently in circulation. At the time of writing, XRP has a circulating supply of 60.1 billion tokens.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the launch of the Ledger, a total supply of 100 billion XRP was pre-mined and fixed. Of this amount, approximately 55 billion XRP were placed into escrow contracts controlled by Ripple to control how many tokens enter the market over time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the time of writing, about 35 billion XRP tokens are currently locked in escrow and waiting to be released into circulation. Each month, up to 1 billion XRP is released, and any unused portion (about 70% to 80%) is typically placed back into escrow. As part of the schedule, Ripple is going to unlock another 1 billion XRP from escrow on November 1. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.51, up by 0.9% in the past 24 hours.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Crypto isn’t the domain of early adopters and philosophically driven “hodlers” anymore. The demographics of crypto usage are shifting fast, with stablecoins, in particular, leading the charge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Forget about newcomers stacking sats. In Q3 2025, Tether’s USDt </span><span> and Circle’s USDC </span><span> collectively accounted for approximately 40% of the total crypto volume. This gargantuan figure is due, in part, to folks from emerging regions like Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America wanting a better way to move their money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Their reasons for diving into crypto are practical and straightforward. If crypto tech wants to meet them where they’re at, its products must evolve to meet these changing needs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The need for practicality drives adoption</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Not so long ago, getting into crypto meant buying Bitcoin </span><span>, maybe reading a white paper or two, and finding out — sometimes, the hard way — about seed phrases, personal wallets and the perils of self-custody.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Today, most people outside the crypto enthusiast circles aren’t thinking about ideological freedom or permissionless money. They’re thinking about needs. The drive for practicality is everywhere.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2025, retail-sized transfers below $250 increased in volume, showing growth in everyday, small-value payments (exactly the kind needed for groceries, bills or tuition at home). </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stablecoins are dominating this pattern, becoming the first crypto asset many people encounter, especially in places where banks are slow, expensive or unreliable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Philippines ranks among the globe’s biggest recipients of remittances. Citizens need to send money across borders cheaply, quickly and without banking hurdles. Stablecoins solve that problem.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Centralized exchanges and peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms are now experiencing a surge in traffic from users who value cryptocurrency for its utility rather than ideological reasons. It’s not just anecdotal: Chainalysis’ 2025 Global Adoption Index shows that India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Brazil and the Philippines are leading in grassroots crypto activity, much of which is routed through non-volatile assets, like stablecoins.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to the World Economic Forum, the average stablecoin transfer in emerging markets ranges from $100 to $500. Cross-border remittances make up a multibillion-dollar portion of the crypto ecosystem annually.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto adoption among Filipinos, in particular, has increased to 22.5%, up from 17.8% last year, primarily driven by play-to-earn gaming and remittance needs. Other fast-growing markets, including Nigeria and Vietnam, are also experiencing similar trends. Practicality and necessity are driving people to crypto, rather than the prospect of freedom, money or other philosophical motivations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>New users need a new kind of security</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is, however, a tradeoff lurking in the wings. New users primarily care about utility — specifically, sending and receiving funds — and often skip deeper crypto fundamentals, such as private keys, seed phrases and self-custody. They’re far more likely to rely on wallets provided by exchanges or custodians. While these solutions may be more straightforward and familiar, they run counter to the original ethos of crypto: not your keys, not your coins.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It’s not just about ease of use; it’s about risk and responsibility. The narrative of “lose your seed phrase, lose your crypto” is a nonstarter for someone wiring $60 for groceries. If self-custody means risking the loss of essential household funds due to a forgotten sequence of words, adoption slows and trust erodes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For businesses and platforms, the lesson is clear: If most new users lack the desire or time to master seed phrases and backup protocols, crypto security needs to be built natively into the product, not bolted on as an afterthought.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Innovators are already on the case. Companies are experimenting with abstracting away seed phrases, using multi-layered account recovery, trusted contacts or even hardware integrations to safeguard assets without exposing users to the complexities of cryptocurrency’s cryptography.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Security is evolving from a test of technical knowledge and mental tenacity to a transparent background feature.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Abstracting away complexity is key to the next wave of adoption</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>This new wave of crypto users isn’t waiting for the perfect UX. They’re already using stablecoins for real-world utility, whether they realize the blockchain rails are underneath them or not. Many Filipinos are already engaging in P2P cash exchanges to convert their digital assets back into fiat currency.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto’s convenience and speed are embedded in the daily lives of millions, enabling them to send money, make purchases on Facebook Marketplace, settle family bills and manage side hustles in gaming economies.​</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto technology’s next big win won’t be about championing ideological arguments; it will be about quietly powering global money movement and commerce, native in everyday apps, as frictionless as sending a WhatsApp message.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some of the world’s largest businesses, from remittance processors to mobile money providers, are integrating blockchain rails, creating experiences where users never see a wallet address or a blockchain explorer but instead enjoy faster settlement and lower fees.​</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Built-in security is a must</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>What does this mean for teams building crypto solutions? Firstly, products must make security seamless and not a burden for the user to bear. Custodial wallets, social recovery, multifactor authentication and even regulated, insured custody options are all part of the toolkit. If cryptocurrency aspires to mainstream adoption and financial inclusion, it must recognize the needs and risk tolerance of its users. It must deliver best-in-class UX, clear safeguards and effective recovery options.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Secondly, it means welcoming a new global crypto population: not just the cypherpunks and maximalists, but people who rely on utility, trust and practical empowerment. The cryptocurrency industry is poised for a much broader transformation. Blockchain is the rails, but onboarding is effortless, security is built-in, and mass adoption doesn’t require everyone to be their own bank.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With USDT and USDC now accounting for 40% of global crypto trading volume, and more than 161 million people holding stablecoins, the asset class is larger than the population of the world’s 10 biggest cities combined.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The fastest-growing crypto economies aren’t coming for philosophy. They want solvency, convenience and freedom from legacy banking.​ </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto’s future depends on recognizing the changing face of adoption. We must build technologies that serve this new reality.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Opinion by: Louise Ivan, co-founder and CEO of Ryder.</span></strong></em></p><p class=\"\"><span>This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
