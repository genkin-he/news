Despite the dip, charts suggest both tokens are merely consolidating, with their long-term bullishness still firmly intact.  For investors seeking early opportunities, the best crypto presales like $BEST, $PEPENODE, and $RTX could offer explosive growth. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The sell-off triggered by the latest Federal Reserve rate cut – primarily due to Powell remarking that a December rate cut is far from likely – has now well and truly seeped into hype-driven tokens, which are often the biggest losers whenever such a sell-off happens.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The most notable ones are Pump.fun ($PUMP) and Virtuals Protocol ($VIRTUAL). Pump.fun, for instance, has lost nearly 20% in the last 48 hours alone, whereas Virtuals Protocol is down 15% since its latest swing high of around $1.68.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It’s worth noting that these are not isolated instances. Even the biggest meme coins in the industry, like $PENGU, $SPX, and $APE, have each lost between 10-15% in just the last week, hinting at a broader, industry-wide downturn. But before you spiral downward and sell all of your crypto holdings, it’s worth taking a good, long look at the charts, which suggest that the current downturn is most likely just a pause before the longer-term bullish momentum resumes. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>$PUMP, for instance, is currently retesting the $0.0044 level, which it broke out from after overcoming resistance around the same zone with a 55% rally just a couple of weeks ago.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:825.147347740668px;aspect-ratio:1.37524557956778\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:1b9baf0bd094b-52ebb93304a9398ab1f2d09354226ef3-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"$PUMP daily chart on TradingView.\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:1b9baf0bd094b-52ebb93304a9398ab1f2d09354226ef3-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f7f8f8\"/></picture></div></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>$VIRTUAL, on the other hand, looks even more positive.

So, how do you go about building a crypto portfolio in such a market? The obvious answer is the best crypto presales. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These are low-cap tokens, meaning they’re still under the radar and carry a lot of explosive potential.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Plus, they’re currently in ‘pre’-sale, meaning they’re not yet listed on exchanges, which gives them the unique ability to ward off noise from current market conditions while also positioning you ahead of the next big wave.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here are our top three suggestions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Viral Presale Token Powering the Best Wallet Ecosystem</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Best Wallet Token ($BEST)</span></strong><span> has the potential to revolutionize how people buy into crypto presales. Right now, </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Best Wallet</span></strong><span> is the only crypto wallet that lets you purchase new projects directly within the app.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other wallets, by contrast, require you to visit external presale websites, connect your wallet there, and then return to authorize the transaction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Best Wallet’s ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section lists all these early-stage moonshot opportunities in one place, saving you the trouble of digging around to find the best investment options. Even better, the internal Best Wallet team vets every single new meme coin before making it available for purchase, adding a crucial extra layer of security that can save you from rug pulls and phishing websites. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Speaking of security, Best Wallet uses state-of-the-art encryption technology and robust two-factor authentication, including biometric login.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It’s also a completely non-custodial crypto wallet, meaning only you have access to your private keys.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1141.304347826087px;aspect-ratio:1.9021739130434783\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:1b9baf0bd094b-0491219072a8e383c843e4aa015d360a-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"Best Wallet key features.\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:1b9baf0bd094b-0491219072a8e383c843e4aa015d360a-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#c9e0f1\"/></picture></div></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On top of that, you have the option to set up multiple Ethereum wallets, giving you the freedom to organize your crypto endeavors however you like – perhaps one wallet for HODLing, one for staking, and another for active trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to Best Wallet’s roadmap, it aims to capture 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That’s why buying $BEST, which has already pulled in over $16.75M in its ongoing presale, could be a smart move.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Also, based on our $BEST price prediction, it could soar 170% by the end of 2030, reaching a potential high of $0.07.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ride Best Wallet’s growth – buy $BEST today for just $0.025875.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Making Crypto Mining More Accessible &amp; Fun</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Right now, crypto mining is not only largely inaccessible to the general public due to its high costs and technical know-how, but it’s also extremely boring because of its tedious and repetitive nature.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That needs to change, and </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>PEPENODE ($PEPENODE)</span></strong><span> is bringing that change by offering a never-before-seen gamified virtual crypto mining ecosystem that removes the barriers currently surrounding crypto mining while also offering lucrative rewards in return.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When you become a $PEPENODE holder, you get access to an empty virtual server room. The next step is to go shopping and grab some meme nodes, and this is where things get exciting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Every node is unique in terms of its characteristics, mining quality, and compatibility with other nodes, meaning you’ll need to experiment and fine-tune to build the perfect mining setup for yourself.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:948.0812641083521px;aspect-ratio:1.5801354401805867\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:1b9baf0bd094b-679a22c370ab161144bcafb1ecfdbe14-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"How PEPENODE works.\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:1b9baf0bd094b-679a22c370ab161144bcafb1ecfdbe14-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#2d3025\"/></picture></div></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Furthermore, PEPENODE ranks its miners on a leaderboard, which ultimately determines the rewards they receive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These rewards include free $PEPENODE, $PEPE, and $FARTCOIN tokens, all of which are strong and explosive meme coins in their own right.

Remittix ($RTX) – Unique PayFi Solution Bridging Crypto and Fiat</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>There’s a reason Remittix ($RTX) has been able to attract over $27.76M from investors in its ongoing presale.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After all, its mission is to transform the cross-border payments market by creating the perfect synergy between cryptocurrency and fiat.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Remittix allows you to send crypto directly to fiat-based bank accounts around the world. The receiving party gets the funds in fiat currency, completely unaware that the transaction originated as crypto.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By doing so, Remittix hits two targets with one arrow. It lets the receiver, who might be in a crypto-unfriendly region, safely receive fiat currency, while allowing the sender to comfortably pay using cryptocurrency.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On top of that, Remittix charges zero forex fees and offers same-day transaction processing, solving two of the biggest issues that plague the current banking system.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Buy $RTX today for just $0.1166 – and be part of a game-changing new cryptocurrency project.</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Recap</span></strong><span>: With hype-driven tokens proving remarkably resilient amid a broader market downturn, the future for emerging low-cap presale gems like </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Best Wallet Token ($BEST)</span></strong><span>, </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>PEPENODE ($PEPENODE)</span></strong><span>, and Remittix ($RTX) look overarchingly bright. </span></p><p class=\"\"><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: Invest in crypto only after doing your own research.

By contrast, Google Cloud lost billions between 2018 and 2022 due to heavy investments in servers, datacenters and chips until it turned its first profit in 2023.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Now, with generative AI, Alphabet sees a chance to close the gap with rivals Microsoft </span><span> and Amazon </span><span>, which hold 20% and 30% market share respectively.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Making Google Cloud a contender has come at a cost: Alphabet has already shocked Wall Street twice during quarterly earnings this year by proclaiming higher-than-expected capital spending due to the need to build more infrastructure to fulfill cloud demand.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    “This is the moment Google Cloud was waiting for,” Dave McCarthy, who directs coverage of the cloud industry for research firm IDC. “A lot of the future growth at Alphabet is being looked at through its potential.”  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    In exclusive interviews with Reuters, senior Alphabet executives mapped out the gameplan that transformed the also-ran into a growth driver: a cultural shift to a more customer-driven sales approach; changing how it worked with rivals; and a renewed focus on delivering profits.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    ‘GET OUT OF HERE, KID’  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Back when Kurian joined Alphabet, Google Cloud struggled to win enterprise customers, unlike the ads side of the business which was dealing with the biggest companies in the world.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    “We would go to the ads team asking, ‘Hey, can you help us out with this customer?’ And they would basically be like, ‘Get out of here, kid,’” said Josh Gwyther, a startup founder who worked at Google Cloud from 2016 to 2025.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    That’s not a problem anymore: Google’s scope of AI offerings have brought it into conversations with large companies that previously only considered Amazon and Microsoft.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    “The ads business is extremely healthy, but it’s not going to grow at the pace that we are,” said Matt Renner, Google Cloud’s president of global revenue.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Nine of the 10 leading AI labs are now customers, Kurian said at an industry conference in September. They include OpenAI, Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence. Details of Google’s deals with two of those labs were     first reported by Reuters     earlier this year.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    To get there, Kurian took a mallet to traditional practices, replacing it with what several employees called an “un-Googley” culture.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kurian, who left a job as one of Larry Ellison’s highest-paid lieutenants at Oracle </span><span>, brought financial discipline to Google’s “loosely-run, ground-up culture” that encouraged side projects and experimentation, said Chirag Mehta, a tech analyst who worked at Google Cloud from 2017 to 2021.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    To slash costs, Kurian opened new offices in cheaper locations, such as North Carolina and Poland. He audited Google Cloud’s contracts for internal services and renegotiated those where he deemed his unit was being overcharged by other departments, as was     first reported in The Information    .  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    He has ordered employees to focus on revenue rather than bookings. Google Cloud also shifted its sales strategy to target customers by sector rather than geography. That helped reduce sales reps being assigned accounts in industries where they lacked specialized knowledge, said Renner.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Its focus on generative AI has allowed it to catch up with rivals Microsoft and Amazon from a technical standpoint, according to some analysts.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    “We believe that the three clouds competitively are on roughly equal footing,” said Goldman Sachs managing director Eric Sheridan. “That’s a very different competitive positioning for Google Cloud now than two or three years ago.”  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    WORKING WITH THE ENEMY  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    For years, Alphabet had reserved the lion’s share of its own chips, or TPUs, for in-house use only. That changed in 2022, when Kurian successfully lobbied to move the group selling TPUs from Google’s core engineering unit into Google Cloud.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    That move drastically increased Google Cloud's allocation of TPUs because the unit could now freely offer the chips rather than having to receive approval from another part of the company, according to two people familiar with the move.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    A    t a time when the world was scrambling for compute, Alphabet made the decision to make its chips available to not just its own DeepMind AI unit, but also to its competitors.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That decision stoked tensions internally, according to former employees of both units, but it gave Kurian a stronger sales pitch for courting customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“We are the only hyperscaler with both silicon and models of our own,” he said. “How deep is your technical differentiation when the same stuff that you’re reselling can be bought from somebody else?”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Google Cloud quickly leveraged the opportunity to petition Anthropic to test TPUs as a viable alternative to Nvidia’s </span><span> GPUs, according to a former Google Cloud executive involved in the partnership.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By 2024, Anthropic had seen enough to deploy Alphabet’s TPUs at scale. In October, it expanded its deal with Google to use as many as one million TPUs, worth tens of billions of dollars. The startup, which is now valued at $183 billion, has also tapped Amazon for chips as it reduces its dependency on Nvidia, which controls about 80% of the AI chip market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    “The whole world was sort of on GPUs, OpenAI in particular,” said Dan Rosenthal, who manages Anthropic’s partnerships with Google and Amazon. The need for chips “pushed us to be more flexible,” he said.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other AI developers including Apple </span><span> and Safe Superintelligence have since adopted Alphabet's TPUs. Pichai told analysts on an earnings conference call this week that Alphabet is \"investing in TPU capacity to meet the tremendous demand we are seeing from customers and partners.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And although Google Cloud launched an enterprise version of its flagship model Gemini in October, Kurian told Reuters he would welcome adding OpenAI’s family of enterprise models to Google Cloud if the ChatGPT maker was interested.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    POWER SHIFT  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    The ascent of Google Cloud is shifting the balance of power inside Alphabet. Current and former executives told Reuters Kurian has gained clout at Google’s weekly “leads,” the agenda-setting meetings where division leaders jostle over resources and priorities.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    “What Thomas has been a powerful voice for is making sure that when we say we’re focusing on the user, that we’re focusing on the enterprise customer too,” Pichai said.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It still has a long way to catch up with its rivals and it will be expensive to get there. In July, Pichai hiked Alphabet’s projected capital spending for 2025 by $10 billion to $85 billion. This week, he raised the projection again to between $91 billion and $93 billion, adding that 2026 was likely to run an even larger bill.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    With concerns over an AI bubble growing, Pichai told Reuters that he expects Google Cloud’s business to have “a lot of resilience” against short-term market corrections. “From our standpoint, we've been doing the AI thing for a decade now, and we're going to be doing it a decade from now.”  </span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Mark Maurer</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Companies are increasingly relying on generative AI to help draft their financial reports, aiming to save time and money, but also raising questions on trust and transparency in executives' efforts to communicate with their investors and regulators.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ON Semiconductor, a maker of chip components, has ramped up its use of AI to compile a draft of its financials over the past year, especially in sections that aren't number-heavy, CFO Thad Trent said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI is \"getting better and better\" at writing the management discussion and analysis section, with ever less editing from the company's regulatory-reporting manager, Trent said. Previously, the company would ask AI to write one paragraph in a particular section. \"Now, we're getting to the point of: Write the whole section for me,\" Trent said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The efforts are the latest sign of finance executives' growing ease with AI for public-facing work that was long handled solely by humans. Companies are already using AI to prepare for questions that analysts might ask on earnings calls.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financial reports are a crucial proving ground for AI. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires all U.S. public companies to file them quarterly and annually, including a balance sheet, income statement and management discussion and analysis. Investors rely on the filings to inform their decisions, and false or misleading statements can create both civil and criminal liability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'Much better than humans'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Besides providing text for financial reports, AI is also seeping into the number-compilation effort. In particular, it's become helpful in tracking down information for journal entries, such as accruals for revenue and expenses, that are eventually tallied up on the balance sheet, ON Semiconductor's Trent said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI's assistance in financial reporting has helped the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based company reduce the time between closing the books and reporting quarterly results to roughly eight days from 10, with plans to pare that to six in the next year, Trent said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's doing it much more efficiently across the entire financial reporting cycle than what we've done in the past,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another company, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which has used its large language model for earnings-day prep, is getting ready to use it to formally produce a first draft of financial statements, possibly for the quarter ending in January, said Chief Financial Officer Marie Myers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Myers aspires to have both the financial and non-financial parts of the company's SEC filings written by AI at some point, she said, with people continuing to vet the work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You want to pick up everything that's in your current earnings and make sure it's all well reflected, and that's what the AI is good at,\" Myers said, referring to AI's ability to mirror and aggregate data. \"It's much better than humans at doing that.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Spring, Texas-based enterprise-tech company currently uses an AI platform it co-developed to help its investor-relations team not only predict the questions analysts might lob on earnings day, but analyze their executive's response for tone and delivery, Myers said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI's role in the accounting that details a company's financial position and performance in an SEC filing is minimal right now — but likely to grow, corporate advisers say.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Companies sometimes ask AI to calculate a journal entry to address a particular accounting issue, for instance, creating a sales reserve in compliance with French accounting rules, said Ash Mehta, a senior director analyst at Gartner. The finance team then checks if the suggestion would work — but AI generally isn't posting an accounting entry to the books, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At present, people are said to be \"in the loop\" on AI, keeping a close eye on it. But, Mehta said, \"There is this idea that's emerging of humans 'on the loop,' which basically means AI operates autonomously and humans step in only to check exceptions or override certain decisions.\" He added, \"This is a little while away from becoming commonplace.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For now, executives seem to be approaching gingerly. In an impromptu survey in April, 28% of attendees at a Financial Executives International event said they use generative AI to help prepare external reporting, such as 10-Ks, compared with 16% who said they use it extensively and 57% not at all.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Others express greater confidence in the technology. At the beginning of the year, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon commented that 95% of an S1 filing, which a company submits to the SEC before going public, could be completed by AI in a few minutes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Expanding uses, possible flaws</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>New tasks for AI in assembling financial reports are being found, but there could be drawbacks, some of them subtle. For one: Its robotic voice could change the tenor of how companies communicate with the public. Indeed, there is a risk that trust between management and investors could erode over time, said Keren Bar-Hava, head of the accounting department at the Hebrew University Business School.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If disclosures begin to feel formulaic or emotionally empty, investors may disengage — not because they don't care, but because they no longer believe management disclosures tell them anything real,\" Bar-Hava said. \"The danger is when AI replaces critical thinking and honest managerial voice.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The new uses come as President Trump has called for an end to quarterly reports, saying that reporting every six months instead would save companies time and money. Last month, SEC Chair Paul Atkins said he supports proposing a rule change to do so, though the agency hasn't put one forward yet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Any shift away from quarterly reporting could further spur companies to replace finance people with AI to help save money, said John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The accounting firms tasked with auditing companies' financials are also stepping up their use of the AI in that work. But, Coffee warned, \"AI is not foolproof and they don't have the same depth of knowledge at least initially as the Big Four.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Public companies are expected to disclose the use of AI when it is material to their business — but aren't specifically required to tell whether or how the technology assisted in compiling financial reports.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, companies could burnish their services to investors if AI freed up time for companies to issue custom financial reports intended for different types of shareholders in the next several years, said Dilshoda Yergasheva, head of financial services at Writer, an enterprise AI startup.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Imagine you have to do a hundred or a thousand different versions to meet your shareholders where they are. But with AI, I can see it being done,\" Yergasheva said. \"A new way of reaching your shareholders could be how it's done in the future.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
