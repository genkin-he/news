Hires will be stationed in Washington, D.C., for up to one year, according to the website.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Trump administration launched the site to recruit \"highly qualified and specifically trained individuals,\" said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since June, the administration has deployed National Guard troops to various Democratic-led jurisdictions, including Los Angeles and Memphis as well as Washington, in an extraordinary expansion of the use of the military for domestic purposes. The deployments aimed to quell what Trump said were high levels of crime.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump this month declared victory over what he called a \"crisis\" of crime in Washington. A Reuters review of public safety records suggested that it was too early, however, to draw any sweeping conclusions about the effects of the deployments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The new website links to the federal government's jobs board, which includes an advertisement for police officers to join the U.S. Park Police, the law enforcement arm of the National Park Service. Applications opened on September 29, according to the ad.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Trump administration is looking for police officers to guard \"National Park Service icons and symbols of democracy,\" the posting said, adding that officers will be required to maintain firearms proficiency. New hires may be eligible for a bonus of up to $70,000 over four years.</span></p></span></div></div>",

RILAs, which offer tax-deferred growth, have benefited from double-digit growth in equity markets this year and the easing of volatility in the third quarter, according to Keith Golembiewski, assistant vice president and director of annuity research at Limra.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is a perfect environment for RILAs, which offer protected growth with attractive caps and participation rates aligned with equity market returns,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fixed-index annuities, which are structured similarly to RILAs but offer more downside risk protection, saw sales of $33.2 billion in the third quarter, sliding 6% from last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sales of traditional variable annuities checked in at $16.7 billion in the third quarter, up 11% from last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fixed-rate deferred annuities were once again the most popular product category, posting third-quarter sales of $41.7 billion, up 3% from 2024. Those products have an interest rate that is set for a duration, after which the insurer can offer a new rate that is often subject to a minimum level. When the annuity reaches the withdrawal stage, investors receive regular payments from the insurer for a certain period or the rest of their lives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lower interest rates could weigh on demand for FRDs, but they typically offer better returns than CDs and \"have become an attractive, short-term solution for [risk-averse] investors and their advisors looking for protected investment growth,\" Golembiewski says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to advisor.editors@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
