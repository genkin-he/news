(GEL) filed a Form 8K - Operations and Financial Condition - with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission on October 30, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We issued a press release on October 30, 2025 regarding our financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, and will hold a webcast conference call discussing those results on October 30, 2025 at 9:00 a.m. Central time (10:00 a.m. Eastern time). A copy of this earnings press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. The webcast conference call will be available for replay on our website at www.genesisenergy.com for 30 days. A summary of this conference call is archived on our website.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As provided in General Instruction B.2 to Form 8-K, the information furnished in this Item 2.02 and in Exhibit 99.1 hereto shall not be deemed \"filed\" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, except as shall be expressly provided by specific reference in such filing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Overview</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This press release and the accompanying schedules include non-generally accepted accounting principle (non-GAAP) financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and total Available Cash before Reserves. In this press release, we also present total Segment Margin as if it were a non-GAAP measure. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because such measures may include or exclude other specified items. The accompanying schedules provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered (i) as alternatives to GAAP measures of liquidity or financial performance or (ii) as being singularly important in any particular context; they should be considered in a broad context with other quantitative and qualitative information. Our Available Cash before Reserves, Adjusted EBITDA and total Segment Margin measures are just three of the relevant data points considered from time to time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When evaluating our performance and making decisions regarding our future direction and actions (including making discretionary payments, such as quarterly distributions) our board of directors and management team have access to a wide range of historical and forecasted qualitative and quantitative information, such as our financial statements; operational information; various non-GAAP measures; internal forecasts; credit metrics; analyst opinions; performance; liquidity and similar measures; income; cash flow expectations for us; and certain information regarding some of our peers. Additionally, our board of directors and management team analyze, and place different weight on, various factors from time to time. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management, lenders, analysts and other market participants. We attempt to provide adequate information to allow each individual investor and other external user to reach her/his own conclusions regarding our actions without providing so much information as to overwhelm or confuse such investor or other external user.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Available Cash before Reserves</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Purposes, Uses and Definition</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Available Cash before Reserves, often referred to by others as distributable cash flow, is a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships and is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and rating agencies, to aid in assessing, among other things:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(1)the financial performance of our assets;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(2)our operating performance;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(3)the viability of potential projects, including our cash and overall return on alternative capital investments as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(4)the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to satisfy certain non-discretionary cash requirements, including interest payments and certain maintenance capital requirements; and</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(5)our ability to make certain discretionary payments, such as distributions on our preferred and common units, growth capital expenditures, certain maintenance capital expenditures and early payments of indebtedness.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We define Available Cash before Reserves (\"Available Cash before Reserves\") as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for certain items, the most significant of which in the relevant reporting periods have been the sum of maintenance capital utilized, interest expense, net, cash tax expense and cash distributions paid to our Class A Convertible Preferred unitholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Disclosure Format Relating to Maintenance Capital</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We use a modified format relating to maintenance capital requirements because our maintenance capital expenditures vary materially in nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and amount from time to time. We believe that, without such modified disclosure, such changes in our maintenance capital expenditures could be confusing and potentially misleading to users of our financial information, particularly in the context of the nature and purposes of our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Our modified disclosure format provides those users with information in the form of our maintenance capital utilized measure (which we deduct to arrive at Available Cash before Reserves). Our maintenance capital utilized measure constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary maintenance capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures, operating expenses and depreciation from period to period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Maintenance Capital Requirements</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Maintenance Capital Expenditures</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Maintenance capital expenditures are capitalized costs that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets, including the replacement of any system component or equipment which is worn out or obsolete. Maintenance capital expenditures can be discretionary or non-discretionary, depending on the facts and circumstances.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Prior to 2014, substantially all of our maintenance capital expenditures were (a) related to our pipeline assets and similar infrastructure, (b) non-discretionary in nature and (c) immaterial in amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Those historical expenditures were non-discretionary (or mandatory) in nature because we had very little (if any) discretion as to whether or when we incurred them. We had to incur them in order to continue to operate the related pipelines in a safe and reliable manner and consistently with past practices. If we had not made those expenditures, we would not have been able to continue to operate all or portions of those pipelines, which would not have been economically feasible. An example of a non-discretionary (or mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing a segment of an old pipeline because one can no longer operate that pipeline safely, legally and/or economically in the absence of such replacement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beginning with 2014, we believe a substantial amount of our maintenance capital expenditures from time to time will be (a) related to our assets other than pipelines, such as our marine vessels, trucks and similar assets, (b) discretionary in nature and (c) potentially material in amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Those expenditures will be discretionary (or non-mandatory) in nature because we will have significant discretion as to whether or when we incur them. We will not be forced to incur them in order to continue to operate the related assets in a safe and reliable manner. If we chose not to make those expenditures, we would be able to continue to operate those assets economically, although in lieu of maintenance capital expenditures, we would incur increased operating expenses, including maintenance expenses. An example of a discretionary (or non-mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing an older marine vessel with a new marine vessel with substantially similar specifications, even though one could continue to economically operate the older vessel in spite of its increasing maintenance and other operating expenses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In summary, as we continue to expand certain non-pipeline portions of our business, we are experiencing changes in the nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and amount of our maintenance capital expenditures that merit a more detailed review and analysis than was required historically. Management's increasing ability to determine if and when to incur certain maintenance capital expenditures is relevant to the manner in which we analyze aspects of our business relating to discretionary and non-discretionary expenditures. We believe it would be inappropriate to derive our Available Cash before Reserves measure by deducting discretionary maintenance capital expenditures, which we believe are similar in nature in this context to certain other discretionary expenditures, such as growth capital expenditures, distributions/dividends and equity buybacks. Unfortunately, not all maintenance capital expenditures are clearly discretionary or non-discretionary in nature. Therefore, we developed a measure, maintenance capital utilized, that we believe is more useful in the determination of Available Cash before Reserves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Maintenance Capital Utilized We believe our maintenance capital utilized measure is the most useful quarterly maintenance capital requirements measure to use to derive our Available Cash before Reserves measure. We define our maintenance capital utilized measure as that portion of the amount of previously incurred maintenance capital expenditures that we utilize during the relevant quarter, which would be equal to the sum of the maintenance capital expenditures we have incurred for each project/component in prior quarters allocated ratably over the useful lives of those projects/components.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our maintenance capital utilized measure constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary maintenance capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures, operating expenses and depreciation from period to period. Because we did not use our maintenance capital utilized measure before 2014, our maintenance capital utilized calculations will reflect the utilization of solely those maintenance capital expenditures incurred since December 31, 2013.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Purposes, Uses and Definition</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and rating agencies, to aid in assessing, among other things:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(1)the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structures or historical cost basis;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(2)our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry, without regard to financing and capital structure;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(3)the viability of potential projects, including our cash and overall return on alternative capital investments as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(4)the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to satisfy certain non-discretionary cash requirements, including interest payments and certain maintenance capital requirements; and</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(5)our ability to make certain discretionary payments, such as distributions on our preferred and common units, growth capital expenditures, certain maintenance capital expenditures and early payments of indebtedness.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We define Adjusted EBITDA (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") as Net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (including impairment, write-offs, accretion and similar items) after eliminating other non-cash revenues, expenses, gains, losses and charges (including any loss on asset dispositions), plus or minus certain other select items that we view as not indicative of our core operating results (collectively, \"Select Items\"). Although we do not necessarily consider all of our Select Items to be non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, we believe that an understanding of these Select Items is important to the evaluation of our core operating results.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><span>RNS Number : 5396F  Unilever PLC  30 October 2025   </span><p class=\"\"><span>Unilever PLC</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Statement regarding AGM Vote on Directors' Remuneration Report</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As announced following the Annual General Meeting (\"AGM\") held on 30 April 2025, 72.29% of votes were cast in favour of the resolution to receive and adopt the Directors' Remuneration Report (Resolution 2).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the Board was pleased that the resolution received majority support, Unilever PLC (the \"Company\") recognises the importance of understanding the reasons behind votes against. Following the AGM, the Company contacted its largest shareholders - representing 46.3% of the share register - as well as other shareholders that voted against the Directors' Remuneration Report and several proxy agencies. In total, we held 22 meetings to gain deeper insight into shareholder views and concerns regarding Directors' remuneration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shareholders who opposed the Directors' Remuneration Report consistently cited two key concerns. Firstly, the disapplication of time pro-ration on three outstanding long-term incentive awards for the former CEO, Alan Jope, and the former CFO, Graeme Pitkethly, who retired from the Company in 2022 and 2023 respectively. Secondly, the approach taken to setting fixed pay for Fernando Fernandez on his appointment as CEO.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company acknowledges that the disapplication of time pro-ration on three awards for the former CEO and former CFO were exceptional decisions taken in order to mitigate the impact of the disruption to the business at a time of significant change and uncertainty. The Company has publicly confirmed that it will apply time pro-ration to outstanding awards for future Director exits, in accordance with market practice and the remuneration policy. This was demonstrated by the recent treatment of outstanding long-term incentive awards for the former CEO, Hein Schumacher, where time pro-ration was applied to all unvested awards when Hein left the Company in March 2025. In dialogue with shareholders and proxies, it has been understood and recognised that the non-pro-ration of awards to former Directors is a legacy decision and not an ongoing issue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the approach to setting pay on appointment, the Company understands that some shareholders prefer to see phased progression over time as opposed to a more significant salary uplift from the outset. The Board took this feedback into account when determining fixed pay for Srinivas Phatak on his appointment as CFO in September 2025. His salary has been set at a lower level than the previous CFO's salary, and the Company intends to gradually move pay to the appropriate position relative to the market over the next 2-3 years, subject to performance and the wider external and internal context.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We would like to thank all of the shareholders and proxy agencies who spent time engaging with us recently and those who continue to engage with us over the coming months. The Company will continue to meet with shareholders regularly on remuneration related matters and their perspectives are critical inputs into the Board's discussions and decision making.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company is publishing this statement as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code in response to the votes received against the Directors' Remuneration Report resolution at its AGM held on 30 April 2025. A final summary will be provided in the Company's next Annual Report and Accounts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-End-</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For further information, please contact:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investor Relations: Investor.Relations@unilever.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unilever Press Office: Press-Office.London@unilever.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cautionary Statement</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This announcement may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws of certain jurisdictions, including 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

ChatGPT maker OpenAI said on Tuesday that it would buy an additional $250 billion of storage and related services from Microsoft as part of a broader restructuring in their relationship.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are reasons to worry about Microsoft's machine-learning outlays. Capital expenditures during the third quarter swelled 30% to $19 billion, a figure that understates the total because many data centers depend on long-term leases.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><span>Swedavia AB</span><p class=\"\"><span>Swedavia continued to report a positive profit before tax, improved operating profit and stronger net revenue during the third quarter. The quarter was characterised by increased demand for air travel both domestically and internationally, as well as increased commercial revenue.</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span> </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>“The increase in both international and domestic travel continued during the third quarter. Together with adjusted charges and increased revenue from commercial operations, this contributed to an improvement in net revenue of SEK 102 million compared with the same period last year. The increase in passenger volume resulted in higher costs, but overall operating profit also improved and amounted to SEK 249 million,” says </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Jonas Abrahamsson</span></strong><span>, President and CEO.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the third quarter of the year, almost ten million passengers travelled via Swedavia’s ten airports, which is an increase of just over three per cent compared with 2024. Demand for international travel remains positive and increased by over three per cent during the quarter. Domestic travel increased by almost four per cent during the quarter compared with the same period last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Third quarter in numbers</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net revenue for the third quarter was SEK 1,800 million (1,698), which is an increase of SEK 102 million compared with the corresponding period of 2024. Operating income improved further to SEK 249 million, which is SEK 20 million better than last year. Cash flow from operating activities improved by SEK 143 million compared with last year and amounted to SEK 568 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the third quarter, Swedavia again reported a profit before tax of SEK 170 million, which is on a par with the third quarter of last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Operational delivery for the quarter has been very good at Swedavia’s ten airports. After the first three quarters of the year, Stockholm Arlanda Airport currently ranks as Europe’s most punctual major airport, according to Eurocontrol. This measurement relates to the first nine months of the year and represents a clear improvement compared with the corresponding period in 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In September, Arlanda’s Marketplace was named “Commercial Space of the Year” at the prestigious NCSC (Nordic Commercial Spaces &amp; Communities) Nordic Awards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The airports’ commercial spaces have been contracted out through competitive tenders, significantly improving commercial revenue per passenger. This revenue is an important part of Swedavia’s business model and makes a significant contribution to Swedavia’s ability to offer competitive airport charges.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The development of the Arlanda of the future continues. The Passenger boarding bridges and stands project is progressing according to plan. This is an important part of ensuring a continued high level of operational capability and a smooth passenger experience.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Norwegian is continuing its ongoing expansion and Ryanair has also announced new investments at Swediavia’s airports in general and Arlanda in particular. Several other airlines are also growing by double-digit percentages at Arlanda right now. Both the abolition of the aviation tax and Swedavia’s earlier investments to further improve the competitiveness of our airports have contributed to this development. At the same time, connectivity in the form of direct intercontinental connections in particular requires further improvement. The change in strategy of SAS, moving its long-haul routes to Copenhagen, increases the need to attract incoming airlines to Arlanda. Swedavia’s competitive charges and a strong corporate market provide good conditions for the company. Together with the business community and politicians, challenges in the form of the weaker domestic market, insufficient aircraft capacity globally and inadequate efforts to proactively market Sweden as a tourist destination are being actively addressed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The consultation period for the government’s infrastructure review in relation to Arlanda recently ended. Swedavia looks forward to seeing some concrete decisions and activities. At the same time, a review is under way of the future shape of Sweden’s national basic infrastructure. From this perspective, it is important to achieve as broad a political consensus as possible. Like the energy industry, the transport industry is reliant on having stable and predictable conditions. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Swedavia AB (publ) is required to disclose the information in this Interim Report under the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Securities Market Act.
