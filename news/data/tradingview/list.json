It also removed its Chinese CEO, citing concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia's move came after the Dutch chipmaker's Chinese unit resumed supplying semiconductors to local customers but stipulated that all sales to distributors would need to be settled using the Chinese yuan. Previously, transactions had been settled with foreign currencies like the U.S. dollar.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>        The company produces large volumes of chips in the Netherlands that are widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries. Some 70% of the Netherlands-produced chips are packaged in China and sold mostly to distributors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"While we have maintained shipments for as long as commercially feasible, continuing the current flow of supply from our front-end sites is no longer justifiable,\" the letter said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Unless these contractual obligations are fully satisfied, we cannot resume wafer supply to the site. Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or from the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution to the problem. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Nexperia said it is financially independent of Wingtech and it does not raise capital from Wingtech, the letter showed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Nexperia confirmed that it sent the letter but said it could not comment further. Nexperia China and Wingtech did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Court filings showed that the seizure by the Dutch government came as U.S. pressure was rising on Nexperia after Wingtech was placed on a restricted-export list, though Dutch authorities say governance shortcomings were the trigger. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On October 4, China's commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips from China.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Industry bodies have sounded the alarm over the possible impact on production, with Stellantis </span><span> saying on Thursday that it had set up a \"war room\" to monitor the situation. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Japanese automaker Nissan </span><span> said it had enough chips at the moment to last until the first week of November without disruption. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some Nexperia products that used to cost just a few Chinese cents have gone up in price to two or three yuan each over the past two weeks, more than 10 times their original cost, according to a source familiar with the matter. </span></p></span></div></div>",

In early trade, Brent crude and WTI both slip 0.6% to $63.98 and $60.20 a barrel, respectively. The market has largely priced in a modest output increase of 137,000 barrels a day for December, but concerns over a growing supply glut continue to weigh on sentiment. Meanwhile, the trade agreement between the U.S. and China did little to resolve questions over Chinese purchases of Russian oil, analysts say. \"There has been no indication on the Chinese side as to whether they will stop buying,\" according to ANZ. \"There was also hope that China would agree to purchases of U.S. oil and gas as part of a broader U.S.-China deal.\" (giulia.petroni@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
