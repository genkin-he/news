Netflix could buy another asset or go for an NFL international package. It could also just spend more on content, \"but that is not an answer for tomorrow,\" Kurnos says.

Brazil and Paraguay are expected to follow soon, Von der Leyen said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, the agreement can only be fully concluded with consent from the European Parliament, the bloc's legislative arm. Lawmakers voted last month to demand a ruling on the legality of the Mercosur deal.

The </span><br/><span>consideration paid to BCIC shareholders was less than the aggregate fair </span><br/><span>values of the BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in </span><br/><span>a purchase discount (the \"purchase discount\"). The consideration paid was </span><br/><span>allocated to the individual BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed based </span><br/><span>on the relative fair values of net identifiable assets acquired other than </span><br/><span>\"non-qualifying\" assets and liabilities (for example, cash) and did not give </span><br/><span>rise to goodwill. As a result, the purchase discount was allocated to the cost </span><br/><span>basis of the BCIC investments acquired by the Company on a pro-rata basis </span><br/><span>based on their relative fair values as of the effective time of the Merger. </span><br/><span>Immediately following the Merger, the investments were marked to their </span><br/><span>respective fair values in accordance with ASC 820 which resulted in immediate </span><br/><span>recognition of net unrealized appreciation in the Consolidated Statement of </span><br/><span>Operations as a result of the Merger. The purchase discount allocated to the </span><br/><span>BCIC debt investments acquired will amortize over the remaining life of each </span><br/><span>respective debt investment through interest income, with a corresponding </span><br/><span>adjustment recorded to unrealized appreciation or depreciation on such </span><br/><span>investment acquired through its ultimate disposition. The purchase discount </span><br/><span>allocated to BCIC equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life </span><br/><span>of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change </span><br/><span>to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such </span><br/><span>equity investments at fair value, the Company may recognize a realized gain or </span><br/><span>loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on </span><br/><span>disposition of such equity investments acquired. </span><br/><span> </span></pre><p class=\"\"><span>As a supplement to the Company's reported GAAP financial measures, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>\"Adjusted net investment income\" -- excludes the amortization of   purchase accounting discount from net investment income calculated in   accordance with GAAP;   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>\"Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss)\" -- excludes the   unrealized appreciation resulting from the purchase discount and the   corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation from the   amortization of the purchase discount from the determination of net   realized and unrealized gain (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP;   and   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>\"Adjusted net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from   operations\" -- calculates net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting   from operations based on Adjusted net investment income and Adjusted net   realized and unrealized gain (loss). </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>We believe that the adjustment to exclude the full effect of purchase discount accounting under ASC 805 from these financial measures is meaningful because of the potential impact on the comparability of these financial measures that we and investors use to assess our financial condition and results of operations period over period. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to enhance investors' understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP.

Additionally, we received approximately $80.7 million in proceeds from sales or repayments of investments during the three months ended December 31, 2025.

This reflects our policy of recording interest income, adjusted for amortization of portfolio investment premiums and discounts, on an accrual basis. Origination, structuring, closing, commitment, and similar upfront fees received in connection with the outlay of capital are generally amortized into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2025 were approximately $21.2 million, or $0.25 per share, including interest and other debt expenses of $15.1 million, or $0.18 per share, base management fees of $5.3 million, or $0.06 per share, offset by $1.8 million in management fee waiver, or $0.02 per share. As of December 31, 2025, the Company's cumulative total return did not exceed the total return hurdle, and as a result, no incentive compensation was accrued for the three months ended December 31, 2025.

Net unrealized loss for the three months ended December 31, 2025 was $66.5 million, or $0.78 per share. Net unrealized loss for the three months ended December 31, 2025 primarily reflects a $32.0 million unrealized loss on our investment in Edmentum, a $20.6 million unrealized loss on our investment in Infinite (Razor), a $18.5 million unrealized loss on our investment in SellerX, a $5.2 million unrealized loss on our investment in Hylan, a $5.0 million unrealized loss on our investment in InMobi, a $4.7 million unrealized loss on our investment in Pluralsight, a $4.6 million unrealized loss on our investment in Fishbowl, a $4.5 million unrealized loss on our investment in Brook &amp; Whittle, a $4.3 million unrealized loss on our investment in Domo, a $4.2 million unrealized loss on our investment in AutoAlert, a $3.7 million unrealized loss on our investment in Beqom, and a $2.7 million unrealized loss on our investment in Suited Connector, partially offset by $25.6 million, $20.2 million, $10.2 million, and $2.3 million reversals of previously recognized unrealized losses from the disposition of our investments in Anacomp, Astra, Conergy, and McAfee, respectively.
