After winning a bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount says the combined company plans to produce 30 feature films annually. Each film will receive a full theatrical release with a minimum 45-day window before becoming available on paid video-on-demand. For is most successful releases Paramount is planning for that window to last 60 to 90 days or more to maximize the audience, it says. Afterward, each film will transition to the current industry standard home video window, preserving paid video-on-demand prior to availability on streaming services, the company says.

The Offering consisted of 10,037,020 Shares for aggregate gross proceeds of $6,524,063.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Offering will fund the next phase of exploration at the Company's 100%-owned Adelita Project in Sonora, Mexico, focused on a Phase II drill program. Phase I drilling at the Cerro Grande skarn intersected multiple stacked Cu-Au-Ag skarn horizons at depth, including skarn zones that had not been identified by historic drilling. The upcoming program will target expansion drilling at Cerro Grande and first-pass drilling along an approximately 6-kilometre prospective limestone corridor hosting multiple, undrilled, outcropping skarn targets. Proceeds from the Offering will also be used for additional operating costs and general working capital requirements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Commenting on the opportunity at Adelita, newly elected Director Raymond Jannas stated: \"The Adelita Project exhibits many of the characteristics we look for in emerging district-scale systems, high-grade skarn mineralization with clear geological vectors toward a deeper potential porphyry source. What excites me most is the combination of compelling geology and a focused, determined team that is executing with discipline. With capital in place and a clear exploration roadmap, Algo Grande is well positioned to unlock the broader potential of this system.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In connection with the closing of the Offering, the Company paid certain eligible finders (each, a \"Finder\") aggregate cash commissions of $169,605.44, being equal to 7% of the aggregate gross proceeds raised from those purchasers introduced by such Finder, and issued 355,863 common share purchase warrants (each, a \"Finder Warrant\") being equal to 7% of the number of Shares purchased by those purchasers introduced by such Finder. Each Finder Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire a Share (each, a \"Finder's Warrant Share\") at an exercise price of $0.65 per Finder's Warrant Share until the date that is three years after issuance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Additionally, Canaccord Genuity Corp. (\"Canaccord\") acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Offering. The Company paid Canaccord a corporate finance fee of $50,000 (the \"Corporate Finance Fee\"). The Corporate Finance Fee was settled through the issuance of 76,923 Shares at a deemed price of $0.65 per Share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Securities issued in the Offering are subject to a four-month hold period in accordance with applicable securities laws, which will expire four months and one day from the date of closing of the Offering. The Offering is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, receipt of all necessary approvals, including approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company also announces that at its Annual General Meeting held on February 25, 2026, shareholders approved all matters brought before the meeting, including the election of three new directors:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Raymond Jannas</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Hunter Scharfe</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Enrico Gay</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>The appointments follow the Company's previously announced board strengthening initiatives (see news release dated February 11, 2026).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Certain directors of the Company (the \"Insiders\") subscribed for an aggregate of 77,155 Shares for aggregate gross proceeds of $50,150.75 in the Offering.

The Company is relying on the exemption from the valuation requirements and minority shareholder approvals in MI 61-101 pursuant to subsections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, respectively, as the value of the Insiders' participation in the Offering does not represent more than 25% of the Company's market capitalization, as determined in accordance with MI 61-101.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities in the United States.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>XRP’s liquidity structure on higher timeframes is in a situation where the path of least resistance could extend to the $4 level. The remark came from crypto analyst Bird in response to hourly and daily liquidity heatmaps shared by Cryptoinsightuk, which show a clear contrast between short-term and higher-timeframe liquidity positioning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $1.45, still below the large liquidity clusters visible above the current price. According to Bird, that imbalance may not stay unresolved for long.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Hourly Liquidity Cleared, Short-Term Volatility Reduced</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>XRP’s liquidity heatmap on the hourly candlestick chart shows that much of the nearby liquidity below the current price has already been swept. The visible clusters around the $1.30-$1.50 range have all been cleared, meaning that the short-term stop hunts and liquidation pools have largely been cleared out.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to Bird, this trend shows that hourly XRP liquidity is basically gone. This means there is less immediate incentive for XRP to stay around current levels on lower timeframes. When short-term liquidity dries up like this, the outlook is that the price will gravitate to areas where larger pools are untouched.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since the nearby liquidity has already been taken, the next logical target is now where there are larger concentrations of resting orders. As noted by the analyst, these resting orders are stacked all the way up past $4. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>XRP Hourly Liquidity. Source: @Cryptoinsightuk on X</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Daily Liquidity Stacked Above $4</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Liquidity on the daily heatmap appears layered and dense above the current price, stretching through multiple resistance bands and extending above the $4 price level. The upper regions show heavy trading activity and visible liquidity clusters between $2.50 and $4.00, which is a reflection of a thick concentration of stop orders and resting interest.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In liquidity-based trading theory, price action is often drawn to areas where there are large position orders, especially when those zones have not yet been tapped. Bird described this higher-timeframe liquidity as stacked all the way up past $4, with the notion that the higher-timeframe liquidity is sitting there like a magnet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>XRP Daily Liquidity. Source: @Cryptoinsightuk on X</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bird also referenced a five-month breakdown in Bitcoin dominance. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin dominance is at 57.9%, down from 58.2% last week. This means Bitcoin has been steadily losing dominance. A decline in dominance is always due to capital rotation into altcoins. If that trend continues, XRP could easily become one of the best beneficiaries, particularly given its visible higher-timeframe liquidity targets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The analyst also noted that sentiment has not yet reached extreme lows. XRP, in particular, has maintained a relatively positive positioning among investors compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. That combination of declining dominance and neutral-to-cautious sentiment can create conditions for XRP’s projected rally above $4.</span></p></span></div></div>",

SpaceX didn't respond to a request for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors are eager to see financials from the space giant. Filing confidentially won't help slake that desire, but it's all part of the process of becoming a publicly traded company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many draft registration statements are filed with the SEC before they are made available to the public. Companies and the regulatory authority have to work out the details.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The review process can take three months or more. After the document becomes public, the company needs to wait at least 15 days before starting its IPO roadshow. During that time, brokers take a company around to investors and discuss the business. The process helps gauge IPO demand and pricing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When the registration documents are made public, investors will get a look at one of the most unique companies on the planet, responsible for more than half of all orbital launches on Earth and for essentially the modern space economy by driving down the cost of reaching orbit through pioneering reusable rockets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SpaceX's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, profit margins are estimated to be as high as 50%. Aerospace companies in the S&amp;P 500 generate average Ebitda profit margins of roughly 20%. High margins aren't unprecedented, though. TransDigm Group's margins are north of 50%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Triangulating SpaceX's profits isn't easy. SpaceX doesn't produce financial statements. Management, however, said its Starlink business was profitable in 2024, with about half as many users as the service has today. And it's easy to imagine SpaceX's launch business is profitable, given its cost advantage from reusable rockets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SpaceX might be on track to generate as much as $10 billion in Ebitda in 2026. Its financials, however, just got a lot more complicated by the acquisition of Musk's AI company, xAI. It, like OpenAI, doesn't appear to be profitable and is operating in a capital-intensive, brutally competitive market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Just how profitable SpaceX is, and xAI isn't, should become clearer in just a few months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
