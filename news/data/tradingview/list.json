Between September-December, they participated in weekly sessions centered on interactive learning and team-based design challenges that balanced technical rigor with creative, real-world applications.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Each week, students learned about a different STEM topic, such as electronics, mechanical energy and design thinking, and completed projects coordinating with the topics. Curriculum challenged students to solve problems by creating products, building simple machines like a cotton ball launcher, and working circuits and an electrical fan.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>UNLV established the STEM for Girls Camp to address the wide gender disparity in STEM-related fields. The American Association of University Women estimates that women make up only 26% of the STEM workforce. Gaps appear early, with women underrepresented in STEM majors in higher education, particularly in engineering and computer science.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We truly appreciate Sands making this possible, both with philanthropic support and the inspiration to launch a program that helps break stereotypes and will hopefully lead to more women in STEM fields,\" Yingtao Jiang, Ph.D., associate dean in UNLV's Howard R. Hughes College of Engineering, said. \"As we look forward to the next segment, the girls will be meeting more female mentors in engineering fields and continue to work on projects that build excitement, confidence, STEM literacy and pride in their work.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the current spring 2026 semester, the program features a critical thinking workshop and project clusters on chemistry and material science, physics and engineering mechanics, and human-centered design. In addition to learning sessions and hands-on experiments, project highlights include building articulated robot hands to understand how tendons and joints function as simple machines, as well as designing accessibility tools for people with disabilities and environmentally conscious solutions for resource conservation. The camp concludes with students presenting their work in a show-and-tell day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sands' involvement in the UNLV STEM for Girls Camp aligns with the company's focus on workforce development and helping build an inclusive workforce of the future through education, mentorship and skills development programs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Research shows that teams with gender diversity consistently deliver the strongest innovation,\" Matt Perkins, vice president of global process innovation at Sands said. \"Today, women make up about 15-16% of the engineering workforce, yet when they're included, creativity and problem-solving soar. For the best outcomes, we need more women in engineering - our national security, economic strength and global competitiveness depend on it.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Perkins said that means tackling barriers head-on by building mentorship programs and visible role models, as well as strengthening the education pipeline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Girls need to see STEM as a natural choice if we are to create inclusive workplaces where women can thrive and lead. When we do this, we unlock the full potential of every mind, and that's how we keep innovation moving forward.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To learn more about Sands' workforce development and education initiatives, read the company's latest environmental, social and governance report: https://www.sands.com/resources/reports</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Find more stories and multimedia from Las Vegas Sands at 3blmedia.com.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Contact Info:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Spokesperson: Las Vegas Sands</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/las-vegas-sands</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Email: info@3blmedia.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>SOURCE:</span></strong><span> Las Vegas Sands</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "title": "Worksport Is \"Showing Its Work\" as 2026 Momentum Targets Record-Setting Performance",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>WEST SENECA, NY / ACCESS Newswire / February 27, 2026 / Projections often capture attention. Measurable progress builds confidence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At Worksport Ltd. (\"Worksport\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:WKSP), the sequence of developments extending back through Q4 2025 reflects the latter principle. This is not a company relying on narrative alone. It's increasingly demonstrating execution alongside opportunity. As 2026 begins, the emphasis is clear: documented milestones and operational advancement are taking precedence over distant ambition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That tone was established before the new year even turned. In December 2025, Worksport reported that November revenue marked the highest monthly total in Company history, creating a record baseline entering 2026. A single month does not define a trajectory, but it can reveal acceleration. When revenue peaks within a compressed timeframe, it often signals traction building beneath the surface, which can show up in broader quarterly performances.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Against that backdrop, the early 2026 announcements read less like routine updates and more like coordinated steps within a structured expansion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Growth Through Intention</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>On January 27, Worksport's subsidiary Terravis Energy selected a major Asian manufacturing partner for its Aetherlux heat pump platform with Zerofrost anti-frosting technology. The move was less about headlines and more about infrastructure. Clean energy hardware does not scale on concept alone. It requires supply chain alignment, cost discipline, and production readiness. By securing manufacturing capacity ahead of broader commercialization, Worksport signaled preparation and a willingness to lay foundational infrastructure before expanding market visibility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then, on February 3, the Company announced a strategic partnership with Potomac International Partners to accelerate federal government and commercial market engagement for its clean energy ecosystem. Federal procurement is structured, compliance-driven, and relationship-based. Rather than attempting to navigate that terrain independently, Worksport aligned with a partner designed to open institutional doors. The SOLIS solar system, COR portable energy platform, and Aetherlux heat pump technology are now positioned within structured procurement conversations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Momentum is far more compelling when numbers support it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Record-Setting Revenues Posted</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>On February 11, Worksport reported Q4 revenue growth of 65% year over year, with gross profit increasing 380%. Full-year revenue climbed 91% to approximately $16.2 million, and gross margins expanded into the low 30% range. Revenue growth draws attention. Margin expansion commands respect. Together, they indicate that scaling efforts are not occurring at the expense of discipline. In other words, operational leverage appears to be emerging alongside expansion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The next development added another layer. On February 12, Worksport confirmed that a government entity is evaluating its Aetherlux Pro heat pump, with AHRI and ENERGY STAR certification processes continuing to advance. Government evaluation is not casual engagement. It involves technical scrutiny, regulatory review, and structured assessment. While outcomes remain subject to process, the engagement itself signals that the technology is being tested within serious institutional channels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That momentum carried forward on February 19, when Worksport secured key certifications for its COR portable energy system, including transport and federal compliance approvals. The Company indicated that final UL and CSA certifications are expected within the first quarter of 2026. Those certifications are often prerequisites for large-scale retail and enterprise distribution, again showing that commercialization gates are being addressed in accretive sequence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Viewed collectively, the pattern becomes harder to dismiss. Revenue momentum. Manufacturing readiness. Federal channel access. Certification advancement. Margin expansion. These are not disconnected headlines. They represent synchronized movement across production, distribution, compliance, and financial performance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Worksport's broader 2026 business update reinforces that alignment. Management has stated that clean energy products are shipping, that OEM and major distribution discussions are progressing, and that growth is expected to continue in 2026 - language that reflects forward movement supported by visible operational steps.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Summing The Parts</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's also important to remember the foundation beneath this expansion. Worksport's core automotive accessory business, particularly tonneau covers, continues to contribute revenue stability. The SOLIS solar integration platform, COR portable energy system, and Aetherlux heat pump portfolio are not replacements. They are extensions. The Company is layering clean energy capabilities onto an existing operational base rather than attempting to build from scratch.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Market opportunity narratives, including references to multibillion-dollar industry segments, only carry weight when paired with tangible advancement. What distinguishes Worksport's current phase is that incremental barriers are being addressed methodically. Production alignment reduces supply risk. Certifications reduce compliance friction. Institutional evaluation adds credibility. Margin expansion suggests scalability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Taken together, the progression suggests coordination between strategy and execution. Moreover, Worksport's updates show it's not merely outlining where it intends to go in 2026. It's describing the intermediate steps designed to support that trajectory. For observers evaluating emerging clean energy participants within the small-cap landscape, the distinction between aspiration and implementation matters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As importantly, Worksport's first-quarter developments continue to reflect a company intent on showing its work as it provides answers to serve multiple market opportunities. In a market environment that increasingly values operational clarity and disciplined advancement, that distinction could prove meaningful.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Worksport</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Worksport Ltd. </span><span>, through its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, and owns the intellectual property on a variety of tonneau covers, solar integrations, portable power systems, and clean heating &amp; cooling solutions. Worksport has an active partnership with Hyundai for the SOLIS Solar cover. Additionally, Worksport's hard-folding cover, designed and manufactured in-house, is compatible with all major truck models and is gaining traction with newer truck makers including the electric vehicle (EV) sector. Worksport seeks to capitalize on the growing shift of consumer mindsets towards clean energy integrations with its proprietary solar solutions, mobile energy storage systems (ESS), and Cold-Climate Heat Pump (CCHP) technology.

ECLL had four short-term loans outstanding at the previous year end with £2,661,639 lent and £3,043,500 due to be received at maturity of the loans. These loans were repaid in full in the first half of the current financial year end. The Company took a decision not to continue using ECLL for short term investments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the year the directors reviewed the carrying value of the goodwill created on the acquisition of PL.

Details of the Company's and Group financial performance can be found in the statement of comprehensive income on page 51.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The current year loss was exacerbated by the write down of the investment in Precious Link (UK) Limited in an amount of £379,127. Management assessed PL as a cash generating unit (CGU) and discounted its projected future cashflows using appropriate rates (factoring in the cost of debt and equity). They concluded that the third shop acquired as part of PL has underperformed against original income expectations, resulting in weaker future cashflows than anticipated at the time of acquisition. The Directors will review this position after trading in the year ended October 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Basic loss per share for the year was 1.43p (2024: profit of 2.48p).

This gave SPC a total of 13 CLNs at a nominal value of £3,250,000. Each tranche of loan notes has an initial term of 3 years from the date of the certificate being issued to the relevant noteholder. SPC is wholly owned and controlled by Mr Ziwei Peng, Mr Peng is the owner and controller of Golden Nice International Group Limited, which at 31 October 2025 holds a 24.55% interest, in the issued share capital of the Company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the 28 August 2025, due to the company having excess cash to its needs, it repaid £1,500,000 of the outstanding CLNs to SPC. The repayment was settled as to £1,491,731 in cash with the remaining £8,269 added to the balance of the loan advance made by SPC in November 2024 of approximately £159,000. This loan attracts the same interest rate as the CLNs (being 6% per annum) and can be rolled into a CLN once the loan balance reaches £250,000</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SPC was a related party transaction for the purposes of Rule 7.3 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Subsequent to the year end, on 26 November 2025 the Company issued 6 CLNs worth £1,500,000 of new Convertible Loan Notes (\"CLNs\") in tranches of £250,000 to SPC.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition to the financing the Company felt that the low nominal share price was not optimal and sought to do a share consolidation. This was proposed to the shareholders on 10 October 2025 and approved on 7 November 2025 as an event after the reporting date. Accordingly, the Board carried out a subdivision and reclassification of the existing and to be issued Ordinary Shares by 200:1 so that each Existing Ordinary Share would be subdivided and reclassified into one (1) new ordinary share of £0.000005 each (\"New Ordinary Share\") and (2) 3,999 deferred shares of £0.000005 each (\"Deferred Shares\") (\"Subdivision\"), followed by a consolidation of the New Ordinary Shares and Deferred Shares by 200 so that every 200 New Ordinary Shares and every 200 Deferred Shares will be consolidated into one New Ordinary Share and one Deferred Share of £0.001 each (\"Consolidation\", together with the Subdivision, \"Capital Reorganisation\"). The Deferred Shares have no right to vote or participate in the capital of the Company and the Company did not issue any certificates or credit CREST accounts in respect of them. The Deferred Shares were not admitted to trading on any exchange. The rights of the Ordinary Shares and the Deferred Shares are set out in the new articles of association proposed to be adopted by the Company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition to the above the Company sought approval to amend the articles of association. The changes approved by the shareholders include:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·      The New Ordinary Shares will have the same rights as the Existing Ordinary Shares including voting, dividend, return of capital and other rights. The Deferred Shares will have no dividend or voting rights and, upon a return of capital, the right only to receive the amount paid up thereon after the holders of the Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company have received the aggregate amount paid up thereon. The Deferred Shares will not be traded on the Main Market or any other market, and no share certificates will be issued in respect of the Deferred Shares, nor will the CREST accounts of holders of New Ordinary Shares be credited with any Deferred Shares.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·      The Company will be able to hold general meetings and annual general meetings by means of electronic facility or facilities. The notice of the meetings will specify whether the meeting will be a physical, electronic or hybrid meeting. In the case of an electronic or hybrid meeting, the notice shall specify the date, time and electronic platform for the meeting, which electronic platform may vary from time to time and from meeting to meeting as the Board, in its sole discretion, sees fit. At any electronic general meeting, the Board may impose any necessary requirements or restrictions to verify the identity of those taking part and the security of the electronic communications. The Company will also be able to authorise any voting application, system or facility for electronic or hybrid general meetings as it sees fit. For the avoidance of doubt, the New Articles will not prevent a general meeting being held both physically and electronically.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Subject to express agreement by members (as further detailed in the proposed New Articles), the Company will be able to send any documents or notices to members, who have provided their express consent, in electronic form and use its website to display certain documents rather than sending these documents to members in hardcopy form.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Acquisition strategy</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company considered several acquisitions during the year under review and decided that the cigar bar was the only appropriate project.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Board is considering a number of projects currently and as and when appropriate will inform the market and shareholders. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Key performance indicators ('KPI')</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Year ended</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>31 October</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2025</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Year ended</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>31 October</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2024</span></p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>£</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>£</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Turnover</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>566,755</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>437,768</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Gross profit</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>171,362</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>108,054</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Cash on hand and in bank</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>1,063,463</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>279,725</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Underlying operating loss</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>(1,085,087)</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>(669,607)</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><span>The Board use these indicators as a high-level indication of how the Group is performing and therefore how to actively improve the performance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The KPIs used are reflective of the business as at 31 October 2025 and 31 October 2024. Therefore, the profit and loss KPI will include only continuing businesses and similarly the balance sheet will include PL, Everest (Hong Kong) Securities Ltd and N20 Nine Ltd. As a result of the acquisition and subsequent disposal, the KPIs in future years will reflect this change in the Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Due to the transactions undertaken in the prior year, the financial data shown above has been changed to reflect the reporting requirement under IFRS.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Turnover is the income for the Group and therefore is vital to enable the Group to continue with its current business model. Gross profit is an indication that the underlying business is profitable. This is because gross profit is turnover less any direct costs. With our new group formed we will look to grow turnover in the knowledge that it is profitable. We have achieved a 30% (2024: 25%) gross profit margin, which is healthy and a metric we will continue to target as PL grows. This approach will allow the business to grow and reinvest in itself or pay out to its shareholders in the longer term.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a Company that invests in companies, having direct access to capital via the ability to issue further CLN's/equity to our supportive substantial investor/ shareholder is invaluable to cover ongoing costs and also to be able to invest in new businesses. Investment opportunities can arise from anywhere and by having adequate access to funds, the Group is able to actively scour the market for these opportunities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the comparative period the Group, including discontinued operations, has pre-tax profits of £4.125 million, this is not a direct indication of performance due to the transactions undertaken in the year. The Group profit pre-tax takes into consideration of the unwinding of the loan outstanding to K2 from DI. As a result, there is a large finance income receivable, further details on the discontinued operations are documented in note 4. The Group continues to pivot the business to focus on a UK and European focus with retail footprint rather than manufacturing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We would hope to see improvements in these KPIs as we move forward. This isn't going to occur in the short term as we purchase businesses, however in the medium to long term we envisage a cash generative and profitable group with growing turnover.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group uses financial instruments to aid in the ongoing objectives of the business.

If an acquisition is made, its business risk will be concentrated in a single target until the Company completes an additional acquisition, if it chooses to do so. In the event that the Company acquires less than a 100 per cent. interest in a particular entity, the remaining ownership interest will be held by third parties and the subsequent management and control of such an entity may entail risks associated with multiple owners and decision-makers. In circumstances where the Company were to undertake a Reverse Takeover (or analogous transaction) requiring the eligibility of the Company to be re-assessed, the Company would be required to meet the minimum market capitalisation requirement of £30,000,000 to maintain its listing as well as satisfy the requirements of the Equity Shares (commercial companies) category of the new UK listing rules which came into effect on 29 July 2024. In the event that the Company is unable to satisfy these requirements, the Company would be unable to meet the eligibility requirements to maintain its listing and would be required to de-list, meaning the shareholders of the Company would hold shares in a non-trading public company (assuming it would be unable to secure a listing or quotation on another exchange).</span></p></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>iv.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Reliance on consistent supply</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>The beverage industry is dependent on prompt supply and quality transportation of beverage ingredients and finished goods.

The business commenced trading under the new banner in September 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Directors consider this to be a highly complementary strategic acquisition. The powerful synergy between premium spirits and fine cigars enhances our existing alcohol distribution business, providing it with a new direct outlet. In addition, the cigar lounge creates an immediate additional direct-to-consumer retail channel and a flagship showcase for the Group's product portfolio, enabling brand experience curation and direct consumer feedback.

This transaction has been approved by the relevant Hong Kong authorities during the current reporting period. The Directors continue to monitor the position and will update shareholders as soon as there is a material development. AJV is the parent company of Giga (Hong Kong) Limited, which holds both a Type 4 Licence (provision of advice on securities) and a Type 9 Licence (asset management related regulated activities) under the Securities and Futures Ordinance in Hong Kong. The Directors believe that holding an interest in these licences will facilitate future fundraisings from investors based in Hong Kong and China. Separately, the Company continues to hold its Hong Kong incorporated entity, Everest (Hong Kong) Securities Limited ('EHKS'), which remains dormant at the date of this report but will, once trading, enhance the credibility and ability of the Group to raise capital in those markets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Capital Re-Organisation</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A General Meeting was held on 7 November 2025 to approve a re-organisation of the Company's share capital.

The repayment was settled as to £1,491,731 in cash, with the remaining £8,269 added to the balance of the loan advance previously made by SPC in November 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Following the repayment, SPC held seven CLNs with an aggregate principal value of £1,750,000 under the Loan Note Instrument.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Continued related party position: SPC is wholly owned and controlled by Mr Ziwei Peng. Mr Peng is the owner and controller of Golden Nice International Group Limited, which holds a 24.55% interest in the issued share capital of the Company.

The funds were received on 25 November 2025. The CLNs are convertible into new ordinary shares at a price of £8.00 per share (reflecting the post re-organisation share structure) and carry the same material terms as previously disclosed.

2025</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1.   General information</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Everest Global Plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. Details of the registered office, the officers and advisers to the Company are presented on the directors and professional advisers page at the back of this report (page 106). The Company is admitted to the Official List (by way of a Standard Listing under Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules) (subsequent to the year end the Company is admitted to the equity Shares (transition) category of the Official List) and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities. The information within these financial statements and accompanying notes has been prepared for the year ended 31 October 2025 with comparatives for the year ended 31 October 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2.   Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The consolidated financial statements of Everest Global Plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the United Kingdom (IFRS as adopted by the UK), IFRS Interpretations Committee and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in the Group's reporting currency of Pound Sterling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 3. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Although these estimates are based on management's experience and knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only that year or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>c.   Going concern</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These consolidated financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis. The going concern basis assumes that the Group will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Group has incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations as the Group pivoted to new opportunities during the year under review.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There remains an active and liquid market for the Group's shares.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As at 31 October 2025 the Group held £1,063,463 (2024: £279,725) in cash and cash equivalents.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Furthermore, the Group continues to seek further investment opportunities to develop its UK and European-focused food and beverage operations. It will be necessary to raise further funding to achieve these objectives. The Company has the ability to issue up to £50 million CLNs, of which the Company has issued £3.25 million of CLNs since this facility was agreed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts. These forecasts consider operating cash flows and capital expenditure requirements for the Company and PL, available working capital and forecast expenditure, including overheads and other costs. The Directors are of the opinion that the Group has sufficient working capital and that no additional funding is required. However, funding is being raised to provide adequate cash flow to cover the business for unforeseen costs that might occur.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After careful consideration of the matters set out above, the Directors are of the opinion that the Group will be able to undertake its planned activities for the period to 28 February 2027 from current cash and debtor positions and have prepared the consolidated financial statements on the going concern basis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>d.   New and amended standards adopted by the Company</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group has implemented IFRS as adopted by the UK. At the point of transition from IFRS as adopted by the EU the underlying requirements were identical. The following standards, amendments and interpretations are new and effective for the year ended 31 October 2025 and have been adopted. None of the IFRS standards below had a material impact on the financial statements.</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>IFRS S1</span></p></td><td rowspan=\"7\"><p class=\"\"><span>General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information</span></p></td><td rowspan=\"7\"><p class=\"\"><span>IFRS S1 sets out overall requirements for sustainability-related financial disclosures with the objective to require an entity to disclose information about its sustainability-related risks and opportunities that is useful to primary users of general-purpose financial reports in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>1 January 2024</span></p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>IFRS S2</span></p></td><td rowspan=\"5\"><p class=\"\"><span>Climate-related Disclosures</span></p></td><td rowspan=\"5\"><p class=\"\"><span>IFRS S2 sets out the requirements for identifying, measuring and disclosing information about climate-related risks and opportunities that is useful to primary users of general-purpose financial reports in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>1 January 2024</span></p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><span>The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued, but are not effective for the financial year beginning 1 November 2024 and have not been early adopted:</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>IFRS 18</span></p></td><td rowspan=\"4\"><p class=\"\"><span>Presentation and Disclosures in Financial Statements </span></p></td><td rowspan=\"4\"><p class=\"\"><span>IFRS 18 includes requirements for all entities applying IFRS for the presentation and disclosure of information in financial statements.</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>1 January 2027</span></p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><span>The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and the interpretations in future periods will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>e.   Basis of consolidation</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 October each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by other members of the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group's equity therein. Those interests of non-controlling shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests' share of subsequent changes in equity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Changes in the Group's ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group's interests and the non- controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Where certain assets of the subsidiary are measured at revalued amounts or fair values and the related cumulative gain or loss has been recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are accounted for as if the Company had directly disposed of the related assets (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings). The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IFRS 9 \"Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement\" or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a jointly controlled entity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Business combinations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment transactions of the acquiree or the replacement of an acquiree's share-based payment transactions with share-based payment transactions of the Group are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment at the acquisition date; and</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Goodwill</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Associates</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company's interest in an associate is carried in the statement of financial position at its share in the net assets of the associate together with goodwill paid on acquisition, less any impairment loss. When the share in the losses exceeds the carrying amount of an equity-accounted Company, the carrying amount is written down to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>f.    Property, plant &amp; equipment</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial year in which they are incurred. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to write of their cost over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>      Leasehold improvements                                                                                   33.33%</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>      Furniture, fixtures &amp; equipment                                                                           10.00% - 25.00%</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>      Plant &amp; machinery                                                                                             20.00% - 33.33%</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant asset and is recognised in profit or loss in the year in which the asset is derecognised.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>g.   Leased assets</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group leases various retail premises. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The right-of-use asset is depreciated over lease term on a straight-line basis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received any initial direct costs; and</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     restoration costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Payments associated with short term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise moving equipment rented on a day to day basis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>h.   Investments in subsidiaries</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>i.    Inventories</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost of completion and applicable selling expenses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When the inventories are sold, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense in the year in which the related revenue is recognised. The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventories are recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories is recognised as an expense in the year in which the reversal occurs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>j.    Impairment</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-derivative financial assets</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Credit-impaired financial assets</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt securities at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income ('FVTOCI') are credit-impaired. A financial asset is \"credit-impaired\" when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets have occurred.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A 12-month approach is followed in determining the Expected Credit Loss ('ECL').</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Presentation of allowance for ECL in the statement of financial position</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For debt securities at FVTOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income ('OCI').</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write-off</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. For corporate customers, the Group individually makes an assessment with respect to the timing and amount of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures of recovery of the amounts due.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>k.   Financial instruments</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories: loans and receivables and Fair Value through Profit and Loss ('FVTPL') and FVTOCI financial assets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the following category: other financial liabilities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>i.    Non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities - recognition and derecognition</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group initially recognises loans and receivables on the date when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred, or it neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control over the transferred asset. Any interest in such derecognised financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire. Gains or losses on derecognition of financial liabilities are recognised in profit or loss as a finance charge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ii.   Loans and receivables - measurement</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These assets are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>iii.  Assets at FVTOCI - measurement</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These assets are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses, are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the revaluation reserve.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When these assets are derecognised, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>iv.  Non-derivative financial liabilities - measurement</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other non-derivative financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>v.   Convertible loan notes and derivative financial instruments</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The presentation and measurement of loan notes for accounting purposes is governed by IAS 32 and IFRS 9. These standards require the loan notes to be separated into two components:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     a derivative liability; and</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     a debt host liability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is because the loan notes are convertible into an unknown number of shares, therefore failing the 'fixed-for- fixed' criterion under IAS 32. This requires the 'underlying option component' of the loan note to be valued first (as an embedded derivative), with the residual of the face value being allocated to the debt host liability (refer financial liabilities policy above).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Compound financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible notes denominated in British pounds that can be converted to ordinary shares at the option of the holder, when the number of shares to be issued is fixed and does not vary with changes in fair value.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The liability component of compound financial instruments is initially recognised at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option. The equity component is initially recognised at the difference between the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not remeasured.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interest related to the financial liability is recognised in profit or loss. On conversion at maturity, the financial liability is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss is recognised.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group's financial liabilities include amounts due to a director, trade payables and accrued liabilities. These financial liabilities are classified as FVTPL are stated at fair value with any gains or losses arising on re-</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>measurement recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities, including borrowings are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>l.    Borrowings</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Borrowings are presented as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the reporting period, in which case they are presented as non-current liabilities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs and subsequently carried for at amortised costs using the effective interest method. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in profit or loss over the year of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings which are due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period are included in current borrowings in the statement of financial position even though the original term was for a period longer than twelve months and an agreement to refinance, or to reschedule payments, on a long-term basis is completed after the reporting period and before the financial statements are authorised for issue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>m.  Revenue recognition</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Performance obligations and service recognition policies</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control over of goods or services to a customer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The following table provides information about the nature and timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations in contracts with customers, including significant payment terms, and the related revenue recognition policies.</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td rowspan=\"3\"><p class=\"\"><span>Type of product/ service</span></p></td><td rowspan=\"3\"><p class=\"\"><span>Nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, including significant payment terms</span></p></td><td rowspan=\"3\"><p class=\"\"><span>Revenue recognition under IFRS 15</span></p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Sale of goods</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Customers obtain control of the goods when the goods have been delivered to them and have been accepted at their premises or the agreed point of delivery.

Trade discounts, rebates and other similar items are deducted in determining the costs of purchase. Cost of conversion primarily consists of hiring charges of subcontractors incurred during conversion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>o.   Finance income and finance costs</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group's finance income and finance costs include:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     interest income;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     interest expense; and</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     dividend income.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interest income and expense is recognised using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the Group's right to receive payment is established.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The \"effective interest rate\" is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-     the amortised cost of the financial liability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset, if the asset is no-longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>p.   Taxation</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years, and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Current or deferred tax for the year is recognised in profit or loss, except when it relates to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the current and deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>q.   Cash &amp; cash equivalents</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, demand deposits with banks and other financial institutions, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, having been within three months of maturity at acquisition. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are also included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>r.    Provisions and contingencies</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors' best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the statement of financial position date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When the effect of discounting is material, the amount recognised for a provision is the present value at the reporting date of the future expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.

However, management also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base, including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which its customers operate. Details of concentration of revenue are included in Note 4.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group's standard payment terms and conditions are offered. The Group's review includes external ratings, if they are available, financial statements, credit agency information, industry information and in some cases bank references. Sales limits are established for each customer and are reviewed regularly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group limits its exposure to credit risk from trade receivables by establishing a maximum payment period of one month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.

The pact aims to open up trade between the two continents amid unprecedented uncertainty in Europe's trading relationship with the U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Mercosur is one of the most consequential trade agreements of the first half of this century,\" Von der Leyen said in a statement Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2024, the EU exported about 55 billion euros ($64.90 billion) worth of goods to the four South American countries included in the deal, according to data from the bloc's statistics authority. It imported goods worth around 56 billion euros.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The decision to implement the deal follows ratification on Thursday from Uruguay and Argentina. Brazil and Paraguay are expected to follow soon, Von der Leyen said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, the agreement can only be fully concluded with consent from the European Parliament, the bloc's legislative arm. Lawmakers voted last month to demand a ruling on the legality of the Mercosur deal. Only when that judicial review is complete will the parliament be able to vote on the deal itself.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The implementation, though provisional, was greeted with approval by industry bodies including the German automotive-industry association, known as the VDA.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The application \"is good news for the economy in Europe and for the German automotive industry,\" VDA chief Hildegard Mueller said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deal with the Mercosur nations has drawn critics from agricultural businesses across Europe, worried about an influx of cheap produce from across the Atlantic. France--where farmers have long made their opposition to the deal known with high-profile protests and tractor rallies--is among the member states that have opposed the deal's ratification, pending new safeguards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Any boost to Europe's trade flows from the provisional application of the deal won't be immediate, economists at Dutch bank ING wrote in a recent note.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Most of the impact will probably materialise later than 2026 as tariffs will be phased out gradually,\" ING said. \"For now, the symbolic value of strategic independence and the signalling effect outweigh trade benefits.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Joshua Kirby at joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby</span></p></span></div></div>",
