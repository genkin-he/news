The Circular provides details regarding the proposed Acquisition Transaction, including the background and rationale for the Acquisition Transaction, voting information, and the matters to be considered at the Meeting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On February 5, 2026, at the Meeting, the common shareholders of the Bank voted in favour of the Acquisition Transaction pursuant to which Fairstone Bank of Canada will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Bank. The special resolution requiring approval by at least 66(2/3) % of the votes cast was obtained, with 98.8% of votes cast in favour. Assuming the timely receipt of all required key regulatory approvals, and the satisfaction of other closing conditions, the Transactions are expected to close by late 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On February 17, 2026, the Bank completed the sale of its syndicated loan portfolio to National Bank of Canada (the Syndicated Loan Transaction). The outstanding principal balance of the syndicated loans was approximately $705 million as at closing. Certain liabilities were also assumed by National Bank. The cash consideration received at closing by Laurentian Bank was $646 million, subject to customary post--closing adjustments, and reflected a discount of $50 million to the outstanding balance of the syndicated loans. In the second quarter of 2026, the Bank will record a loss of approximately $20 million before taxes ($15 million after taxes) on the Syndicated Loan Transaction, reflecting the aforementioned discount and the impact of reversing previously recognized allowances for credit losses. The closing of the Syndicated Loan Transaction was not conditional upon the closing of the Retail/SME Transaction or the Acquisition Transaction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consolidated Results</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Three months ended January 31, 2026 financial performance A net loss of $20.5 million and a diluted loss per share of $0.58 were recorded for the first quarter of 2026, compared with net income of $38.6 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.76 for the first quarter of 2025. Of note, reported results for the first quarter of 2026 included restructuring and other impairment charges of $61.2 million ($45.0 million after income taxes), or $0.89 per share, related the Bank's strategic shift to a specialty commercial bank, resulting in its exit from the retail and SME banking business. Reported results also included transaction and conversion costs of $11.0 million ($8.1 million after income taxes), or $0.18 per share, related to the Transactions announced on December 2, 2025 (defined below). Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures section and to the Business Highlights section on pages 8 to 10 of the Bank's MD&amp;A for additional information. Adjusted net income was $34.2 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.65 for the first quarter of 2026, compared with $39.4 million and $0.78 for the first quarter of 2025. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures section for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total revenue</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total revenue increased by $1.9 million to $251.6 million for the first quarter of 2026, compared with $249.6 million for the first quarter of 2025, attributable to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in other income, as detailed below.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net interest income increased by $8.7 million or 5% to $194.9 million for the first quarter of 2026, compared with $186.2 million for the first quarter of 2025. This growth was mainly due to favourable loan repayments and shifts in the Bank's business mix. The net interest margin was 1.89% for the first quarter of 2026, an increase of 4 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2025, primarily for the same underlying reasons.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other income decreased by $6.7 million to $56.7 million for the first quarter of 2026, compared with $63.4 million for the first quarter of 2025. Of note, reported other income for the first quarter of 2025 included a $0.9 million profit from the sale of assets under administration of LBS' discount brokerage division. The decrease in other income for the quarter was primarily driven by lower income from financial instruments compared with the first quarter of 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Provision for credit losses</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The provision for credit losses was $16.5 million for the first quarter of 2026, compared with $15.2 million for the first quarter of 2025, representing an increase of $1.3 million. This increase primarily reflects higher provisions on performing loans driven principally by increased volumes and lower releases, partially offset by lower provisions on impaired loans. The provision for credit losses as a percentage of average loans, including those classified as assets held for sale, was 18 basis points for the quarter, compared with 17 basis points for the same quarter one year ago. Refer to the \"Credit risk management\" section on pages 17 to 19 of the Bank's MD&amp;A and to Note 5 to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on provision for credit losses and allowances for credit losses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-interest expenses</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-interest expenses amounted to $267.4 million for the first quarter of 2026, an increase of $80.4 million compared with the first quarter of 2025. Adjusted non-interest expenses increased by $8.0 million or 4% to $192.9 million for the first quarter of 2026, compared with $184.9 million for the first quarter of 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Salaries and employee benefits amounted to $102.7 million for the first quarter of 2026, an increase of $5.8 million compared with the first quarter of 2025. The increase mainly reflects regular annual salary increases, as well as higher employer--related contributions and benefit costs. The Bank also recorded a net loss of $2.2 million related to the settlement of certain pension plans resulting from an annuity purchase. Refer to the Business Highlights section on pages 8 to 10 of the Bank's MD&amp;A and to Note 12 of the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details concerning the annuity purchase transaction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Premises and technology costs were $55.0 million for the first quarter of 2026, an increase of $4.1 million compared with the first quarter of 2025. The increase mainly reflects higher IT--related costs, driven by continued investment in strategic technology initiatives and increased amortization from completed technology projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Impairment and restructuring charges were $61.2 million for the first quarter of 2026, compared with $2.0 million for the first quarter of 2025. In the first quarter of 2026, charges recorded result from the Bank's strategic shift to a specialty commercial bank and its exit from the retail and SME banking businesses. The charges primarily reflected the impairment of right--of--use assets and leasehold improvements affected by the exit of related activities, provisions for onerous contracts and unavoidable costs under contractual arrangements linked to the retail and SME operations, severance and employee benefit costs associated with anticipated workforce reductions, and the impairment and accelerated amortization of software and other intangible assets. Refer to the Business Highlights section on pages 8 to 10 of the Bank's MD&amp;A and to Note 17 of the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. In the first quarter of 2025, the Bank recorded restructuring charges of $2.0 million related to the streamlining of its technology infrastructure and organizational structure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Transaction and conversion costs amounted to $11.0 million for the first quarter of 2026. In connection with the Transactions announced on December 2, 2025, the Bank recognized transaction and conversion costs that are attributable to the successful completion of the Transactions. These costs primarily relate to legal fees, professional fees and other incremental expenditures incurred as a direct result of the Transactions. Costs that are conditional upon the closing of the Transactions will be recognized as they are incurred in subsequent periods. No such costs were recognized in the first quarter of 2025. Refer to the Business Highlights section on pages 8 to 10 of the Bank's MD&amp;A and to Note 17 of the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other non-interest expenses were $37.4 million for the first quarter of 2026, mainly unchanged compared with the first quarter of 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Efficiency ratio</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The efficiency ratio on a reported basis increased to 106.3% for the first quarter of 2026, compared with 74.9% for the first quarter of 2025. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the impairment and restructuring charges recognized in the quarter, as well as transactions and conversion costs. The adjusted efficiency ratio increased to 76.7% for the first quarter of 2026, compared with 74.3% for the first quarter of 2025, for reasons outlined in the analysis above.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Income taxes</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the first quarter of 2026, the income tax recovery was $11.8 million, and the effective income tax rate was 36.6%. The higher effective income tax rate compared to the statutory income tax rate reflects the impact of the loss recorded for the quarter and was essentially attributed to a lower taxation level on income from foreign operations. For the first quarter of 2025, the income tax expense was $8.9 million, and the effective income tax rate was 18.7%. The lower effective income tax rate compared to the statutory income tax rate was essentially attributed to a lower taxation level on income from foreign operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financial Condition</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As at January 31, 2026, total assets amounted to $49.9 billion, compared with $50.1 billion as at October 31, 2025, with the modest decrease primarily attributable to lower liquid assets, partially offset by higher loans including those classified as assets held for sale.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Liquid assets</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As at January 31, 2026, liquid assets as presented on the balance sheet amounted to $12.4 billion, a decrease of $0.7 billion compared with $13.1 billion as at October 31, 2025.

Total commercial loans amounted to $18.6 billion as at January 31, 2026, an increase of $0.7 billion or 4% since October 31, 2025 resulting from our key growth engines, namely commercial real estate, inventory financing and equipment financing.

Total residential mortgage loans amounted to $15.8 billion as at January 31, 2026, a decrease of $0.3 billion or 2% from October 31, 2025, mainly due to easing housing market activity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Assets held for sale Assets held for sale amounted to $4.7 billion as at January 31, 2026, with no such balance recognized as at October 31, 2025.

Sterling briefly rose before resuming earlier losses as the Greens won the election rather than Reform, which is associated with the largest potential policy shift, he says. However, the perceived stability of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's leadership has weakened, with a risk of a more left-leaning successor, he says. That \"increases uncertainty around the U.K.'s fiscal and macro trajectory,\" he says. Sterling is heading for a fourth consecutive weekly decline against the euro and its weakest month since June. The euro rises 0.1% to 0.8753 pounds after hitting a 10-week high of 0.8764 earlier, LSEG data show. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
