            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Audi's latest earnings call carried a sharper tone than usual. The Volkswagen AG subsidiary, home to the Audi, Lamborghini, Bentley, and Ducati brands, trimmed its full-year operating margin forecast to between 4% and 6%, down from as high as 7%. Chief Financial Officer Jurgen Rittersberger said tariffs alone could cost the group about 1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) this year, a figure that captures the dual strain of slowing global demand and rising trade friction. The move also follows Porsche's decision to scale back its EV pushsignaling that Volkswagen's luxury arm is bracing for a more defensive phase in its transition strategy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rittersberger called the environment very demanding, pointing to an uneven recovery across markets and persistent supply constraints. Audi's third-quarter operating margin stood at 2%, generating 280 million in profit, up from a small loss a year earlier tied to the Brussels factory closure. But headwinds remain: tariffs in the US, weaker momentum in China, and renewed pressure from semiconductor shortages, particularly after disruptions at Dutch chipmaker Nexperianow caught in geopolitical crossfire. Management said securing chip supplies and cutting costs will be critical to keeping its model rollout on track.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The tension is playing out across the broader EV sector. BYD's (BYDDF) earnings slump, Tesla </span><span>'s string of recalls, and Rivian's delayed financing all highlight how fragile profitability can be in a capital-intensive cycle. Audi is exploring production in the US to offset tariff exposure, with a final decision expected before year-end. For investors, the message is cautious but clear: this isn't about chasing volume anymoreit's about preserving margin, protecting brand equity, and surviving a high-stakes reset in the global luxury EV race.</span></p></span></div></div>",
