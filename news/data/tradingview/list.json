In Asia, the Bank of Japan's policy outlook, Australia's growth figures and China's annual parliamentary sessions are in focus.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. jobs data are back in focus in the coming week, with monthly nonfarm payrolls data for February due on Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors will be looking to see whether January's surprisingly strong payrolls numbers were a one-off. This comes amid uncertainty over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the coming months, although analysts say it would likely take a particularly weak number to move the dial much on rate expectations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Our view is that it would take quite a lot to get the Fed thinking about an imminent rate cut,\" ING economists said in a note.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. money markets aren't pricing in a rate cut until July at the earliest, LSEG data show. ING doesn't expect another reduction until June.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ahead of Friday's key data, ADP private payrolls figures for February will be released Wednesday, followed by weekly jobless claims Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The latest ISM surveys for February for manufacturing and services activity will be released on Monday and Wednesday, respectively. These will be keenly watched for indications of the overall performance of the U.S. economy, particularly amid uncertainty over U.S. tariff policy and tensions between the U.S. and Iran. U.S. January retail sales data are also released Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Eurozone</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The eurozone data calendar thins out after the usual end-of-month avalanche.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Spanish, Italian, French, German and eurozone manufacturing and services PMI data are due on Monday and Wednesday, respectively.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Italy will release yearly GDP data on Monday and flash estimate CPI data for February on Tuesday, when the same data is also scheduled from the eurozone as a whole.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Eurozone unemployment figures for January are scheduled for Wednesday and retail sales data for the same month on Thursday. Germany will publish manufacturing orders data for January on Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Final fourth-quarter GDP and employment data from the eurozone are due on Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"For now, the economy still looks to be 'in a good place', albeit one that the European Central Bank thinks requires vigilance and agility,\" Investec analyst Sandra Horsfield says in a note.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Netherlands will launch a new 10-year bond via a Dutch Direct Auction on Tuesday, aiming to issue between 6 billion euros and 7 billion euros. Germany will auction April 2031 bonds on Tuesday and a February 2033 green Bund on Wednesday. Spain and France will hold bond auctions on Thursday. Italy will issue a new series of retail-only BTP Valore, with subscriptions running between Monday and Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.K.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Focus in the U.K. will be on Tuesday's spring statement, a twice-yearly report on U.K. public finances which Treasury chief Rachel Reeves will present before lawmakers. This will be followed by an announcement on gilt issuance by the Debt Management Office.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Markets expect Reeves to announce an improved fiscal position, including solid fiscal headroom. Gilt investors also expect government debt issuance to fall in the fiscal year to April 2027. Analysts said this could help push yields on U.K. government bonds lower.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Economic data include final purchasing managers' data for February on manufacturing on Monday, then on services Wednesday. Data on consumer credit and mortgage lending for January are released on Monday, as well as the latest Nationwide house price index for February. The BRC's shop price index for February is released Tuesday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Poland</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Poland's central bank announces an interest-rate decision on Wednesday, where it could announce a 25 basis-point reduction in its key policy rate to 3.75%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>HSBC economists expect a rate cut due to evidence of declining inflation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We continue to expect that during the March meeting the rate-setters will have a new inflation forecast that will show a downward revision to the Polish central bank's 2026 inflation forecast, to or even below the 2.5% target,\" they said in a note. This should be enough to warrant a rate cut, they said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Japan</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors will look for clues on the timing of the Bank of Japan's next rate increase in speeches by BOJ officials. Deputy Gov. Ryozo Himino will meet local leaders in Wakayama, Japan, on Monday. Governor Kazuo Ueda is scheduled to appear at the  \"FIN/SUM 2026\" event in Tokyo on Tuesday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Japan's Ministry of Finance will auction about 2.6 trillion yen of 10-year government bonds on Tuesday and around 700 billion yen of 30-year bonds on Thursday. The 30-year sale may draw strong demand from pension funds and insurers seeking higher yields.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Auto sales figures for February are also scheduled for release on Monday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Australia</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bond traders will focus on Australia's fourth-quarter 2025 growth data due Wednesday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The economy is expected to have grown 2.1% in calendar 2025 while operating near full capacity, adding to inflation pressures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The week will therefore be dominated once again by a discussion about a decade of weak productivity growth, excessive government spending and the potential for the Reserve Bank of Australia to raise interest rates in the coming months, perhaps as early as mid-March.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The release on Thursday of the household spending indicator for January will also be closely watched by the central bank, given that strong consumer spending will add to the case for higher interest rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>RBA Governor Michele Bullock will deliver a speech on Tuesday. Bullock has been indicating that the central bank is closely monitoring data, including quarterly inflation numbers in late April that are likely to be critical in setting the scene for an interest rate increase in May.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the RBA, the data will point to whether aggregate capacity constraints are more or less worrisome than before. January's household spending data should show consumer activity starting 2026 at a subdued pace, while house price data is likely to confirm another strong monthly increase.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China returns from the Lunar New Year holiday to a busy week of data and policy announcements, including the annual meetings of its top legislature and advisory body.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The National People's Congress, part of the \"Two Sessions,\" will open on Thursday. Beijing is expected to announce key economic targets for 2026, including GDP growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ING economists forecast the growth target will be lowered to \"above 4.5%\" from \"around 5.0%\" in recent years. Fiscal targets, including the deficit-to-GDP ratio and bond issuance, are also expected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A reduced growth target would mark the first in four years. Citi economists said such a move would signal measured stimulus. They anticipate 1 trillion yuan in fiscal support, a possible 10-basis-point rate cut and a 50-basis-point reserve requirement ratio cut this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Further measures could focus on stabilizing the labor market, boosting household income and domestic demand as well as advancing AI adoption.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Official PMIs due Wednesday are likely to reflect disruption from February's extended holidays. ANZ economist Krystal Tan expects the manufacturing PMI to fall to 49.0 from 49.3, and the non-manufacturing PMI to edge down to 49.3 from 49.4. Small and midsize firms may show particular weakness, with tourism gains offset by softness in construction and finance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Private PMIs compiled by RatingDog are also due Wednesday. Foreign-exchange reserves data will be released Saturday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Asian PMIs</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Monday brings February manufacturing PMIs for Taiwan, Japan, India, Vietnam and other economies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors will look for signs that renewed U.S. tariff uncertainty has affected business sentiment, especially after The Supreme Court struck down Trump's global tariffs as illegal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The ruling may offer temporary relief for some exporters, but trade policy remains uncertain. Momentum is likely to remain supported by a strong tech-led export cycle, which remains largely insulated from the tariff shifts, ANZ added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Malaysia</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Malaysia's central bank will announce its rate decision Thursday afternoon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With inflation contained and labor-cost growth moderate, Citi expects Bank Negara to keep its policy rate unchanged at 2.75% through 2026. Policymakers are likely to favor a gradual appreciation of the ringgit to tighten monetary conditions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>South Korea</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>South Korea is expected to report solid February exports on Mar. 1, driven by robust semiconductor demand despite fewer working days in the month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Wall Street Journal poll of nine economists forecast exports rose 25.6% from a year earlier, after a revised 33.8% increase in January. Early February trade data suggest chip exports are on track for a monthly record. Imports likely rose 13.6%, resulting in a $10.10 billion trade surplus--wider than January's revised $8.72 billion surplus.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>February inflation data are due Friday. Headline inflation is expected to remain near the central bank's 2% target after easing to a five-month low of 2.0% in January from 2.3% in December.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Indonesia</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Indonesia will release January trade and February inflation data Monday afternoon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Headline inflation likely rose in February due to base effects and stronger demand during Ramadan, Kenanga Investment Bank said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>January export growth may moderate as base effects fade after a temporary rise in late 2025, RHB said in a note. However, exports should maintain moderate growth over 2026, driven by ongoing efforts to diversify markets, RHB added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Philippines, Thailand</span></p></span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, we have seen none of this in our engagement,\" Wilson wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Lululemon spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The company said in prior statements to Barron's that its board and leadership team had engaged \"extensively and in good faith\" with Wilson to understand his perspectives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wilson stepped down from the board over a decade ago, but still owns about 9% of the shares.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lululemon stock was down 1.1% to $184.02 in midmorning trading Friday. The stock has shed 11% this year, and about 50% over the past 12 months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wilson nominated three candidates to the company's board: Marc Maurer, former co-CEO of On Running; Laura Gentile, former chief marketing officer at ESPN; and Eric Hirshberg, former CEO of Activision. One of the candidates has met with some directors, he wrote, but the response from the board was \"weak and insufficient.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"While we have proposed changing three directors, our strong feeling is that more than three directors should be replaced,\" he wrote. \"The staggered nature of the Board limits how much change we can affect in one year, but we do not think the Board should constrain itself on refreshment.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lululemon has previously said the board will review Wilson's three nominees and will present a formal recommendation regarding them in the company's definitive proxy statement ahead of its 2026 shareholder meeting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wilson also discussed his proposal that calls for a change to the board's election structure. Now, directors are elected in groups that come up for election at different times, sometimes requiring years to fully replace the board. Wilson wants the board to declassify immediately so all directors are elected annually.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to Wilson, the board indicated an \"openness\" to some unspecified director refreshment over several years and a phased de-staggering of the board over time. In his letter, Wilson requested the Board provide shareholders with details on how many incumbent directors will be retiring and when new candidates will be added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, Wilson said the board rejected his proposal to create a Brand Product Committee, which would oversee the development of the company's products. Lululemon has struggled to execute some of its new product launches recently — its latest \"Get Low\" line of leggings were criticized for being see-through, and the company paused sales of its 2024 Breezethrough collection just a few weeks after launching because of issues with execution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wilson isn't the only activist pushing for change at Lululemon, which has seen sales growth stall in recent years. Elliott Investment Management took a $1 billion stake and is pushing for Jane Nielsen, Ralph Lauren's former chief financial officer, to be the next chief executive after CEO Calvin McDonald stepped down in January. A search for his successor is under way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The CEO shuffle inspired Wilson to launch his proxy campaign. He has said Lululemon shareholders won't trust any CEO picked by the current board, so he wants to change the board before someone is chosen.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Sabrina Escobar at sabrina.escobar@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Has it gone too far already?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A rare alliance against Big Tech came together in February. Now that could be put to the test.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>February has brought a sharp rotation away from the group of megacap tech stocks known as the Magnificent Seven MAGS, sparking an \"everything but tech\" rally that lifted economically sensitive names as well as recession shelters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That unusual unity, however, may already be starting to crack as the month draws to a close, suggesting the market's temporary alliance against Big Tech may not last.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In February, defensive sectors like consumer staples and utilities XX:SP500.55 have surged alongside economically sensitive groups such as industrials and materials, while technology stocks XX:SP500.45 have been under sharp pressure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This comes as concerns about tech spending and artificial intelligence were on full display this week, with the big drop in Nvidia's stock (NVDA) that followed its blowout earnings report dragging the rest of the stock market lower.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See: Why Nvidia's stock is falling despite a historic earnings beat</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That backdrop has led to the S&amp;P 500's SPX consumer staples XX:SP500.30, industrials XX:SP500.20 and materials XX:SP500.15 sectors being among the best-performing of the large-cap benchmark index's 11 sectors so far in February, with each up over 6.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 0.4% in the same period, according to FactSet data (see table below).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SOURCE: DOW JONES MARKET DATA; FACTSET</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I don't think anybody had that on their bingo card coming into 2026,\" said Stephen Hoedt, head of equities at Key Private Bank. \"It has created a really difficult environment for market participants to navigate, because there's no playbook that you could come up with over the last 10 years where cyclicals and and defensives were rallying at the same time while tech was getting smashed.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cyclicals and defensive stocks rarely move in tandem, as they tend to benefit from different, and often opposing, market and economic conditions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Defensive stocks are shares of companies that provide essential goods and services that tend to remain in demand regardless of economic conditions. These safe-haven investments often offer low volatility and could help protect investors from market downturns, but they generally lag during bull markets. Cyclical stocks, on the other hand, are closely tied to the economic cycle. They typically perform well during expansions, but could underperform during economic downturns or even recessions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A central theme around the rapid pace of AI advancements is that it could be a driving force for growth. But it also might trigger painful job losses and render some business lines obsolete, which could ultimately hurt the consumer-centric U.S. economy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, investors have focused on the consumer staples sector, which was up a total of 14.2% in January and February, while the industrials sector rose 13% and materials stocks were up 15.7% in the year to date, according to FactSet data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See: The S&amp;P 500 is caught in an extremely narrow trading range. What's happening beneath the surface could decide where the index goes next.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>More broadly, there has been a rising \"united front\" against Big Tech that has \"nothing to do with economic conditions,\" Hoedt told MarketWatch in a phone interview.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"But it has everything to do with the market looking for stuff that is not AI impacted and figuring out what is a safe place to hide.
