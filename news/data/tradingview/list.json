Reports Full Year 2025 Results</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 27, 2026--</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sable Offshore Corp. (\"Sable,\" or the \"Company\")</span><span> today announced its full year 2025 operational and financial results.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2025 Operational and Financial Highlights</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On May 19, 2025, we announced that (i) as of May 15, 2025, we had   restarted production at the Santa Ynez Unit and begun flowing oil   production to Las Flores Canyon and (ii) we completed our anomaly repair   program on Pipeline Segments 324 and 325 of the Santa Ynez Pipeline   System as specified by the Consent Decree. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On May 23, 2025, we closed an upsized underwritten public offering of   10,000,000 shares of Common Stock at a public offering price of $29.50   per share. The gross proceeds from the offering, before deducting   discounts and commissions and estimated expenses, were approximately   $295.0 million. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On May 28, 2025, we announced that we successfully completed hydrotests   of all segments of the Santa Ynez Pipeline System, satisfying the final   operational condition to resume petroleum transportation through Pipeline   Segments 324 and 325 as outlined in the Consent Decree. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>As an alternative to the Santa Ynez Pipeline System, we announced that   we are also pursuing an OS&amp;T strategy to provide access to domestic and   global markets via shuttle tankers for federal crude oil produced from   the Santa Ynez Unit in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf Area. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On November 10, 2025, we entered into subscription agreements to issue   45,454,546 shares of Common Stock in a private placement to institutional   investors at a purchase price of $5.50 per share, raising $250.0 million   in gross proceeds. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On November 24, 2025, we satisfied all conditions to effectiveness of   the Second Amendment to the Senior Secured Term Loan, thereby extending   the maturity date of the Senior Secured Term Loan to the earlier of (i)   March 31, 2027 or (ii) the date falling 90 days after first sales of   hydrocarbons. The Second Amendment increased the interest rate from ten   percent (10%) per annum to fifteen percent (15%) per annum, compounded   annually. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On December 17, 2025, PHMSA notified us that it concurred with our   determination that the Santa Ynez Pipeline System is an interstate   pipeline facility under the Pipeline Safety Act, pursuant to which PHMSA   is vested with exclusive regulatory authority over interstate pipelines.   In its notification, PHMSA additionally states that it considers the   Santa Ynez Pipeline System to be an \"active\" pipeline according to PHMSA   regulations. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>On December 23, 2025, PHMSA issued an emergency special permit for   segments of the interstate Santa Ynez Pipeline System (specifically   Pipeline Segments 324 and 325), related to cathodic protection and seam   weld corrosion along Pipeline Segments 324 and 325. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>We reported a net loss of $410.2 million, primarily attributable to   production restart related operating expenses, general &amp; administrative   expenses, and non-cash interest expense, partially offset by a non-cash   change in fair value of warrant liabilities. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>We ended the year with short-term outstanding debt of $921.6 million,   inclusive of paid-in-kind interest, and a cash and cash equivalents   balance of $97.7 million. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>About Sable</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sable Offshore Corp. is an independent oil and gas company, headquartered in Houston, Texas, focused on responsibly developing the Santa Ynez Unit in federal waters offshore California.

When used in this press release, the words \"could,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"may,\" \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"continue,\" \"plan,\" \"forecast,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"future,\" \"outlook,\" and \"target,\" the negative of such terms and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward- looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements will contain such identifying words. These statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of Sable's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause Sable's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements include: the ability to recommence sales of oil from the Santa Ynez Unit assets, including the potential implementation of an Offshore Storage and Treating Vessel (\"OS&amp;T\") strategy, the cost and time required therefor, and production levels once recommenced; availability of future financing; global economic conditions and inflation; increased operating costs; lack of availability of drilling and production equipment, supplies, services and qualified personnel; geographical concentration of operations; environmental and weather risks; regulatory changes and uncertainties; litigation, complaints and/or adverse publicity; privacy and data protection laws, privacy or data breaches, or loss of data; our ability to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business; and other one-time events and other factors that can be found in Sable's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, and any subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K, which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are available on Sable's website (www.sableoffshore.com) and on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website (www.sec.gov). Except as required by applicable law, Sable undertakes no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this press release.</span></p><section class=\"variant-secondary-aHOVUrmQ disclaimer-fdvjGD1u\"><b class=\"heading-wrapper-aHOVUrmQ\"><span class=\"heading-aHOVUrmQ\">Disclaimer</span></b><div class=\"content-aHOVUrmQ link-with-underline-aHOVUrmQ\"><p class=\"\"><span>Disclaimers</span></p></div></section><p class=\"\"><span>The Santa Ynez Unit assets restarted production in May 2025. Sable has not sold commercial quantities of hydrocarbons since acquisition of the Santa Ynez Unit. The Santa Ynez Unit was shut in during June of 2015 when the only onshore pipeline transporting hydrocarbons produced from the Santa Ynez Unit to market ceased transportation. Since the May 2025 production restart, the oil produced has been transported via pipeline to storage tanks onshore at Sable's Las Flores Canyon processing facility where it is being stored pending resumed petroleum transportation through the Santa Ynez Pipeline System or an OS&amp;T vessel. There can be no assurance that the necessary approvals will be obtained that would allow the Company to recommence sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260227076859/en/</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CONTACT:    Investor Contact:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Harrison Breaud</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vice President, Finance &amp; Investor Relations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>IR@sableoffshore.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>713-579-8111</span></p></span></div></div>",

They got some proof of it this month — and then they started selling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq fell in February, each suffering its worst month since tariff turmoil started to crop up in markets last spring. Among the hardest-hit: software businesses, tech companies and the financial firms invested in, or threatened by, the rapid evolution of AI technology.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Those losses intensified Friday, as sliding bank and tech shares weighed on the Dow industrials and the S&amp;P 500. Bank stocks suffered their worst day since April, plagued by worries about AI and problems in the private-credit market. A hotter-than-expected wholesale inflation reading also dimmed hopes of another rate cut from the Federal Reserve.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.4% on Friday, or 0.9% over the course of the month. The Dow industrials fell 1.1% on Friday, shrinking monthly gains to 0.2%. The blue-chip benchmark is still on its longest monthly winning streak since 2018.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The main story is still tech and AI uncertainty,\" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird. \"It is making investors question the fundamental underpinning of the profitability of a lot of industries.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Those worries have triggered several nauseating stock swings in recent weeks, some with relatively innocuous catalysts — an incremental update to a particular AI tool, a 7,000-word hypothetical essay on Substack or a news release from a former karaoke company. On Friday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%, bringing its monthly losses to 3.4%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In each case, investors indiscriminately dumped shares in a style that was described again and again as \"sell first, ask questions later.\" The underlying concern: AI could soon upend the business models for companies from wealth management to trucking. Not even another strong earnings report from industry bellwether Nvidia was enough to quell the market jitters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"AI was considered this very large potential revenue source,\" said Adrian Helfert, chief investment officer at Dallas-based Westwood Holdings Group. \"Now it is considered to be a potential threat to corporate businesses.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Five weeks ago, after a Friday night glass of whiskey, Helfert sat down to try his hand at \"this vibe-coding thing,\" as the investor described it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By 4 a.m. the next morning, he had used AI to build a software program that could manage the logistics of his son's travel soccer team — previously an extracurricular activity that took up chunks of time on his nights and weekends. That same day, he sent a note to his investment team with one message: The AI revolution was probably coming a lot faster than anyone expected.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When the \"SaS-pocalypse\" arrived a few weeks later — a massive selloff in software-as-a-service companies in early February that erased some $300 billion in market value — Helfert said he was less surprised than others.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The capability for building new tools and innovations is occurring at a much faster rate than we ever thought possible,\" Helfert said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The potentially disruptive impact of AI was evident again on Friday, after payments company Block — led by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey — said it would shed 40% of its staff in preparation for the AI age.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The large-cap tech trade has been losing steam since late last year, when investors first started to look beyond megacap market leaders such as Meta, Microsoft and Amazon in favor of a broader swath of blue-chip, small-cap and even international stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That kind of market broadening is often viewed as a bullish signal — but the rotation turned violent in February, with muted moves in broader indexes sometimes masking sharper moves beneath the surface.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the new AI narrative that has taken hold, the economy is still resilient — indicating that the idiosyncratic moves of the past few weeks could smooth out at some point, said Kevin Gordon, head of macro research and strategy at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The ex-tech market has been holding up relatively well,\" he said. \"That still suggests to me that we're in the middle of an uncomfortable rotation.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gordon pointed to the fact that investors haven't moved completely into risk-off mode: Stock sectors such as industrials and real estate, typically susceptible to ebbs and flows in economic growth, were among the S&amp;P 500's best-performing in February.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But traders are still flocking to some classic defensive plays. Gold futures rose roughly 11% in February, the biggest monthly increase for the precious metal since January 2012. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields dropped to 3.961% on Friday, their largest one-month decline in a year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As tech fears rattle U.S. markets, foreign markets have left domestic benchmarks in the dust. Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed 10% in February, while Korea's Kospi surged roughly 20%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And though he's skeptical of a doomsday scenario, Mayfield is hesitant to believe the new wave of AI anxiety will disappear soon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I don't think the market is going to get the clarity it wants, because it's not an easily answerable question and it's not one that can be answered in the near term,\" he said. \"This is more of an existential worry.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Hannah Erin Lang at hannaherin.lang@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

Saefong</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the U.S. attacks Iran, oil prices 'are headed into the sky along with the missiles,' says one energy-market investor</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran ramped up oil exports in recent weeks - a signal that it is \"preparing for some type of military incursion and is trying to get out as much crude as possible ahead of such an event,\" said Matt Smith of Kpler.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oil prices jolted higher on Friday, booking their biggest daily gain in over a week, after President Trump signaled the window for using diplomacy to end Tehran's nuclear program may be closing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I'd love not to use\" the U.S. military to attack Iran, \"but sometimes you have to,\" Trump told reporters outside the White House on Friday. He also said a final decision on whether to attack Iran had not yet been made.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The president's \"sometimes you have to\" bombshell lit the fuse for oil on Friday, said Manish Raj, managing director at Velandera Energy Partners.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oil prices settled at their highest levels in about seven months Friday. U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery (CL.1) (CLJ26) finished at $67.02 a barrel, up 2.8% for the month, while global benchmark Brent crude for April delivery (BRNJ26), which expired at the end of Friday's session, tallied a monthly rise of 2.5%, to $72.48.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Prices rose on fears that this weekend could \"flip the switch from talk to tomahawk,\" said Raj. Traders are \"baking in a fat $10 risk premium,\" or the extra price per barrel of oil beyond \"fair value\" based on supply and demand dynamics. \"This is pure geopolitical nitro, leaving bulls high-fiving over the chokepoint drama,\" he noted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are several \"chokepoints\" to worry about when it comes to oil infrastructure and the flow of crude in and around Iran. The country has been among the world's biggest oil producers, with a 4% share of the world's oil output in 2023.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here's what matters in terms of the oil infrastructure in surrounding Iran.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran's \"last-resort weapon\" has always been a threatened closure of the Strait of Hormuz, according to a report this week from Oxford Analytica. The waterway is a crucial maritime passage for crude transport that connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Seas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From the archives: Strait of Hormuz, the world's biggest oil chokepoint, in focus as U.S.-Iran tensions flare</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A closure of the passageway might prove difficult, but significant disruption and heightened risks would have a major impact on regional trade as well as international oil prices, the Oxford Analytica report said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Iranians don't appear to be making concessions, so \"we should expect U.S. military action,\" said Matt Smith, U.S. head analyst at Kpler. There's a \"near 80% probability\" of some form of U.S. military action against Iran, he added - noting that Trump last week gave a deadline of 10 to 15 days to make a deal with Iran, leaving this weekend as a possibility for a U.S. strike.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's particularly important as Iran has ramped up exports in recent weeks, according to Smith. It's a signal that Iran is \"preparing for some type of military incursion and is trying to get out as much crude as possible ahead of such an event,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Iran's crude-oil exports climbed significantly in February from a month earlier, data from Kpler show.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last week, Iran exported 26 million barrels, according to Smith, who pointed out that it typically exports less than half that amount. This lifted February crude exports from Iran to the highest monthly pace since July 2018, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But it's not a U.S. strike on Iran itself that would be the key concern, said Velandera Energy's Raj.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The biggest \"oil-market nightmare\" would be Iran \"flipping the Strait of Hormuz switch,\" he told MarketWatch - disrupting maritime passage through the narrow chokepoint, which carries 20% of the world's global crude.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"One missile barrage, and we're staring at a $90 barrel moonshot and sending prices into orbit faster than a Texas wildcatter striking paydirt,\" said Raj.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet a weekend strike is far from guaranteed - especially after Badr Albusaidi, Oman's foreign minister, said \"significant progress\" was made during negotiations on Thursday, while signaling talks between the U.S. and Iran are set to continue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Trump's 'we'll see what happens' vibe screams 'keep negotiating or else,'\" Raj noted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Myra P.

I believe the answer is both,” he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The executive said that firms operating as transactional middlemen and commoditized insurance product lines “should be concerned.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But for his firm he described AI as a “step-function multiplier,” enabling significant gains in productivity and enhancing organizational speed and agility. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This includes in personal lines, which comprises 38% of Baldwin’s total pro forma revenue. Around 80% of this revenue emanates from embedded insurance, which its CEO said represents “one of the ultimate moats in this environment.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“While the market is worrying about consumers asking a chatbot for insurance in our embedded businesses, we are focused on being the insurance solution of convenience sold through a trusted partner alongside a primary transaction such as buying a home, securing a mortgage or renting an apartment,” he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The executive said Baldwin’s Westwood platform, which is inclusive of business acquired from Hippo, generated $190 million in pro forma revenue in 2025 and “seamlessly embeds directly into the home-buying experience for 20 of the top 25 homebuilders in the United States.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Baldwin onboarded 12 new partners on the platform in 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company this week signed a 10-year exclusive agreement with Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation, the sixth largest independent mortgage lender in the U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“We currently expect to go live with Fairway on our Coverage Navigator platform in the second quarter,” Trevor Baldwin said. “The growing momentum here is palpable and will drive deeper moats around our embedded business.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Baldwin’s renters insurance platform, which wrote over $280 million of premium in 2025, embeds directly into property management software, allowing a renter to purchase an insurance policy at point of lease in under 60 seconds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“100% of the premium flowing through this channel is into our own proprietary products built and managed by our MGA platform, MSI. Overall, these embedded solutions are easier, more intuitive and more seamless than initiating a separate process with a stand-alone AI agent,” Trevor Baldwin said.</span></p></span></div></div>",
