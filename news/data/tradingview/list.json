The Delivra Health portfolio features innovative brands Dream Water® and LivRelief™, which deliver relief from common health issues such as sleeplessness, chronic pain and anxiety.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the first half of fiscal 2026, the Company has seen encouraging momentum in its targeted e-commerce strategy and continued growth within the Dream Water® brand. Year-to-date e-commerce sales increased 26% for Dream Water® and 28% for LivRelief™, reflecting strong consumer engagement and repeat purchasing behavior. At the same time, overall revenue has been impacted by temporary shifts in customer ordering patterns across certain retail markets, along with the transition of our licensed LivRelief™ Infused distribution channel. While these factors have created near-term variability in reported results, underlying consumer demand for the Company's core brands remains solid, and management is actively addressing fluctuations in distribution timing and engaging in channel optimization to stabilize and accelerate growth in the second half of fiscal 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Management Commentary</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"While our results this quarter reflect temporary timing variability in certain retail markets, we are encouraged by the strength of our core business fundamentals. Our targeted e-commerce strategy continues to deliver measurable growth, our U.S. expansion remains a key driver, and consumer demand for both Dream Water® and LivRelief™ continues to develop,\" said Gord Davey, President and Chief Executive Officer of Delivra Health Brands Inc. \"We are focused on disciplined execution — strengthening distribution, optimizing customer mix, advancing innovation, and investing in scalable revenue channels. As we move through the second half of fiscal 2026, our priority remains clear: stabilize retail ordering patterns, reignite growth in licensed markets, and continue expanding high-margin direct-to-consumer and U.S. retail opportunities. We believe these initiatives position us well to return to consistent revenue growth while maintaining financial responsibility.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Financial Highlights for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2025</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>(</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)</span></strong></em></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Net revenue:</span></strong><span> In the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported total net revenue of $2,433 as compared to $2,754 in same period last year, representing approximately a $321 or 12% decrease. This net decrease was primarily due to lower sales of Dream Water® in the U.S. and Canada by $183, lower sales of LivRelief™ OTC by $93 impacted by the timing of customer ordering patterns and partially, offset by growing ecommerce LivRelief™ OTC sales, and finally lower sales of LivRelief™ Infused topical creams by $45 due to the transition to a new licensed distribution partner. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Gross profit and gross profit margin:</span></strong><span> In the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported gross profit of $972 and a gross profit margin of 40% as compared to $1,294 and 47% in the same period last year. The decrease in gross profit is driven by lower revenue and higher product cost due to price increases by certain vendors and the reduction in gross profit margin was the result of a different product and customer mix in this quarter compared to same quarter last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Expenses including selling, general and administrative (\"SG&amp;A\") expenses and excluding non-cash items</span></strong><span>: In the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported expenses of $1,391 as compared to $1,544 in the same period last year, representing a $153 or 10% decrease. The decrease was mainly driven by lower investments in marketing campaigns and digital marketing programs of $182 or 32%, offset by a slight increase in general and administrative costs of $29 or 3% mainly driven by increased investments in investor relation programs. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA</span></strong><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>(1)</span></strong><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>:</span></strong><span> In the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of $(369) as compared to $(194) in the same period last year. This reduction in Adjusted EBITDA is the result of lower sales volume and gross profit as explained above. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Financial Highlights for the Six Months Ended December 31, 2025</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>(</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)</span></strong></em></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Net revenue:</span></strong><span> In the six months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported total net revenue of $5,640 compared to $5,917 in same period last year, representing a $277 or 5% decrease. This decrease was due to higher sales of Dream Water® in the U.S and Canada by $29 offset by lower sales of LivRelief™ OTC of $61 impacted by the timing of customer ordering patterns and finally lower sales of $245 of LivRelief™ Infused topical creams due to the transition to a new distribution channel in Canada. These declines were partially offset by increased e-commerce sales of LivRelief™ OTC by 28% and Dream Water® products in Canada and USA by 26% driven by strong consumer demand and online marketing. The Company is currently reviewing its market distribution strategy for licensed LivRelief™ Infused products and intends to resume its growth strategy in the second half of fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Gross profit and gross profit margin:</span></strong><span> In the six months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported year-to-date gross profit of $2,473 and a gross profit margin of 44% as compared to $2,891 and 49% in same period last year. The reduction in gross profit and gross profit margin was the result of a change in customer mix and product cost and mix. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Expenses including selling, general and administrative (\"SG&amp;A\") expenses and excluding non-cash items</span></strong><span>: In the six months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported expenses of $2,838 compared to $3,149 in the same period last year, representing a 10% decrease. Prior year fiscal 2025 first half sales and marketing expenses were higher than the first half of fiscal 2026 sales and marketing expenses by $426 or 34% given that the Company released in November 2024 two major marketing campaigns, 'Shush Your Mind' for Dream Water® and 'Quiets Chronic Pain' for LivRelief™. General and administrative costs were higher in the first half of fiscal 2026 compared with same period last year by $115 or 6% mainly as a result of higher investor relation programs and higher professional and consulting services offset by lower salaries costs. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA</span></strong><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>(1)</span></strong><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>:</span></strong><span> In the six months ended December 31, 2025, the Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of $(313) compared to $(176) in the same period last year, representing a $(137) year-over-year reduction.

Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of the Company's loss from operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and adjusted for share-based compensation, common shares issued for services, fair value effects of accounting for biological assets and inventories, asset impairment and write-downs, and other non-cash items, and is a non-IFRS measure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This measure can be used to analyze and compare profitability among companies and industries, as it eliminates the effects of financing and capital expenditures. It is often used in valuation ratios and can be compared to enterprise value and revenue. This measure does not have any standardized meaning according to IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are no comparable IFRS financial measures presented in Delivra Health's financial statements. Reconciliations of the supplemental non-IFRS measure are presented in the Company's management discussion and analysis for the three and six months ended December 31, 2025 (the \"</span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Q2 2026 MD&amp;A</span></strong><span>\"). This non-IFRS financial measure is presented because management has evaluated the financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items and believes that the non-IFRS financial measure presented provides additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the business. The Company believes that the supplemental measure provides information which is useful to shareholders and investors in understanding the Company's performance and may assist in the evaluation of the Company's business relative to that of its peers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The non-IFRS financial measure should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with the IFRS financial measures presented in the Company's financial statements.

Discovery was the loser, Netflix, which bowed out after Paramount Skydance submitted a higher bid for the media company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other competitors, like Comcast, could be winners, too, amid further media consolidation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount is paying a stiff price, and its winning bid may turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory. It offered $31 a share in cash for Warner Bros., a deal that values the company's equity at $81 billion plus about $29 billion of assumed net debt.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix shares rose 22%, to $96, this past week as investors expressed relief that the company wouldn't go forward with its richly priced offer for Warner Bros.' movie studio and streaming assets, including HBO. The acquisition would have saddled Netflix with over $50 billion of new debt and changed what had been a winning, organic, growth-focused narrative around the stock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There could be more upside in Netflix stock, given that it traded at $103 before it reached a surprise deal for Warner Bros. on Dec. 5. One of the positives for Netflix is that it will pocket a $2.8 billion breakup fee.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Back to Simply Dominating\" was the title of Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino's note on Thursday after Netflix decided not to match the Paramount offer. Supino lifted his price target to $110 from $95.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix, trading for about 30 times projected 2026 earnings, isn't a bargain, but profits per share are expected to rise at a 20% clip in the coming years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking at other affected stocks, investors may want to steer clear of what will be a heavily leveraged Paramount and take a hard look at Comcast, the cable industry leader that owns NBCUniversal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Comcast wasn't involved in the Warner Bros. battle, but it could take part in the next round of media consolidation or an alternative transaction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There has been pressure on Comcast CEO and controlling shareholder Brian Roberts to dismantle NBCUniversal after its spinoff of some cable properties, including CNBC and MSNOW (formerly MSNBC), into Versant Media in early January. Now that Netflix has passed on Warner Bros., it could consider buying NBCU assets such as the Universal movie studio or the Peacock streaming service.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield told CNBC on Friday morning that investors were barraging him with emails about the Comcast scenario after Netflix declined to match the Paramount offer late on Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Comcast shares, at about $31, trade cheaply at just eight times projected 2026 earnings on concerns about broadband competition. Supino thinks a separation of NBCU could add $10 a share or more to Comcast's stock price, given the lofty price that the business could garner.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount stock surged 21%, to $13.51, on Friday as investors reacted favorably to the Warner deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The immediate investor reaction appeared to be this: While Paramount is paying a high price for Warner Bros., the $31-a-share deal value was less than the $33-a-share figure or higher that some thought Paramount needed to pay to win.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Paramount run-up could also be fueled in part by short covering with short interest of 51 million shares, about 15% of the public float.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There was bullish news late on Friday when Paramount said that it would issue $47 billion of equity at $16.02 a share to help finance the Warner transaction. The equity deal is fully backed by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital Partners, the current controlling shareholders of Paramount, with a roughly 70% economic state.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That sale is at a 19% premium to Paramount's closing price on Friday and represents a big vote of confidence by key holders in the value of Paramount stock. Large equity sales often come at a discount to the market price.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount's share count is set to increase by about 2.9 billion, bringing the total to about four billion, Barron's estimates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount stock amounts to a leveraged play on the success of the Warner deal, which Wall Street is betting will pass regulatory scrutiny because President Donald Trump likes Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison and is probably happy that Warner's CNN cable business will be controlled by the Ellison family, including Larry's son, Paramount CEO David Ellison. Trump has criticized CNN for what he views as its left-leaning news coverage.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Assuming the deal closes, Paramount will carry an estimated $90 billion of debt, seven times projected 2026 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, before cost savings and various corporate streamlining initiatives. That's double the debt/Ebitda ratio that most companies seek to maintain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount is banking on quickly getting those cost savings of $6 billion annually — a high level relative to about $12 billion of projected 2026 Ebitda — and rapidly deleveraging its balance sheet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are better opportunities in media than Paramount. Walt Disney trades for $106, down 5% in the past year. Its shares sell for just 15 times projected 2026 earnings and 10 times projected 2026 Ebitda, with a better franchise in most respects than Paramount, led by Disney's powerhouse theme-parks business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount has a tough road to navigate. It needs to get regulatory approval for the Warner deal, which isn't a sure thing due to likely U.S., state, and international inquiries, wrote Seaport analyst David Joyce on Friday. Assuming the deal closes in 12 months, Paramount will need to integrate a much larger company, cut significant costs, and wrestle with ongoing erosion in the core media and cable parts of both Paramount and Warner.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's a tall order for David Ellison. The 43-year-old was running Skydance, a media and entertainment business with just $1 billion of annual sales, a year ago. The Skydance deal for Paramount closed last August. Backed by his father's wealth, David Ellison has parlayed his tiny Skydance into the No. 3 media and entertainment company behind Netflix and Disney.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bigger may not be better.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Prospectuses for the Funds contain this and other important information and are available free of charge by calling toll-free at 1-800-621-1675 or visiting https://www.ftportfolios.com. A prospectus should be read carefully before investing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Principal Risk Factors: You could lose money by investing in a fund. An investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed. There can be no assurance that a fund's objective(s) will be achieved. Investors buying or selling shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Please refer to each fund's prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for additional details on a fund's risks. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in a Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in a Fund. An investment in a Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. There can be no assurance that a Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. An investment in a Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges. The risks of investing in each Fund are spelled out in its prospectus, shareholder report, and other regulatory filings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ETF shares may only be redeemed directly from a fund by authorized participants in very large creation/redemption units. ETF shares may trade at a discount to net asset value and possibly face delisting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Securities of small- and mid-capitalization companies may experience greater price volatility and be less liquid than larger, more established companies whereas large capitalization companies may grow at a slower rate than the overall market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A fund that effects all or a portion of its creations and redemptions for cash rather than in-kind may be less tax efficient.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. For example, changes in governmental fiscal and regulatory policies, disruptions to banking and real estate markets, actual and threatened international armed conflicts and hostilities, and public health crises, among other significant events, could have a material impact on the value of the fund's investments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A fund normally distributes income it earns, so a fund may be required to reduce its distributions if it has insufficient income. Distributions in excess of a Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a return of capital. There may be other circumstances when all or a portion of a Fund's distribution is treated as a return of capital, for example, there are times when Fund securities are sold to cover a derivative position that generated all or a portion of the distribution that could lead to a return of capital.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A fund is susceptible to operational risks through breaches in cyber security. Such events could cause a fund to incur regulatory penalties, reputational damage, additional compliance costs associated with corrective measures and/or financial loss.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trading FLEX Options involves risks different than, and possibly greater than, investing directly in securities. A Target Outcome fund may experience substantial downside for FLEX Option positions and certain FLEX Option positions may expire worthless. There can be no guarantee that a liquid secondary market will exist for the FLEX Options and the FLEX Options may be less liquid than exchange-traded options.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In managing a fund's investment portfolio, the portfolio managers will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Market risk is the risk that a particular security, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A fund classified as \"non-diversified\" may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, a fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A fund and a fund's advisor may seek to reduce various operational risks through controls and procedures, but it is not possible to completely protect against such risks. A fund also relies on third parties for a range of services, including custody, and any delay or failure related to those services may affect a fund's ability to achieve its objectives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A fund with significant exposure to a single asset class, country, region, industry, or sector may be more affected by an adverse economic or political development than a broadly diversified fund.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Certain funds have characteristics unlike many other traditional investment products and may not be appropriate for all investors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The investment strategy is designed to deliver returns that match, or for the X series are approximately twice those of, the reference asset if a fund's shares are bought on the day on which a fund enters into the Flexible Exchange Options(R) (\"FLEX Options\") (i.e., the first day of a Target Outcome Period) and held until those FLEX Options expire at the end of the Target Outcome Period subject to a pre-determined upside cap, while limiting downside losses. If the Underlying ETF experiences gains during a Target Outcome Period, a fund will not participate in those gains on a one-to-one basis or beyond the cap. If an investor does not hold its fund shares for an entire Target Outcome Period, the returns realized by that investor may not match those a fund seeks to achieve. In the event an investor purchases fund shares after the first day of a Target Outcome Period or sells shares prior to the expiration of the Target Outcome Period, the value of that investor's investment in fund shares may not be buffered against a decline in the value of the reference asset and may not participate in a gain in the value of the reference asset up to the cap for the investor's investment period. A shareholder may lose their entire investment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Commodity prices can have a significant volatility and exposure to commodities can cause the value of a fund's shares to decline or fluctuate in a rapid and unpredictable manner.</span></p></span></div></div>",

OpenAI said that with the changes, it would have referred the account belonging to Jesse Van Rootselaar to police if it was discovered today. Police have identified Van Rootselaar as the suspect in a deadly school shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia that left eight dead and dozens injured.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Wall Street Journal has reported that OpenAI considered alerting Canadian law-enforcement authorities about interactions between Van Rootselaar and ChatGPT. OpenAI shut down Van Rootselaar's ChatGPT account after detecting a violation of its policy but didn't notify police.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Solomon said he's also scheduled to speak to OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman next week. A spokesman for Solomon said the timing and location have yet to be determined.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A meeting with Solomon marks the second senior Canadian politician Altman has agreed to speak with. British Columbia Premier David Eby said he's also set to speak to Altman, and Eby added he wants the CEO to be cognizant of the pain that families in Tumbler Ridge are feeling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A spokesperson for OpenAI confirmed that Altman has scheduled meeting with both Messrs. Solomon and Eby.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Online platforms have long debated how to balance questions of privacy with public safety in their decisions to alert law enforcement about certain users. That debate has now pulled in the AI companies that power the chatbots to which people are confiding the most intimate details of their private thoughts and lives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In its letter to Solomon, OpenAI divulged that Van Rootselaar had a second ChatGPT account. Among OpenAI's pledges is a commitment to strengthen detection systems to prevent efforts to evade safeguards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Taylor Owen, a public-policy professor at Montreal's McGill University with a specialty in media and ethics, said OpenAI has now publicly acknowledged its previous safety protocols were inadequate, and that Van Rootselaar's ability to create a second account discloses a previously unknown system error.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It means the threshold that governed the original decision, the one that resulted in Canadian police not being contacted about violent content flagged by the company's own systems, was one the company itself now considers inadequate,\" Owen said. OpenAI's pledges, he added, follows a pattern among social-media platforms \"where product safety changes come only after an incident forces them.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Solomon said he will press Altman about ensuring the pledges are fully implemented and enforced.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We will be seeking further clarity on how human review is conducted and whether Canadian context and best practices are appropriately embedded in those decisions,\" the minister said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Solomon added that intends to meet other major digital platforms in the coming weeks to advocate for a consistent approach on protecting youths and the public.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

There also were more problems on the inflation and private-credit fronts, with shares of financial stocks - banks and asset managers alike - selling off hard.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors largely blamed the collapse of U.K.-based mortgage lender Market Financial Solutions for reviving fears about more \"cockroaches\" to come in the private-credit industry. But there was also an announcement from Apollo Global Management (APO) that it had reduced a dividend at a private-credit fund and re-evaluated some asset values due to challenges with its loan portfolio.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index BKX fell nearly 5% to cap off the month. Shares of Blue Owl Capital (OWL) fell nearly 6%, while Apollo's stock was down more than 8%, FactSet data showed. Blue Owl spooked investors earlier in February when it limited investor withdrawals and sold $1.4 billion in private-credit assets, including some software loans.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other issues for investors arrived ahead of the opening bell, including a troubling inflation report that showed wholesale prices rose by 0.5% in January - faster than the 0.3% increase economists had expected. Meanwhile, what some have called the artificial-intelligence \"fear trade\" remained in full effect.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Investors are readjusting their risk budget right now in a risk-off mood on Friday, and that the AI momentum is now becoming AI anxiety,\" said Brian Mulberry, chief market strategist at Zacks Investment Management.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A 'shoot first, ask questions later' market</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Software stocks and megacap technology players like Nvidia (NVDA) continued to struggle on Friday, adding to their already punishing losses over the past month. This time, semiconductor stocks - particularly highflying memory names like Sandisk (SNDK) and Micron Technology (MU), which have soared recently while software has plunged - joined in the selling as well.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stocks trading outside of the U.S. mostly continued to trundle higher in February, with big gains particularly in the South Korean market. But in the U.S., a dour mood has been underscored by a couple of apparent contradictions, as Jay Hatfield, a portfolio manager at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, pointed out during a conversation with MarketWatch.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>First, sentiment in certain corners of the market has soured dramatically, even though the S&amp;P 500 SPX finished Friday roughly 2 percentage points shy of record territory. Second, there are seemingly contradictory narratives causing havoc within the technology sector, the largest and most important sector for the U.S. equity market's overall stability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Megacap tech stocks are struggling as investors balk at the massive spending on AI infrastructure, seemingly worried about the possibility that the return on investment might be too weak to justify the tremendous cost. Recent earnings reports from Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) elicited negative reactions from investors, while even blockbuster earnings from Nvidia earlier this week weren't enough to turn the tide.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, fears that AI might be so successful it turns whole industries on their heads have hammered shares of software companies, asset managers, commercial real-estate and brokerage firms, cybersecurity companies, and even transportation and logistics firms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"These ideas don't even make sense internally - but they're all out there, and all of these companies are going down,\" Hatfield told MarketWatch Friday. \"This is a 'shoot first, ask questions later' kind of market.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Substack post penned by Citrini Research that went viral Monday was widely credited with inspiring the worst selloff in stocks in three weeks. The report envisioned an economy in 2028 where AI is successful enough to cause widespread white-collar job destruction, without new industries emerging to absorb displaced workers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"AI has been disrupting a different segment of the economy on a daily basis,\" said Michael Hans, chief investment officer at Citizens Wealth, in a phone interview Friday. He noted that \"the narrative has been shifting\" away from talk of huge productivity gains from AI to worries over potential job losses and damage to the economy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A puzzling bid for bonds</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There also has been a sudden bid for bonds. Instead of Treasury yields rising on signs that inflation might be rearing back up, the benchmark 10-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD10Y slipped below the 4% threshold on Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read: The bond market has been doing something strange despite a hot inflation report</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Inflation can be kryptonite for bonds. But lately, inflation and the timing of any future Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts have taken a backseat to investors seeking safety from the selloff in software names, said Sweta Singh, a portfolio manager at City Different Investments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's the legacy [software-as-a-service] scared money that is being parked into the Treasury market,\" Singh told MarketWatch.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This dynamic has also helped bonds shrug off the Supreme Court's decision to rule most of President Trump's tariffs illegal, Singh noted. The ruling raised new questions about the size of U.S. fiscal deficits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In other haven plays, the U.S. dollar DXY failed to gain ground Friday against a basket of rival currencies, despite Trump saying he would \"love not to\" attack Iran. Yet gold (GC00,) which global central banks have been stockpiling as a dollar alternative, has been playing second fiddle to silver (SI00) as investors grow more nervous about a splintering world order. Both metals saw their largest monthly gains on record in February, Dow Jones Market Data showed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A \"panic\" rotation has also helped boost shares of defensive stocks in the consumer-staples sector. Investors trawling for value stocks have also boosted shares of energy and materials names.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See: February's 'panic' rotation in stocks sets the stage for more tumult in March</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite COMP finished in the red on Friday, and both indexes capped off their worst monthly drop since March 2025, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has now fallen during three of the past four months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet it wasn't all bad news.

After winning a bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount says the combined company plans to produce 30 feature films annually. Each film will receive a full theatrical release with a minimum 45-day window before becoming available on paid video-on-demand. For is most successful releases Paramount is planning for that window to last 60 to 90 days or more to maximize the audience, it says. Afterward, each film will transition to the current industry standard home video window, preserving paid video-on-demand prior to availability on streaming services, the company says.
