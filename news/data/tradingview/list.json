Awaits Written Order to Complete Sale to Partners Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners; Reports Third Quarter 2025 Earnings</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DULUTH, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 31, 2025--</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ALLETE, Inc. </span><span> ALLETE today reported third quarter 2025 earnings of 46 cents per share on net income of $27.1 million. Last year's third quarter results were 78 cents per share on net income of $45.0 million. Net income in the third quarter of 2025 and year to date primarily reflects lower sales to industrial customers and inflationary pressures at Minnesota Power, lower sales of renewable projects at the clean energy businesses and transaction related expenses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ALLETE awaits a written order from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (\"MPUC\") in order to execute on the closing of the partnership with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (\"CPP Investments\") and Global Infrastructure Partners (\"GIP\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I am grateful for the MPUC's unanimous approval of ALLETE's partnership with CPP Investments and GIP on October 3, 2025, and extremely proud of our entire ALLETE team for the thoughtful work with our many stakeholders throughout the regulatory process — all as they continue to work diligently to execute our Sustainability-in-Action strategy,\" said ALLETE Chair, President, and Chief Executive Officer Bethany Owen. \"The MPUC's approval results in historic benefits for our customers, our employees, and the communities we serve. We expect to close the transaction once the written order is received from the MPUC, and we are excited for the next chapter of ALLETE's wonderful history with these Partners that are aligned with our values and support our culture and strategy.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ALLETE's Regulated Operations segment, which includes Minnesota Power, SWLP and the Company's investment in the American Transmission Company, recorded third quarter 2025 net income of $32.5 million, compared to $34.0 million in the third quarter a year ago. Net income at Minnesota Power was lower than 2024 reflecting lower margins from industrial customers, and higher operating and maintenance expense, partially offset by lower income tax expense and increased cost recovery rider revenue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ALLETE Clean Energy recorded a third quarter 2025 net loss of $3.6 million compared to net income of $3.9 million in 2024. Net income in 2025 reflected lower production, along with associated tax credits, due to transmission network outages in the SPP market. Net income in the third quarter of 2024 reflected the sale of the Whitetail wind project.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>New Energy Equity recorded 2025 third quarter net income of $1.3 million, compared to net income of $11.7 million for the same period in 2024. Net income in 2025 includes lower sales of renewable energy projects due to the timing of project closings. These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings from tax equity financed solar energy facilities and higher investment tax credits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Corporate and Other businesses, which include BNI Energy, ALLETE Properties and our investments in renewable energy facilities, recorded a net loss of $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to a net loss of $4.6 million in 2024. Net income in 2025 reflects lower merger-related expenses compared to 2024, and lower income tax expense. Merger-related expenses were $3.1 million after-tax in 2025 compared to $3.8 million in 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Results for 2025 have been negatively impacted by lower industrial margins as a result of lower sales to taconite customers at Minnesota Power which are expected to continue through the remainder of 2025,\" said ALLETE Vice President — Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Treasurer Jeff Scissons. \"As a result of the transaction, historic customer, clean-energy, workforce and governance commitments have been made by our Partners. Approximately $200 million of value including rate credits, an immediate return on equity reduction and rate case stay-out provision will be recognized by Minnesota Power customers, while maintaining existing charitable and economic investments will benefit ALLETE stakeholders and our communities. The rate case stay-out provision will have an impact on 2026 financials, but it is a material benefit to all Minnesota Power customers.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ALLETE is an energy company headquartered in Duluth, Minn. In addition to its electric utilities, Minnesota Power and Superior Water, Light and Power of Wisconsin, ALLETE owns ALLETE Clean Energy, based in Duluth, BNI Energy in Bismarck, N.D., New Energy Equity in Annapolis, MD, and has an eight percent equity interest in the American Transmission Co.

A \"non-GAAP financial measure\" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the company's financial statements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company include presentations of earnings (loss) per share. ALLETE's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by removing the effect of variances in GAAP reported results of operations that are not indicative of changes in the fundamental earnings power of the Company's operations. Management believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is appropriate and enables investors and analysts to more accurately compare the company's ongoing financial performance over the periods presented.</span></p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><span> </span><br/><span>                              ALLETE, Inc. </span><br/><span>                    Consolidated Statement of Income </span><br/><span>             Millions Except Per Share Amounts -

Discovery's streaming and studios business, according to a report.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both media stocks were rising ahead of the opening bell. Netflix shares climbed 2.6% to $1,117. Warner Bros. rose 2.5% to $22.15.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Futures tracking the S&amp;P 500 were 0.7% higher, boosted by solid quarterly earnings from Apple and Amazon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix is retaining the investment bank Moelis &amp; Co. as a financial advisor as it actively considers a Warner Bros. bid, and has been granted access to key financial information, Reuters reported, citing three people familiar with the matter. Moelis, Netflix, and Warner Bros. didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Barron's.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The deal would give Netflix control over the rival HBO Max streaming service, as well as intellectual property like DC Comics and Harry Potter. That would feed the tech giant's flywheel model, a self-sustaining cycle of growth in which more subscribers means more money to spend on content, which in turn attracts even more users.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The news could kickstart a bidding war. Warner Bros' has already rejected three offers from Paramount Skydance, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month, citing people familiar with the matter. Its last offer was for $23.50 a share, the people said, which is still way below the $40 a share level that Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav is reportedly aiming for.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix announced a 10-for-1 stock split late Thursday, which it said would help reset shares to a range that would make it easier for employees taking part in an options program to buy in. The stock has climbed 22% this year, although third-quarter earnings took some of the shine off a bigger rally, as a continuing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities led to the company missing Wall Street's profit target.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Its forthcoming five-year economic plan outlines ways to \"safeguard the multilateral trading system and promote broader international economic flows.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beyond messaging, China has also taken action. During a trip to Malaysia last week, Chinese Premier Li Qiang attended the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Kuala Lumpur and signed an upgraded China-ASEAN free trade deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As was the case at APEC, the contrast with the U.S. was palpable. Trump's six-hour blitz of meetings at the ASEAN forum achieved four trade deals — but none of them reduced U.S. trade barriers and some included further threats. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They stipulated that if a country deepens relations with another that \"jeopardizes essential U.S. interests\" it would face more levies, in what experts say is a reference to China.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The upgraded free trade agreement only reinforces China's dominant posture in terms of regional economic engagement,\" Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center think-tank, said in reference to the China-ASEAN deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"In comparison, U.S. bilateral trade deals with individual countries are much more circumstantial and limited in their scope.\" </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>PRICE OF FREE TRADE</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Although no policy breakthroughs are expected at APEC, Xi's presence at the summit, along with Li's at ASEAN, sends a powerful message about China investing in relationship-building with regional countries, say analysts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sun said that compared to China's consistent presence, U.S. \"inevitably appears selective and conditional\".</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Xi will hold meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Japan's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Friday and both meetings are likely to be difficult, given Takaichi's hardline conservative bent and China's ongoing trade dispute with Canada.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But countries in the region are also wary of China's economic dominance, its own willingness to use trade barriers as a weapon, and its export-led model flooding other countries with cheap goods that creates fears of deindustrialisation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China this month said it would dramatically ratchet up its restrictions on rare earths exports, including outside of China's borders, sending shockwaves through already brittle global supply chains. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"China is very powerful, a big country in terms of economy, and they try to make use of these U.S. tariff issues in order to pretend as if they are the guardian or champion of the free trade system,\" said Japanese foreign ministry spokesperson Toshihiro Kitamura on the sidelines of the ASEAN meeting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"But for Japan, it's not true. As I said, for example, the rare earths issue, they try to utilise their own resources in order to impose their positions on politics to others. So we don't think that they are champions of the free trade system.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Eric Olander of the China Global South Project added that China's strategy was \"through expanded trade, infrastructure development, and supply chain logistics to bind this region to the Chinese economy to the point where it eventually becomes totally unfeasible for countries to extricate themselves from their reliance on Chinese economic engagement.\"</span></p></span></div></div>",

Prices have been under pressure this week amid weak demand and rising output. High inventories in Malaysia and substitution impact from soybean oil are also weighing, Guangzhou Futures says in commentary.
