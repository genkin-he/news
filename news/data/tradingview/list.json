The debt then reappears on the balance sheet a few days after quarter end, it added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Our key takeaway from this behavior is that distribution cuts are so worrisome that some bad actors are playing Enron-like accounting games,\" the letter said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The firms are using repo-like loans from one particular investment bank to mask debt, the letter says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rubric Capital did not name the bank nor the BDCs involved and Reuters was unable to independently verify whether this practice is being deployed and at what scale.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rubric Capital declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The private credit market has been gripped by anxiety in recent months since the bankruptcies of auto-parts maker First Brands and subprime lender Tricolor last year. The fallout has sharpened scrutiny of a market that has grown quickly, drawing large institutional investment and rising corporate lending in recent years. A renewed bout of uncertainty has flared up in recent weeks. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    The BDC industry oversees over $300 billion in assets under management and accounts for roughly one quarter of direct lending in the United States, according to a Bank for International Settlements note in July. The closed-end investment vehicles can be private or listed on stock exchanges.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Enron went bankrupt in 2001 after using off-balance-sheet vehicles and other accounting tricks to hide tens of billions of dollars of debt.  </span></p></span></div></div>",
