Some experts have praised investors’ resilience, suggesting that the “real story” is not in the recent outflows.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>ETFs Investors Hold Strong Despite Market Downturn</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Thursday, Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute, affirmed that Bitcoin ETF investors have “largely displayed diamond hands” during the recent crypto market downturn.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The flagship crypto has seen a 48.2% correction from its October 6, 2025, all-time high (ATH), recording five consecutive months of strong bleeding after the October 10 market crash.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since then, spot BTC ETFs have seen about $6.5 billion in outflows, the expert observed, which he considers a “drop in the bucket” compared to the $55 billion in cumulative total net inflows that the category has seen since launching in January 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It’s worth noting that crypto-based investment products have seen five weeks of outflows this year, with Bitcoin having the weakest sentiment among major assets amid the negative market sentiment of the past month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to SoSoValue data, BTC funds have recorded $3.81 billion in net outflows since January 23, starting the week with $203.82 million in outflows on Monday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, Geraci highlighted potential renewed demand for the investment products as the category sees a three-day streak of consistent inflows. Notably, Bitcoin ETFs have seen over $1 billion in inflows over the past three days, setting the stage for their potential biggest week since mid-January.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The ETF expert emphasized that 50% drawdowns “are a walk in the park for long-time BTC investors,” but observed that newer ETF investors also appear unfazed by the current market conditions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“Not first time btc has experienced 50% decline &amp; likely won’t be the last. ETF investors clearly aren’t panicking, though. Apparently buying the dip,” he wrote on X.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Bitcoin ETFs Strength Is The ‘Real Story’</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas backed Geraci’s comment, praising the remarkable performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs over the past two years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“As an ETF watcher, you know just how absurd this strength amid a 50% drawdown,” Balchunas stated. “This is the real story, vs focusing on the $6b that came out, which most stories do.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“Further, the narrative that crypto is ‘paying the price’ for getting financialized is absurd. $55b in net new cash in two years is the opposite of paying the price,” he added on X.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a recent interview, the senior analyst observed that the amount of Bitcoin held by ETFs is only down around 6% despite the market pullback. He noted that these types of corrections happen to every asset, including bonds and stocks, before recovering.</span></p><div class=\"blockquote-xrkxvh37\"><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>Stocks have the same thing. Every time stocks go down, I remind myself and then other people that stocks have a 100% perfect record of coming back to hit all-time highs from a downturn. So, why would I worry that much, right?</span></p><span> </span></div><p class=\"\"><span>Balchunas affirmed that these assets can have “really horrible streaks, but then when they come back around, the flows come back.” He concluded that the price volatility and the negative market sentiment are “the cost of the holy grail returns that most people have gotten.”</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:889.6551724137931px;aspect-ratio:1.4827586206896552\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:cd90afe0c094b-d956397ae8ea6174e6704acc92c00129-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"Bitcoin, btc, btcusdt\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:cd90afe0c094b-d956397ae8ea6174e6704acc92c00129-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#1c1d26\"/></picture></div></button></figure></span></div></div>",

In November 2025, we began to see early signs of an improved supply-demand balance, driven by stronger-than-expected demand from energy storage systems (ESS), as well as certain supply disruptions. This led to a tighter market environment and a shift in pricing trends. We continue to observe solid demand fundamentals, and we estimate that the lithium market could grow by approximately 25% this year, led by electric vehicles (EVs) and ESS.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mr. Ramos </span><span>continued:A</span><span>t Nova Andino Litio, we are operating at full capacity to meet our customer commitments while continuing to advance our expansion plans in the Salar de Atacama.

In January of this year, we celebrated our first shipment of lithium hydroxide produced in Australia at the Kwinana refinery. Notably, lithium hydroxide from Kwinana refinery has been certified under the International Lithium Association’s Life Cycle Assessment framework, demonstrating a 37% lower emissions footprint compared to traditional hard-rock production refined in China.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mr Ramos continued: “Our Iodine and Plant Nutrition division delivered solid performance, particularly in iodine, which contributed approximately 42% of SQM’s total gross profit. By year-end, we observed record iodine prices amid tight supply conditions and strong demand, particularly from the X-ray contrast media market.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Feliz Solomon and Henna Moussavi</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Almost from the moment Iran's universities opened their gates for the start of a new term last week, it was clear the regime had another problem on its hands. Students came back dressed all in black, shouting slogans against the country's leader.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Activists are harnessing anger over last month's brutal crackdown to revive protests aimed at toppling the Islamic Republic. Led by a constellation of disparate groups, the new wave of dissent is ratcheting up domestic pressure on the regime just as it braces for a potential military showdown with the U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The students are bringing a measure of cohesion to what has otherwise been a spontaneous movement fueled by frustration over a crumbling economy. Since last week, crowds have swelled on campuses in major cities as students joined memorials for peers who were killed in the crackdown. The gatherings morphed into heated rallies where students burned the country's flag and called for the death of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Chaotic scuffles and fistfights erupted on several campuses when antiregime protesters were confronted by mobs of regime loyalists.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As the protests gathered pace, Chief Justice Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i warned that \"certain slogans and behaviors, such as burning a flag on campus, are absolutely unacceptable.\" At least half a dozen universities in cities including Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz and Urmia announced that courses would be held remotely for the next few weeks. Some said the move coincided with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, though others cited stability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Student associations responded by calling for a boycott of online classes and urging students to show up on campus anyway.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"These protests are important, because they show Iranian society is still defiant,\" said Arash Azizi, an Iranian-American historian and author of the book \"What Iranians Want .\" \"I don't think this problem of regime versus people will be resolved unless there's fundamental change. They know they can't get out of this so easily.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sustaining the protests hinges on a fragile alliance united by little more than outrage. Student activism in Iran has traditionally been split broadly among three camps representing left-leaning progressives, monarchists and regime loyalists. The last of these are often members of the Basij, a paramilitary group backed by the government that has branches in almost every high school and university. This group was instrumental in the violence that put down street protests in January.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What's emerging now, analysts say, is a coalition of convenience among progressives and monarchists on campus. Mohammad Ali Kadivar, an Iranian associate professor of sociology and international studies at Boston College, says these two camps appear to be tolerating each other as they face a shared opponent. \"For now at least, they're less hostile toward each other,\" Kadivar said. \"They agree implicitly on what they don't want, but much less on what comes next.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The broader opposition movement, much of it in exile, remains bitterly divided. Their rivalry goes back to the betrayals of the 1979 revolution, when democrats and communists helped Iran's religious clerics overthrow the monarchy. Once in power, the clerics turned on their partners, killing and imprisoning them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On campuses at least, both sides are focused on a common enemy: Khamenei. Chants of \"Death to the dictator\" rumble through courtyards. A video shared with The Wall Street Journal by the citizen-journalist network Mamlekate shows demonstrators at Tehran's Shahid Beheshti University raising their hands above their heads and flinging them from side to side — a taboo gesture mocking Khamenei, whose right arm was paralyzed during an assassination attempt in 1981.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Elsewhere, students plastered school walls with photographs of the dead. At Sharif University of Technology, they hung toy rats from trees — a reference to Khamenei hiding from his enemies in underground bunkers — according to video footage verified by Storyful, which is owned by the Journal's parent company News Corp.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What has surprised some analysts is the degree to which students have rallied behind Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's late and final shah. Pahlavi has positioned himself as a potential leader if the regime falls, and in early January he urged Iranians to join the protests that began late last year over the country's free-falling currency.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Berber Jin, Robbie Whelan and Kate Clark</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nvidia plans to unveil a new processor specially tailored to help OpenAI and other customers build faster, more efficient tools, a major shake-up to its business that is poised to reset the AI race.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company is designing a new system for \"inference\" computing, a form of processing that allows AI models to respond to queries, according to people familiar with the plans. The new platform, set to be revealed at Nvidia's GTC developer conference in San Jose next month, will incorporate a chip designed by the startup Groq, the people said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Inference computing has been the subject of intense industry competition. Rivals Google and Amazon have designed chips that compete with Nvidia's flagship systems. And the explosion of autonomous coding in the tech workforce has created demand for new chips that can more efficiently handle complex AI-related tasks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OpenAI has agreed to become one of the largest customers of the new processor, some of the people said, representing a major win for Nvidia. The ChatGPT maker, which is one of Nvidia's largest customers, has spent the past few months shopping for more efficient alternatives to Nvidia's chips, and signed a deal with a chip startup last month that provides it with new options.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Earlier Friday, OpenAI alluded to the new processor when it announced it would sign up for a major purchase of \"dedicated inference capacity\" from Nvidia, alongside a $30 billion investment from the chip giant. It also signed a major new deal to use Amazon's Trainium chips.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nvidia has dominated the business of designing and selling GPUs — graphics processing units — a type of processor that can perform billions of simple tasks simultaneously. But for the first time since the start of the AI boom, it is confronting the limits of its flagship product. As the market shifts toward inference, Nvidia is feeling pressure from some customers to produce chips that can more efficiently power AI applications.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The chip giant's powerful Hopper, Blackwell and Rubin series GPUs are considered best-in-class for training gigantic AI models and command top prices. Most analysts estimate that Nvidia controls 90% or more of the GPU market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang has long claimed that Nvidia's GPUs are the market leader for both training and inference, and that such versatility was a key appeal of the product.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But over the past year, demand for advanced computing has shifted from training to inference as companies deploy AI agents and other tools that they hope will upend hundreds of industries and generate enormous profits from subscription fees. Agents are AI systems that act relatively autonomously to carry out tasks on behalf of users.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many companies that build and operate AI agents find that GPUs are too costly, consume too much energy and aren't as well-suited to actually running their models. With the meteoric rise of agentic AI, Nvidia is under pressure to develop inference chips that are less expensive and more energy-efficient.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last month, OpenAI signed a multibillion-dollar computing partnership with Cerebras, which offers an inference-focused chip that its CEO Andrew Feldman says is faster than Nvidia's GPUs. OpenAI entered into negotiations with Cerebras last fall after its engineers asked for a faster inference chip for agentic coding applications, The Journal previously reported.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nvidia agreed to pay $20 billion late last year to license key technologies from Groq and hire its top leadership, including founder Jonathan Ross, in one of Silicon Valley's largest-ever \"acqui-hire\" deals, The Wall Street Journal reported.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Groq designed chips that use a different architecture from Nvidia's, called \"language processing units,\" which are highly efficient for inference functions. So far, however, Nvidia has kept mum about how it intends to use Groq's technology.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI inference computing is divided into two main tasks: pre-fill, or the process by which a model interprets a user prompt, and decode, by which the model generates a response, one word at a time. Pre-fill is usually the faster of the two processes, while decode tends to be especially slow, for larger AI models.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Coding applications have emerged as one of the most important — and profitable — uses of enterprise AI, with Anthropic's Claude Code generally regarded as the market leader. But Anthropic relies primarily on chips designed by Amazon Web Services and Alphabet's Google Cloud unit, rather than by Nvidia, to power its models.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of Claude's closest competitors, however, is OpenAI's fast-growing Codex tool. The ChatGPT-maker plans to use the new Nvidia system to improve Codex, people familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Typically, Nvidia has paired its Vera chips, which are central processing units, or CPUs, with its Rubin GPUs in powerful data center servers, but some large customers have found that certain agentic AI workloads can be run more efficiently on CPUs alone.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This month, Nvidia announced an expanded partnership with Meta Platforms that included the first-ever significant CPU-only deployment to support Meta's ad-targeting AI agents. The deal offered an early window into Nvidia's strategy to look beyond the GPU to lock up pockets of the AI market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Berber Jin at berber.jin@wsj.com, Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com and Kate Clark at kate.clark@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

We don't need it, we don't want it and will not do business with them again!\" President Trump said in a post on Truth Social.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Defense Department and other agencies using Anthropic's Claude models will have a six-month phaseout period, he said, adding that there would be civil and criminal consequences if the company isn't helpful during the transition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump's announcement came shortly before the Pentagon's Friday afternoon deadline for Anthropic to agree to let the military use its models in all lawful-use cases, a concession the company had refused to make. \"We cannot in good conscience accede to their request,\" Anthropic Chief Executive Dario Amodei said on Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump and administration officials have attacked the company for that stance, while also taking exception to its push for AI regulations and its links to organizations that are big Democratic donors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shortly after the deadline, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on X that he is designating the company a supply-chain risk, impairing its ability to work with other government contractors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hegseth had previously threatened the move. The designation is normally used for companies from foreign adversaries like China that pose security threats.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Depending how aggressively the Defense Department enforces the restriction, it could mean that other companies working with the Pentagon will have to show that they don't use Claude at all, a threat that could hit swaths of Anthropic's business. \"America's warfighters will never be held hostage by the ideological whims of Big Tech,\" Hegseth said in his post.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI and security experts said the administration's actions could have a chilling effect for other businesses considering working with the Pentagon or other agencies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is a dark day in the history of American AI. The message sent to the business community and to countries around the world could not be worse,\" said Dean Ball, a former Trump administration AI adviser who is now a senior fellow at the Foundation for American Innovation, a center-right think tank. He had called for the administration not to use the supply-chain risk designation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ball said that Anthropic partners and investors including Nvidia, Amazon and Google might have to divest from the company or stop working with it if they want to continue working with the Pentagon. Some legal analysts have said it only applies to the work companies do with the military, not all private-sector business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is about Anthropic not being one of the favored companies and they're going to pay the price for not bowing down and not signing on the dotted line,\" said Jack Shanahan, who oversaw AI efforts in the military for during the first Trump administration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It basically says to any startup that's contemplating dipping its toe in the Defense Department water that they're going to grab your ankle and pull you all the way in,\" said Gregory Allen, a senior adviser focused on AI at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Allen, who previously worked on the Defense Department's AI strategy, called the move \"completely absurd.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is going to be a huge deterrent to companies thinking about serving the defense industry,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. The company said Thursday it wouldn't meet the Pentagon's conditions but was \"ready to continue our work to support the national security of the United States.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic's contract with the Pentagon is worth as much as $200 million. The company had sought to have protections written into the deal against the use of its models for autonomous weapons and mass domestic surveillance. The military has said it should have final authority to decide how the technology can be used within the law.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even absent the supply-chain risk designation, broadening the clash to include all federal agencies takes the Anthropic fight to a much larger scale than its spat with the Pentagon. The company's Claude models are being used across the government to do everything from summarize documents to analyze data. Pausing those functions to swap in alternatives could set back the government's AI and modernization efforts, AI experts have said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pentagon officials have criticized Anthropic leaders including Amodei for seeking control over the military's operations. After Claude was used in the Venezuela raid to capture former President Nicolás Maduro in January, an Anthropic employee asked a counterpart at data-mining firm Palantir, its partner, about how the technology was used. Defense Department officials learned about the exchange and viewed it as a challenge to the department's prerogative to have final say in operational matters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic has said the Palantir question was part of routine technical discussion between partners.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The new moves by the administration come as other AI companies grapple with their own red lines. OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman told staff Thursday that the company was working with the Defense Department to see if its models could be used in classified settings while maintaining the same safety guardrails Anthropic has, The Wall Street Journal reported. Employees at Google and OpenAI signed an online petition urging their companies to maintain the same red lines.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Elon Musk's xAI is currently the only AI company besides Anthropic with approval to be used in classified settings, but government agencies have raised concerns about the reliability of its Grok model and how quickly it can be substituted after Claude was embedded in the Pentagon for many months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Trump administration and Anthropic have been feuding since the start of Trump's second term. The company hired several top Biden administration officials, proposed AI regulations and guardrails and criticized the president for exporting AI chips to China, actions that upset administration officials including David Sacks, the White House AI czar.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last summer, the administration put out an executive order on \"woke AI,\" saying the government had an \"obligation not to procure models that sacrifice truthfulness and accuracy to ideological agendas.\" Anthropic was widely seen as a target of the order. The company has said it isn't woke or political and previously called such attacks baseless.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Pentagon has said it didn't want to use Claude for autonomous weapons, mass surveillance or other illegal uses, but that it needs to have full control over the technology it deploys.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Shalini Ramachandran, Heather Somerville and Amrith Ramkumar</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Officials at multiple federal agencies have raised concerns about the safety and reliability of Elon Musk's xAI artificial-intelligence tools in recent months, highlighting continuing disagreements within the U.S. government about which AI models to deploy, according to people familiar with the matter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The warnings preceded the Pentagon's decision this week to put xAI at the center of some of the nation's most sensitive and secretive operations by agreeing to allow its chatbot, Grok, to be used in classified settings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Grok-4 \"does not meet the safety and alignment expectations required\" for general federal use within the General Services Administration and an experimental federal AI platform, said a Jan. 15 executive summary of a GSA report flagging Grok safety issues, reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The larger 33-page report, which discussed public safety incidents and the results of the GSA's own testing, concluded that even limited government use of Grok would require strict and layered safety oversight, without which its inclusion \"would pose elevated and difficult-to-manage safety risk.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Throughout the government, agencies are racing to deploy AI for a host of purposes, but the debate over which models to use has become increasingly political. Senior U.S. officials, including at the White House, view Anthropic's outspoken stances on safety and ties to big Democratic donors as potentially making the company too \"woke\" to be a reliable provider, people familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>President Trump said Friday the federal government would stop working with Anthropic and directed every federal agency to immediately cease use of its technology. The Pentagon had earlier given Anthropic a Friday deadline to agree to looser rules on its use by the U.S. military.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic was the only developer approved for classified use before the deal between xAI and the military. The looser controls on Grok, and Musk's absolutist stance on free speech, have made it a more attractive choice to the Pentagon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other officials have questioned whether Grok's looser controls present risks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ed Forst, the top official at the GSA, the procurement arm of the federal government, in recent months sounded an alarm with White House officials about potential safety issues with Grok, people familiar with the matter said. Other GSA officials under him had also raised safety concerns about Grok, which they viewed as sycophantic and too susceptible to manipulation or corruption by faulty or biased data — creating a potential system risk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the time, in late December and early January, Grok was under fire for allowing sexualized editing of photos, including of children. Government officials saw the issue as representative of how Grok could be exploited by bad actors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The matter reached Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, who called a senior xAI executive about the concerns, the people said. The executive told her that xAI was working on addressing the safety issues that made Grok overcompliant. Josh Gruenbaum, a senior GSA acquisitions official recruited through Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, assured government officials that the government platform of Grok was separate from the public one. Wiles was satisfied, the people said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Musk, who has said he is committed to preventing child exploitation, announced in January that the company would limit the image-generation and editing tools to paying customers. He and xAI didn't respond to requests for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In recent weeks, GSA officials were told to put xAI's logo on a tool called USAi, which is essentially a sandbox for federal employees to experiment with different AI models. Grok hadn't been made accessible through USAi largely due to safety concerns, and it remains off the platform, people familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The website shows xAI's logo but only offers models from Anthropic, Google and Meta .</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A team at the GSA studying AI has circulated the report flagging Grok's safety problems to top agency officials, the people said. The larger report noted that Grok's safety failures aren't limited to edge cases but \"reflect a broader tendency toward unsafe compliance in unguarded configurations.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a statement, Gruenbaum said the agency takes AI safety seriously. \"We rigorously evaluate frontier AI models, including xAI, through a comprehensive internal review process. In this instance, we followed established procedures and maintain our determination to keep it on schedule,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Two weeks ago, Matthew Johnson, the Pentagon's chief of responsible AI, stepped down in part over his concerns that safety and governance had become an afterthought amid the Defense Department's intense push to expand AI capabilities, people familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Previously, Johnson's team had circulated memos that had highlighted Grok's safety issues and questioned whether it was aligned with government ethics and standards. Those notes had been sent up their chain of command at the Pentagon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reached for comment, Johnson pointed to a LinkedIn post announcing his departure where he said he was proud of his team of \"true, quiet professionals, who had outsized impact and undersized recognition\" in the DOD's Responsible AI Division: \"We were continually faced with impossible situations, but somehow always delivered through a combination of grit &amp; repeated all-nighters.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that the department \"is excited to have xAI, one of America's national champion frontier AI companies onboard and looks forward to deploying Grok to its official AI platform GenAI.mil in the very near future.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The National Security Agency, which oversees much of the country's intelligence gathering and processing, conducted a classified review in November 2024 of large language models, including Grok. It determined Grok had particular security concerns that other models, including Anthropic's Claude, didn't, people familiar with the review said. Its conclusion served as a red flag that deterred some parts of the Pentagon from using Grok, the people said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The use of Anthropic's Claude in the U.S. military's operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro last month intensified its tense dispute with the Pentagon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic's usage guidelines prohibit Claude from being used to facilitate violence, develop weapons or conduct surveillance, and the company has refused to let the military use its models in all lawful scenarios. xAI has agreed to that language.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>xAI got a foothold in the Pentagon through a July contract from the AI office worth up to $200 million, which was also awarded to Google, OpenAI and Anthropic. Google and OpenAI have approval for use in unclassified settings but not classified activities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman told staff Thursday that the company was working with the Defense Department to see if its models could be used in classified settings while maintaining the same safety guardrails Anthropic has, The Wall Street Journal reported. Employees at Google and OpenAI signed an online petition urging their companies to maintain the same red lines.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Until recently, the military has leaned on Claude over Grok because it is seen by many in the industry as a more reliable model, AI and security analysts said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I do not believe they are peers in performance right now across all of the capabilities that matter to a customer like the Department of War,\" said Gregory Allen, a senior adviser focused on AI at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. He previously worked on the Defense Department's AI strategy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the Biden administration, the Chief Digital and AI Office, which is part of the Pentagon, declined to pursue any use of Grok, people familiar with the matter said. The concerns included that Grok made it difficult to track the data sources used to train the model, didn't follow federal government standards for responsible AI and had weak guardrails for safety. xAI didn't sufficiently try to hack its own technology to identify and fix vulnerabilities, a process known in technology as red teaming, the people said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>People who have reviewed Grok in the government setting said that recent testing shows the chatbot is more susceptible than other models to \"data poisoning,\" in which manipulated, biased or inaccurate data corrupts the underlying data sets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, U.S. officials have determined Grok to be effective at imitating an adversarial actor, which is useful, for example, in war gaming, people familiar with the discussions said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Shalini Ramachandran at Shalini.Ramachandran@wsj.com, Heather Somerville at heather.somerville@wsj.com and Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "title": "Tech Trader: Nvidia Is Stuck in a Rut, but There's Hope For Software Stocks — Barron's",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Adam Levine</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Thursday morning, I woke up to an inbox full of analyst notes praising another great quarter from the artificial-intelligence chip leader, Nvidia, which had reported its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings the previous afternoon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Acceleration at a Scale Never Seen\" was the title of Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes' note.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Generational growth at inspirational valuation,\" said Vivek Arya of Bank of America.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The laudatory missives multiplied.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, the stock fell by 5.5% on Thursday. Despite strong results and the accelerating 2026 AI data-center buildout — of which Nvidia remains the primary beneficiary — the stock has been stuck in the mud for months. Since October, it has moved sideways, down about 1%, while the S&amp;P 500 index rose by 3.3%. And despite beating earnings expectations 13 quarters in a row, the stock declined the next day by an average of 3% after the last three of them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Negative narratives have crept in:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Growth deceleration. This once seemed like a real concern. Year-over-year sales growth peaked at 265% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, and it declined through the second quarter of 2026. But the growth rate turned back up in the second half of the fiscal year, and Nvidia's guidance was for more acceleration in the current quarter. This narrative is on life support.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Competition. Nvidia's largest customers, the \"hyperscalers,\" are looking to diversify their supply chains and not be so dependent on Nvidia. Meta Platforms just signed a deal with Advanced Micro Devices for its AI chips. The three big cloud providers -- Amazon.com, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- all make their own custom chips they would like customers to use, and there are many chip start-ups. Alphabet is getting the most traction so far. Nvidia has a deal with start-up Groq for its AI chips.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Risky commitments. To deal with supply-chain shortages, Nvidia has committed to $95 billion of inventory purchases, almost all of which will be spent this year. In all of fiscal 2026, Nvidia had $62 billion in cost-of-goods-sold, so this is a major supply commitment, and some of these orders may not be cancelable. A year from now, this will either look like a genius move that kept Nvidia's industry-leading gross profit margin high or a disastrous example of hubris that destroyed its gross margin.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Limitations of the data-center boom. Nvidia's main vendors are seeing tight supply. Land, skilled construction crews, and power are becoming harder to come by. The hyperscaler customers have given sky-high guidance for 2026 capital expenditures, but how long can that last? They have substantial cash flow of their own, but they are reaching the limits of it with their even larger capital budgets. They are already dipping into debt. How much will investors stomach?</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Circular financing. Nvidia had over $100 billion in operational cash flow last year, and it has been spreading that wealth around throughout the AI start-up ecosystem. In fiscal 2026 it made $17.5 billion in start-up equity investments, and another $13 billion to Groq -- and it has commitments for another $11.4 billion this year. On Friday, Nvidia invested $30 billion in OpenAI. Many of these companies are Nvidia customers, or customers of customers, and a good portion of those investments will wind up in Nvidia's pockets. These are big numbers, but they pale in comparison to Nvidia's sales: $216 billion in fiscal 2026 and a projected $350 billion this year. Nvidia is supporting the ecosystem, not the other way around, and in the process it is taking a stake in a range of AI start-ups.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Nothing seemed to change this week for Nvidia, but there was some light at the end of the tunnel for enterprise software makers, and they're hoping it's not a train headed their way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These stocks hit the bricks at the end of last year, and this year they have been getting demolished. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector exchange-traded fund was down 27% through this past Monday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But then one of their tormentors became a patron saint.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Much of the stocks' woes were attributable to AI start-up Anthropic's agent software. Agents use language models like Anthropic's Claude to accomplish a complex series of tasks from simple conversational prompts, which led to fears that business software is replaceable by AI. On Feb. 5, Anthropic released tools for specific agent tasks in several areas like legal and finance. The software ETF capped eight straight trading days of declines with a 5% drop in what felt like capitulation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But on Tuesday, Anthropic gave a presentation aimed at increasing AI adoption among business customers, something that's been slow going. The demonstration was all about how Anthropic's agents work...with software. Only four minutes into the hourlong show, Anthropic presenters began bragging about how much enterprise software from Microsoft, Salesforce, Google, Docusign, and others works with Claude agents. The company also announced a new integration with Intuit's financial software the same day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Anthropic wants to partner with Intuit, not kill Intuit. They want to partner with Salesforce. They don't want to replace Salesforce,\" said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill in a Barron's Q&amp;A this week. \"They're not going to replace some of these systems that we use. They will make them better. There's no doubt they will create new applications that potentially can compete. But we think it's more of a partnership than a full eviction of everyone in the software city.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And software stocks did turn on the Anthropic demonstration. The software ETF rose three days running, up 7.4% in all. But I'm not ready to call the bottom yet. Sentiment around the sector remains on a hair trigger, and it won't take much to knock it back down, like a fictional Substack post on Monday that sent the software ETF down 4.8%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Friday, the mood turned again, and the software ETF was down 2% in midday trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Steven M. Sears</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>How do you price chaos?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That is the essence of this moment in market time — and almost no one has an answer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This means the stock and options markets should be stuck in a volatile reactionary state for a prolonged period. Many investors will no doubt make rash decisions in reaction to a steady flow of dramatic news.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The leading cause of chaos emanates from President Donald Trump's retaliation against the Supreme Court ruling that curtailed his tariff diplomacy. Analysts are opining about the impact on global trade, which influences corporate earnings, but it's too early to draw significant conclusions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, the president is amassing attack forces around Iran, a founding member of OPEC. An attack would disrupt oil markets and infect the stock and options markets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some relief could come when the Federal Reserve's interest-rate committee concludes a two-day meeting on March 18, but that isn't looking likely. Recent reports indicate that Fed governors disagree about lowering rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To further cloud matters, November's midterm elections could see Trump lose control of Congress. If Democrats take the House of Representatives, Trump's often pro-market agenda would stall.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These unusual risks should keep most investors in an event-driven trading mode. Expect them to view risk and opportunity in snapshots of time, making short-term wagers on events, rather than investing in thematic trends that evolve over longer periods.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Every Trump social-media post, unexpected news headline, and economic report — not to mention the odd apocalyptic report on artificial intelligence — thus has even more power than usual to roil investor sentiment and increase options volatility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For true long-term investors with the stamina to let time and dividends compound returns of blue-chip stocks, chaos is immaterial. But few such people exist.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last week, we focused on how to hedge with put-option spreads. This week, we focus on a strategy for making decisions amid uncertainty. Our \"time arbitrage\" strategy, which monetizes short-term volatility for long-term gain, provides a simple framework.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pick any stock you can own for three to five years, but ideally longer. What that stock declines, the sharper the better, sell a put option that expires in one month or less with a strike just below the stock price. (Puts give the holder the right to sell an asset at a set price and time.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During selloffs, the put's implied volatility increases as investors buy puts to hedge stocks. That's why seasoned investors like selling puts during downturns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You get paid more for the risk of selling options during volatility events,\" says Michael Schwartz, Oppenheimer's chief options strategist.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consider JPMorgan Chase. The stock is down about 11% since its early January peak, and it looks weak. Still, the bank is among the most important in the world, and that isn't in doubt.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With the stock at $297.30, a long-term investor could sell the March $292.50 put for about $7. If the stock is below $292.50 at expiration, investors must buy the stock. If the stock exceeds $292.50 at expiration, investors can keep the put premium, making a nice return just for agreeing to buy the stock. During the past 52 weeks, JPMorgan has ranged from $202.16 to $337.25.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These trades always seem enticing when discussed. Everyone likes getting paid to buy stock in great companies. In reality, though, it's the options premium they really like, and they tend to get cranky if the stock declines and they must buy it. So be realistic, and use this strategy only on stocks you want to own. If you can do that, chaos becomes a useful ally to building long-term wealth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Email: editors@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Andrew Bary</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The big winner from the battle for Warner Bros. Discovery was the loser, Netflix, which bowed out after Paramount Skydance submitted a higher bid for the media company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other competitors, like Comcast, could be winners, too, amid further media consolidation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount is paying a stiff price, and its winning bid may turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory. It offered $31 a share in cash for Warner Bros., a deal that values the company's equity at $81 billion plus about $29 billion of assumed net debt.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix shares rose 22%, to $96, this past week as investors expressed relief that the company wouldn't go forward with its richly priced offer for Warner Bros.' movie studio and streaming assets, including HBO. The acquisition would have saddled Netflix with over $50 billion of new debt and changed what had been a winning, organic, growth-focused narrative around the stock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There could be more upside in Netflix stock, given that it traded at $103 before it reached a surprise deal for Warner Bros. on Dec. 5. One of the positives for Netflix is that it will pocket a $2.8 billion breakup fee.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Back to Simply Dominating\" was the title of Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino's note on Thursday after Netflix decided not to match the Paramount offer. Supino lifted his price target to $110 from $95.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix, trading for about 30 times projected 2026 earnings, isn't a bargain, but profits per share are expected to rise at a 20% clip in the coming years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking at other affected stocks, investors may want to steer clear of what will be a heavily leveraged Paramount and take a hard look at Comcast, the cable industry leader that owns NBCUniversal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Comcast wasn't involved in the Warner Bros. battle, but it could take part in the next round of media consolidation or an alternative transaction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There has been pressure on Comcast CEO and controlling shareholder Brian Roberts to dismantle NBCUniversal after its spinoff of some cable properties, including CNBC and MSNOW (formerly MSNBC), into Versant Media in early January. Now that Netflix has passed on Warner Bros., it could consider buying NBCU assets such as the Universal movie studio or the Peacock streaming service.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield told CNBC on Friday morning that investors were barraging him with emails about the Comcast scenario after Netflix declined to match the Paramount offer late on Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Comcast shares, at about $31, trade cheaply at just eight times projected 2026 earnings on concerns about broadband competition. Supino thinks a separation of NBCU could add $10 a share or more to Comcast's stock price, given the lofty price that the business could garner.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount stock surged 21%, to $13.51, on Friday as investors reacted favorably to the Warner deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The immediate investor reaction appeared to be this: While Paramount is paying a high price for Warner Bros., the $31-a-share deal value was less than the $33-a-share figure or higher that some thought Paramount needed to pay to win.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Paramount run-up could also be fueled in part by short covering with short interest of 51 million shares, about 15% of the public float.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There was bullish news late on Friday when Paramount said that it would issue $47 billion of equity at $16.02 a share to help finance the Warner transaction. The equity deal is fully backed by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital Partners, the current controlling shareholders of Paramount, with a roughly 70% economic state.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That sale is at a 19% premium to Paramount's closing price on Friday and represents a big vote of confidence by key holders in the value of Paramount stock. Large equity sales often come at a discount to the market price.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount's share count is set to increase by about 2.9 billion, bringing the total to about four billion, Barron's estimates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount stock amounts to a leveraged play on the success of the Warner deal, which Wall Street is betting will pass regulatory scrutiny because President Donald Trump likes Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison and is probably happy that Warner's CNN cable business will be controlled by the Ellison family, including Larry's son, Paramount CEO David Ellison. Trump has criticized CNN for what he views as its left-leaning news coverage.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Assuming the deal closes, Paramount will carry an estimated $90 billion of debt, seven times projected 2026 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, before cost savings and various corporate streamlining initiatives. That's double the debt/Ebitda ratio that most companies seek to maintain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount is banking on quickly getting those cost savings of $6 billion annually — a high level relative to about $12 billion of projected 2026 Ebitda — and rapidly deleveraging its balance sheet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are better opportunities in media than Paramount. Walt Disney trades for $106, down 5% in the past year. Its shares sell for just 15 times projected 2026 earnings and 10 times projected 2026 Ebitda, with a better franchise in most respects than Paramount, led by Disney's powerhouse theme-parks business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount has a tough road to navigate. It needs to get regulatory approval for the Warner deal, which isn't a sure thing due to likely U.S., state, and international inquiries, wrote Seaport analyst David Joyce on Friday. Assuming the deal closes in 12 months, Paramount will need to integrate a much larger company, cut significant costs, and wrestle with ongoing erosion in the core media and cable parts of both Paramount and Warner.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's a tall order for David Ellison. The 43-year-old was running Skydance, a media and entertainment business with just $1 billion of annual sales, a year ago. The Skydance deal for Paramount closed last August. Backed by his father's wealth, David Ellison has parlayed his tiny Skydance into the No. 3 media and entertainment company behind Netflix and Disney.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bigger may not be better.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

La Monica</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jim Paulsen isn't your typical \"retired Grampa,\" even though that's how he describes himself in Paulsen Perspectives, the Substack newsletter that he started writing in February 2024. And even though he has technically been retired since the end of 2022, he is still analyzing the economy and markets, much as he did for 40 years as a chief investment strategist. His career included two decades in the institutional investment unit of Wells Fargo, and another five at the Leuthold Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now that Paulsen has no boss but himself, he has the freedom and flexibility to write about what he chooses. \"I love the interplay between emotions in trading and the math of the economy and markets,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paulsen, who will turn 68 in early March, typically writes two times a week for nearly 7,500 subscribers, with recent posts focusing on bond yields, consumer confidence, and sector rotation. Barron's spoke with him in mid-February about what he's seeing in the markets and the economy, and why he remains largely bullish despite the recent artificial-intelligence and tech-stock pullback.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An edited version of the conversation follows.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Barron's : After three strong years for the stock market, do you worry that 2026 will be a down year?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jim Paulsen: I'm always worried to some degree. But I'm still more in the bullish camp. The biggest thing that keeps me bullish at this point is that Main Street confidence is in the tank, and major players in the private sector are pessimistic and cautious. They're worried about the future. I find that's always a great time to be invested.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is a bearish bull. Gold and stocks usually move in opposite directions. This is the only bull market where gold and stocks have both gone up. Also, the stock market is going up while confidence is deteriorating. This bull market has been led by a small cadre of new-era stocks, and everything else hasn't participated yet. That means there are many stocks that could still participate before the bull run is over.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>How concerned should investors be about the divide in the economy and markets between the haves and have-nots?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most of the economy entered a recession in 2022 and never emerged. But the new-era stocks put up scorching gains through that period. They have become so big [in market capitalization] that they have been wagging the dog in this market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is a reason that people on Main Street have said for years that they aren't feeling good. Weird things are going on. We have a recessionary expansion. People talk about the split of the K-shape economy — rich versus poor. I think it is more of a split between the new era [stocks] and the old era [stocks]. These new-era stocks are looking tired.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Why is that? We have had unconventional and contractionary monetary policy since 2022. This bull market started with worries about inflation and the Federal Reserve tightening. It has persisted mostly through a tightening environment. Bond yields went up and never came down much. The dollar went up dramatically until recently. The yield curve inverted for the longest time ever. The broader market should do better from here than the new-era stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now that the Fed is cutting rates again, you have talked about passing the baton in the market. Where are the new leaders?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The new-era economy has divorced itself from traditional forces. It is driven by its own innovation cycle. Yet, two important things are going on. There is dramatic over-ownership of new-era stocks, but they are no longer outperforming. Also, the Fed has eased monetary policy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Given lower interest rates and a decline in the dollar, the rally has broadened, and more stocks are now doing better. Small-caps, cyclical stocks, international stocks, and the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 index are starting to perform better. We are finally getting policy support for parts of the market that need it to do better.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Also, the capital spending cycle is long in the tooth. Part of the appeal of those winning stocks was their absolute performance, and their relative performance compared with the rest of the market. Things are changing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The broadening trend may be welcome, but will it continue?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If the rest of the economy is finally getting policy support, new-era stocks won't be worth as much. They are losing some of their appeal, even if their fundamentals haven't changed much.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In some ways, we now have a bull within a bull. Tech stocks won't die, but other sectors are coming back to life, which is like starting a new bull market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>How different is the AI revolution from the revolution at the dawn of the internet in the late 1990s? Will there be an AI bust? Has it already begun?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is only one way to end a stock market bubble. It has to burst, and the market needs to crash. I'm not sure AI is in a bubble. It doesn't seem nearly as big as the dot-com bubble, and the dichotomies don't seem extreme, as in the 1990s.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When tech stocks peaked in March 2000, the broad market rolled over. The performance of the S&amp;P 500 was tied directly to the internet sector. That hasn't happened this time around. Tech stocks have been relatively weak since the end of October, but the S&amp;P 500 has held its highs, and has even gone up since then. That can happen only because the baton is passing to a broader array of stocks. Their strength is compensating for the weakness in tech.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This sounds like a good argument for diversification.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Almost all investors let their exposure to new-era stocks rise in recent years. We did it purposefully or passively, via index funds. Heck, who could sell these stocks when they outperformed consistently and had such dynamic stories?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I don't advise selling all your tech stocks now. But if you trim your weighting in a sector that accounts for about 40% of the value of the S&amp;P 500, and put your money in something else, such as small-caps, that seems sensible. We don't need to have a tech crash that spells the end of the bull market. The market can keep rising as we find new winners.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Let's switch gears, or assets. The dollar has weakened in the past year. Where does that leave investors?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The dollar's performance has been a big driver of international stocks' outperformance, but it is just one factor. People have an odd emotional reaction to the dollar — to the idea that a strong dollar is good and a weak dollar is anti-American. I never understood that. The dollar is just like interest rates. When it goes up, it can be a restrictive force.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Where should people invest overseas?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A weaker dollar means international stocks should keep winning. I am more intrigued by emerging and frontier markets than developed markets. Emerging markets excluding China look attractive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The pandemic was a disaster for China. It highlighted to every company in the world the need to diversify supply chains. You want to have exposure to places like Vietnam, and Central and South America, as well.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>President Donald Trump has nominated Kevin Warsh as the next Fed chair. What would a Warsh Fed mean for monetary policy?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We don't have an inflation problem, so the Fed doesn't need to raise rates. Also, I am not worried about threats to the Fed's independence. Fed governors are appointed by politicians. There is political bias throughout the Fed. But there is political bias everywhere; that is nothing new.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ultimately, the Fed has a bigger boss: the economy. We have a weird economy now: Gross domestic product is still growing, while the unemployment rate has risen. Some parts of the labor market, such as manufacturing, have seen no job growth in the past year. It will be difficult for the Fed to stand pat. Also, GDP is distorted; the economy isn't doing as well as the numbers suggest. They have been impacted by trade flows and the massive budget deficit. The Fed is going to have to bring more juice [in the form of lower rates] regardless of who is on the Board of Governors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What will that mean for fixed-income investors?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Inflation is heading down closer to the Fed's 2% annual target, but the Fed needs to get rid of that target. Everyone treats 2% inflation as the holy grail. Americans don't like inflation of any ilk, but it is back in the 2% to 3% range, and that has been just fine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I wouldn't be shocked to see the 10-year Treasury yield at 3.25% to 3.5% by the end of the year. Bonds should have a pretty good year, although maybe not as good as stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You have discussed on Substack some of the risks that investors face with gold. Yet, the yellow metal has continued to climb. How much further can this rally go?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I didn't think gold would go up as much as it already has. But there are problems. The surge in gold reflects investors' uncertainty about geopolitics, monetary policy, and the economy. For gold to continue climbing, the level of uncertainty would need to increase.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gold is the thing you buy to protect you from whatever keeps you up at night. But the same things that should lead to improvement in the broader market and economy should also improve consumer confidence. If that happens, that is an enemy of gold. Also, since we don't have an inflation problem, I would take money out of gold.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thanks for your time, Jim.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Paul R.
