            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Mackenzie Tatananni and Nate Wolf</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>October is winding to a close, capping off a month filled with rapidly transforming trade policy and a barrage of earnings from some of the biggest names in tech.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And while concerns have intensified around the formation of a possible \"AI bubble,\" four of the five best-performing stocks in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 this month were artificial-intelligence plays.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Advanced Micro Devices was by far the top performer in the index, climbing 61.6% in October. The chip maker announced on Oct. 6 that it had notched a deal to become a major supplier for OpenAI. The ChatGPT maker plans to deploy 6 gigawatts worth of AMD chips in exchange for up to 160 million shares of AMD stock. The deal propelled AMD shares to their best month since 2001, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Micron Technology continued its banner year in October, with shares rising 36.1% for the month. AI has driven a surge in demand for the company's dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, products, giving Micron license to raise prices as customers' inventories thin out. The company got an additional boost this week when South Korean rival SK Hynix forecast a \"supercycle\" of demand for memory chips.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shares of Teradyne jumped 33.1% to an all-time high in October. The maker of test systems for semiconductors and robotics closed last week down for the month. But shares surged after the company beat earnings expectations for the third quarter and issued fourth-quarter guidance that blew past analysts' estimates, citing robust AI-related demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>J.B. Hunt Transport Services rebounded from a rough year, rising 24.8% in October. The freight company has combatted a weak shipping economy by controlling costs. That strategy paid off: Hunt posted third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16 that easily beat analysts' expectations, driving the stock to its largest single-day gain since 1998. It remains narrowly down in 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Data-storage company Western Digital was the second-best performer in the S&amp;P 500 in the third quarter, but it will have to settle for fifth place in October. The stock rose 23.4% amid a spike in demand for storage hardware due to cloud and AI investments. Another earnings beat this week adds to Western's momentum heading into the home stretch of 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Conversely, Fiserv was the worst performer in October as shares cratered nearly 48.9%. The stock had its worst day on record Wednesday after Fiserv slashed its full-year outlook, sending shares down 44%. CEO Mike Lyons attributed the guidance cut to overly upbeat expectations for growth in Argentina and a previous focus on \"short-term initiatives\" that came at the expense of long-term customer relationships. Third-quarter earnings also missed analysts' expectations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alexandria Real Estate Equities fell 32.5%. The real estate investment trust swung to a loss in the third quarter and issued full-year guidance that underwhelmed investors. Alexandria lowered the midpoint of its earnings guidance to a loss of $2.94 a share from earnings of 50 cents a share, citing the potential for additional real estate impairments in the fourth quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Molina Healthcare sank 21% in October. Last week, the health insurer reduced its full-year earnings guidance for the third time in months, citing cost pressures and underperformance in its marketplace business. Earnings and revenue for the third quarter also came in sharply below Wall Street's estimates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CoStar Group declined 20.7%. CoStar's third-quarter earnings report Tuesday put it squarely in the spotlight. While the real estate data-analytics company issued an upbeat outlook for the full year and posted adjusted earning that beat consensus, CoStar reported a net loss of $30.9 million versus a profit of $53 million last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cybersecurity company F5 declined 20.6%. Shares sank by double digits on Oct. 16 alone, when F5 disclosed it had suffered a security breach that gave nation-state affiliated hackers \"persistent access\" to some of its systems. The Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency said at the time that the hack presented \"an imminent threat to federal networks.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.com and Nate Wolf at nate.wolf@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

The new platform features dual artificial intelligence engines that deliver Fortune 500-quality analysis capabilities without requiring internal SEO expertise. As a result, agencies can now produce professional backlink strategy reports in approximately 45 to 60 minutes instead of spending multiple hours on manual creation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>White-Label Backlink Strategy Report Creation System Announced By LinkDaddy</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8814/272742_e30a4b9e645409be_002full.jpg</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>More information is available at https://linkdaddy.com.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The launch addresses a significant challenge facing SEO agencies seeking to expand their service offerings while maintaining operational efficiency. Unlike generic template-based solutions, the white-label system analyzes both client websites and agency capabilities to create authentic authority positioning in delivered reports. This dual analysis approach ensures recommendations align with actual agency strengths, providing meaningful differentiation in competitive markets where cookie-cutter reports fail to impress potential clients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Two specialized artificial intelligence engines work in coordination to optimize both analysis quality and investment recommendations. The Dynamic Reasoning Engine processes data from premium SEO tools with monthly subscription values exceeding $1,000, delivering comprehensive competitive intelligence and technical assessments that would otherwise require significant tool investments. Meanwhile, the Dynamic Investment and Scaling Engine ensures strategic budget recommendations consistently fall within the $4,000 to $6,000 range through mathematical service scaling rather than arbitrary pricing structures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The platform includes several proprietary methodologies that differentiate it from standard SEO reporting tools. First Mover Advantage Identification discovers hidden revenue streams through specialized keywords that competitors have not yet targeted in their optimization strategies. To ensure long-term sustainability, the Strategic Dilution Methodology provides a systematic 3-phase approach for anchor text optimization that aligns with search engine preferences and reduces penalty risks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LinkDaddy has served over 3,800 customers and completed more than 16,000 backlink orders since establishing operations 10 years ago in the SEO services industry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To learn how the white label system integrates with existing service offerings, interested agencies can schedule a strategy consultation at https://calendly.com/linkdaddy/strategy-call</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Contact Info:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Name: Tony Peacock</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Email: tony@linkdaddy.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Organization: LinkDaddy</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Address: 80 Southwest 8th Street, Miami, Florida 33130, United States</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Website: https://linkdaddy.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/272742</span></p></span></div></div>",

The BOC cut its policy rate this week, and signaled that the easing cycle might be done. The BOC's forecast anticipates weak growth, and therefore sets a high bar for additional cuts, Shenfeld says. Yet the BOC forecast justifies an additional cut given the slow absorption of spare capacity, he adds. (Paul.Vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)</span></p></span></div></div>",

Wall Street analysts are generally positive despite some concerns about its artificial-intelligence initiatives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple shares were up 0.4% at $272.59 on Friday, having closed at a record high the previous day. On the face of it, its forward price/earnings ratio of 33 times looks expensive for the 8% revenue growth it reported for the third quarter. But there are reasons to be optimistic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>First, Apple's earnings on Thursday underlined the early success of the new iPhone 17 range. With iPhone revenue set to be up by double digits in the final quarter of the year, the long-awaited wave of smartphone users upgrading their phones looks to be here.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company achieved 6% iPhone revenue growth for the September quarter despite a drop in sales in Greater China, a major market for Apple. The company attributed that to supply constraints meaning it wasn't able to match demand, saying it expects to return to growth in the region in the December quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We are raising our revenue growth forecasts materially on the momentum of the product cycle, which we expect to sustain with the iPhone 18 series as well,\" wrote J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a research note. He raised his target price on Apple stock to $305 from $290, keeping an Overweight rating.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apart from hardware, Apple's other big driver of revenue is services. It struck an upbeat tone there as well, with 15% growth. Services revenue, where Apple includes the estimated $20 billion a year it receives from Google for making it the default search provider on its devices, is extremely profitable for Apple due to its high margins.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes raised his target price on Apple stock to $345 from $290. His call is the highest on Wall Street, according to FactSet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Our estimates for Services no longer have the segment decelerating toward 10% [growth] long-term given our view that payments from Google continue and other areas continue to grow at strong double-digit rates,\" Reitzes wrote. \"Concerns around Services should be put to rest.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That means all is clear for Apple stock to rally, except for concern about AI. Apple noted that the cost of AI would push up its operating expenses, but didn't give much detail on what kind of features it was developing. That combination worried some analysts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The upside surprise from strong iPhone 17 demand and Services momentum are partially offset by accelerated R&amp;D investment in AI. Management's decision to accelerate investment in AI seems to significantly lag its peers,\" wrote Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He kept a Perform rating on the stock with no price target.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose that: (1) Defendants concealed the true value of the Company's investment in TuSimple Holdings, Inc. at the time of the Merger; and (2) in turn, the offer of $43.30 per ordinary share as consideration for the Merger substantially shortchanged the true value of Sina ordinary shares.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.
