Hundreds of thousands of civilians and local responders who remain trapped in the city face heightened protection risks and increasingly limited access to lifesaving assistance. Those who attempt to flee to neighboring areas such as Tawila face perilous journeys: civilians have reportedly been detained and attacked while attempting to flee and along routes to safe locations. Many displaced persons arriving in Tawila are dehydrated, malnourished, injured, and traumatized. The likelihood of sexual violence against women and girls remains extremely high.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Samy Guessabi, the Country Director of Action Against Hunger Sudan, said: \"The scale of displacement, protection risks, and humanitarian needs in El Fasher and neighboring areas is massive. All parties to the conflict must respect their obligations to protect civilians. It is imperative to secure protection and safe passage for civilians, scaled-up funding, and sustained access.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Action Against Hunger is finalizing preparations to deploy two mobile health and nutrition clinics in Tawila. Action Against Hunger teams are also preparing to launch activities to address the acute gender-based violence (GBV) risks faced by displaced populations, including prevention, case referral, and community engagement and awareness-raising through community-based protection networks (CBPNs).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Action Against Hunger urgently calls upon the international community to urgently increase diplomatic efforts to ensure the protection of civilians remaining in El Fasher and safe passage for civilians fleeing, the protection of humanitarian responders, and sustained humanitarian access to El Fasher and surrounding areas. Action Against Hunger also calls upon donors to scale up flexible funding to expand critical humanitarian operations and support local responders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>***</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Action Against Hunger leads the global movement to end hunger. We innovate solutions, advocate for change, and reach 26.5 million people every year with proven hunger prevention and treatment programs.

Target development follows up airborne targets, which have been verified by detailed analysis, ground geophysics as well as geological mapping, sampling and prospecting in 2023 and 2024. These targets will be tested by drilling subject to the required funds being raised this year.

Drill testing of designed targets will follow up confirmation of Airborne conductors by ground geophysics on the Fay Lake property subject to a successful financing and direct consultation with Kiciwapa Cree Nation. Also planned is detailed mapping, prospecting, sampling and line cutting on the Fay Lake Property on a small portion of the Redwin volcanogenic massive sulphide horizon that remains unmapped but contains conductors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Separate to the VMS exploration at Fay Lake above, gold exploration through mapping and prospecting of the western portion of the Puffy Lake Mine style gold mineralization trend, east of the Railroad. Approximately 10-line kilometers is planned on this trend where samples assayed up to 14.33 g/t Au, to evaluate its on strike continuity. The gold potential at Koscielny Lake located at the eastern end of the property south of the Puffy Lake Gold Mine will also be assessed. Here mineralization contained values of up to 11.81 g/t Au (0.38 oz/ton Au) over one meter (J.
