The team is expected to complete a high-level interim engineering audit report (\"Report\") in the next few days and a full report within the coming week or so. This Report will cover the entire plant, including those elements that may be utilised for the secondary plant configuration, and will provide observations and recommendations concerning the current flotation plant.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The results of the Report, together with the outcome of current ongoing commercial discussions with the Company's prepayment and offtake partner over their arrangements with Premier, are expected to have a material bearing on the Company's assessment of the current flotation plant having the short term potential, as reported previously, to meet its operational objectives of achieving sustainable commercial production at both the required grade and tonnage.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company remains confident that, given adequate time and resources, the current flotation plant will achieve its planned design capacity. However, following a recent assessment of available financial resources since the announcement of the General Meeting and a comprehensive analysis, the Company has now determined that it is in the Company's best interests to immediately  acquire, install and commission the 15-20 TPH flotation cell plant manufactured by Xinhai Technology Processing EPC, currently located in Harare, Zimbabwe (the \"Secondary Flotation Plant\"). The metallurgical recovery process employed by the Secondary Flotation Plant is technically straightforward and has been successfully applied to ore of a similar composition to that of Zulu at other operations within Zimbabwe. The current flotation plant would be supplemented by the Secondary Flotation Plant and provide the opportunity to increase future operational performance by increasing the original design capacity of the entire Zulu plant. The planned timing for the Secondary Flotation Plant availability will be finalised in due course.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Graham Hill, Managing Director, commented: \"We have recently reported on the engineering audit that is currently ongoing. The intention of the audit is to look into all those parts of the process plant that connect all of the major plant equipment. My conviction has been that in order to achieve stable and consistent operations, all parts of the plant need to be balanced in terms of mass and water flows. This is true for the existing flotation plant as well as for the Secondary Flotation Plant. The audit will also be making suggestions and comments as far as the existing flotation plant is concerned. Current comments discussed show that the audit team are coming up with practical suggestions based on professional engineering assessments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With the recent changes to the current plant and with recommendations for improvement  for stable operation, we remain hopeful that the current plant can achieve pre-production readiness and with that in mind the Secondary Flotation Plant installation and commissioning would be supplementary, but it is felt that being able to quickly bring the Secondary Flotation Plant to pre-production readiness provides the best opportunity for making the existing plant fully production ready and able to provide production benefits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When I joined Premier, I advised that it would take me until the end of September to make a decision with regards to the Secondary Flotation Plant and subsequently, negotiations have been ongoing during October for the provision of the operating Secondary Flotation Plant. Ultimately it provides further assurances with regards to achieving earliest commercial production and gives the possibility of increased production by using both flotation plants simultaneously.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Market Abuse Regulations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of UK Domestic Law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"UK MAR\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The person who arranged the release of this announcement on behalf of the Company was Graham Hill.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A copy of this announcement is available at the Company's website, www.premierafricanminerals.com.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Enquiries:</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Graham Hill</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Premier African Minerals Limited</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Tel: +27 (0) 100 201 281</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Michael Cornish / Roland Cornish</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Beaumont Cornish Limited</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(Nominated Adviser)</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Tel: +44 (0) 20 7628 3396</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Douglas Crippen</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>CMC Markets UK Plc</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Tel: +44 (0) 20 3003 8632</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>Toby Gibbs/ Harry Davies-Ball</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Shore Capital Stockbrokers Limited</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Tel: +44 (0) 20 7408 4090</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"><span>Nominated Adviser Statement</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beaumont Cornish Limited (\"Beaumont Cornish\"), which is authorised and regulated in the United Kingdom by the Financial Conduct Authority, is acting as nominated adviser to the Company in connection with this announcement and will not regard any other person as its client and will not be responsible to anyone else for providing the protections afforded to the clients of Beaumont Cornish or for providing advice in relation to such proposals.

Due to weaker than estimated third quarter and weaker sales pipeline for the rest of the year, we lowered our full-year guidance for both net sales growth and profitability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the third quarter 2025, net sales were EUR 40.7 million, and at comparable exchange rates, net sales decreased 0.2 percent. In the challenging market environment, especially in the automotive industry, average deal size was smaller than expected during July-September 2025, and it decreased in comparison to the previous year. Sales to new customers and to existing customers’ new product development projects decreased in comparison to the previous year. Distribution license revenue was on previous year’s level.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Weaker than expected net sales growth contributed to weaker profitability in the third quarter of 2025. Operating profit (EBITA) was EUR 4.3 million, and EBITA-margin was 10.5 percent. Profitability decreased also due to one-off costs related to the acquisition of IAR, which totaled approximately EUR 1.7 million in July-September 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We began the work to integrate IAR into Qt Group. IAR’s transition towards SaaS based licensing model is a strategically important initiative for us. We will present the tentative SaaS transformation plan and its impact to Qt Group’s growth expectations in more detail during the first quarter of 2026. Together with IAR, we now have a more comprehensive product offering for the microcontroller (MCU) market, which is expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 10%1. In addition, IAR’s strong position in safety-critical systems, is a great starting point for sales of Axivion’s quality assurance solutions in particular. IAR’s key product, the Embedded Workbench compiler, is typically selected at the beginning of product development projects, which will increase the growth opportunities of Qt’s other products as potential customers are reached early in the R&amp;D process.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our next priorities are to plan IAR’s SaaS transformation and setting up joint targets for long-term strategy, business synergies and growth opportunities. As of now, we estimate that IAR’s impact to Qt Group’s net sales in the remainder of the year 2025 will be approximately EUR 8-10 million. The one-off costs related to the acquisition of IAR are estimated to be approximately EUR 6-7 million in 2025, of which approximately EUR 1.7 million will be booked to the third quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>1</span></em><span> </span><em><span>Source:</span></em><span> </span><span>https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/microcontroller-mcu-market </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Outlook for 2025 (issued on October 17, 2025):</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We estimate that our full-year net sales for 2025 will increase by 3-10 percent year-on-year at comparable exchange rates and that our operating profit margin (EBITA %) will be 20-30 percent in 2025.
