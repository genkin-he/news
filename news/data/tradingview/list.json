Rany is one of at least 36 people in the area, mostly children, with neurological disorders not explained by genetic tests, according to preliminary data from a groundbreaking study into the impacts of mercury contamination.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While scientists have warned of the risks that mercury could pose to Indigenous children in the Amazon, none have established a causal link to disabilities in their communities, as this study may soon do.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>EAT THE FISH POISONED BY MERCURY OR GO HUNGRY</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rany’s father, Rosielton Saw, has worked as a miner near their village for years, following in the footsteps of his father, Rosenildo.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sitting at the family's one-bedroom wooden home, the older man said he knew the mercury they used was dangerous.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But mining about 30 grams of gold per week provides just \"enough to support ourselves,\" Rosenildo Saw said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The family regularly eats surubim, a carnivorous fish that accumulates mercury in the river biome. Rany Ketlen, who has severe swallowing problems, drinks the fish broth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In recent years, government health officials have reported dozens of other patients in the wider region suffering from similar disorders. But a lack of testing and access to medical care has made it difficult to compile a full picture of the problem or establish the exact causes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Now researchers are collecting data on neurological problems known to be associated with mercury poisoning, ranging from acute brain malformation to memory issues, in a multi-year study concluding by the end of 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The scientists involved in the latest unpublished research, backed by Brazil's leading public health institute, said a top suspect is the mercury seeping into waterways after miners use it to bind tiny specks of gold extracted from riverbanks – a largely lawless trade spurred on by record-high prices for the precious metal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The mercury has contaminated river fish that are a staple for Indigenous communities and accumulated in women's placentas, breast milk and offspring at alarmingly high levels, often two or three times the hazardous threshold for pregnant mothers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chief Zildomar Munduruku, who is also a nurse, said he cannot tell his people to stop eating fish, despite guidance from health officials.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“If we obey their rules, we will go hungry,” he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>EVEN IF MINING STOPS, MERCURY WILL LINGER</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Far downstream from Sai Cinza, diplomats and world leaders gather next month in the Amazon for the United Nations climate summit, known as </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">COP30</a><span>. Brazilian organizers have called it the \"Forest COP,\" focusing global attention on threats to tropical rainforests and their inhabitants, such as illegal mining across the region.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has driven thousands of miners out of Indigenous lands since he returned to office in 2023. But the mercury left behind cannot be broken down as it cycles through air, water, and soil, fueling a lasting health crisis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Brazil's government has stepped up monitoring of mercury levels in the Munduruku Indigenous Territory, trained public health officials to identify early signs of mercury poisoning and invested in clean water sources for remote communities, the Health Ministry said in a statement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even if \"gold mining in the Amazon came to a complete stop, the mercury that was deposited ... would remain for many more decades,\" said Paulo Basta, a researcher at public health institute Fiocruz, who has studied mercury contamination of Indigenous people for more than three decades.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Papers, interviews and fresh data reviewed by Reuters suggest the humanitarian crisis unleashed by illegal mining will have permanent consequences for current and future generations of Indigenous communities in the Amazon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A 2021 study by Basta and his colleagues found 10 of 15 mothers tested in three Munduruku villages had elevated mercury levels. An earlier study found 12 of 13 people in a Yanomami village where mining was rampant had dangerous mercury levels in their bloodstream. Nearly all the 546 registered cases that were in the government's databases by March 2025 were collected by Basta and his team.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"That's just the tip of the iceberg,\" Basta said. The Munduruku, Yanomami, and Kayapó territories have populations of tens of thousands of people who could potentially be contaminated by mercury.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>PROVING CAUSATION IS NOT EASY</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the study now underway, Basta's team aims to provide a crucial missing link in the puzzle: proof that mercury is causing disabilities. For that, they are following 176 pregnant women to test babies during their first years of life.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At Sai Cinza, where Rany Ketlen and her family live, the researchers’ preliminary data showed that, on average, mothers in the study had mercury levels five times higher than the Brazilian Health Ministry considers safe and their babies had three times that level. Rany Ketlen's sister, one-year-old Raylene, is one of them, though she has not yet shown any symptoms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This mercury disease, if you don't look for it, you won't find it,\" said Cleidiane Carvalho, a nurse who set out years ago to connect researchers with the sick Indigenous children she came across. Without their studies, she worried, the crisis \"will be silenced, neglected forever.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But proving a causal link to mercury contamination has been a challenge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fiocruz researchers found that Indigenous communities often lack basic health services and are vulnerable to various infectious diseases, all potential causes of neurological problems. Marriage among close cousins, which can cause genetic disorders, is also more common in small Indigenous communities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is likely that mercury is among the causes of the conditions of the 36 patients who did not have an inherited genetic disorder, but that does not rule out other factors, said Fernando Kok, a geneticist at the University of Sao Paulo who is working on the Fiocruz study.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Exams that find mercury in people's bodies are like snapshots of a patient's recent diet, so they alone cannot prove a prior contamination as a cause of neurological problems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's a perfect crime, because it leaves no signature,\" Kok said.</span></p></span></div></div>",

At the same time, AI companies assembled the most valuable monopolies since Standard Oil, and they’re data monopolies that make protocol dominance look trivial by comparison. The AI industry is expected to generate over $300 billion in revenue by 2025, primarily through training models on trillions of tokens scraped from researchers, writers and domain experts. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bitcoin maxis fought block size wars. Ethereum debated MEV extraction. Meanwhile, OpenAI, Google and Anthropic scraped the entire corpus of human knowledge, locked it inside proprietary training runs and built moats that no amount of capital or talent can overcome.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto’s response was launching the ten-thousandth DeFi fork while the most consequential infrastructure battle of the decade happens offchain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto needs a wake-up call. It is catastrophically misallocating attention while AI companies perfect centralized control over intelligence itself, the ultimate network effect that makes liquidity pools look like child’s play.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Data set monopolies are permanent without intervention</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>DeFi demonstrated that financial infrastructure could be rebuilt transparently. Financial rails, however, are commoditized compared to knowledge monopolies. Every DeFi protocol competes on execution, composability and user experience because the underlying assets like tokens, stablecoins and liquidity are standardized and portable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI data sets are not portable. They’re locked inside training runs that cost $100 million and take months to complete. Once a foundation model reaches critical mass, it becomes prohibitively expensive to replicate. The first mover that assembled the training corpus wins permanently unless new infrastructure changes the rules.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Google has 20 years of search query data. Meta has 15 years of social interaction data, and OpenAI partnered with publishers who will never license the same content to competitors. These are permanent moats that compound with every new user interaction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto built decentralized alternatives to centralized finance, so where is the decentralized alternative to centralized intelligence? It doesn’t exist because crypto hasn’t treated data ownership as an existential fight worth having.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Crypto founders aren’t building data set protocols</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The brutal truth is that data set infrastructure is less exciting than yield farming. Crypto founders chase token velocity, speculative upside and viral growth mechanics. Building attribution layers for training data generates zero speculation, requires years of ecosystem development and demands partnerships with institutions that move slowly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Boring infrastructure, however, is precisely what mattered. Ethereum wasn’t exciting when it launched; it was a slow, expensive computer that academics appreciated. Chainlink wasn’t exciting; it was an oracle network that took five years to gain adoption. The most critical crypto infrastructure often resembled homework compared to the casino next door.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Data set attribution protocols are the homework right now. The market opportunity is larger than DeFi, the network effects are more potent than those of any protocol token, and regulatory pressure creates inevitable demand. Yet crypto capital flows into the next NFT marketplace instead of the infrastructure that could prevent AI companies from becoming more powerful than nation-states.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>The window is closing fast</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI companies are not waiting for permission. They’re training GPT-5, Claude 4 and Gemini Ultra right now using data scraped from millions of creators who will never see compensation. Every training run that completes without onchain attribution makes centralized control more entrenched.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Once these models reach sufficient capability, they become self-reinforcing. Users generate data through interactions, which train the next version, and the next version attracts more users. The flywheel accelerates, and competitors cannot catch up because they lack both the initial corpus and the ongoing data stream.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto has maybe two years before this window closes permanently. After that, data set monopolies become facts of nature that no amount of decentralized infrastructure can dislodge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>What crypto should build instead of more DEXs</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The crypto industry needs data set registries where contributors cryptographically sign data licenses before any training begins. It requires attribution protocols that log which data sets influenced which model outputs, and micropayment rails that automatically split inference revenue among the original creators. It needs reputation systems that rank data set quality based on measured model performance, rather than subjective metrics.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The technology is simpler than most DeFi protocols. Data set registration requires cryptographic hashes, contributor wallet addresses, licensing terms in standardized formats, and usage logs. Training runs record the data used and when it was used — inference requests route payments to registered contributors proportionally.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This infrastructure doesn’t require new consensus mechanisms or experimental cryptography, but rather builders who prioritize preventing monopolies over farming liquidity rewards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Crypto’s mission or crypto’s obituary</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto’s founding thesis was preventing centralized control over valuable networks. Bitcoin prevented central banks from monopolizing money. Ethereum prevented tech companies from monopolizing computation. But if AI companies monopolize intelligence, those victories become irrelevant. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What good is decentralized money if centralized models control what people think? What good is decentralized computation if centralized training data determines which ideas get amplified? Intelligence is upstream of everything, from finance and governance to media and education. Whoever controls AI training data controls the future information environment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto can either build the infrastructure that makes data set monopolies impossible, or it can watch AI companies perfect the exact centralized control that blockchain was invented to prevent. There’s no third option where crypto remains focused on token speculation while being relevant to the most significant technological shift of the century.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The industry needs to build data set attribution infrastructure now, or write crypto’s obituary as the movement that talked about decentralization. In contrast, centralized AI companies built permanent monopolies on human knowledge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><em><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Opinion by: Ram Kumar, core contributor at OpenLedger.</span></strong></em></p><p class=\"\"><span>This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Thereby flipping an important resistance into support. The daily price ranged from $1.82 to $1.33, reflecting strong volatility alongside increased activity.

This is comfortably bullish without venturing into overbought territory, hinting that the rally isn’t exhausted yet. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram flipped positive (+0.063).
