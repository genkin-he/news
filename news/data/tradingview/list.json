However, a sustainable fall below the 4% handle isn't in sight, at least for now. \"We do remain, just about, within the longer-run range here,\" the senior research strategist says. Should the 10-year yield trade under 4.00% on a closing basis, that would give U.S. Treasury bulls some degree of control in the near term, he says. The 10-year Treasury yield was last trading at 3.997%, down 1.9 basis points, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
