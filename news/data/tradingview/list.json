This technology has the potential to measure venous saturation, arterial saturation, hemoglobin, and flow in blood vessels that conventional commercially available monitoring technologies can't.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company's first biomarker or vital sign is the real-time measurement of central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) without an invasive catheter and blood draw. This noninvasive, continuous approach will help clinicians detect and manage sepsis and septic shock sooner. Its LIVOx Central Venous Oxygenation Monitor has already received FDA Breakthrough Device Designation for the indication of non-invasive, real-time, continuous or spot monitoring of ScvO2 in adults at risk of septic shock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By integrating Noninvasix monitoring into their critical care workflows, clinicians can more quickly and accurately diagnose critically ill patients and tailor resuscitation based on tissue hypoxia, aiming to improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Addressing a major unmet need, early identification of declining ScvO2 provides a direct window into perfusion status in sepsis. This condition affects about 1.7 million adults annually in the U.S., with nearly 270,000 deaths, and an estimated 50 million people globally, with 11 million deaths. The LIVOx technology has the potential to expand to other shock indications including traumatic and cardiogenic shock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Contact Information</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>For further information, please contact:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>David Giarracco | President &amp; CEO</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1 (303) 888 6520</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>dgiarracco@noninvasix.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>www.noninvasix.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Cypher Metaverse Inc.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cypher focuses on identifying and investing in early-stage opportunities across the digital landscape, participating in blockchain projects, including proof of work mining, proof of stake cryptocurrencies, and decentralized finance.
