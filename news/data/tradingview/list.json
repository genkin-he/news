He attributed the Treasury market's recent rally in long-dated government debt, and the resulting drop in yields, to broader fears about AI's destructive capacity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Thursday, yields on everything from the 1-year bill BX:TMUBMUSD01Y through the 30-year bond BX:TMUBMUSD30Y were slipping, despite a lack of any clear data or non-AI-related events that could explain those moves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Importantly, the benchmark 10-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, which is a peg for pricing new 30-year fixed mortgages, was on track to close Thursday's session at below 4.02%, which would be the lowest level of 2026. It is down from around 4.3% on Jan. 20.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An easing of that crucial rate since January has spilled over into mortgage financing, where rates for new 30-year fixed mortgages have fallen below the 6% threshold for the first time in three-and-a-half years, according to Freddie Mac.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read: Mortgage rates fall below 6%, giving buyers a glimpse of affordability</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Treasury yields act as a benchmark on borrowing costs for many American consumers and businesses. They can be influenced by a variety of things - such as the outlook for the U.S. economy and inflation, expectations for the path of interest rates, and rising geopolitical risks in the Middle East.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What's interesting now is that yields continue to trend lower even though the U.S. economy is generally holding up, expectations for the Federal Reserve's next rate cut have been pushed back to July, and the U.S. and Iran are involved in nuclear talks in Geneva that may reportedly produce an agreement. And while economic data have been mixed, most U.S. companies have avoided widespread layoffs - keeping a \"low-hire, low-fire\" labor market in place. Weekly jobless claims also remained near an exceedingly low level of 212,000 for the seven days that ended last Saturday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So long as workers have jobs, lower mortgage rates could help improve affordability issues. Yet fears of layoffs might still act as a counterbalance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read: CEOs say they won't add many jobs in 2026. Is a low-hire, low-fire labor market the new norm?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Within the bond market, \"there's been an ongoing bid related to job displacements from AI, and we've seen a drop in yields over the past couple of weeks because of that,\" LPL Financial's Gillum said in a phone interview. Thursday's bond-market moves \"seem like a continuation of that trade,\" he noted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gillum described the downward path in yields as an \"interesting dynamic\" in which the bond market \"is not trading how you would expect it to trade,\" given the potential for continued elevated inflation pressures over the next few years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We think, in the near term, that the AI buildout could keep inflation elevated for the next few years,\" Gillum said. \"What's interesting is that the bond market is not trading that. Instead, it's trading on the disinflationary impact that might happen a few years from now,\" as well as on a \"downgrade in economic expectations.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gillum's inflation view is shared by BofA Securities strategist Meghan Swiber and economist Stephen Juneau. In a note on Thursday, Swiber and Juneau wrote that they think, in the near-term, \"AI will drive more demand-side inflation from surging AI capex and a positive wealth effect.\" They added that \"the market narrative around disinflation effects has gotten ahead of itself\" because a slowing pace of price gains may not play out for another two years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Thursday, investors were reconsidering the likely winners and losers from AI. Shares of software companies like Salesforce (CRM) and Intuit (INTU) were rallying on the possibility that they might benefit from AI, after having previously been punished on fears that their industry might be wiped out. Meanwhile, stocks DJIA SPX COMP were mostly lower in afternoon trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Vivien Lou Chen</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Exports are expected to continue with moderate growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The balance of risks for growth remains tilted to the downside, the central bank said.

The stock was rising 3.5% to $198.39 on Thursday. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF was up 2.2%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"On Wednesday, markets were beginning to show some glimmers of stabilization around software stocks,\" Ameriprise Chief Market Strategist Anthony Saglimbene wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Salesforce reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue. However, the company also gave fiscal 2027 revenue guidance that was just in line with analyst estimates, leading the stock to drop in after-hours trading Wednesday night.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shares bounced back in regular trading on Thursday, though. Investors seemed pleased with the company's AI results. Agentforce's annual recurring revenue reached $800 million in the fourth quarter, up 169% year-over-year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Salesforce's Agentforce platform has been a closely watched part of the company's strategy.

In its first 15 months, we closed 29,000 deals, up 50% quarter-over-quarter,\" Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff said on the earnings call Wednesday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Worries about AI replacing the need for software have fueled a selloff in the sector. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF has tumbled 30% from its 52 week closing high of $117.79 on Sep. 22, 2025. One thing software companies can do to help quell some of the concerns plaguing investors' minds is show that they are making money off their own AI products. Salesforce shareholders seem to think the company was able to do that in its last quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Whether or not software stocks have hit a bottom remains a question. The rise in the sector this week is a good sign, though. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF has gained 7.4% over the past three days, its best three-day stretch since the three days ending April 25, 2025, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Is [the] 'SaaS-Pocalypse' over? It's too soon to tell from our vantage point, though opportunities across well-established software companies are likely emerging for those who can stomach the volatility,\" Saglimbene wrote. \"That said, the panic phase of this recent volatility may be winding down as cooler heads have begun to prevail and cheaper valuations emerge.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other experts feel similarly that established software companies could start to see a rebound after such a strong selloff.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, told Barron's that in the short term, \"the best of breed software stocks are very oversold and have likely bottomed. This would include Palantir, Microsoft and Salesforce.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Risks still loom, though. Companies like Anthropic and OpenAI keep rolling out updated models. Investor skepticism may persist if these models continue to impress.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nancy Tengler, CEO and CIO of Laffer Tengler Investments, wrote on Wednesday that she's focusing on investing in software companies that prove they have a strong growth trajectory amid the AI noise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I think that's what investors have to digest — who are going to be the winners. Salesforce will be in business, but they may not put up the kind of growth numbers they've put in the past,\" Tengler said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Only 2,000 white South Africans had entered the U.S. as refugees as of January 31 under a program launched in May 2025, although the pace has picked up in recent months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The ambitious target could also face administrative delays in Washington, which in recent weeks have halted all refugee travel to the U.S., including white South Africans, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. State Department and Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment. The White House referred questions to the State Department.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The South African Chamber of Commerce in the U.S. said last year that more than 67,000 people had expressed interest in relocating.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump ordered a halt to refugee admissions into the U.S. after taking office in 2025 as part of his crackdown on legal and illegal immigration. But weeks later, he launched an effort to bring in white South Africans of Afrikaner ethnicity as refugees, saying they had been violently persecuted in the majority-Black country. South Africa's government has rejected that claim, while some refugee advocates have criticized the Trump policy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     U.S. SEES URGENT NEED FOR REFUGEE PROCESSING SITE</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The contracting document, posted to a U.S. government database on Wednesday, explains the rationale for awarding the contract for the trailers without a competitive bidding process, stressing an urgent need for a secure site.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>An immigration raid by South African authorities on a previous U.S. refugee processing site on a commercial property in Johannesburg had forced the government to consider a more secure location, it said, after \"operations were compromised.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The inability to safely process about 4,500 applicants per month, an objective communicated to (the U.S. State Department's refugee division) from the White House, would result in failure to meet a Presidential priority,\" the document said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>South African Foreign Ministry spokesperson Chrispin Phiri said his government would not interfere with the U.S. program if it remained within legal boundaries, while reiterating Pretoria's rejection of Trump's claims about white South Africans.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The assertion that Afrikaners face systemic persecution is fundamentally unsubstantiated,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Whether the U.S. could reach the ambitious 4,500 per month target remains unclear. The State Department last week canceled all refugee travel - including for South Africans - from February 23 to March 9 due to operational factors, an email sent to applicants said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Because of Trump's sweeping refugee ban issued in January 2025, South Africans must be admitted as exceptions on a case-by-case basis by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal operations, said DHS had delayed the approvals, creating an administrative backlog.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Prior to the pause on admissions, South African entries had been ramping up, with about 1,500 admitted in December and January, compared with about 500 in the previous six and a half months, according to U.S. State Department figures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AFTER PUBLIC U.S.-SOUTH AFRICA TENSIONS, A PRIVATE AGREEMENT</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tensions between the U.S. and South Africa over the refugee effort boiled over in mid-December when South African authorities raided the commercial building in Johannesburg where U.S. staff and contractors were working on refugee cases.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Seven Kenyans working as contractors for a U.S.-based refugee group were arrested for alleged violations of their visa terms, while two U.S. refugee officers were briefly detained.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. and South African officials reached an agreement during a closed-door meeting in late December to allow processing to continue, Reuters reported last month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The contracting document said a South African company had received a no-bid $772,000 contract to supply and install 14 prefabricated modular buildings as part of a \"temporary modular village\" on an embassy property in Pretoria.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a WhatsApp group for South Africans to share information about the program, one applicant said they had an interview this week in a trailer-like structure at an embassy property and that more trailers were being prepared, suggesting the site was now operational.</span></p></span></div></div>",
