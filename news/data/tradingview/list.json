            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>What Does Palantir Actually Do?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Palantir (PLTR) builds high-stakes data integration software often described as a central “operating system” for organizations. In plain terms, its platforms help governments and companies take messy, siloed data and turn it into real-world decisions. The company started in 2003 serving U.S. intelligence and defense agencies, where stakes are life-or-death and data is sensitive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Today, Palantir has expanded into commercial sectors (from healthcare to energy) with a suite of platforms: Gotham (for government analytics), Foundry (for enterprise operations), Apollo (for deploying software in any environment), and its new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) for integrating AI into business workflows.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In short, Palantir’s software connects data, analytics, and operations so organizations can act on insights quickly… now with an AI platform layer to drive enterprise AI applications.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Why Is PLTR Stock So Expensive?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Palantir stock carries a sky-high valuation because investors have priced it like a future AI category winner. Even after a recent pullback, PLTR stock trades around $120 per share – roughly 200 times earnings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company’s growth has been impressive (Palantir’s U.S. commercial revenue jumped 137% year-over-year last quarter, with management guiding for ~61% revenue growth in 2026).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Those “inflection point” numbers have fueled optimism that Palantir’s AI-fueled expansion will justify its rich price. In effect, the market expects Palantir to deliver exceptional growth and margins for years to come to support this premium valuation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>PLTR stock isn’t cheap by any metric, but bulls argue that its unique position in mission-critical AI software warrants the premium.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Can Palantir’s AI Platform (AIP) Drive Real Growth?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Palantir’s new AI Platform (AIP) is key to converting hype into real growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AIP is an orchestration layer that securely connects third-party AI models (like large language models) to a company’s internal data, with strict governance and controls.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This means enterprises can deploy powerful AI tools on sensitive data while meeting security requirements – a huge selling point in sectors like finance, healthcare, and defense. Palantir has been running AIP “bootcamps” to show clients quick wins and accelerate adoption.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The big question: will those pilot projects turn into large, repeatable deals? If AIP makes Palantir’s software easier to deploy and more plug-and-play, it could transform Palantir from a custom consulting-like business into a high-margin enterprise AI platform. Early signs are promising – Palantir’s U.S. commercial growth soared 137% year-over-year, signaling strong demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If AIP continues to convert trials into multi-year contracts and expands usage across organizations, it can absolutely be the engine of Palantir’s next growth surge. However, if these AI pilots don’t scale up, AIP could end up as more buzz than business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What Risks Could Hit Palantir Stock?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At its current valuation, Palantir stock has little room for error.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The biggest risk is that Palantir can’t live up to the enormous expectations built into its $100+ share price. With the stock around 200x earnings, even a slight slowdown in growth or margins could trigger a major pullback.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For example, if Palantir’s much-hyped AIP deals stall out or if competitors offer cheaper AI solutions, the narrative of “unstoppable growth” could crumble. The company’s history of heavy stock-based compensation is another concern… and the ongoing dilution of shares needs to taper off as the business scales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notably, famed investor Michael Burry has likened Palantir to an “emperor with no clothes,” arguing that enthusiasm for the stock’s AI story far exceeds its fundamentals. Burry even disclosed bets against PLTR, suggesting its fair value might be closer to $46 – implying a 60%-plus drop from current levels if the optimism collapses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In short, any sign that Palantir’s explosive growth is a one-time blip (or that Palantir’s commercial growth decelerates sharply) could hit the stock hard.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Is PLTR Stock a Buy After Its Recent Rally?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After a huge rally this year, Palantir sits at a crossroads – and whether it’s a buy now depends on your conviction in its future vs. its price.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bulls see Palantir as a one-of-a-kind enterprise AI powerhouse that has become the “AI operating system” for high-stakes organizations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They point to Palantir’s expanding operating margins, nearly 1000 customers, and deep government ties as evidence that the company can keep delivering high growth and fend off competitors. On the other hand, bears argue Palantir stock is priced for perfection, meaning any stumble could be costly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With the stock already reflecting years of future success, the key question is how much of that future is already priced in – and whether Palantir can outrun those expectations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In practical terms, Palantir has enormous long-term potential in the AI economy, but new investors should be mindful that at its premium price, this stock will need to execute flawlessly to deliver further outsized returns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ready to dive deeper?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To understand Palantir’s full bull vs. bear case and its outlook in the AI era, read the full MarketWise breakdown here.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>More from InvestorPlace</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/dailylive/2026/02/polymarkets-odds-moved-first-then-these-stocks-exploded/?utm_source=tradingview&amp;utm_medium=editorial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Polymarket’s Odds Moved First — Then These Stocks Exploded</a></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/2026/02/the-businesses-that-ai-cant-replace/?utm_source=tradingview&amp;utm_medium=editorial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Businesses That AI Can’t Replace</a></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/smartmoney/2026/02/markets-move-on-belief-not-facts/?utm_source=tradingview&amp;utm_medium=editorial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Markets Move on Belief – Not Facts</a></li></ul></span></div></div>",

It will also prop up revenues of exporting companies, a potential boost to Russia's flagging economic growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Russia's deteriorating finances, caused by Western pressure on its oil sales, may add some urgency to slow-moving, U.S.-mediated </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">peace talks with Ukraine</a><span>, in which Washington is offering major economic incentives to both sides.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>        German Gref, the powerful CEO of Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, said the rouble has no chance to remain as strong as in 2025, when it rallied by 45% against the dollar. He said the currency could tumble by 23% from its current level of 77 to the dollar, to end the year around 100.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This year, I don't see any chance of having such a strong rouble. It is counterproductive by all conceivable and inconceivable measures. It's counterintuitive, and everything else you can think of,\" Gref told a conference call after Sberbank's 2025 results announcement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday the government would divert more money into the fiscal reserve fund to prevent its depletion. That implies reduced foreign currency sales by the state, a factor that has supported the rouble.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Operations by the government and the central bank currently account for over one-tenth of Russia's thin foreign currency market. The government and the central bank have been criticised for propping up the rouble.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This means that the volumes of currency sales from the National Wealth Fund may decrease in the future, which in turn means that the support for the rouble from the budgetary mechanism will weaken,\" Alfa Bank analysts said. At the start of February, analysts in a Reuters poll saw the rouble at 88 to the dollar in 12 months.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'ROUTINE DIFFICULTIES'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Siluanov's announcement came a day after a late-night, hours-long meeting between President Vladimir Putin and top government and central bank officials on how to deal with the budget deficit and a sanctions-related fall in energy revenues.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Kremlin said on Thursday the sharp fall in these revenues, which were down by 24% in 2025 and halved in February in year-on-year terms, as well as the growing budget deficit, were \"routine difficulties\" that could be fixed thanks to overall macroeconomic stability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sberbank released an optimistic economic outlook for 2026, projecting growth between 1% and 1.5%, above the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) estimate of 0.8%, with Gref arguing that a weaker rouble would prove an important factor.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It is not possible to definitively assess the dynamics of economic growth for the full year in February. It will depend on a number of factors, including the dynamics of the rouble exchange rate,\" Gref said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Russia's economic growth slowed sharply in 2025 due to prohibitive interest rates, which stalled investment. Gref said investment and growth would resume when the central bank's key interest rate falls to 12% from the current 15.5%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The rallying rouble and the high key rate have helped the central bank bring inflation down.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some central bank board members at a rate-setting meeting on February 13 warned that a weaker rouble and falling oil revenues created inflationary risks, according to the minutes, published on Thursday.</span></p></span></div></div>",

GOVERN ensures that an autonomous system strictly adheres to legal and mission parameters, actively blocking the underlying AI model if it attempts to hallucinate or deviate from established protocols.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>GOVERN is currently in active beta testing with three entities and is slated for full commercial deployment in Q3 of 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>MEDIA CONTACT:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Janie Mackenzie</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>janiemack@ascendantgroupbranding.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>SOURCE:</span></strong><span> GOVERN</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire</span></p></span></div></div>",
