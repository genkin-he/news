One of the biggest questions patients have after surgery is: \"What foods can I eat?\" Your diet plays a big role in how quickly and comfortably you heal after wisdom teeth removal. Eating the right foods can help prevent irritation, reduce discomfort, and support the recovery of your mouth, gums, and jaw to full health. Here's a guide to what you should eat and what foods to avoid after wisdom teeth removal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Best foods to eat after wisdom teeth removal</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>After your wisdom teeth are removed, your mouth may be sensitive and irritated by certain types of food. These options will give you the nutrients and food you need to recover without damaging or causing pain around the extraction sites:1</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Soft dairy products</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yogurt, pudding, or cottage cheese can serve as a source of protein and calcium to support recovery. Colder foods may also feel soothing around the surgical site and against swollen gums.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Mashed potatoes and soft vegetables</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pureed carrots, soft-cooked squash, and mashed potatoes are easy to chew and swallow post-surgery, and they provide essential vitamins your body needs to help heal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Smoothies and shakes</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Blended smoothies and milkshakes aren't just a sweet treat as a reward for making it through surgery. Including leafy greens like spinach or kale or adding protein powder can also make them a great source of nutrition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Scrambled eggs</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking for an easy breakfast after oral surgery? Scrambled eggs are soft, easy to eat, and quick to prepare when you're too exhausted to cook.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Applesauce and pureed fruit</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Applesauce and other fruit cups are gentle on your gums, making them a great sweet treat post-surgery.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Foods to avoid after wisdom teeth removal</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>With how sensitive your mouth is after wisdom teeth surgery, it's important to be aware of what foods you shouldn't eat. Not only may these options cause pain and discomfort, but they might also prolong the recovery process:2</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Crunchy or hard foods</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chips, popcorn, nuts, or raw vegetables can scrape against your healing gums or get stuck in extraction sites, causing irritation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Sticky candies</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Caramel, gum, and sweet candies may taste good, but they can also irritate sensitive areas and leave residue that attracts bacteria.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Spicy foods</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even if you pride yourself on handling all levels of spice, consider sticking to more neutral foods during recovery. Spicy foods can irritate your gums and increase swelling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Acidic foods</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Citrus, like oranges and grapefruits, along with other acidic foods like tomatoes, can sting sensitive areas and cause discomfort.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Alcohol</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alcohol can interfere with the healing process and may interact negatively with pain medication. Stick to other drinks like water or unsweetened tea until you're fully recovered.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Pick the right choices for a speedy recovery</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Understanding how your diet affects your oral health is always important, but after oral surgery, the right foods can ease your pain and make the recovery process easier. This extends beyond just the food you eat, as certain practices like using a straw can dislodge blood clots in the extraction area. Adjusting your diet during recovery may be annoying, but your mouth will thank you in the long run.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Contact Information:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Name: Sonakshi Murze</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Email: Sonakshi.murze@iquanti.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Job Title: Manager</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>SOURCE:</span></strong><span> iQuanti</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire</span></p></span></div></div>",

To date, Rio Tinto has incurred exploration-related expenses of USD 4.73 million on the Project, having completed multiple programmes of surface mapping and geochemical sampling, ground-based geophysics and four diamond drill holes.  This decision follows Rio Tinto's prior notification to the Company of its decision to exercise its Stage 1 earn-in rights under the JV agreement (as announced on 10 July 2025).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aterian will now regain control of the Project, and the Company believes this provides an exceptional opportunity to unlock the broader value of the licence area, where significant tantalum, niobium and lithium mineralisation potential remains untested. The Company may now directly capitalise on the extensive exploration investment already completed and maximise the full critical mineral potential of HCK-including high-grade tantalum and niobium systems that have historically supported local artisanal mining.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Key Points:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·   </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Full control of the Project is returned to Aterian</span></strong><span>, following Rio Tinto's investment in early-stage exploration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·     </span><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>High-grade lithium drill intersection recorded:</span></strong><span> 6.90m at 2.11% Li₂O, including 3.45m at 3.20% Li₂O.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·    </span><span>Mining optionality exists for development of broader mineral systems: extensive tantalum, niobium, and lithium targets remain to be advanced.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>·     </span><span>Immediate benefit to Aterian shareholders arising from the Company inheriting the complete exploration dataset and drilling results at no additional cost.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The cessation of the HCK JV is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's near-term operations. Rather, Aterian views the regained control and dataset as a strategic opportunity to capture the full project value and to continue building its position as the only LSE-listed company with an operating presence, including a mineral trading facility, in Rwanda.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aterian Chairman, Charles Bray, commented,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Aterian wishes to express its sincere appreciation to Rio Tinto for its collaboration, technical expertise, and the high-quality work completed on the Project. While Rio Tinto's strategic decision reflects its requirement to focus solely on world-class, tier-one lithium deposits, its considerable spend at HCK has delivered us a fully funded exploration database, enhanced geological knowledge and clear optionality over multiple critical minerals. The return of ownership of HCK marks an opportunity for Aterian to unlock value on our own terms especially through dedicated tantalum and niobium mining. Rio Tinto's exploration programme provides a springboard to assess and develop the tantalum-niobium potential within the licence area. These metals are essential to advanced electronics, aerospace, and energy-storage applications, and they already underpin local trading activity in Rwanda and any dedicated supply would be welcomed by buyers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Building on this significant technical base, Aterian will also continue to evaluate the lithium potential identified within the Project while reassessing the tantalum-niobium opportunity within the same licence area. We view this is a value-creation moment for Aterian and a clear demonstration of our strategy in action-transforming exploration assets into near-term development opportunities that support Rwanda's formal, conflict-free mineral supply chain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I personally </span><span>wish to express our gratitude to the Rio Tinto team for the excellent working relationship and we very much appreciate the opportunity to have worked with them. Aterian remains focused on advancing the Project's critical mineral potential and delivering long-term value for its stakeholders.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Next Steps for the Project</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>·     </span></strong><span> </span><span>Advance exploration across HCK with a renewed focus on tantalum, niobium and associated by-products, markets in which Aterian already has established trading networks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>·     </span></strong><span> </span><span>Integrate Rio Tinto's technical data into Aterian's regional datasets to fast-track mineral target generation and prioritisation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>·     </span></strong><span> </span><span>Engage with new strategic and commercial partners to monetise the broader Rwandan opportunity, including the opportunity for a dedicated conflict-free supplier of coltan.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>·     </span></strong><span> </span><span>Continue to scale Aterian's critical mineral trading platform in Rwanda under robust ESG and traceability frameworks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>- ENDS -</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This announcement contains information which, prior to its disclosure, was inside information as stipulated under Regulation 11 of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019/310 (as amended).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Engage with the Aterian PLC management team directly by asking questions, watching video summaries, and seeing what other shareholders have to say.

They're passing legal and medical licensing exams, and winning math olympiads. Leaders of major artificial-intelligence labs — from OpenAI's Sam Altman and Anthropic's Dario Amodei to Demis Hassabis of Google-owned DeepMind and Elon Musk at xAI — talk about a future of \"AGI,\" artificial general intelligence, in which AIs are as smart as humans.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Supposedly, these AI megabrains are the ones coming for all our jobs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But when you talk to chief executives at companies that currently rely on AI day in and day out, you hear a different story. For the overwhelming majority of tasks, it's not the biggest and smartest AI models, but the most simplistic that are winning the day. These unsung heroes of AI, the ones actually transforming business processes and workforces, also happen to be the smallest, fastest and cheapest.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The reality is, for many of the operations that we need computing for today, we don't need large language models,\" says Kyle Lo, a research scientist who builds open-source large language models at the nonprofit Allen Institute for AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI-powered companies have found success by building their software and services more like an assembly line of AI: Information goes in one end, and data, actions or products come out the other. In between, many smaller, simpler, more specialized, faster and cheaper-to-operate AIs are doing all the work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Companies that need to get real work done with so-called AI agents, on a large scale, are finding that \"small language models\" are more than good enough to power them. What's more, companies are realizing that they have no choice but to use these small language models, because they are more affordable, and in some cases better suited to the tasks at hand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is how the future of agentic AI is being built, one workflow at a time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Building the AI factory</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It might look like AI-powered systems are becoming more capable because the underlying AI models are becoming smarter. The biggest AI models certainly are advancing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In many cases, though, the truth about corporate productivity gains is that the impact AI is having — on competitiveness, jobs and the like — is the result of human engineers getting better at stitching together smaller, simpler AIs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aurelian is a Seattle-based startup that uses generative AI to automate responses to nonemergency calls to 911 centers. New York City-based Hark Audio uses AI to identify, clip and collect memorable moments from the world's half a million or so active podcasts. In San Francisco, Gong uses AI to scan and digest every call its customers' sales reps have ever recorded, to help them sell more. And Airbnb uses AI — including open-source models from China's Alibaba — to automatically resolve a significant portion of customer-service issues faster than its human representatives can.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even Meta uses small AI models in this way. In its most recent earnings call, finance chief Susan Li said that when it comes to delivering ads, the company doesn't use its biggest AI models, \"because their size and complexity makes it too cost prohibitive.\" Instead, Meta uses its big models to transfer the requisite knowledge about targeting ads to smaller, more lightweight, specialized models that are used in production.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What all these companies have in common is that they have built internal knowledge factories that daisy chain together small, simple, fast AIs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a factory, widgets travel down a conveyor belt, and workers tweak those widgets along the way. In what you might call an AI knowledge factory, chunks of data flow through pipelines of conventional software and are handed from one simple-minded AI to the next, with each one altering, sorting or transforming it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In this analogy, the conveyor belt is made of conventional software — those tried-and-true existing pathways for data, which many companies have built up over years, or even decades. And the workers along the conveyor belt are AI tools powered by small language models.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a group of researchers from Nvidia and the Georgia Institute of Technology wrote in a recent paper, the rise of AI agents (like our assembly line workers) is \"ushering in a mass of applications in which language models perform a small number of specialized tasks repetitively and with little variation.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Small language models, they wrote, are \"sufficiently powerful, inherently more suitable, and necessarily more economical\" for such work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI in action</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gong, which helps its clients sell more stuff, is an illustrative example. Company co-founder Eilon Reshef says its customers — which include Google and Cisco — might ask its conversational AI questions like, \"Why am I losing deals?\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To answer, Gong uses a mix of costlier, more advanced AI tools and smaller, less expensive ones. Its systems assign tougher tasks to more advanced models. Think of it like a manager delegating tasks to workers with different degrees of expertise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Gong's software typically starts by sending the user's question — in this case, \"Why are my sales declining?\" — to one of the \"smart\" AI models from the likes of Anthropic or OpenAI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The initial prompt includes a request for the AI to come up with a broad plan to answer the question. Because those smart models are expensive — and take longer to \"think\" about questions — Gong uses them as little as possible.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Once a frontier reasoning model, the largest of the large language models, spits out a high-level plan, Gong's software pipeline springs to life. First, it combs through what can be tens of thousands of recorded sales calls with customers. Then Gong uses smaller language models to summarize the conversations surfaced by that search. Next, yet another language model can scan those summaries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the end of this process, all of this data is handed back to one of the smart, slow, expensive frontier AIs, which transforms it into a report. This report outlines, in a way that would normally require hundreds of hours of work by a smart human, what's working and what isn't, across all the sales calls a company is having.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You might use the cheapest LLM to find out if a conversation is relevant, a reasonably cheap LLM to find the right information inside it, and then maybe a more-expensive frontier model to come up with the action document,\" says Reshef.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Faster, cheaper AI</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The difference in cost between the biggest and most sophisticated models and the smallest and cheapest is huge. Using an industry-standard weighted average, OpenAI's smallest, fastest model, GPT-5 Nano, costs around 10 cents per million tokens, while the full-fledged, more sophisticated GPT-5 costs around $3.44 per million tokens. Tokens are the basic units of text that AI processes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What's more, big models can sometimes use thousands of times as many tokens to complete a task, as they burn through them in an internal monologue they use to reason through an answer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's important to note that when it comes to AI models, \"smallest and least smart\" doesn't mean least capable. Indeed, small models can be tuned — either as part of their training process or, increasingly, through elaborate prompts — to behave in a way that is specialized for the task at hand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The giant LLM models are incredibly smart, but they don't offer us an efficient way to leverage our unique proprietary data, or a way to incorporate feedback from our editors,\" says Don MacKinnon, chief executive of Hark Audio. The team at Hark has spent years creating a library of tens of thousands of clips of podcasts selected and edited by humans, which the company's engineers used to fine-tune a customized AI that can now automate that entire process.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Across all the companies I've spoken with about their use of small models, there is a remarkable consistency in how they structure their systems. This suggests that there are only so many ways to build AI agents that actually, consistently work — and that nearly all of them include small language models.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Christopher Mims at christopher.mims@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

And it can be especially overwhelming if you're on a tight schedule, or traveling with young children and older family members.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition to being time-consuming and often stressful, the long trip from curb to departure gate isn't something all fliers are physically prepared to handle. And it isn't just those with mobility issues — some travelers just have difficulty trekking through long airport corridors with their gear.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We're all aging while our airports are getting bigger,\" says Ty Osbaugh, principal architect at Gensler, the architectural firm behind dozens of new airport terminals, including one that opened in September at San Diego International Airport.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To help fliers navigate these behemoths, airlines and airports have added improved signage, interactive maps and digital displays showing estimated walking times to departure gates. They've also updated their apps with better maps and flight information.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But as airports around the world become ever larger and more complex, interest is growing in more-personalized assistance programs that promise a less-painful airport experience for travelers who are willing to pay.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Offered by airlines and other companies for a fee, these services may include perks like personal concierges, assistance with luggage, expedited security access, access to VIP lounges and more — and in many cases you don't have to be a first-class passenger, frequent flier or premium credit-card holder to book them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paul Tumpowsky, chief revenue officer of Fora Travel, a travel agency, says he almost always recommends that his clients use some sort of airport-assistance service. It can be pricey, depending on the services you choose, but it is usually worth it, he says. \"Coming off a crowded plane at a strange airport, nothing beats seeing someone holding a sign with your name on it,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here is a closer look at some of the services available:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Airline add-ons</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At least three major U.S. airlines — Delta, United and American — and Air France and British Airways are among the carriers that offer premium hand-holding services for passengers at key airports.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Delta's Delta VIP Select program is available in 11 of its domestic hubs, including New York (at LaGuardia and JFK), Los Angeles, Atlanta and Minneapolis. The service includes a guide to take you through the airport, help with check-in and baggage, complimentary access to Delta's Sky Club lounges and in some locations a private car to take you straight to the plane. Prices start at $550 for the first passenger, and $100 for each additional flier per trip.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>United passengers can get VIP treatment at the airport through the airline's Signature Service program, available at 21 airports in the U.S. and abroad. A greeter will meet you at the curb, accompany you through security and get you inside the airline's club, starting at around $250 a person.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Air France offers a range of concierge services at Paris Charles de Gaulle for prices starting at $350 a person. British Airways offers its fliers access to an airport concierge through a partnership with Diamond Air. It can be particularly useful for travelers flying in and out of airline's base at Heathrow Airport, which has the most flight connections of any airport in the world. The service will send someone to meet you upon arrival, escort you through immigration and customs and take you to your connecting flight. Prices vary.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>American Airlines' Five Star Service program, meanwhile, is available only to passengers traveling in business or first class. It is offered at 22 U.S. and international airports, including New York, Los Angeles, London and Tokyo, for $350 for the first person, $100 per additional adult and $50 per child.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Of course, for fliers whose main concern is mobility, airlines operating in the U.S. are required to provide transportation to and from gates via wheelchair at no additional charge for those who need it. Airlines suggest you request wheelchair assistance when you book your flight or up to 48 hours before departure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Concierge companies</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Travelers who want a personal airport guide also can work with separate concierge companies, some of which have contracts with big airports around the world.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Their airport sherpas will help you avoid lines at check-in, escort you to a fast-track security lane, get you into a VIP lounge and take you to your gate when it's time to board. If you're arriving from abroad, they can meet you at your arrival gate and help you through customs. In some places this service could include transfers by limo directly to the waiting aircraft.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Providers include the Queen of Clubs, offered by a boutique luxury-travel company in several European countries, including the U.K. and France, as well as larger networks such as Perq Soleil and Royal Airport Concierge, which are in hundreds of airports worldwide. Prices vary; a meet-and-greet or a transfer service at major international gateways in Europe and Asia could range from $250 to more than $500 a person.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A newer arrival in this business is Clear Concierge, a new service from Clear, the ID security firm that speeds fliers through security checkpoints faster by verifying their identify for an annual fee. The company is now offering Clear members a personal escort who will take them from curb through security for $99, to a wider array of services that will get them all the way to the departure gate for $179. It's being rolled out at 23 major U.S. airports, including Denver International, Orlando and Salt Lake City.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Luxury offerings</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For a true splurge, a small number of clubs can offer passengers flying commercial a whiff of the private-jet lifestyle, bypassing the hated airport experience altogether.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the U.S., the PS brand (for private suite) offers fliers a sanctuary in the form of a separate terminal away from the main airport. There, travelers get full lounge amenities and can check their luggage, get a boarding pass and clear security and customs privately. Michael Holtz, CEO of travel firm SmartFlyer who uses the service often, says a private car service takes passengers to and from the lounge and the plane, which they board or disembark from via the jetway stairs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>PS is available in Los Angeles and Atlanta and plans to add locations in Miami, Dallas and Paris. Prices start at around $1,200-plus per person.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Barbara Peterson is a writer in New York. She can be reached at reports@wsj.com.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>DUBAI, UAE, Oct. 31, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Bybit, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has released its latest Bybit Crypto Insights Report, analyzing market movements following the much-anticipated October 2025 rate cut and ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's December policy decision.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Key Highlights:</span></strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The Federal Reserve implemented its second consecutive 25-basis-point rate cut, lowering the federal funds target range to 3.75%–4%.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Chair Jerome Powell described the economic outlook as \"driving in the fog,\" citing limited data amid a government shutdown.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Markets reacted unevenly: equities initially rallied before stabilizing, Treasury yields reversed higher, and the dollar weakened modestly.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Bitcoin and Ether saw short-term gains as lower yields and a softer dollar buoyed sentiment, while volatility in crypto markets remained subdued.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Institutional caution persisted due to regulatory uncertainties and tepid ETF flows, with select privacy tokens outperforming on specific catalysts.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>The October rate cut marked a critical juncture in the 2025 monetary policy cycle, signaling a pivot toward growth support amid inflation still above target and growing labor market fragility. The decision, approved by a 10–2 vote, reflected the Federal Reserve's balancing act between addressing economic weakness and maintaining inflation vigilance. Powell underscored that the current policy stance is \"modestly restrictive,\" but refrained from committing to further easing ahead of December's meeting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While risk assets initially welcomed the rate cut, Powell's cautious tone dampened investor enthusiasm. Treasury yields rose after an early dip, and equities moderated as traders reassessed expectations for future policy. In contrast, digital assets experienced a short-lived relief rally, with Bitcoin and Ether briefly extending gains before consolidating. Despite supportive macro conditions, the crypto market's muted reaction highlighted growing structural maturity, as volatility remained contained and option markets priced in continued caution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bybit's analysis concludes that crypto assets are increasingly behaving like high-beta macro instruments—sensitive to liquidity trends but shaped by internal market dynamics. The Federal Reserve's October decision extended the current risk-on environment, but without a clear policy trajectory for December, both traditional and digital markets remain in a holding pattern, awaiting decisive economic signals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The full analysis is available in the Bybit Crypto Insights Report.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>#Bybit / #CryptoArk /#BybitResearch / #BybitLearn</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Bybit</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bybit is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri all have small pockets of extreme or exceptional drought, according to the latest map. But these states are showing large coverage of dry conditions ranging from abnormally dry to severe drought. The USDA's Crop Progress report has not been published since late September, so traders and analysts are unsure of crop conditions through the harvest — which should be mostly complete by now. But the dryness likely hasn't helped the conditions of these finished crops. Most-active CBOT corn is down 0.2%, soybeans fall 0.2%, and wheat is up 0.2%.
