For those investors who don't take up their subscription rights, the Company endeavours to place in the market the shares that they were entitled to subscribe for, and then return the net sale proceeds to those investors as a way to deliver to them as much as possible of the value of their subscription rights, therefore reducing the dilution effect of not subscribing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The calculation for the fully diluted NAV per share assumes that the maximum number of shares the Company can issue is 21,566,885 based on the subscription exercise price of 104.63p on 30 November 2026.

As previously announced, TXNM Energy does not plan to issue 2026 earnings guidance during pendency of the proposed transaction with Blackstone Infrastructure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"PNM and TNMP continue to grow and we remain focused on meeting our customer needs across New Mexico and Texas, with TNMP supporting a 28% increase in system peak demand and PNM delivering 80% carbon free energy in 2025,\" said Don Tarry, President and CEO of TXNM Energy. \"Our proposed transaction with Blackstone Infrastructure will provide the necessary capital to support this growth and New Mexico's transition to clean energy. We look forward to bringing the benefits of this transaction to our customers and communities.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>TRANSACTION UPDATE</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On May 19, 2025, TXNM Energy announced an agreement under which affiliates of Blackstone Infrastructure will acquire the outstanding common stock of TXNM Energy for $61.25 per share.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shareholders approved the proposed transaction on August 28, 2025. In February 2026, approval was received from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Public Utility Commission of Texas (\"PUCT\") approved a unanimous settlement agreement on the proposed transaction. Clearance has been received from the Federal Communications Commission and the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act has expired without any objections or concerns having been raised. Approvals continue to be pursued from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (\"NMPRC\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>TXNM Energy continues to anticipate that the closing of the acquisition will occur in the second half of 2026, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the remaining customary closing conditions, including among other things, receipt of other required state and federal regulatory approvals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>REGULATORY UPDATE</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On November 14, 2025, Texas New Mexico Power (\"TNMP\") filed a general rate proceeding with the PUCT requesting recovery of $2.8 billion of rate base as of June 30, 2025, a requested return on equity of 10.4%, and a 47.54% equity ratio. The TNMP base rate review also includes increases in operations and maintenance expenses that are not recovered through semi-annual Transmission Cost of Service (\"TCOS\") and Distribution Cost Recovery Factor (\"DCRF\") filings, excludes increases in interest expense resulting from refinancing of debt associated with the proposed Blackstone Infrastructure transaction, and requests recovery of $20.5 million associated with Hurricane Beryl restoration costs over a five-year period. If approved by the PUCT, the new rates are expected to become effective in mid-2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On December 29, 2025, Public Service Company of New Mexico (\"PNM\") filed an application with the NMPRC for approval of two economic development projects related to New Mexico Senate Bill 170 at an estimated cost of $165.5 million. Senate Bill 170 allows a utility to defer costs of economic development projects that serve sites certified by the New Mexico Economic Development Department.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On February 25, 2026, PNM filed an application with the NMPRC for approval of a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for a new 345 kV transmission line, existing station expansions, and a new substation at an estimated cost of $247 million. This project aims to enhance reliability and resilience in the Albuquerque area, facilitate the integration of renewable energy, and support economic development.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the fourth quarter of 2025, PNM initiated its 2026 Integrated Resource Plan (\"IRP\") process which will cover the 20-year planning period from 2026 through 2046. Consistent with historical practice, PNM is receiving public input from interested parties as part of this process. PNM expects to file its 2026 IRP with the NMPRC on or before September 1, 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>TNMP's second DCRF filing for 2025 was approved and implemented in the fourth quarter, providing recovery for $19 million of rate base.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SEGMENT REPORTING OF 2025 EARNINGS</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>PNM -- a vertically integrated electric utility in New Mexico with   distribution, transmission and generation assets.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>TNMP -- an electric transmission and distribution utility in Texas.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Corporate and Other -- reflects the TXNM Energy holding company and other   subsidiaries.

Readers are cautioned that all forward-looking statements are based upon current expectations and estimates and apply only as of the date of this report. TXNM, PNM, and TNMP assume no obligation to update this information. Because actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, TXNM, PNM, and TNMP caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. TXNM's, PNM's, and TNMP's business, financial condition, cash flow, and operating results are influenced by many factors, which are often beyond their control, that can cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. For a discussion of risk factors and other important factors affecting forward-looking statements, please see the Company's Form 10-K, Form 10-Q filings and the information included in the Company's Form 8-K's with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which factors are specifically incorporated by reference herein and the risks and uncertainties related to the proposed transaction with Blackstone Infrastructure, including, but not limited to: the expected timing and likelihood of completion of the pending transaction, including the timing, receipt and terms and conditions of any required governmental and regulatory approvals of the pending transaction that could reduce anticipated benefits or cause the parties to abandon the transaction, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the transaction agreement, including in circumstances requiring TXNM Energy to pay a termination fee, the risk that the parties may not be able to satisfy the conditions to the proposed transaction in a timely manner or at all, the outcome of legal proceedings that may be instituted against TXNM Energy, its directors and others related to the proposed transaction, risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction, the risk that the proposed transaction and its announcement could have an adverse effect on the ability of TXNM Energy to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with its customers and suppliers, and on its operating results and businesses generally, the amount of costs, fees, charges or expenses resulting from the proposed transaction, and the risk that the price of TXNM Energy's common stock may fluctuate during the pendency of the proposed transaction and may decline significantly if the proposed transaction is not completed. Other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this communication could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. Ongoing earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of net unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on economic hedges, the net change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, pension expense related to previously disposed of gas distribution business, and certain non-recurring, infrequent, and other items that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Company's operations. The Company uses ongoing earnings and ongoing earnings per diluted share to evaluate the operations of the Company and to establish goals, including those used for certain aspects of incentive compensation, for management and employees. While the Company believes these financial measures are appropriate and useful for investors, they are not measures presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not intend for these measures, or any piece of these measures, to represent any financial measure as defined by GAAP. Furthermore, the Company's calculations of these measures as presented may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company uses ongoing earnings guidance to provide investors with management's expectations of ongoing financial performance over the period presented. While the Company believes ongoing earnings guidance is an appropriate measure, it is not a measure presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not intend for ongoing earnings guidance to represent an expectation of net earnings as defined by GAAP. Since the future differences between GAAP and ongoing earnings are frequently outside the control of the Company, management is generally not able to estimate the impact of the reconciling items between forecasted GAAP net earnings and ongoing earnings guidance, nor their probable impact on GAAP net earnings without unreasonable effort, therefore, management is generally not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for ongoing earnings guidance. Reconciliations between GAAP and ongoing earnings are contained in schedules 1-4.</span></p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><span> </span><br/><span>

During the fourth quarter 2025, Delek US's benchmark crack spreads were up an average of 66.0% from prior-year levels.

Statements concerning current estimates, expectations and projections about future results, performance, prospects, opportunities, plans, actions and events and other statements, concerns, or matters that are not historical facts are \"forward-looking statements,\" as that term is defined under the federal securities laws.

These financial and operational non-GAAP measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Adjusting items - certain identified infrequently occurring items,   non-cash items, and items that are not attributable to or indicative of   our on-going operations or that may obscure our underlying results and   trends;   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Adjusted net income (loss) - calculated as net income (loss)   attributable to Delek US adjusted for relevant Adjusting items recorded   during the period;   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Adjusted net income (loss) per share - calculated as Adjusted net   income (loss) divided by weighted average shares outstanding, assuming   dilution, as adjusted for any anti-dilutive instruments that may not be   permitted for consideration in GAAP earnings per share calculations but   that nonetheless favorably impact dilution;   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization   (\"EBITDA\") - calculated as net income (loss) attributable to Delek   adjusted to add back interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation,   amortization and proportional interest, taxes, depreciation and   amortization of equity method investments;   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA - calculated as EBITDA adjusted for the relevant   identified Adjusting items in Adjusted net income (loss) that do not   relate to interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation or   amortization, and adjusted to include income (loss) attributable to   non-controlling interests;   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Refining margin - calculated as gross margin (which we define as sales   minus cost of sales) adjusted for operating expenses and depreciation and   amortization included in cost of sales;   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Adjusted refining margin - calculated as refining margin adjusted for   other inventory impacts, net inventory LCM valuation loss (benefit),   unrealized hedging (gain) loss and intercompany lease impacts;   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Refining production margin - calculated based on the regional market   sales price of refined products produced, less allocated transportation,   Renewable Fuel Standard volume obligation and associated feedstock costs.   This measure reflects the economics of each refinery exclusive of the   financial impact of inventory price risk mitigation programs and   marketing uplift strategies;   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Refining production margin per throughput barrel - calculated as   refining production margin divided by our average refining throughput in   barrels per day (excluding purchased barrels) multiplied by 1,000 and   multiplied by the number of days in the period; and   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Net debt - calculated as long-term debt including both current and   non-current portions (the most comparable GAAP measure) less cash and   cash equivalents as of a specific balance sheet date. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>We believe these non-GAAP operational and financial measures are useful to investors, lenders, ratings agencies and analysts to assess our ongoing performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable GAAP financial measure, they provide improved relevant comparability between periods, to peers or to market metrics through the inclusion of retroactive regulatory or other adjustments as if they had occurred in the prior periods they relate to, or through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying results and trends. \"Net debt,\" also a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Additionally, because Adjusted net income or loss, Adjusted net income or loss per share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Refining Margin and Refining Production Margin or any of our other identified non-GAAP measures may be defined differently by other companies in its industry, Delek US' definition may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

We exercised optionality to exclude certain volumes related to the agreement and our obligation under the agreement was reduced by $289.2 million between December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other Inventory Impact</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Other inventory impact\" is primarily calculated by multiplying the number of barrels sold during the period by the difference between current period weighted average purchase cost per barrel directly related to our refineries and per barrel cost of materials and other for the period recognized on a first-in, first-out basis directly related to our refineries. It assumes no beginning or ending inventory, so that the current period average purchase cost per barrel is a reasonable estimate of our market purchase cost for the current period, without giving effect to any build or draw on beginning inventory. These amounts are based on management estimates using a methodology including these assumptions. However, this analysis provides management with a means to compare hypothetical refining margins to current period average crack spreads, as well as provides a means to better compare our results to peers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Small Refinery Exemptions</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In August of 2025, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") announced its decisions on the backlog of 175 Small Refinery Exemption (\"SRE\") petitions from refineries seeking an exemption from their Renewable Fuel Standard obligations. Delek fully complied with Renewable Identification Number (\"RIN\") obligations for all years, incurring significant costs to finance our compliance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>EPA granted Delek full and partial exemptions for substantially all of our 20 petitions for the 2019-2024 calendar years. Because RINs are valid for a one-year period, a majority of the refunded RINs were expired and therefore had no value, and are the subject of ongoing litigation. The RINs received from prior year SREs resulted in a reduction of our Consolidated Net RIN Obligation and therefore a reduction within cost of materials and other of approximately $75.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Intercompany Leases</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a result of amendments to intercompany lease agreements in August 2024, we had to reassess lease classification for the agreements that contain leases under Accounting Standards Codification 842. As a result of these lease assessments, certain of these agreements met the criteria to be accounted for as sales-type leases for Delek Logistics and finance leases for the Refining segment. Therefore, portions of the minimum volume commitments under these agreements subject to sales-type lease accounting are recorded as interest income with the remaining amounts recorded as a reduction in net investment in leases. Prior to the amendments, these agreements were accounted for as operating leases and these minimum volume commitments were recorded as revenues in the Logistics segment. Similarly, these minimum volume commitments were previously recorded as costs of sales for the Refining segment, as the underlying lease was reclassified from an operating lease to a finance lease, and these payments are now recorded as interest expense and reductions in the lease liability. These accounting changes have no impact to the Delek US consolidated results as these amounts eliminate in consolidation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Subsequent Events - Transactions with Delek Logistics</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In January 2026, we entered into asset purchase agreements with Delek Logistics, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire a Tyler refinery tank for total consideration of $19.0 million and El Dorado tank and terminal assets for total consideration of $66.0 million. The Tyler Tank Purchase and the El Dorado Terminal Purchase are expected to close on April 1, 2026 and October 1, 2027, respectively.</span></p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\"

However, based on our history of being granted the exemptions </span><br/><span>     and expected future activity, we have adjusted the non-GAAP measure to </span><br/><span>     include the benefit of receiving exemptions equal to approximately 50% of </span><br/><span>     our recorded current-period obligation. </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Reconciliation of Income

Quarter Impacting Results\" section. </span><br/><span>(2)  Starting with the quarter ended March 31, 2025, we updated our non-GAAP </span><br/><span>     financial measures to include the impact of fair value adjustments to the </span><br/><span>     net RINs obligation under the EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard to reflect </span><br/><span>     the period end market price of the underlying RINs. The impact to </span><br/><span>     historical non-GAAP financial measures is immaterial. </span><br/><span>(3)  During the second quarter 2024, we realigned our reportable segments for </span><br/><span>     financial reporting purposes to reflect changes in the manner in which </span><br/><span>     our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, assesses financial </span><br/><span>     information for decision-making purposes. The change represents reporting </span><br/><span>     the operating results of our 50% interest in a joint venture that owns </span><br/><span>     asphalt terminals located in the southwestern region of the U.S. within </span><br/><span>     the refining segment. Prior to this change, these operating results were </span><br/><span>     reported as part of corporate, other and eliminations. While this </span><br/><span>     reporting change did not change our consolidated results, segment data </span><br/><span>     for previous years has been restated and is consistent with the current </span><br/><span>     year presentation. </span><br/><span>(4)  Starting with the quarter ended June 30, 2025, we updated our non-GAAP </span><br/><span>     financial measures to include the impact of the DPG inventory for price </span><br/><span>     and volume inventory impacts. The impact to historical non-GAAP financial </span><br/><span>     measures is immaterial. </span><br/><span>(5)  Starting with the quarter ended September 30, 2025, we have updated our </span><br/><span>     non-GAAP financial measures to include the benefit related to small </span><br/><span>     refinery exemptions expected to be received specific to the current year </span><br/><span>     obligation based on current laws and regulations. Consistent with our </span><br/><span>     historical accounting practice, we have recorded the full amount of our </span><br/><span>     Consolidated Net RINs Obligation assuming no future exemptions are </span><br/><span>     granted. However, based on our history of being granted the exemptions </span><br/><span>     and expected future activity, we have adjusted the non-GAAP measure to </span><br/><span>     include the benefit of receiving exemptions equal to approximately 50% of </span><br/><span>     our recorded current-period obligation. </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>
