The company has started raising prices in response to rising product costs from tariffs, resulting in roughly 3% pricing inflation in 3Q, compared with 2% the quarter before. Advance Auto Parts expects inflation to reach 4% this quarter and continue rising, though at a slower rate, in 2026. Executives tell analysts they expect some volatility in sales as consumers manage their budgets in an inflationary backdrop. Transactions were down in 3Q. Advance Auto Parts loses 3% after the executive comments, despite recording a narrower loss in the quarter. (katherine.hamilton@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

This represents an 11% increase from the previous quarter and a 72% increase from the same period last year. The company's return on average assets (ROAA) improved to 1.09%, and return on average equity (ROAE) rose to 12.43%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The net interest margin (NIM) on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis was 3.84%, up from 3.43% a year ago.

The company also reported improved asset quality, with non-performing assets (NPAs) declining to 0.28% of total assets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-interest income increased by $611 thousand to $4.5 million, driven by higher ATM and check card income, fees for other customer services, and a bargain purchase gain from the Touchstone acquisition. Non-interest expense rose to $15.8 million, primarily due to increased salaries, employee benefits, and occupancy expenses.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>First National has been active in managing its capital structure.

It's been a slog since then. The stock plummeted 17% on Aug. 1 after second-quarter earnings results showed a 39% drop in transaction revenue — and Coinbase is yet to claw back those losses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The stock was down 3.3% to $337.09 on Thursday, though it remains up 35% in 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Analysts expect Coinbase to report $1.8 billion in revenue for the third quarter, up 49% from a year ago, per FactSet. Earnings are expected to come in at $1.13 a share, well above 28 cents last year. That growth should show up across the business, from consumer and institutional transactions to subscriptions and services, analysts predict.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>H.C. Wainwright, which downgraded Coinbase to a short-term Sell in July a few weeks before the stock's pullback, double-upgraded shares to Buy in a research note Thursday. The firm also lifted its price target for Coinbase shares to $425 from $300.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto trading volumes and the company's \"take rate\" on transaction fees should drive revenue and profits higher than previously expected, H.C. Wainwright argued.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Coinbase's $2.9 billion acquisition of crypto options exchange Deribit, which closed in August, may also bear fruit. H.C. Wainwright expects Coinbase to post meaningful derivatives trading revenue for the first time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking beyond Thursday, further momentum in Washington, D.C., may be the most critical catalyst for Coinbase.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Genius Act in late July established a regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are tokens pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Coinbase notably takes in revenue as a distribution partner for USDC, the stablecoin issued by Circle Internet Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crypto companies are now waiting for the Senate to pass the Clarity Act, which would divide regulation between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Many crypto industry insiders believe the bill, which passed in the House of Representatives in July, will unleash institutional adoption of digital assets. The Clarity Act will likely get the green light from the Senate by the end of 2025, giving a boost to Coinbase shares, H.C. Wainwright argued.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Our stance has turned back to bullish,\" H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese wrote of Coinbase. \"We expect rising crypto asset prices (driven by seasonal strength and accelerating institutional demand) and regulatory tailwinds to drive the stock higher in the last quarter of the year.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>H.C. Wainwright's double-upgrade followed a similarly bullish outlook from J.P. Morgan, which upgraded Coinbase to Overweight from Neutral and raised its price target to $404 from $342 last week. Coinbase has many monetization opportunities beyond crypto trading, including its Coinbase One subscription offering, J.P. Morgan said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That growing diversification means plenty of opportunities to impress — or disappoint — investors on Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Nate Wolf at nate.wolf@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
