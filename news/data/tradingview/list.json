It says the government shutdown, tariffs and reduced purchasing have impacted the consumer retail and beverage sector. National Beverage says it continues to generate superior cash flows. The company is buying stock on the open market saying current prices don't accurately reflect its underlying value. Shares rise 2.7% to $33.35 and are down about 22% this year. On Oct. 10, MTY Food Group, home to many chains including Cold Stone Creamery and Wetzel's Pretzels, mentioned that SNAP funding disruptions could hurt discretionary spending.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Allegra Fradkin; Editing by Jeff Barber</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Global oil prices are projected to fall to a five-year-low in 2026 on growing  supply and weaker demand, the World Bank Group said Wednesday in its Commodity Markets Outlook. The bank forecast Brent crude prices will average $68/bbl this year, down sharply from 2024's $81/bbl average, then slip to an average of $60/bbl next year. The oil market surplus, fueled largely by output increases from OPEC and allied producers, will rise to 4 million b/d in 2026, 65% above the peak surplus in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic led to a sharp drop in demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The organization said the implied market surplus of 2.7 million b/d in the third quarter of this year, the largest since 2020, underscores the persistence of the oversupplied market. While stockpiling by China and European countries has absorbed part of the glut, supply continues to outpace demand, according to the report.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The World Bank projects global oil output will increase to a record 106.1 million b/d in this year and rise to 108.5 million b/d in 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oil prices over the first nine months of 2025 were 14% below the same period of 2024, though Brent crude briefly spiked 5% late this month after the U.S. announced sanctions on Russian oil companies. Further, the report said demand remains stagnant in major economies like China, where consumption growth is sharply below 2015-2019 levels on rising adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles. India's economy may be the sole bright spot for demand as the country increases its consumption of LPG and gasoline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The report warned oil prices could fall further if OPEC+ production continues rise or if demand weakens more than expected, though geopolitical tensions or new sanctions could support prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The bank forecast overall energy prices will decline 12% in the year and by another 10% in 2026 before edging higher in 2027. Brent is projected to recover to $65/bbl in 2027 as low prices curb excess supply.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(c) 2025 Oil Price Information Service, LLC.

It's the first time that threshold has been passed since July 2024. President Trump posted on Truth Social that he \"had a truly great meeting with President Xi of China,\" mentioning that China agreed to purchase \"massive amounts of Soybeans, Sorghum, and other Farm products.\" Further details were scant throughout the day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>INSIGHT</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Different Scenario: China isn't looking to build its livestock herds, but instead move more animals through its meat-processing pipeline. That may become a big factor influencing how CBOT soybeans trade, more so than promises made during this week's meetings between the U.S. and China. \"Amid a massive liquidation of their hog herd, [we doubt] that China wants to import greater tonnages of soybeans in 2025/26,\" AgResource said in a note. The firm also adds that Brazilian prices remain more competitive, making the U.S. a less-favored alternative until margins ease.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Delayed Reaction: Aid payments that have been directed to farmers in the wake of U.S. trading disputes with numerous partners may be slowing down what would otherwise be a necessary change in the input costs for farmers to plant every spring. In a report this week, analysts with Rabobank said payments coming from the Trump Administration may be creating this delay. If land values alone were to backtrack from current levels, then the price competitiveness of U.S. soybeans would be closer to par with that of soybeans out of Brazil's Mato Grosso region, Rabobank said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AHEAD</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Note: The government shutdown is impacting the timing of USDA reports and data releases.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>AGCO Corp. will release its third quarter earnings report at 7:30 a.m. ET Friday.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Zoetis Inc. will release its third quarter earnings report at 7 a.m. ET Tuesday.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Mosaic Co. will release its third quarter earnings report after the  stock market closes on Tuesday.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
