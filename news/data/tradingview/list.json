            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Randall W. Forsyth</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All eyes were on the parade of earnings reports from the technology behemoths this past week. But what grabbed the markets' attention were the implications of their massive capital investments in artificial intelligence on their balance sheets and cash-flow statements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the center of this debate was Meta Platforms, which plunged 11% on Thursday after reporting a miss on earnings but, more importantly, said it was pushing full-speed ahead on AI data centers, projecting $71 billion in spending, up from $69 billion previously. Moreover, the company said that capital expenditures \"will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All of which is absorbing increasing amounts of megatechs' cash flow. As Doug Kass of Seabreeze Partners observes, the so-called hyperscalers have morphed from being \"capital light\" to capital-intensive operations. In the process, they have had to turn to external financing for their ambitious AI buildouts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In fact, Meta brought this year's biggest investment-grade corporate bond deal to market, totaling some $30 billion, the latest in a parade of recent data-center borrowing. Bank of America tallies $75 billion of AI-related public debt offerings in the past two months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And that doesn't count other financings, including Meta's creative off-balance-sheet funding of its Louisiana data center, described by colleague Adam Levine in last week's Tech Trader column. That includes a $38 billion loan tied to Oracle's data centers, on top of $18 billion of public bonds issued by the company, led by world's second-richest person, Larry Ellison.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Putting numbers to Kass' point, BofA credit strategists Yuri Seliger and Sohyun Marie Lee write in a client note that capital spending by five of the Magnificent Seven megacap tech companies ( Amazon.com, Alphabet, and Microsoft, along with Meta and Oracle) has been growing even faster than their prodigious cash flows. \"These companies collectively may be reaching a limit to how much AI capex they are willing to fund purely from cash flows,\" they write.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consensus estimates of AI capex suggest, they calculate, that it will climb to 94% of operating cash flows, minus dividends and share repurchases, in 2025 and 2026, up from 76% in 2024. That's still less than 100% of cash flows, so they don't need to borrow to fund spending, \"but it's getting close,\" they add.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That leaves no room to return capital to shareholders. The companies could opt to fund AI investments by eliminating share buybacks, which would mean those investments would take the ratio of capex to cash flow back to the low 70% range. Or the companies could take advantage of their stocks' elevated price/earnings ratios by issuing equity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Much more expedient, and more favorable from an equity investors' standpoint, is to continue to issue debt. And that's especially so while credit-market conditions are so salubrious. According to multiple reports, Meta received over $120 billion of orders for its $30 billion of high-grade (Aa3 by Moody's, AA- by S&amp;P Global Ratings) bonds on offer, a reflection of massive investor demand for investment-grade corporate bonds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On that point, Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Schmid pointed to easy financial market conditions as one reason for dissenting against the central bank's decision to lower its federal-funds target a quarter percentage point, to a range of 3.75% to 4%, this past week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Equity markets near record highs, narrow corporate bond spreads, and robust high-yield bond issuance counter the suggestion that monetary policy is restrictive, he said in a statement on Friday explaining his vote. Meanwhile, inflation has exceeded the Fed's 2% target for more than four years, he added. (Fed governor Stephen Miran dissented in the opposite direction, preferring a half-point cut, as he had at the September meeting.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kass points out that unlike earnings per share, cash flow can't be manipulated by companies. If they spend more on AI than they generate internally, they have to finance the difference. That's no problem currently, especially with the credit markets ready, able, and more than willing to fund megatech borrowers. And the future promise from AI may justify today's spending.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But there is a credit cycle. And tech hadn't depended on it until now.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Randall W.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Megan Leonhardt</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of the best views of waves breaking off Maine's rugged coast can be seen from Ogunquit's Marginal Way, a coastal cliff walk in the southern part of the state. But storms and erosion have taken a toll, threatening the structural integrity of the roughly 1.5-mile trail. Erosion, by its nature, can weaken foundations over time, leading them to crumble under pressure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. labor market looks to be undergoing a similar sort of erosion, with hiring stalled as employers weigh months of economic and policy uncertainty. Yet, while conditions may not be as \"stable\" as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated this past week, there are indications the market's foundation is much stronger than that of Marginal Way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For one, the number of people filing for unemployment benefits hasn't shot up, at least not yet. The Labor Department hasn't released official estimates of weekly initial jobless-claim volumes since early October, due to the government shutdown, which began Oct. 1. But Citigroup economists estimate on the basis of available state data that initial jobless claims fell to 220,000 filings for the week of Oct. 25 from 232,000 in the prior week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That alone signals the number of Americans losing their jobs, even in the midst of a government shutdown, hasn't reached alarming levels. Mike Reid, senior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, credits healthy corporate fundamentals, noting that profit growth was strong in the third quarter. Reid says he would be concerned if weekly claims rise above 275,000.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Higher-income households, bolstered by stock market and home-equity gains, have continued to spend, boosting corporate revenue and earnings and driving broader economic growth. Bank of America reports that total credit-card spending per household rose 0.8% in the year ended Oct. 25. That has helped keep employment in the retailing business \"surprisingly stable\" in recent months, says Lisa Simon, chief economist at Revelio Labs, which maintains a workforce database.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Moreover, more small businesses said in the latest National Federation of Independent Businesses survey that they are planning to hire. The hospitality sector posted the strongest rebound in hiring in October, with monthly payroll growth up 13.8%, breaking a two-year pattern of October declines, according to data from Homebase — a provider of employee management software to about 150,000 small businesses, which collectively employ about two million people. The transportation and logistics sector recorded monthly payroll gains of 4.8% in the month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Education and healthcare, which have driven much of the job growth this year, likely will continue to add jobs as well, Revelio's Simon says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Private payrolls, in general, may have ticked higher in recent weeks. ADP reported on Tuesday that total private employment grew by a four-week moving average of 14,250 jobs in the week ended Oct. 11, up from a four-week average gain of 10,750 jobs in the week ended Oct. 4.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The pickup suggests that the hiring freeze that has plagued much of the labor market in recent months may be easing, although the recovery is \"tepid,\" says ADP chief economist Nela Richardson. She cautioned that the weekly pulse data are estimates and that recent hiring patterns have been volatile week to week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To be sure, the job market isn't as robust as it was a year ago, or even back in April — and the risk of more layoffs shouldn't be discounted.
