            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Mark Hulbert</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investment professionals rarely outperform in a bull market. If you want stock picking to pay off, you're essentially rooting for a crash.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Will this year bring a bear market?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If this really is a time for stock pickers to get greedy, then a market downturn is likely.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investment advisers hoping for a return of a \"stock-pickers market\" should be careful what they wish for. I'm referring to the age-old distinction between an investment environment in which most stocks march to the beats of their own individual drummers (a so-called \"market of stocks\") and its opposite, an environment in which most stocks rise and fall in tandem with each other (a so-called \"stock market\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a \"stock market\" the best strategy is simply investing in a broad stock-market index fund, while in a \"market of stocks\" the strategy most likely to beat the market is picking and choosing individual stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There have been a rash of declarations that we have entered a market-of-stocks environment. Bloomberg even declared that \"for stock pickers, now might be the time to get greedy.\" But what many analysts don't appreciate is that the distinction between these two market environments is correlated with the market's cycle. Stock picking is far more likely to be successful when the overall market is falling than when it's rising. To hope for a \"market of stocks\" is functionally equivalent in many ways to hoping for a bear market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This functional equivalence is illustrated in the accompanying chart. Each dot represents one of the calendar years since 1981; its place on the vertical axis represents the percentage of investment newsletter portfolios that beat the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index XX:W5000FLT in that calendar year (as measured by the portfolios tracked by my performance auditing firm). Each dot's place along the horizontal axis reflects the Wilshire 5000's return in that year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notice the steep downwardly sloping trendline that best fits these dots, the statistical significance of which is quite high (as signified by its impressive r-squared). That means, on average, more portfolios beat the market when the stock market is falling - and vice versa. The implication: If it's really time for stock pickers to get greedy, then the market as a whole is likely to fall.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last year is a good case in point. The broad market, as measured by the Wilshire 5000's total return, gained 17.1% in 2025 - well-above the U.S. stock market's long-term average rate of return. Sure enough, stock pickers struggled: Just 31% of monitored investment newsletter portfolios beat the market, in fact. A similarly low proportion of actively-managed equity funds and ETFs beat the market, according to Morningstar's Active/Passive Barometer - just 38%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Of course, none of this discussion sheds any light on whether there actually will be a bear market in 2026, and therefore whether or not the odds favor stock picking. But unless you have an unusually good crystal ball about when the next bear market will begin, there's no reason to change your investment strategy for making money in the stock market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.

These programs outlined mineralization over approximately 1,200 meters laterally and to depths approaching 900 meters. The mineralized horizon occurs at the contact between mafic and felsic volcanic units, a geological setting characteristic of volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits..</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Recent compilation of historical data by the Company suggests that the known mineralization may be controlled by a large-scale fold structure, leaving open the possibility of additional lateral and structural extensions that remain partially or entirely untested.

The Company holds a 100% interest in the Bousquet (Au), Langlade (Cu, Zn, Ag, Au), Bodo (Cu, Au, Ag, Zn, Ni, Li, Co, Mn, Pb) and Terragold (Au) projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Bousquet Project has been optioned to the Australian company Olympio Metals (Oly), which may acquire up to an 80% interest in the gold project in consideration for C$1.25 million in cash and shares, as well as C$2 million in exploration expenditures. Should Olympio fulfill all its obligations, Bullion would retain a 20% net carried, undivided non-participating interest.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Langlade Project (72 claims - 4,127 ha) is a volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) project currently in development and drill-ready.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Bodo Project (761 claims - 410 km²) is an early-stage exploration project. Anomalous and indicative occurrences of critical and strategic minerals (Au, Ag, Cu, Zn, Ni, Li, Pb, Co, Mn) have been identified across the property. The main showings - Rivon Lake, Canico, Licé, Tichégami and Didi - demonstrate polymetallic, VMS and IOC potential.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bullion recently acquired the Terragold Project, located in the Senneterre region of Abitibi. The main showing, known since the early 1960s, has been intersected by drilling over a cumulative strike length of approximately 2 kilometres and has not been the subject of exploration work since 1984. The mineralized corridor associated with a quartz-porphyry system remains open in all directions. The Company plans to undertake various exploration activities on this project in 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>For further information, please contact:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Guy Morissette</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>President and CEO</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>gmorissette@bulliongold.ca</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Other Information</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>The TSX Venture Exchange and its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts no responsibility for the veracity or accuracy of its content.</span></em></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Forward-Looking Statements:</span></strong><em><span> This press release contains forward-looking statements.

We achieved a $2 billion improvement in profitability in our first full year under the Back-to-Basics strategy, driven by meaningful gains in revenue, utilization, unit economics, and customer experience.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"With a healthier fleet and improving residual performance, we are building from a position of strength and have begun to expand retail and mobility capabilities bolstering the Hertz platform. Spanning Rent-A-Car, Service, Fleet, and Mobility, we believe these businesses will generate value well beyond traditional rental, and ultimately redefine the role Hertz plays in the future of mobility.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ESTERO, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 26, 2026--</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. </span><span> (\"Hertz,\" \"Hertz Global,\" or the \"Company\") today reported results for its fourth quarter and full year 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Q4 AND FULL YEAR 2025 HIGHLIGHTS</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Revenue totaled $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter and $8.5 billion for   full-year 2025, reflecting sequential improvement in pricing and   resulting in Hertz's strongest year-over-year revenue performance since   Q1 2024. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Year-over-year Revenue per Unit (RPU) and Revenue Per Day (RPD) metrics   improved sequentially through 2025. This momentum has continued into Q1   2026 as the Company expects to deliver mid-single digit revenue growth,   driven by continued progress on internal revenue management initiatives   and a positive industry pricing environment. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Profitability improved more than $2 billion year over year, with net   loss totaling $194 million in Q4 and $747 million for the full year;   Diluted EPS showed a significant year-over-year improvement, landing at   $(0.72) for the quarter and $(2.43) for 2025. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Adjusted Corporate EBITDA for Q4 was $(205) million, an improvement of   approximately $150 million year-over-year. This includes more than a $100   million impact from several transitory headwinds. Full year Adjusted   Corporate EBITDA was $(339) million, an improvement of more than $1   billion year over year as revenue optimization, utilization gains, and   cost controls took hold. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Utilization was 78% in the fourth quarter and averaged 81% for the full   year, a year-over-year improvement of 200 basis points, driving improved   RPU. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Depreciation per Unit per Month (DPU) was $330 in Q4 and $300 for the   full year, representing a year-over-year improvement of 44%, supported by   disciplined fleet rotation. Depreciation was weighed down by an   approximately $60 million non-cash charge driven by a revised third party   forecast of residual values. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Q4 adjusted Direct Operating Expense (DOE) per transaction day improved   by 6% year over year through rigorous cost control and operational   discipline. DOE declined 3% year over year in the fourth quarter and 4%   for the full year while Transaction Days declined 1% and 3%   respectively. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Customer experience continued to improve in 2025, with Net Promoter   Score increasing nearly 50% year-over-year, reflecting measurable gains   in rental ease, fleet quality, and service reliability. </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Hertz ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.5 billion of   liquidity and potential access to more than $1 billion of liquidity   enhancements. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Transitory Q4 Headwinds</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A number of compounding external events impacted EBITDA in the fourth quarter by more than $100 million. This included a government shutdown coupled with FAA flight cancellations, multiple technology vendor outages, and a nearly 3 times higher than normal level of vehicles on recall.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>DPU was in line with the Company's full-year North Star target, but above its quarterly target due to a revised Black Book residual outlook and softer seasonal wholesale pricing amid elevated OEM and rental de-fleeting activity. This resulted in an approximately $60 million non-cash depreciation charge. Looking ahead, the Company sees a more normalized residual value outlook for 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Excluding these items, our core EBITDA production was in line with our expectations, reflecting continued progress on our revenue and cost initiatives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2025 Summary</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>2025 was a critical year in the Hertz transformation, and underscored that the structural improvements the Company is making are permanent while the headwinds it faces are transitory. The traditional rental car business is improving, guided by its North Star metrics of DPU sub $300, RPU over $1,500, and DOE per transaction day in the low $30s.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Over the course of the year, Hertz completed its fleet rotation and successfully secured model year 2026 buys at its target prices and volumes. This enabled model year 2025 sales through Hertz Car Sales, continuing the Company's short-hold strategy and introducing a richer, more optimized car-class mix to its fleet. Hertz's average fleet age was less than ten months and the lowest its been in almost a decade.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Through these actions, Hertz achieved a full year EBITDA improvement of more than $1 billion year over year. The Company drove sequential improvements in revenue, RPU, and RPD, while also improving utilization and driving DPU down in line with the North Star target. Hertz also brought DOE per transaction day down despite lower volumes and saw a nearly 50% improvement in customer satisfaction — a result of an intentional effort to improve operations and customer experience.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Q1 2026 Insights</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hertz's early first quarter performance indicates that its commercial strategy continues to deliver sustained value in 2026. January revenue results show meaningful improvement year over year, with February trending more positively and March continuing that trajectory. The Company expects a mid-single digit increase in revenue for the quarter, supported by a constructive demand environment and increased year-over-year RPD. With respect to the fleet, the Company also sees signs that residual values are improving from Q4's seasonal lows. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, the Company remains focused on growing the off-airport and mobility business and accelerating revenue growth while staying disciplined on costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Platform for Growth</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company is building on the transformation of the core rental car business by establishing a diversified, value-creating platform for growth. This platform spans four strategic areas — Rent-a-Car, Service, Fleet, and Mobility — each with unique potential to scale. The Company is focused on developing capabilities across its platform, including continuing the digital evolution of Hertz Car Sales in Fleet, exploring growth and franchise opportunities in Rent-a-Car, piloting new offerings in Service, and expanding revenue channels, assets, and capabilities in Mobility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>EARNINGS WEBCAST INFORMATION</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hertz Global's live webcast and conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2025 results will be held on February 26, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Adjusted Net Income (Loss) includes a provision (benefit) for income taxes derived utilizing a combined statutory rate. The combined statutory rate is management's estimate of the Company's long-term tax rate. Its most comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EPS represents Adjusted Net Income (Loss) on a per diluted share basis using the weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period.

These measures enable management and investors to isolate the effects on profitability of operating metrics most meaningful to the business of renting and leasing vehicles. They also allow management and investors to assess the performance of the entire business on the same basis as its reportable segments.

Adjusted DOE per day is important to management and investors as it measures the Company's cost efficiency on a per unit basis excluding the impact of variable direct operating expense fluctuations attributable to changes in volume, so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Available Car Days</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Available Car Days represents Average Rentable Vehicles multiplied by the number of days in a given period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Average Vehicles (\"Fleet Capacity\" or \"Capacity\")</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Average Vehicles is determined using a simple average of the number of vehicles in the fleet whether owned or leased by the Company at the beginning and end of a given period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Average Rentable Vehicles</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Average Rentable Vehicles reflects Average Vehicles excluding vehicles for sale on the Company's retail lots or actively in the process of being sold through other disposition channels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Depreciation Per Unit Per Month (\"Depreciation Per Unit\" or \"DPU\")</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Depreciation Per Unit Per Month represents the amount of average depreciation expense and lease charges per vehicle per month, exclusive of the impacts of foreign currency exchange rates so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends. This metric is important to management and investors as it reflects how effectively the Company is managing the costs of its vehicles and facilitates comparisons with other participants in the vehicle rental industry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total Revenue Per Transaction Day (\"Total RPD\" or \"RPD\"; also referred to as \"pricing\")</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total RPD represents revenue generated per transaction day, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends. This metric is important to management and investors as it represents a measure of changes in the underlying pricing in the vehicle rental business and encompasses the elements in vehicle rental pricing that management has the ability to control.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total Revenue Per Unit Per Month (\"Total RPU\", \"RPU\" or \"Total RPU Per Month\") Total RPU Per Month represents the amount of revenue generated per vehicle in the rental fleet each month, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends. This metric is important to management and investors as it provides a measure of revenue productivity relative to the number of vehicles in our rental fleet whether owned or leased, or asset efficiency.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Transaction Days (\"Days\"; also referred to as \"volume\")</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Transaction Days represents the total number of 24-hour periods, with any partial period counted as one Transaction Day, that vehicles were on rent (the period between when a rental contract is opened and closed) in a given period. Thus, it is possible for a vehicle to attain more than one Transaction Day in a 24-hour period. This metric is important to management and investors as it represents the number of revenue-generating days.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vehicle Utilization (\"Utilization\")</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Vehicle Utilization represents the ratio of Transaction Days to Available Car Days. This metric is important to management and investors as it is the measurement of the proportion of vehicles that are being used to generate revenues relative to rentable fleet capacity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260226304972/en/</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CONTACT:    Hertz Investor Relations:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>investorrelations@hertz.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hertz Media Relations:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>mediarelations@hertz.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
