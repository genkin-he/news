Drilling is scheduled to begin November 1, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The 2,646-hectare Camelot property lies approximately 65 kilometres east of Williams Lake, B.C. within the Quesnel Terrane - home to multiple producing copper-gold and copper-molybdenum porphyry deposits, including the nearby Gibraltar and Mount Polley mines (Figure 1). The project area benefits from year-round road access and excellent regional infrastructure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Our technical team, which includes Equity Exploration Consultants Ltd., Members of the Board and our Technical Advisory Committee have done an exceptional job integrating decades of historic data,\" stated Len Brownlie, Ph.D., CEO of Prospect Ridge. \"</span><span>Very recently, an inversion of aerial magnetics data has revealed compelling signatures showing elevated magnetic features coincident with areas of elevated chargeability from an earlier IP survey. These inverted magnetic features at depth are consistent with potential apophyses on the shoulder of a larger batholith and are hypothesized to represent a porphyry stockwith disseminated sulphides and magnetite. Supporting this hypothesis, a historic 1974 vertical percussion hole (PDH74-L04), drilled to just 61metres depth, intersected 0.25% copper over 21.3 metres within a potassic-altered biotite monzonitei that appears to have clipped the outer flank of this hypothesized stock. With over $2.8M in our treasury, all permits in place and drilling set to begin on November 1, we are very excited to test these newly characterized targets\".</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>High Priority Drill Targets Defined</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Previous exploration workii,iii has outlined a 1700 m x 500 m coincident chargeability-magnetic anomaly trending northeast-southwest beneath shallow till cover in an area that has not been previously drilled (Figure 2). The anomaly lies within the same structural, stratigraphic, and intrusive trend as the Mount Polley copper-gold mine, located 34 km northwest of Camelot.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Drill targeting for the 2025 program draws on historic copper-in-soil anomalies, a 2011 induced polarization (IP) survey, and an inversion model of 2021 airborne magnetic data. When integrated, these datasets highlight target signatures typical of alkalic porphyries - moderately high-amplitude magnetic inversion anomalies with chimney-like geometries on the shoulders of broader, higher-amplitude anomalies, coincident with moderate-high to high chargeability that may reflect disseminated sulphide mineralization.Prospect Ridge has identified ten high priority and ten lower priority drill collar locations to probe these exciting targets in a ten hole diamond drill program (Figure 3).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A cross section derived from an inversion of the aerial magnetic data for the highest priority drill target (CAM25-001) is shown in Figure 4.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Highly regarded Dorado Drilling from Vernon, B.C. has been contracted to conduct the 2025 drilling program, with a drill rig currently enroute from Prince George to Horsefly, B.C.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About the Camelot Property</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Camelot project covers approximately 26 square kilometres in central B.C, and is located approximately 34 km southeast of Imperial Metals' Mount Polley mine, as well as 13 km northeast of Vizsla Copper's Woodjam project.

The approximately five-kilometre-wide pluton was formed by early phases of gabbro and diorite cut by younger monzonite porphyries, breccias, and late-stage monzonite-syenite dikes. Moderate K-feldspar and biotite alteration, as well as local pyrite-chalcopyrite mineralization, are primarily associated with monzonite porphyry. Zones of sericite-pyrite (or phyllic) alteration are poorly developed and quartz veining is absent, consistent with the interpreted alkalic nature of the system.</span></p><span>Figure 1: Map showing location of the Camelot property relative to nearby mines and deposits*</span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>*Sources for Figure 1 resources:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>1.

The Dogwood research pipeline includes two first-in-class development candidates, HalneuronÂ® and SP16 IV.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our lead product candidate, HalneuronÂ®, is in Phase 2b development to treat pain conditions including the neuropathic pain associated with chemotherapy treatment. HalneuronÂ® has been granted fast track designation from the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") for the treatment of CINP. HalneuronÂ® is a non-opioid, NaV 1.7 analgesic which is a highly specific voltage-gated sodium channel modulator, a mechanism known to be effective for reducing pain transmission. In clinical studies, HalneuronÂ® treatment has demonstrated pain reduction in pain related to general cancer and in pain related to chronic chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (\"CINP\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SP16 IV is a low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP1) agonist with potential to treat neuropathy and prevent or repair nerve damage following chemotherapy. SP16 acts as an LRP1 agonist that in turn provides alpha-1-antitrypsin-like activity. Consistent with alpha-1-antitrypsin anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions, SP16 preclinically demonstrated anti-inflammatory (analgesic) action via potential reductions in IL-6, IL-8, IL1B and TNF-alpha levels, as well as potential to repair damaged tissue via increases in pAKT and pERK that regulate fundamental processes like growth, proliferation and survival. The forthcoming SP16 IV Phase 1b CINP trial is fully funded by the National Cancer Institute.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For more information, please visit www.dwtx.com.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Forward-Looking Statements</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Statements in this press release contain \"forward-looking statements,\" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.
