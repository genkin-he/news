The following conditions shall otherwise apply to the resolution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(i) The right to subscribe for the warrants shall vest in Logistri Fastighets AB (publ). The reasons for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights are that the company intends to use the warrants as payment for part of the purchase price for the company Egenlokal Projektbolag 116 AB, reg. no. 559513-8081, and thereby indirectly the companies Egenlokal Projektbolag 118 AB, reg. no. 559513-8107, and Egenlokal Projektbolag 120 AB, reg. no. 559513-8123, as well as the properties Ludvika Gon√§s 1:178 and Ludvika Gon√§s 1:181 pursuant to the share transfer agreement entered into with Torngrund Group AB, according to the announcement from the Company on 30 October 2025 (</span><span>Logistri enters into agreement with Torngrund Group AB regarding the acquisition of Hitachi Energy Sweden AB's logistics centre in Ludvika), by the Company transferring to Torngrund Group AB the number of warrants whose total subscription price upon exercise correspond to ninety (90) per cent of such purchase price as shall be paid by the Company or by a subsidiary nominated by the Company to Torngrund Group AB upon completion of construction on the properties. Warrants that are not transferred to Torngrund Group AB are intended, following a decision by the Company's board of directors, to be cancelled.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(ii) The subscription price, which has been determined at SEK 16.5 per share as set out below, has been agreed through arm's length negotiations between the Company and Torngrund Group AB, and the board of directors therefore notes that the issue is commercially justified and is being carried out on market terms, and that the issue proposed by the board of directors with subsequent transfer of the warrants is the most advantageous alternative for the Company to complete the acquisition. Shareholders are advised that the determined subscription price of SEK 16.5 per share may deviate from the Company's future valuation at the time of exercise of the warrants, which in the board's assessment is commercially justified and corresponds to market terms in accordance with what is stated above.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(iii) SEK zero (0) shall be paid for each warrant. The basis for the subscription price is the market value of the warrants.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(iv) Subscription for the warrants shall take place within two (2) weeks from the date of the issue resolution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(v) The board of directors has the right to extend the subscription period and the time for payment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(vi) The warrants entail the right to subscribe for class B shares. Subscription for class B shares by virtue of warrants shall be possible on one or more occasions from the time the warrants are registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office until and including 31 December 2028, or until and including such earlier date as may follow from the special terms and conditions, pursuant to item 6 below, at a price of SEK 16.5 per class B share. The share premium shall be transferred to the Company's unrestricted share premium reserve. Payment for the subscribed class B shares shall be made immediately, and the board of directors has the right to, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 14, Section 48 of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551), allow payment to be made by way of set-off.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(vii) The warrants shall otherwise be subject to customary recalculation provisions etc. according to terms and conditions set out in 2025/2028.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(viii) The new shares that may be issued through exercise of warrants shall entitle the holder to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs closest after the date upon which the shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and been entered in the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(ix) The board of directors, the chief executive officer or any person otherwise appointed by the board of directors, shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments and clarifications to the meeting's resolution as may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Existing shareholders who together represent approximately 29 per cent of the shares and 29 per cent of the votes in the Company (taking into account the issue of 16,600,002 new class B shares that the board of directors resolved on 8 October 2025 pursuant to authorization and the issue of 6,733,332 new class B shares that the general meeting resolved on 27 October 2025) have undertaken to vote in favor of the board's proposal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Documents pursuant to Chapter 14, Section 8 of the Swedish Companies Act have been prepared.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Majority requirements</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>For a valid resolution pursuant to the board's proposal under item 7 on the agenda, shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting must approve the resolution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Number of shares and votes</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the time of issuing the notice, there are a total of 96,683,334 shares in the Company, of which 7,335,000 class A shares and 89,348,334 class B shares.
