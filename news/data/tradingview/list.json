Analysts tracked by FactSet were expecting $8.71 billion in revenue, which would translate to about 16% growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That comes after Chief Executive Michael Miebach used Mastercard's earnings release to call out robust spending from both consumers and businesses, which helped the company post 9% growth in gross dollar volume for its third quarter and 10% growth in purchase volume. Those both matched rates seen in the second quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Across different segments of the population, whether it's affluent or mass market, we're seeing good healthy trends,\" Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra added in a conversation with MarketWatch.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Visa Inc. (V) also pointed to consumer \"resilience\" when it delivered its numbers earlier this week. On Visa's earnings call, executives highlighted \"relatively consistent\" growth among different income bands, \"with the highest-spend band continuing to grow the fastest.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read: Visa earnings offer an upbeat read on consumer-spending habits</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That Visa and Mastercard are humming along while cracks show up in some pockets of the economy underscores the high-level nature of these businesses. As Visa pointed out earlier this week, the company is broadly exposed to debit and credit trends; so is Mastercard. That means the companies are relatively insulated from trends like consumers trading down to lower-priced products, as long as customers keep spending in aggregate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consumers \"might make choices as to how they spend, but the size of the wallet that they're spending is what we get to see,\" Mastercard's Mehra said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Don't miss: Fiserv's stock plunges 40% on worst day ever. Outlook reset is deemed 'difficult to comprehend.'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the third quarter, that spending helped drive $8.6 billion in revenue for Mastercard, a hair above the FactSet analyst consensus of $8.54 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $4.38, while analysts had been modeling $4.32.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mastercard benefits from its faster-growth services business that consists of fraud products, research insights and other value-add offerings for financial-services customers. Services revenue was up 25% in the third quarter, outpacing the 17% revenue growth seen for the overall business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Artificial intelligence could be a further tailwind to the services business, and to Mastercard's spending-related revenue. The company offers tools for agentic commerce, through which AI agents can make purchases on behalf of consumers. From a services perspective, there are opportunities to sell merchants and financial partners on tools for authentication, loyalty and other areas that they might want when rolling out AI commerce offerings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, Mehra thinks AI agents could help spur more transactions, which is good for Mastercard since the company generates revenue related to both the dollar value of transactions and the number of transactions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He explained that a consumer who is buying shoes and who also needs socks might buy them both from the same place to save time - but an AI agent might shop around and buy the items from two different places.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"What we will see is that the dollar value of spend might be the same across me buying a shoe and the socks, but you might get two transactions opposed to one,\" Mehra said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read on: American Express sees credit-card spending accelerate</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Emily Bary</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
