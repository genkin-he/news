            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jamie Chisholm</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Concerns about stock market exuberance build as AI tech spending sees shift to debt</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Michael Burry was quoting the famous line from the movie Wargames, presumably about his willingness to participate in the AI-fueled bull market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's getting choppy. The heavy weighting afforded the megacap tech stocks meant the reception given to their third-quarter earnings was very likely to determine the stock market's short-term direction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And so, poorly-received reports from Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) saw the wider market retreat sharply on Thursday, while positivity over Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) results are pushing index futures back up on Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The volatility speaks to investors' sensitivity to any sign of cracks in the bullish AI narrative that is currently delivering stock market exuberance. And we can consider Michael Burry of hedge fund Scion Asset Management in the cautious camp.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a new message on X, Burry - who rose to fame after being featured in the Michael Lewis book \"The Big Short\" and was played by Christian Bale (below) in the movie  - delivered a poetic warning: \"Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play,\" the latter a reference to the nuclear-showdown assessment from the movie Wargames.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Because he is mainly known for his bets against esoteric credit assets ahead of the 2007-08 financial crisis, Burry is wrongly labelled as a perennial bear.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, 13-F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that at the end of last year SAM held only long positions, with his top three bets on China's Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com (JD).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the end of the first quarter of 2025 he had tuned more cautious buying put options - a bet share prices will fall - on the three China tech companies. His biggest position was a put trade on Nvidia (NVDA), which did trend lower for the first four months of this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Burry's next filing for the end of June shows that negative Nvidia position gone - though we don't know exactly when he closed it - which is just as well, because the chipmaker's stock has more than doubled since its April lows.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Instead, the portfolio was replete with bullish bets, including call options - the right to buy a stock - on Alibaba, Meta, ASML (ASML), UnitedHealth (UNH), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and lululemon athletica (LULU). Scion has held shares of Estee Lauder (EL) all year, the only constant.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Burry's next 13-F for his holdings up to the end of September is due in about two weeks. It's still possible that it contains mainly long positions - after all the end of the third quarter was a month ago. But his latest social media message suggests he is nervous about the stock market's rally, and he's now adopting a much more defensive stance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One reason why observers like Burry may be getting more anxious is evidence of a shift in the funding of big tech capex.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Traders have been happy to see hundreds of billions of dollars earmarked for AI-related investment, particularly as most of the money was sourced from company cashflow.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But Meta's recent deal to construct its Hyperion data center site in Richland Parish, Louisiana, included a $30 billion financing package comprising mostly of debt held via a special purpose vehicle. The structure means Meta does not hold the debt on its balance sheet, helping to protect its credit rating.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The concern among some investors is that as companies look for ever more funding to deploy, they may use the Meta deal as a template. Spending cash from the kitty is clean, clear and less dangerous if things go wrong. Financial engineering using what could be called quantum debt, which can be two things at once - not debt according to the rating agencies, but Meta-backed debt according to the buyers - is more opaque and potentially more risky.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Financial Times and Bloomberg report that Meta is also looking at another $25 billion bond sale. Right now there's a prospectus filed at the Securities and Exchange Commission without a specified amount.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The markets</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. stock-index futures (ES00) (YM00) (NQ00) are higher as benchmark Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y nudge up.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>The A-Team is here to save the day. Amazon and Apple that is, rather than the 80s crack commando unit. The two companies put a gloss on Big Tech earnings season as they reversed the narrative about the risks they faced from slow progress in AI and the impact of tariffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon took the starring role, as the market applauded an acceleration in growth in its cloud-computing business to its best rate in three years. That helped put to bed concerns that Microsoft and Google are eating into Amazon Web Services' market share amid the artificial-intelligence race. Amazon also shrugged off tariff costs, noting it hadn't seen significant price increases from sellers on its retail platforms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple was a decent supporting actor, with the main action being an expected double-digit increase in iPhone sales in the holiday quarter. After months of debate over Apple being too slow to integrate AI, the strong start for the iPhone 17 suggests concerns that might have dragged on sales look overblown. A $1.1 billion tariff hit for the quarter also looked more than manageable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Taken together, it's a reminder that sometimes it pays to bet on overlooked stocks. Amazon and Apple were the two worst-performing members of the Magnificent Seven group of companies this year ahead of their earnings reports and trailed far behind a 16% gain for the wider S&amp;P 500. But with worries mounting about the level of capital expenditure required for the AI boom, Apple's relatively modest spending and Amazon's huge revenue from its retail business provide a level of comfort.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With tariff headwinds potentially set to ease amid a U.S.-China trade truce and consumer spending holding up, investors look set to love it as Amazon and Apple's plans come together.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Adam Clark</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>***</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple Is Betting On a Big Holiday Season For iPhone</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple beat fourth-quarter sales expectations and set the bar high for the holiday season, forecasting revenue to rise 10% to 12% as consumers upgrade to the new iPhone 17. CFO Kevan Parekh said they see a \"double-digit\" increase in iPhone sales from a year ago.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>If Apple's prediction comes true, it would be the best revenue quarter   and the best iPhone sales quarter in its history, Parekh said on a call   with analysts. For the just ended period, Apple set a new sales milestone   of over $400 billion for the full fiscal year.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Still despite record sales in India, quarterly iPhone sales and sales in   China both missed projections. Fourth-quarter iPhone sales of $49 billion   were up 5% from the year-ago quarter, but fell short of the $50 billion   expected. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings were $1.85 a share and revenue   was $102.5 billion.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Apple's high-margin services segment, home of its App Stores, AppleCare   support, and iCloud+, remains the all-star of its income statement.   Revenue of $28.8 billion, up 15% from a year ago, and gross margin of   75.3% both surpassed projections and boosted companywide gross margin to   over 47%.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The number of Apple customers still using their iPhones, iPads, and other   devices reached a new all-time high across all product categories and   geographic segments, Parekh said. \"Nearly half\" of Mac users and \"over   half\" of iPad and Watch customers are using new devices. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>What's Next: Tariffs cost Apple $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, and Apple expects that bill to rise to $1.4 billion in the current quarter. CEO Tim Cook said the current quarter figure would have been higher had tariffs on imports from China not been lowered to 10% from 20%.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Adam Levine and Janet H. Cho</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>***</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon Says Web Services Growing Fastest Since 2022</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Like its rivals in the cloud computing business, Amazon reported double digit revenue gains in the third quarter, beating expectations as Amazon Web Services grows at a pace not seen since 2022, according to CEO Andy Jassy. It also has big plans to build out data center capacity.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>For the September quarter, Amazon reported adjusted earnings of $1.95 a   share, including investment gains from AI start-up Anthropic. Overall   revenue was $180.2 billion, up 13%. Revenue for the AWS division was $33   billion, up 20% and above analyst expectations.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Jassy told analysts Amazon has doubled AWS capacity measured by power   from 2022 and is on track to double capacity again by 2027. It expects   capital spending to be $125 billion for the full year, ahead of   expectations, and it expects capex to increase again next year.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>UBS analyst Stephen Ju said AWS's revenue could improve in the fourth   quarter and the first half of next year as Amazon adds more data-center   capacity. But his checks on spending by AWS customers points to a \"less   robust\" picture than for Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Advertising sales revenue rose 24% in the quarter. Consumer spending   remains resilient despite concerns about the labor market. While many   Amazon sellers rely on materials and manufacturing in China, Amazon   hasn't seen \"meaningful\" price increases on its e-commerce platform. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>What's Next: Amazon forecasts fourth-quarter sales to be between $206 billion and $213 billion, with operating profit in a range of $21 billion and $26 billion, to mark the holiday shopping season.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Tae Kim and Liz Moyer</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>***</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix Weighs Up Warner Bros. Bid, Report Says</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix may be about to own the Harry Potter and Batman franchises. The video streamer is weighing up making a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studios business, according to a report.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Netflix is retaining the investment bank Moelis &amp; Co. as a financial   advisor and has been granted access to key financial information, Reuters   reported, citing three people familiar with the matter. Moelis, Netflix,   and Warner Bros. didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from   Barron's.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The deal would give Netflix control over the rival HBO Max streaming   service, as well as intellectual property like DC Comics and Harry   Potter. That would feed the tech giant's flywheel model, a   self-sustaining cycle of growth in which more subscribers means more   money to spend on content, which in turn attracts even more users.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Netflix announced a 10-for-1 stock split late Thursday, which it said   would help reset shares to a range that would make it easier for   employees taking part in an options program to buy in. The stock has   climbed 22% this year, although third-quarter earnings took some of the   shine off a bigger rally, as a continuing dispute with Brazilian tax   authorities led to the company missing Wall Street's profit target. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>What's Next: The news could kick-start a bidding war. Paramount Skydance has already made three offers for Warner Bros. that have all been rejected, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month, citing people familiar with the matter. Its last offer was for $23.50 a share, the people said, which is still way below the $40 a share level that Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav is reportedly aiming for.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>George Glover</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>***</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pfizer and Novo Nordisk Find Themselves In a Bidding War</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pfizer has found itself in a bidding war with Danish rival drugmaker Novo Nordisk over the weight-loss drugmaker Metsera, with just three days left to strike a better deal. Novo Nordisk made the dramatic $6 billion cash bid for Metsera after it already accepted Pfizer's $4.9 billion cash offer.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Metsera's main drug is similar to Novo Nordisk's blockbuster weight-loss   injectable Wegovy, but it is administered monthly rather than weekly.   Pfizer called Novo's bid an attempt by a dominant market leader to   \"suppress competition in violation of law by taking over an emerging   American challenger.\"   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Novo has picked this fight as the Trump administration pressures the   industry to lower drug prices. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has touted his   friendship with President Donald Trump, who wants to cut prices of   branded weight-loss drugs to \"about $150,\" a fraction of Wegovy's current   list price.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Novo's bid could reflect a new level of aggression at the company, or   perhaps desperation, during a tumultuous year that has seen the ouster of   its CEO, the resignation of all its independent board directors, and a   60% drop in its share price since the middle of 2024.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Novo likely was already a bidder for Metsera. Securities filings by the   smaller drugmaker show that it discussed a potential acquisition with   seven companies, including Pfizer, and at least three made offers. The   filings do not name the other companies aside from Pfizer. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>What's Next: Metsera said Novo's offer is better than Pfizer's, and is giving Pfizer four days from Thursday to negotiate a superior offer. Pfizer called Novo's offer \"illusory\" and said it shouldn't trigger a renegotiation of its existing agreement.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Josh Nathan-Kazis and Janet H.
