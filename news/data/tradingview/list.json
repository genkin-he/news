The Transaction adds to an already strong working relationship with key shareholder Hartree Partners LP, an important partner with the US government on their recently announced US$12B critical metals stockpile. Immediate synergies from the Transaction include:</span></p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><span> </span><br/><span>a)  The ability to process zinc concentrates from Blue </span><br/><span>     Moon's Blue Moon Mine in California (the \"Blue Moon </span><br/><span>     Mine\"), where underground development commenced last </span><br/><span>     year, at Teck's Trail Operations, providing the final </span><br/><span>     piece to solidify a fully integrated North American </span><br/><span>     sourced value chain; </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>b)  A path to redevelop the Apex mine in Utah to potentially </span><br/><span>     unlock an important onshore source of Ge and Ga; </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>c)  Possible restart of the permitted Springer tungsten </span><br/><span>     mine in Nevada with the potential to supply a sizable </span><br/><span>     portion of US domestic requirements; and </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>d)  Redevelopment of the larger Springer complex to build </span><br/><span>     critical mineral processing capacity to support the </span><br/><span>     Blue Moon Mine and other mines in the Western US, </span><br/><span>     with logistical connections to Trail as required. </span><br/><span> </span></pre><p class=\"\"><span>Christian Kargl-Simard, CEO of Blue Moon states, \"Underground development at the Blue Moon Mine is advancing well, which together with the acquisition of the Apex Mine and our redevelopment of the Springer metallurgical complex and Springer tungsten mine provides a unique hub and spoke platform for US critical metals growth. Teck and Blue Moon are logical partners, combining Blue Moon's US project pipeline and processing capacity at Teck's Trail Operations.

As a supportive stakeholder, we look forward to working with Blue Moon as they advance their mines and processing complex in California, Utah, and Nevada, as well as to exploring other ways to strengthen North American supply chains together.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Blue Moon Mine, California (Gold, Zinc, Silver, Copper, Lead, Barite)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Blue Moon's advanced-stage 100%-owned Blue Moon zinc-copper-gold-silver project is located in east-central California in Mariposa County, with direct access to roads and power.  Originally mined by Hecla Mining Company from 1943-1945, the mine produced 55,656 tons grading 12.3% zinc, 0.36% copper, 0.48% lead, 3.75 oz/ton silver and 0.062 oz/ton gold. The property was later actively explored and advanced during 1980s and 1990s by Imperial Metals, Boliden and Lac Minerals (now Barrick).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since the new management team and board started in November 2024, Blue Moon has completed a modern review, verification, and analysis of the historical data, and in March 2025 published a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate and a preliminary economic assessment to support a mine restart, demonstrating potential for annual average production of 22,566 oz gold, 62.3M lbs of zinc, 681,784 oz silver and 7.2 Mlbs copper over a +10 year mine life (see press release dated March 3, 2025).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company received permits in April 2025 and began construction of an exploration decline on October 6, 2025.  The decline is progressing well with over 140 meters advanced to date and underground diamond drilling is underway in an effort to upgrade resources to reserves.  Production is forecasted to begin in 2028 and technical work is ongoing to support processing the material at Blue Moon's Springer complex in Nevada to produce copper and zinc concentrates with appreciable gold and silver by-product credits, as well as potentially a lead concentrate and clean pyrite and barite products.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By combining the Blue Moon Mine in California, with processing at the Springer Complex in Nevada and smelting of the zinc concentrate at Teck's Trail Operations in Canada, Blue Moon and Teck are building a fully integrated North American value chain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apex Mine, Utah (Germanium, Gallium, Copper)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apex is a historic underground mine in southwest Utah, which was previously mined for copper oxide, and later for Ge and Ga. This underground mine became the primary producer of gallium and germanium in the United States when Musto Explorations Ltd. brought it into production in the mid 1980's and again with Hecla Mining Company in the 1990's. During its peak year of operations, Apex produced 10,270 tons yielding 1,645 lb Ga, 5,634 lbs of Ge, and 224,800 lbs of Cu.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hecla completed a feasibility study in 1989, reporting a reserve of 230,200 tons of 0.100% Ge, 0.046% Ga and 1.6% Cu.  A historical reserve estimate(1) by Ken Krahulec in 2018 estimated 1 MT @ 0.087% Ge, 0.033% Ga, 1.8% Cu and 41 g/t Ag. The Ge and Ga are 10-100x higher grade than most Ge and Ga deposits, with in-situ value per ton similar to 0.5 oz/T gold ores. Beyond the historical reserves, Hecla also identified several additional breccia bodies as prospective exploration targets, including the Paymaster, Cavern, and 500 North pipes, along with further oxide zones in the immediate mine area.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(1) As at the date of this news release, a qualified person has not completed sufficient work to classify the historical estimates above as current mineral resources or mineral reserves in accordance with NI 43-101 and Blue Moon is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. In order to verify the historical estimates, the Company needs to engage a qualified person to review the historical data, review any work completed on the property since and complete a new technical report. Blue Moon views this historical data as an indicator of the potential size and grade of the mineralized deposits, and this data is relevant to Company's future plans with respect to the property.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Subject to renewed permits and with the intent to reopen the mine, the Company plans to fast track efforts to advance the technical studies, metallurgical testing, process flowsheets, permitting and community engagement to support a final investment decision. In parallel, Blue Moon is evaluating options for a new processing line at the Company's Springer complex to process the Apex material and provide an integrated United States Ge and Ga value chain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Springer Complex, Nevada (Multi-commodity Processing Hub)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Springer property is located on the east flank of the Eugene Mountains, approximately 25 miles southwest of the city of Winnemucca, and 125 miles northeast of the city of Reno, in Pershing County, Nevada. The mine site is approximately 8 miles from Interstate 80, serviced by paved/gravel road, over owned land. The Springer tungsten milling facility is located entirely on private fee lands.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Springer is a former tungsten production facility consisting of a 1,360-ft vertical shaft and underground workings, a 1,200 ton per day mill with automated rod/ball mill grinding and flotation circuits, plus all water rights, and most permits necessary for operation of the facility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Springer tungsten property was the site of continuous underground tungsten mining between 1918 and 1958, much of that time controlled first by the Segerstrom family, and later by the Nevada-Massachusetts Mining Company (\"NMC\"). The General Electric Company (\"GE\") acquired the property in the 1970's, interested in securing long term tungsten supply assets to support its lighting and industrial tools businesses. The current mine and mill were constructed by Utah International Inc. (\"UII\", later became BHP Minerals Group) for GE in the mid 1970's, and was subsequently commissioned and operated by GE for 8 months in 1982. The property has not been actively mined since October 1982, and the underground workings are currently flooded to a depth of approximately 375 feet. EMC Metals Corp. acquired the Springer mine and associated properties from GE in 2006. Between that purchase date and today, considerable refurbishment and renewal has been undertaken to the mill, control systems, hoist house, and an up-rating of the mill throughput from a nominal 950 tpd to a current 1,350 tpd capacity, and an estimated 1,200 tpd throughput after availabilities (89%).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Centrally located with access to diverse mineral sources and existing road and rail infrastructure, the Springer Mine and Mill is well situated to become a regional metallurgical complex. With established tailings and water management systems, the brownfield site provides significant opportunities to reduce capital and permitting timelines compared to a greenfield development.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>WASHINGTON (dpa-AFX) - Block Inc. (formerly Square), the parent company of Cash App and Afterpay, has announced significant layoffs, reducing its workforce by 40% to just under 6,000 employees. The move, led by co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey, is driven by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) rather than financial weakness.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to Dorsey, a 'significantly smaller team, using the tools we're building, can do more and do it better.' CFO Amrita Ahuja echoed this sentiment, stating that the company can 'move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.'</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The job cuts come after Block's headcount grew sharply during the pandemic, from around 3,800 employees in 2019 to over 10,000 before the layoffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dorsey argues that many tech firms, including Block, overexpanded during the COVID-era demand surge and are now recalibrating their operations, explicitly focusing on AI productivity gains. He predicts that most companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes within the next year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors responded positively to the announcement, with Block's shares surging as much as 24%. The move fits into a broader tech-sector pattern, as companies like Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft have all trimmed staff while simultaneously investing heavily in AI infrastructure and tools.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Laid-off Block employees will receive at least 20 weeks of severance (more depending on tenure), equity vesting through the end of May, six months of healthcare, $5,000 in cash, and their corporate devices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dorsey views this as a structural shift, rather than just a cost-cutting cycle. He believes that the adoption of AI tools will enable smaller teams, faster execution, and lower overhead, potentially leading to a permanent workforce compression, particularly in white-collar and tech roles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Copyright(c) 2026 RTTNews.com.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Al Root</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is a great rotation going on in the stock market, from potentially AI-disrupted names to companies that make real things, and you can see it in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So far in 2026, the Dow is leading the way, briefly cracking the 50,000 level. Through midday trading on Friday, the blue-chip index was up about 3% year to date, ahead of the Nasdaq Composite by almost 6 percentage points.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That difference shows investor fears and trading trends. The two best stocks in the Dow this year have been Caterpillar and Honeywell, makers of heavy machinery and aerospace parts, among other things. The two worst stocks are Salesforce and IBM, which are suffering as investors fret that Anthropic's AI tools will render software and services worth much less than they were in a pre-AI world.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the Dow's old-economy tilt isn't driving the index's gains — it still has plenty of technology, including Amazon.com, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The secret of the Dow's success lies in its index construction. It is a price-weighted index, not a market-cap-weighted index like the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq. Higher-priced shares count for more in the Dow. More valuable companies count for more in the other two.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The market value of the Dow companies is down more than $760 billion so far in 2026. If the index were cap-weighted, it would be down almost 4% year to date.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The reality is that tech is much bigger than the 'real' sectors of the economy. When market participants take money out of Microsoft and put it into Caterpillar, Cat stock can't help but soar. Microsoft has lost more than $600 billion in market value. Cat has gained $75 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There is too much money chasing real stocks these days. That is great for holders of Cat, Honeywell, and other manufacturers — along with consumer staples stocks — all of which have soared in 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The extra money flowing into real things has other impacts. Over the past year, Caterpillar's price-to-earnings ratio has soared from about 16 times earnings estimated over the next 12 months, a discount to the market, to 31 times, a big premium to the S&amp;P 500's 22 times multiple.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It is important for investors to be clear-eyed about what is going on. Cat is a high-quality industrial stock. Investors have been encouraged by growth in its power generation business and by the potential for a recovery in some construction markets. There are fundamental reasons for gains. Still, some of the increases come down to too much tech money chasing too few real stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The dynamic will continue until it stops. So, industrial investors should pay attention to things such as the State Street SPDR S&amp;P Software &amp; Services ETF to see if the rotation is running out of steam or reversing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Coming into Friday trading, that ETF was down about 18% year to date. Machinery and software stocks aren't always inversely correlated with one another, but they are for now.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Its investment objective is to reflect the daily changes in the spot price of light, sweet crude oil, plus interest earned on collateral holdings, less expenses.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Investment Strategy:</span></strong><span> USO employs a 'neutral' investment strategy to track changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, allowing investors to gain exposure to the crude oil market in a cost-effective manner. The strategy involves investing in futures contracts and other oil-related investments.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Operational Structure:</span></strong><span> USO is managed by United States Commodity Funds LLC (USCF), which oversees the purchase and sale of USO's shares, evaluates credit risk, and manages investments. USCF is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USCF Investments, Inc., which is part of The Marygold Companies, Inc.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Portfolio Management:</span></strong><span> USO primarily invests in futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels. It supports these investments by holding short-term U.S. obligations, cash, and cash equivalents.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Market Conditions and Adjustments:</span></strong><span> Following market volatility in 2020, USO adjusted its investment parameters and transitioned back to primarily investing in the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract starting September 2023. USO maintains flexibility to invest in other oil futures and related investments based on market conditions and regulatory requirements.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Roll Strategy:</span></strong><span> USO rolls its positions in oil futures contracts over a five-day period each month to avoid contract expiration and delivery of the underlying commodity. This strategy was adjusted from a ten-day roll period to a five-day roll period starting January 2026.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Service Providers:</span></strong><span> USO employs several service providers, including The Bank of New York Mellon for custodial and administrative services, ALPS Distributors as the marketing agent, and multiple futures commission merchants (FCMs) for executing and clearing trades.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Regulatory Compliance:</span></strong><span> USO is subject to accountability levels and position limits set by exchanges like NYMEX and ICE Futures.

This transition was completed between September 2023 and January 2024. USO maintains the ability to invest in Oil Futures Contracts beyond the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract and Other Oil-Related Investments to meet its investment objectives, considering market conditions, regulatory requirements, and risk mitigation measures.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Capital Management:</span></strong><span> USO has not leveraged its assets through borrowings and does not intend to do so. It meets its liquidity needs from the proceeds of the sale of its investments and from Treasuries, cash, and cash equivalents. USO's primary contractual obligations include management fees to USCF, brokerage fees, and other operational expenses. USO has an unlimited number of shares that can be issued in the form of Creation Baskets, and it has been responsible for its expenses since March 23, 2007.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Future Outlook:</span></strong><span> USO plans to continue managing its portfolio to closely track the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.
