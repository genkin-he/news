In a letter to shareholders, Wilson argued that the company's responses to his earlier proposals have been weak and insufficient, and reiterated his slate of three director nominees. He also said he has a strong feeling that additional board members should be replaced, positioning the effort as a push to catalyze what he described as a quantum of change at Lululemon. The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The timing underscores the operational and market pressure already surrounding the business. Shares fell as much as 2.2% in premarket trading following the letter, adding to a roughly 10% decline this year after losing nearly half their value in 2025. Lululemon remains without a permanent chief executive officer and is expected to report its slowest annual sales growth since going public in 2007. Attempts to win back shoppers through brighter colors and more prominent logos have not gained traction, and prior product missteps have added to the scrutiny.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wilson's renewed push comes alongside heightened activist interest. Elliott Investment Management disclosed a stake of more than $1 billion in the company late last year, signaling that shareholder pressure could continue to build. With leadership unsettled, growth moderating and influential investors calling for change, the coming quarters could be pivotal for Lululemon as shareholders assess whether governance shifts might help stabilize performance and restore confidence.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Improvement in AI models influenced Block's decision to cut employees and the cuts will help Block invest in AI engineers and investors, Coad says.

Norwegian is the smallest of the publicly traded traditional cruise operators and its three major brands all have good customer reputations with solid asset bases.

The entire company could also be a target, particularly for MSC, which has long sought additional exposure to the U.S. market, the analysts say.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Nora Knoepflmacher</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Antiaging face serums now go for over $500, and grocery aisles are lined with $15 glass bottles of oat milk. So it's hardly a shock that pearly whites are getting the luxury treatment, too. In the past few years, mouthwash in shapely perfume-like bottles and dental floss in gleaming canisters have hit shelves. \"When patients are already investing in premium skin care, supplements and wellness routines, it feels natural for oral care to follow,\" said Dr. Michael J. Wei, a cosmetic and restorative dentist in Manhattan. This crop of design-forward oral-care brands often features clean formulas and aims to elevate brushing and flossing from a tedious chore to an indulgent ritual.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here, five luxe finds to try — with expert insight into the ingredients behind them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Pricey Toothpaste</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Founded in 2016 by dentist Dr. Gerry Curatola, Revitin specializes in all-natural toothpaste. The $17 toothpaste comes in citrus or mint; some ingredients (like cranberry seed oil) sound like they've been ripped from the menu of an artisanal frozen-yogurt shop. Dr. Vanessa Peterson, an orthodontist in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., appreciates that the toothpaste skips sodium lauryl sulfate, an ingredient that she said \"can contribute to irritation or allergies in some patients.\" She recommends Revitin to patients — and her children use it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Pricier Toothpaste</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>After starting out with clean, natural deodorant, Agent Nateur founder Jena Covello expanded into other hygiene products, including oral care. Packaged in the sort of sleek white tube you'd expect to find squirting premium hand cream, the Los Angeles brand's $28 toothpaste features ingredients such as Manuka honey and coconut oil. Plus: pearl powder, made by grinding real pearls, for gentle brightening. Wei highlighted the paste's \"clean formulation,\" but he cautioned patients with sensitive teeth or enamel erosion against using whitening toothpaste in general. The \"cinna-mint\" flavor reminds us of (say it quietly) a fancier version of Fireball's cinnamon whisky shots.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mouthwash With Bite</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Think of these mouthwash tablets as a TSA-friendly alternative to fluorescent liquid rinses. In flavors including a particularly strong citrus-mint, the tablets are activated by saliva — no water needed. How it works: Chew a tablet to create a foamy mouthwash; swish; spit. It feels a little strange, but it leaves the mouth refreshed. Wei noted the tablets' lack of alcohol — a common ingredient in mouthwash that can dry out the mouth and disrupt the oral microbiome balance, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Eau de Mouthwash</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alas, this gorgeous bottle does not contain French perfume, but mouthwash. Kristoffer Vural founded the Stockholm-based luxury oral hygiene brand after a stroke left him partially paralyzed and hypersensitive to taste and smell. During his rehabilitation, finding existing dental products harsh and synthetic, he set out to \"reimagine oral care as a meaningful self-care ritual.\" Roughly $33, this fresh mouthwash has notes of licorice, lime and peppermint, and contains chamomile extract.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fancy Floss</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Housed in a metallic dispenser embellished with French text, this is the sophisticated Parisian cousin to drugstore dental floss. The work of famously stylish apothecary Officine Universelle Buly, the mint-flavored floss feels sturdy but slips easily between teeth. Most strikingly, it's black. Designed for daily use, it's intended for post-brushing and pre-mouthwash. \"If patients floss more regularly, that is a positive outcome,\" said Wei.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Since 2010 only two nominees for the Fed chief job and other seats on the central bank's Board of Governors have experienced a gap longer than four weeks between the White House announcement and the filing of paperwork to the Senate that kicks off the official confirmation process.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     The reason for the extended wait in Warsh's case is unclear, though Republican Senator Thom Tillis has promised to block any Fed nomination as long as a Department of Justice investigation into Powell regarding his testimony to Congress about central bank building renovations in Washington remains open.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tillis says the probe is frivolous and a form of intimidation by the Trump administration, which has made no secret of its frustration with Powell for not cutting interest rates as quickly or deeply as it would like.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It does strike me as odd that there's been no forward movement on the Warsh nomination,\" said Derek Tang, an analyst with forecasting firm LH Meyer. \"The White House seems no closer to overcoming the Tillis block: that the senator won't let any nominee for the Fed get past the Senate Banking Committee unless and until the Powell probe goes away.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     \"The White House continues to work with the Senate to swiftly confirm Kevin Warsh as our next Federal Reserve chairman,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, adding that Warsh is \"eminently qualified to restore competence and confidence in Fed decision-making.\"  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Fed's insulation from short-term political considerations and the ability to set interest rates without regard to the preferences of a given president is widely considered essential to its ability to keep inflation under control and steer the economy to a healthy footing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the Republican-controlled Senate Banking Committee has agreed to move forward with a confirmation hearing once Warsh is formally nominated. The panel's Republican members, including Tillis, have said they see Warsh as well qualified and a good pick for the job.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But without Tillis' vote to advance Warsh's nomination to consideration by the full Senate, the committee's slim Republican majority does not have the power to override unified Democratic opposition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     Warsh and Fed spokespersons declined to comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>THE POWELL PROBE</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Powell disclosed the DOJ's probe in January, describing it as part of the Trump administration's \"threats and ongoing pressure\" on the Fed to cut rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The central bank has asked a judge to quash the government's subpoenas in the probe, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. The Fed declined to comment on the report.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The probe is not the only hurdle to Trump's long-held goal of installing a rate-cut-friendly Fed chief in place of Powell.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>TICKING CLOCK</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     The 11 weeks until the end of Powell's term on May 15 is less time than it took for most of the Fed's current governors to go from their nominations to Senate confirmation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The timing is by no means overly tight, as the Senate showed last fall when it moved to confirm then-Trump economic adviser Stephen Miran as a Fed governor less than two weeks after the president nominated him.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But a long delay on the Warsh confirmation would leave the nominee - and the central bank - in uncomfortable limbo as the clock ticks toward the central bank's June 16-17 meeting, the earliest expected time for a serious debate on, if not delivery of, a rate cut.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MUSICAL CHAIRS AT THE FED?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump is expected to nominate Warsh to fill a seat currently occupied by Miran, whose term expired on January 31 but who may remain in his role until his successor is confirmed by the Senate. The switch would replace one rate-cut advocate with another, leaving Trump-appointees one seat short of a majority on the seven-member Fed board.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The president has made an unprecedented effort to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook for what he says were misrepresentations on her mortgage applications. Cook, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, denies wrongdoing and is fighting her removal in a case that is before the Supreme Court. Powell attended oral arguments in January, calling it \"the most important ⁠legal case in the Fed's ‍113-year history\" because of its implications for the central bank's independence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>COULD POWELL STAY PUT?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     Powell could, if he chooses, stay on as a Fed governor at least until January 31, 2028. He has declined to say if he will leave the board when his term as head of the central bank ends, as nearly all his predecessors have done.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bucking that precedent would be an extraordinary move that would signal Powell's abiding concern about the Fed's ability to continue to operate independently from the administration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reasons for such concern range from the fact that Trump made support for rate cuts an explicit condition for anyone he nominated to replace Powell, and the unprecedented means by which the president's administration has sought to pressure central bank leaders, including through the DOJ probe.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But staying on would almost certainly draw criticism from the Trump administration and others as a partisan bid to thwart the president's prerogative to name a new Fed governor.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>LEADERSHIP QUESTIONS</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even if Powell did remain as a governor, there's little doubt that the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee would stick with institutional norms and elect Warsh to lead the policy-setting panel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But it would leave Warsh, who already faces the daunting task of convincing a divided committee to support the rate cuts he says he wants - contending with the complications of sharing the policymaking table with the person who used to have his job.</span></p></span></div></div>",

In a statement released Friday, the company said it and TAE are evaluating a framework under which existing shareholders would receive new shares in the spun-off social media business, which would then merge with Texas Ventures Acquisition III Corp., a Nasdaq-listed special purpose acquisition company. The proposal suggests management is actively reassessing how its assets could be organized to potentially unlock different sources of value.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Importantly, TAE Technologies' fusion operations part of a company founded in 1998 along with certain other Trump Media assets, would remain within the parent entity under the contemplated structure. That follows December's announcement of a transaction valued at more than $6 billion, pairing the Truth Social operator with the closely held fusion developer.
