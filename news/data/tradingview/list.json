Net income attributable to common stockholders rose to $60.0 million, representing 13.2% of net sales, compared to 12.2% last year. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales increased to 31.9% from 31.0% in the prior year.

The acquisition of VACCO on July 18, 2025, contributed $24.7 million to the net sales this quarter. The company's backlog as of September 27, 2025, was $1.6 billion, up from $1.0 billion as of June 28, 2025, and $0.9 billion as of September 28, 2024.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>RBC Bearings has been actively managing its debt, resulting in a decrease in interest expense to $13.4 million from $15.6 million in the same period last year. This reduction was partially offset by a $200.0 million draw on the Revolving Credit Facility to fund the VACCO acquisition. The company also reported an increase in SG&amp;A expenses to $77.4 million, up from $69.5 million last year, primarily due to higher operational costs.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Management's Perspective</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>Dr. Michael J.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Tandem Global's Latest Blog Post Delves into the Fascinating World of Parasite Manipulation</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>BETHESDA, MD / ACCESS Newswire / October 31, 2025 / What if I told you zombies are real? And no, not the ones you see on movie screens. I'm talking about nature's zombies, real organisms hijacked and controlled by other living things. This phenomenon, often referred to as parasite manipulation, is found in most ecosystems throughout the world. Parasite manipulation can take shape in many forms, from subtle behavioral changes to dramatic transformations that make the host look and act like something out of a horror film.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In these strange relationships, the \"zombie\" isn't dead, at least not yet, but it's no longer in full control of its own body. Tiny fungi, bacteria, and worms can essentially rewrite the host's brain, forcing it to behave in ways that benefit the parasite rather than the animal itself. A caterpillar might climb to the tip of a plant, paralyzed by a fungus, only to be consumed from within as the fungus spreads its spores. Crickets can be compelled to jump to their grave, where they are then eaten alive by microscopic puppeteers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Parasites often produce chemicals that mimic or interfere with their host's natural hormones and neurotransmitters. The result is a perfectly choreographed takeover. The host becomes a tool, unknowingly carrying out the parasite's reproductive or survival agenda. Unlike fictional zombies, these manipulations are highly specific. Each parasite knows exactly how to influence its host to maximize its own chance of survival, whether that means altering movement or feeding behavior.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But what does this look like in practice? How does a fungus convince an ant to march to its death, or a parasitic worm drive a cricket to take its own life? Scientists still don't fully understand how these parasites control their hosts, but their mysteries open the door to the strange world of nature's real-life zombies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For instance, the fungus Ophiocordyceps, often dubbed the \"zombie-ant fungus\", may appear to be just another harmless organism, but its relationship with ants is nothing short of terrifying. The fungus attaches to the body of an ant, secreting enzymes that dissolve the ant's tough exoskeleton, allowing the fungus to penetrate and begin the infection. Once an ant is infected, the fungus slowly takes over its central nervous system, manipulating it to leave the safety of its colony and aimlessly climb vegetation. Once high enough, the ant clamps down on a leaf or twig in what scientists call a \"death grip,\" where it ultimately dies as the fungus eats through its body, releasing spores to infect the next unlucky ant.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another unsettling example comes from Nematomorph hairworm parasites that live inside grasshoppers and crickets. The worm begins its life in water, hatching as a tiny larva that is ingested by small aquatic organisms like aquatic isopods and amphipods. When a cricket or grasshopper ingests one of these small organisms, the worm enters its body and begins a slow-growing invasion. Over the next few months, the long, thin worm grows inside the insect, preparing for reproduction. When the worm reaches maturity, it releases chemicals that literally rewire the cricket's brain. The cricket suddenly feels an irresistible urge to jump into water. Once the cricket drowns, the hairworm emerges from the cricket's body and enters the water to continue its life cycle, leaving the cricket's body as an empty shell.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The green-banded broodsac flatworm uses an interesting strategy to complete its life cycle. It begins by infecting a snail, its first host, where it eventually moves into the snail's eye stalks. There, the parasite causes the stalks to swell and pulse with bright green and yellow bands that resemble small caterpillars, an appetizing target for birds. The infection also changes the snail's behavior. Instead of hiding in the shade, the snail becomes unusually active and crawls into the open during the day, making itself more visible to predators. When a bird eats the infected snail, the flatworm reaches its final host and reproduces inside the bird's digestive system. In this way, the parasitic flatworm uses the snail as both transportation and bait to attract its intended target.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unlike the green-banded broodsac, the Glyptapanteles take on a more direct approach. This parasitic wasp is found on every continent except Antarctica and takes manipulation to an entirely new level. It lays its eggs inside the caterpillar of the geometrid moth, where the larvae feed on the host from within. When they are ready to pupate, the larvae consume the host from within and emerge to spin cocoons on surrounding vegetation. Remarkably, the caterpillar doesn't immediately die. Instead, it undergoes a dramatic behavioral transformation, standing guard over the newly formed pupae. The caterpillar stops moving and feeding, positioning itself close to the pupae, and when threatened, violently swinging its head to deter potential predators. This self-sacrificial behavior significantly reduces predation on the pupae, increasing their survival rates. However, the caterpillar's fate is sealed; it dies shortly after the wasp larvae emerge as adults, having unwittingly served as a bodyguard.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In observing nature's zombies, we understand the reality of a world where autonomy is fragile. They're reminders that in nature, control is an illusion, and every creature, including us, dances to the rhythm of unseen forces.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Tandem Global</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tandem Global (formerly WHC and WEC), provides the know-how and the network to move business and the environment forward, together.

Meanwhile, she said, she isn't convinced inflation is on a firm track back toward the Fed's 2% target.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That combination suggests the Fed should be more reluctant to cut rates to support the labor market with rate cuts, which weaken the Fed's anti-inflation stance, Logan said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Logan hasn't been a member of the Fed's policy committee this year, under the system that rotates votes annually among the Fed's 12 reserve-bank presidents. But she made it clear that if she had gotten a vote this week, she would have dissented against the Fed's cut.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I would have preferred to hold interest rates steady,\" Logan said, according to a published version of her remarks. She said later in the speech that she is also skeptical that a further cut in December will be the right move.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Fed's decision to cut rates by a quarter point to a range of 3.75% to 4% at a second straight meeting was contentious, with two voters dissenting. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid took the same view as Logan, arguing the Fed should have kept rates still. Fed governor Stephen Miran dissented in the other direction, backing a half-point rate cut.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a press conference after the vote, Chair Jerome Powell said that another cut in December--something that many traders had been counting on--was far from a foregone conclusion. His comments likely reflected a base of skepticism about further cuts among the Fed's policy committee as the group met over two days this week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Logan acknowledged that the labor market has weakened, but said that future policy choices could respond quickly if the situation worsens further. \"These are all risks the FOMC will be able to closely monitor and address promptly if there is evidence they are becoming more likely to materialize,\" she said, referring to the Fed's policy committee by its acronym.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the other hand, she expressed impatience with persistent inflation, noting that prices already rose nearly at the Fed's annual target rate between January and August alone. Inflation is \" still not convincingly headed all the way back to 2 percent,\" she said. She added that the Fed's 2% inflation target is a \"serious commitment.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

So, they do not accurately reflect the MPC's real-world reaction function.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That is a distinction that reflects the BOE's continued reluctance to employ the \"dot plot\" favored by the Federal Reserve, which gives the interest rate forecasts of individual voting members.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, the nine members of the MPC will be given around 200 words each to explain their view of the rate decision and the outlook. Previously, the MPC's debate had been summarized by BOE officials, and the identities of the members making the arguments referred to in the minutes had been kept hidden, although their votes had not.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of Bernanke's key recommendations was that policy makers should be clear when they as individuals don't fully believe in the assumptions that underlie the central forecast.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The MPC's forecasts for growth and inflation are based on the assumption that the interest rate they set changes as investors expect.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But policy makers often have a very different view of how rates should change, and that has led to confusion. In late 2022, for example, the BOE forecast that the U.K. economy would enter a deep recession, but that forecast assumed rates were going to rise more sharply than policymakers intended.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What policymakers were actually doing was signaling that they wouldn't raise the key rate as rapidly as investors expected because such a big move in borrowing costs would tank the economy. However, business and consumer confidence was weakened by the recession call.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The central forecast is not going away, but it will play a less important role in decision making, as Bernanke recommended.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "title": "Aflac Voices - Jamie Lee: Preventing Burnout and a Call to Action for Employers",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jamie Lee, chief culture officer, Aflac Incorporated</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESS Newswire / October 31, 2025 / Originally published on Aflac Newsroom</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As a senior leader in HR, I've spent my career focused on one central truth: Our people are our greatest asset. But today, that asset is under strain. According to the 2025-2026 Aflac WorkForces Report, burnout among American workers has reached a seven-year high, with nearly 3 in 4 employees (72%) reporting moderate to very high stress levels. That's not just a statistic - it's a wake-up call.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Burnout isn't just about long hours or tight deadlines. It's a complex issue driven by heavy workloads, financial stress, caregiving responsibilities and a growing sense of uncertainty. Gen Z, in particular, is feeling the pressure, with 74% reporting burnout, surpassing millennials (66%).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So, what can we do? Here are five actionable strategies I believe every organization should consider to help create environments where people can thrive, not just survive:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>1. Make mental health support visible and intentional.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to the 2025-2026 Aflac WorkForces Report, only 48% of employees believe their employer genuinely cares about their mental health - a drop from 54% in 2024. That perception gap matters. Employees who feel unsupported are more likely to disengage, burn out or leave. We must build mental health into the fabric of our culture by offering flexible schedules, adequate PTO and access to self-care resources. But it doesn't stop there - as HR professionals, we should actively remind and encourage employees to take advantage of these programs. And we should empower the people leaders in our organizations with the information they need to point their team members in the right direction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>2. Communicate benefits clearly and often.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>We are in the middle of open enrollment season, so it's a good time to remind ourselves that benefits are only valuable if employees understand and use them. Yet, according to the report, only 42% of employees feel confident in understanding their health insurance policies, and 69% wish their organizations provided more information about their benefits. Let's rethink how we communicate - using plain language, regular touchpoints and personalized guidance to ensure our teams feel informed and empowered. For example, at my company, we spend the weeks leading up to open enrollment hosting webinars, publishing content and sending internal reminders about the benefits available to employees so that on the first day of open enrollment, they can log in prepared to make any adjustments needed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>3. Address financial fragility head on.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Burnout isn't just emotional - it's also financial. More than 44% of employees say they couldn't afford a $1,000 out-of-pocket medical expense, and 52% report anxiety about health care costs not covered by insurance. This \"medanxiety\" is especially high among Gen Z and underserved communities. Supplemental insurance can help fill these gaps - only 34% of employers offer it, yet 90% of employees say it's needed. Employers can also provide financial wellness programs that include budgeting tools, debt management resources and access to financial advisors to help employees feel more in control of their finances, save for medical expenses and, in turn, significantly reduce stress.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>4. Foster a culture of belonging.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Here's one of the most powerful insights from the report: Employees who feel they belong experience significantly less stress (30% vs. 56%) and lower burnout (55% vs. 78%) than those who don't. Belonging helps boost satisfaction, engagement and retention. It's not about perks - it's about purpose, and it starts at the top. When leaders prioritize celebrating and recognizing their workforce, they send the message that they value their employees, not just the work they do for the organization. Hearing from senior leaders about the importance of creating a culture of belonging - and seeing them live that value day to day - is essential in encouraging the broader employee population to do the same. Of course, no organization is perfect, even those that have strong cultures. Instead of striving for perfection, it's more realistic - and effective - to aim for continuous improvement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>5. Listen, learn and lead with empathy.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Burnout won't be solved by a single policy or program. It requires ongoing dialogue, data-driven decisions and a willingness to adapt. We must listen to our employees, learn from their experiences and lead with empathy. But that responsibility doesn't sit solely on HR's shoulders; we must also equip people leaders with the tools to spot early warning signs - like withdrawal, irritability, decreased productivity - respond with compassion and model vulnerability day to day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Burnout also more than a personal concern - it's a business issue. It affects productivity, retention and, ultimately, the bottom line. If we want to build resilient organizations, we must start by caring for the people who make them run.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Let's commit to creating workplaces where well-being isn't a buzzword - it's a priority.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The 15th annual Aflac WorkForces Report provides insight on the state of the American workplace for both employers and employees. The study captures year-over-year trends, attitudes, needs and experiences in health care and benefits administration in workplaces across our country.

And I'd find it difficult to cut rates again in December unless there is clear evidence that inflation will fall faster than expected or that the labor market will cool more rapidly.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Logan's remarks follow the Fed's decision on Wednesday to lower its policy rate for a second time this year by a quarter of a percentage point to what is now a range of 3.75%-4.00%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the move was aimed at preventing the labor market from slowing further.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another rate cut in December, he said, is not a foregone conclusion, particularly given the lack of official economic data including measures of inflation and unemployment while the federal government shutdown continues. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Logan, who does not have a vote on the Fed's policy-setting committee this year, said that private-sector data, state-level unemployment claims, and the Fed's own network of business and community contacts do give the central bank visibility into the economy, and the picture is far from troubling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Consumer spending has slowed but still exceeds the longer-run trend; stock-market gains are fueling demand from wealthier households; large companies are \"enthusiastically\" putting money into artificial intelligence and data centers; lower-income households and smaller companies are faring less well but still are stable, she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The risks to the labor market do lie mainly to the downside,\" Logan said, adding that she has a close eye on recent layoff announcements, and noting that a sudden drop in the stock market and a longer-than-expected government shutdown could pose risks to spending and economic activity. \"The remaining risks to employment are ones we can monitor closely and respond to if they are becoming more likely to materialize, not ones that currently warrant further preemptive action.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, she said, inflation - though not at an emergency level - is still too high and too slow to return to the Fed's 2% goal. \"Our obligation to the public is to deliver on this commitment,\" she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Logan said she supported the Fed's decision this week to stop shrinking its balance sheet, saying that elevated money market rates show the balance sheet is much closer to its normal size. Indeed, she said, if the recent rise in rates on overnight repurchase agreements for Treasuries proves not to be temporary, the Fed will need to restart asset purchases to keep bank reserves ample.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>She reiterated her view that the Fed should stop targeting the fed funds rate, an outdated target in her view, and should move to targeting a repo rate like the tri-party general collateral rate.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Hence, there is a risk that the Issuer will not be successful in issuing the securities, and that the Issuer will not become profitable, despite this being the Issuer's aim. The Issuer is, however, appointing service providers that have experience in providing services for cryptoasset products. If the Issuer becomes unsuccessful in the issuance of securities, the Issuer may cease its business activities as issuer or ultimately become insolvent and this could lead to a total loss for the securityholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Risks related to a custodian and prime execution agent: The Issuer's ability to meet its obligations with respect to the securities will be dependent upon the performance by each relevant custodian and prime execution agent of its obligations under the relevant custody agreement and prime execution agreement. Consequently, the securityholders are relying on the creditworthiness of the relevant custodian and prime execution agent.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Risks related to the Issuer's reputation and the reputation of its service providers and counterparties: Due to the highly competitive market environment in the Issuer's core business (the issuance of securities linked to cryptoassets), the Issuer depends on its reputation and the reputation of its service providers and counterparties to maintain and grow its core business. Any material adverse event, such as (but not limited to) non-performance, defaults and insolvencies of service providers or counterparties, legal proceedings involving the Issuer or any service provider or counterparty or negative media reports on the Issuer or its service providers or counterparties, could impact the Issuer's reputation, which could depress the Issuer's capacity to attract investment for series of securities. This, in turn, could affect the demand for and liquidity of any series of securities and the price of any series of securities. If this triggers an early redemption event in relation to a series of securities, this may result in the Issuer giving an early redemption notice and all securities in that series becoming subject to an early redemption.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Risks relating to service providers: Cryptoassets are known for their high volatility, unique technical, legal and regulatory challenges, and rapidly evolving market dynamics. The Issuer's service providers' limited experience in this specific field may not fully equip them to navigate these complexities effectively. The past performance of the service providers in other investment vehicles or relating to other assets is no indication of their ability to arrange the issuance of the securities. The unique nature of cryptoassets makes past performance an unreliable indicator of future success in this area. The cryptoasset market is technology-driven and requires a deep understanding of the underlying blockchain technology and security considerations. The service providers' limited experience may not fully encompass the technical expertise required to mitigate risks such as cyber threats, technological failures, or operational errors related to cryptoasset transactions and custody. Should the service providers' experience prove inadequate or unsuitable for arranging a cryptoasset-based investment like the securities, it could result in suboptimal decision-making, increased operational risks, and potential legal or regulatory non-compliance. These factors could adversely affect the Issuer's operations, leading to a potential decrease in the value of the securities and, in turn, to investors losing some or even all of the value of their investment in the securities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Potential impact of changes in law or regulation on the Issuer and the programme: The Issuer's business is issuing series of securities linked to cryptoassets. Although some financial supervisory authorities in Switzerland or across Europe may restrict trading in cryptoassets and/or the categories of market participants which may deal with cryptoassets, the Issuer is not currently required to be licensed, registered or authorised under any securities, commodities, banking or financial services laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. However, there can be no guarantee that legal and regulatory requirements will not change in the future to require this. In addition, the regulatory authorities in one or more other jurisdictions relevant to the Issuer's business may determine that the Issuer is required to be licensed, registered or authorised under the securities, commodities, banking or financial services laws of that jurisdiction. Any such requirement or change could consequently have an adverse impact on the Issuer in terms of increasing the cost of it doing business and/or limiting its ability to continue to operate and may adversely impact the holders of securities by reducing the value of their investment. It may also result in the Issuer (at its discretion) giving notice to redeem the securities early due to a change in law or regulation and therefore the securities becoming subject to an early redemption.</span></p><p class=\"\"></p><p class=\"\"><span>Section C - Key information on the securities</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What are the main features of the securities?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Type, class and ISIN</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The securities (with ISIN: XS2940466316) will be issued as debt securities in registered form and be governed by English law. The securities are represented on issue by a registered global certificate, which will be deposited with a common depository for the relevant clearing system. The series of securities is constituted by the trust deed and secured by the relevant security agreements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Currency, denomination, par value, the number of securities issued and the term of the securities</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The securities are issued in USD without par value. As at the issue date of the above tranche of securities, there will be 63,325,328 securities of the series in issue. The securities have an indefinite term (open ended).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rights attached to the securities</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Legal title to the securities will be held by a nominee (of the common depositary of the International Central Securities Depositaries). Only the nominee will be a securityholder. A purchaser of interests in the securities will not be a registered securityholder, but will hold an indirect beneficial interest in such securities and the rights of such investors, where they are accountholders in an International Central Securities Depositary (\"Participants\"), shall be governed by their agreement with their International Central Securities Depositary or, where they are not Participants, shall be governed by their arrangement with their respective nominee, broker or central securities depositary (as appropriate) which may be a Participant or have an arrangement with a Participant. Interests in the securities represented by the registered global certificate will be transferable in accordance with applicable laws and any rules and procedures issued by the International Central Securities Depositaries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The securities are linked to and are collateralised with bitcoin, a cryptocurrency and worldwide payment system, released as an open-source software in 2009 and the specification of which can be found on https://bitcoin.org/en/ (\"BTC\" or the \"Cryptoasset\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the purposes of categorisation in accordance with the European Structured Investment Products Association (EUSIPA) the securities would qualify as participation securities, in the form of \"Tracker\" securities (category 1300). The performance of the securities would be affected on a one-to-one basis by price movements of the Cryptoasset for that series, if not for fees and costs payable by the Issuer for each series (e.g. the Total Expense Ratio (as defined below)) and by investors (e.g. buy-back and early redemption fees), which will reduce the value of the securities. When such fees and costs are factored in, they will affect the return on the securities so that the return on the securities may not be the same as the investor actually owning and holding the relevant Cryptoasset directly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The value of the securities is dependent on the cryptoasset entitlement (the \"Cryptoasset Entitlement\"). The Cryptoasset Entitlement on the series issue date shall be as specified in the relevant final terms as the \"Initial Cryptoasset Entitlement\". On each subsequent day, the Cryptoasset Entitlement is reduced at a rate equal to the portion of the total expense ratio (\"Total Expense Ratio\" or \"TER\") applicable to such day. The TER is 0.25 per cent. per annum however a partial TER waiver will apply from and including the series issue date, to and including 31 December 2025. During this period, the TER will be 0.15 per cent. per annum.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Authorised participants and non-AP holders may request that the Issuer buys back securities from such authorised participant or non-AP holder in return for either (i) an amount of the relevant cryptoasset or (ii) if at the relevant time the Issuer is accepting cash redemptions by authorised participants and/or non-AP holders for the relevant series, a cash amount in the series currency, in each case, equal to the buy-back settlement amount, provided that the authorised participant or non-AP holder has satisfied certain conditions. The conditions include the return to the Issuer of such securities and, in the case of physical redemptions, payment of any applicable buy-back fee or non-AP buy-back fee (unless the Issuer (or the arranger on its behalf) has waived the buy-back fee or non-AP buy-back fee or agreed that it may be paid following the relevant buy-back) or, in the case of cash redemptions, payment of any applicable residual buy-back fee or residual non-AP buy-back fee (unless the Issuer (or the arranger on its behalf) has waived the residual buy-back fee or residual non-AP buy-back fee or agreed that it may be paid following the relevant buy-back).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Securities purchased by the Issuer will be purchased for the buy-back settlement amount which is:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(i)    for physical redemptions, an amount of the relevant cryptoasset equal to the Cryptoasset Entitlement for such securities subject to the relevant buy-back order as at the relevant buy-back trade date; and</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(ii)   for cash redemptions, an amount equal to the greater of (i) zero and (ii) the product of the cryptoasset sale proceeds per security and the aggregate number of securities subject to cash redemption to be purchased pursuant to the relevant buy-back order, less the relevant buy-back fee or non-AP buy-back fee (as applicable).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In connection with a cash redemption or an early redemption, the Issuer, or the arranger on its behalf, may request that the relevant amount of relevant cryptoasset for a series be sold, in the sole discretion of the Issuer (or the arranger on its behalf), by the prime execution agent, as the Issuer's agent, and/or to one or more cryptoasset trading counterparties. Following receipt by the Issuer (or the relevant agent on the Issuer's behalf) of proceeds of such sale, the administrator will calculate the \"Cryptoasset Sale Proceeds per Security\" as being the proceeds of such sale divided by the relevant number of securities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If an early redemption event occurs and one or more early redemption notices are given, each security of the relevant series will be redeemed at its early redemption amount (being the cryptoasset sale proceeds per security less the early redemption fee) unless the relevant securityholder has elected for principal amount prior the relevant cut-off. The principal amount of the securities is stated in the relevant final terms (an early redemption fee will be deducted). Payment of early redemption amounts and principal amounts will be paid after settlement of prior claims under the priority of payments. Principal amounts are subordinated to early redemption amounts in the priority of payments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If an event of default occurs and the trustee gives an event of default redemption notice, the securities of the relevant series will immediately become due and payable at their early redemption amount (unless such securities are already due and payable before such time).

The performance of the securities may differ significantly from direct holdings of Cryptoassets as a result of the negative effects of fees and charges, including, but not limited to the buy-back fee or early redemption fee upon redemption, in addition to the negative effect of any other risks described herein. The return on the securities may not reflect the return if the investor had actually owned the relevant Cryptoasset and held such investment for a similar period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The trading prices of many cryptoassets have experienced extreme volatility in recent periods and may continue to do so: The price of an applicable Cryptoasset will affect the value of the corresponding series of securities and therefore the price volatility of each series could be significant. The cryptoasset markets may be experiencing a bubble[1] or may experience a bubble in the future. Extreme volatility in the future price of the relevant Cryptoassets, including further declines in the trading prices of bitcoin, are likely to have a material adverse effect on the value of the related securities and such securities could lose all or substantially all of their value. If the securities lose all or substantially all of their value, investors could lose all or substantially all of their investment in the securities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cryptoasset platforms are often unregulated in nature and may be vulnerable to manipulative trading activity, business failure, fraud and security breaches: Cryptoasset platforms may not be subject to, or may not comply with, regulation in a similar manner as other trading platforms, such as national securities exchanges or designated contract markets. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in cryptoasset platforms, including prominent platforms that handle a significant volume of bitcoin trading, which could result in a reduction in the price of bitcoin and therefore the value of the securities, which could in turn lead to investors losing some or even all of their investment in the securities. The bitcoin market globally and in Europe is not subject to regulatory guardrails comparable to those that exist in regulated securities markets. Many bitcoin trading venues also lack certain safeguards put in place by exchanges for more traditional assets to enhance the stability of trading on the exchanges and prevent \"flash crashes\"[2], such as limit-down circuit breakers (where trading may be temporarily halted, for individual securities or market-wide, if the percentage drop in value of a security or index exceeds certain predefined limits). Additionally, certain exchanges may impose daily, weekly, monthly or customer-specific transaction or distribution limits, or suspend trading or withdrawals entirely, making the trading of cryptoassets for fiat currency difficult or impossible at times on those exchanges. As a result, the prices of bitcoin on trading venues may be subject to larger and/or more frequent sudden declines than assets traded on more traditional exchanges. There may also be significant pricing differences between exchanges for the same cryptoasset. Should these circumstances arise, this could adversely impact the price of bitcoin and consequently the value of the securities, and investors could lose some or even all of their investment in the securities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The effect of potential market manipulation, front-running, spoofing, pump-and-dumping, wash-trading, and other fraudulent or manipulative trading practices may give an impression of greater volumes of trading activity than those actually present in crypto markets and/or cause distortions in price, which could adversely affect the value of the securities and cause partial or even total losses to investors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition, over the past several years, some cryptoasset platforms have been closed due to fraud and manipulative activity, business failure or security breaches. In many of these instances, the customers of such cryptoasset platforms were not compensated or made whole for the partial or complete losses of their account balances in such cryptoasset platforms. If a large cryptoasset platform becomes insolvent in the future, the price of bitcoin could be negatively affected, which may reduce the value of the securities which could lead to investors losing some or even all of their investment in the securities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition, if a cryptoasset platform which a series of securities utilises for storage, trading and/or settlement becomes insolvent this may lead to a loss of the Issuer's underlying assets and therefore a loss for the relevant investors. If the securities lose all or substantially all of their value, investors could lose all or substantially all of their investment in the securities. Cryptoasset platforms have also frequently been subject to regulatory enforcement actions. Regulatory enforcement action taken by authorities against cryptoasset platforms could result in the market losing confidence in bitcoin which may lead to the securities losing some or even all of their value and, in turn, lead to investors losing some or even all of their investment in the securities. There have been a number of instances of cryptoasset platforms being hacked or exploited, resulting in users of the relevant platform losing some or all of their assets held on that platform. Losses of cryptoassets due to a hack, theft, insider activity, the manipulation of a transaction signing process to authorise spurious transactions to malicious third parties or other improper behaviour relating to a cryptoasset platform could lead to concerns over the security of cryptoasset platforms, particularly cryptoasset exchanges, and a reduction in confidence in cryptoassets such as bitcoin, which may negatively affect the value of the securities which could lead to investors losing some or even all of their investment in the securities.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cryptoassets may have concentrated ownership: There are some substantial holdings of bitcoin in publicly known digital wallets which have not been involved in transactions on the bitcoin network for a substantial period of time. It is widely believed in the bitcoin market that the owners of such digital wallets have lost access to them and/or to corresponding private keys. Thus, the bitcoin that may be \"locked\" in such digital wallets are effectively excluded from circulation. In the event that holdings of bitcoin considered locked up forever were to enter into circulation, the price of bitcoin might be negatively affected by the increasing supply, which may reduce the value of the securities which could lead to investors losing some or even all of their investment in the securities. Additionally, even if such holdings are not actually sold but there is an indication that the corresponding private keys are not lost (by any means, including but not limited to registering any transaction signed by needed keys, no matter how small and not even necessarily on the bitcoin network), market expectations with regard to total supply of bitcoin could change dramatically. This could negatively affect the price of bitcoin, which may adversely affect the value of the securities and lead to investors losing some or even all of their investment in the securities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Competition from the emergence or growth of other cryptoassets or methods of investing in Bitcoin or hard forks: Bitcoin was the first cryptoasset to gain global adoption and critical mass, and as a result, it has a \"first to market\" advantage over other cryptoassets. Competition from the emergence or growth of alternative cryptoassets and smart contracts platforms, such as Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot or Cardano, could have a negative impact on the demand for, and price of, bitcoin and thereby adversely affect the value of the securities which could lead to investors losing some or even all of their investment in the securities. Hard forks can lead to uncertainties in the period immediately before and after the fork, which can lead to increased price volatility of the relevant cryptoasset. To the extent that a fork leads to the creation of a new cryptoasset, such new cryptoasset may directly compete with bitcoinIn addition, some cryptoasset networks, including the Bitcoin network, may be the target of ill will from users of other cryptoasset networks. For example, Litecoin is the result of a hard fork of bitcoin. Some users of the Bitcoin network may harbour ill will toward the Litecoin network, and vice versa. These could negatively impact the use or adoption of the Bitcoin network, which could result in the price of bitcoin decreasing and may reduce the value of the securities which could lead to investors losing some or even all of their investment in the securities. Investors may invest in bitcoin through means other than the securities, including through direct investments in bitcoin and other potential financial vehicles, possibly including securities backed by or linked to bitcoin similar to the securities, cryptoasset financial vehicles, or bitcoin futures-based products. Market and financial conditions may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles or to invest in bitcoin directly, which could limit the market for, and reduce the liquidity of, the securities. If the risks explained above were to occur and lead to a reduction in the liquidity and value of the securities, investors may lose some or even all of their investment in the securities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Risks relating to the custody and holding of cryptoassets underlying each series and to the provision of services by the custodian and the prime execution agent and to stolen or incorrectly transferred bitcoin being irretrievable: If any relevant Cryptoassets are lost, stolen, damaged or otherwise compromised in circumstances in which the custodian, the prime execution agent, another service provider to the Issuer or any other party is liable to the Issuer for such loss, theft, damage or compromise, the custodian, the prime execution agent or other responsible party may not have sufficient resources to fully compensate the Issuer. There is also some legal uncertainty as to the enforcement of claims in respect of cryptoassets, in particular in those jurisdictions which have no precedent for the tracing of and enforcement of claims relating to cryptoassets. A breach of the Issuer's account at the custodian or the prime execution agent could result in the partial or total loss of the Issuer's assets, which is likely to result in a partial or full loss in the value of the securities. Investors could lose some or even all of their investment in the securities should the risk described above occur.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bitcoin transactions are typically not reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the relevant bitcoin. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the Bitcoin blockchain, an incorrect transfer or theft of bitcoin generally will not be reversible and the Issuer may not be capable of, or successful in, seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft. Although processes and procedures are in place to seek to ensure that the Issuer's transfers of bitcoin will be made only to or from the Issuer's accounts at the custodian and prime execution agent, it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, the Issuer's bitcoin could be transferred from the Issuer's accounts in incorrect amounts or to unauthorised third parties, or to uncontrolled accounts. To the extent that the Issuer is unable to seek or obtain compensation for or correction of such error or theft, such loss could reduce the Cryptoasset Entitlement and adversely affect the value of the securities. Depending on the proportion of bitcoin lost and irrecoverable, and the resulting reduction in the value of the securities, investors may lose some or even all of their investment in the securities</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Issuer call option, early redemption events and events of default: While the securities for each series are undated, the Issuer may at any time elect to redeem all the securities of a series and designate an early redemption trade date for such purposes. In determining whether to issue an Issuer call redemption notice, the Issuer is not required to have regard to the interests of securityholders. In addition to the Issuer call redemption event, the securities of a series may become due and payable in connection with the occurrence of early redemption events and events of default. Due to the limited recourse nature of the securities, in the event that the value of the underlying cryptoassets of the relevant series and other relevant assets and claims of the Issuer relating to that series (including, without limitation, claims relating to the trading balance) is insufficient to pay the early redemption amount, or as the case may be, the principal amount (if elected) to all securityholders following satisfaction of all priority claims, such securityholders may not receive payment of the early redemption amount, or as the case may be, the principal amount (if elected) in full and may receive substantially less and may potentially receive nothing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reductions in Cryptoasset Entitlement: As at the series issue date, the Cryptoasset Entitlement is equal to the initial Cryptoasset Entitlement. Thereafter, the Cryptoasset Entitlement is decreased daily at a rate equal to the portion of the TER applicable to such day. The Cryptoasset Entitlement of each security will decrease over time as a portion of the TER is applied to the Cryptoasset Entitlement each day. There can be no assurance that the performance of the relevant Cryptoasset for a series will exceed the TER ratio. In addition, the TER may be varied by the Issuer at the request of the arranger from time to time with, in the case of an increase, at least 30 calendar days' prior notice given to securityholders. An increase in the TER in respect of a series will reduce the Cryptoasset Entitlement of such series by more than would have been the case had the TER not been increased. Due to the TER, the return on the securities may not reflect the return if the investor had actually owned the relevant Cryptoasset and held such investment for a similar period. To the extent that the performance of the relevant Cryptoasset for a series does not exceed its TER, and investors receive less (net of fees and costs) than the amount they invested, investors may lose some or even all of their investment in the securities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Transaction security granted to secure a series of securities may be unenforceable or enforcement of the transaction security may be delayed: The Issuer has created security interests with respect to the rights and claims arising in connection with the prime execution agreement, the custody agreement, the Issuer's rights, interest and title over the English law governed transaction documents, the series cash account and the sums held by the relevant paying agent in favour of the trustee (for itself and the secured creditors, including the securityholders) as transaction security for the secured obligations (as described more fully in the conditions and the relevant security agreements in respect of a series of securities). For various reasons these security arrangements may not be sufficient to protect the securityholders in the event of the Issuer's, the custodian's, the account bank's, the prime execution agent's or another party's bankruptcy or liquidation. Given the lack of legal certainty of how to take security over cryptoassets, there is a legal risk that the security interest in respect of the relevant cryptoassets is not enforceable given it is a cryptoasset and there could be uncertainties on how to enforce such transaction security. These risks may further evolve as the applicable law in relation to cryptoassets develops. In addition, the enforcement of the transaction security may be delayed or even impossible. Moreover, investors should note that some of the security interests are not governed by English law, but by foreign laws. In particular, security in relation to the custody arrangements will depend on the entity acting as custodian and the relevant security agreement to be entered into in connection with an individual issuance may be governed by the laws of Ireland or, depending on the jurisdiction in which the relevant custodian is located, another jurisdiction. This may make the enforcement of the security interests more costly and time-consuming. Further, the security in respect of Issuer's rights in connection with the prime execution agreement is governed by New York law and the cryptoassets and/or cash held with the prime execution agent are not segregated from assets held for other clients of the prime execution agent. This may make enforcement of such security interest more costly and time-consuming and such security will only entitle the Issuer to a pro rata share of the cryptoassets and/or cash the prime execution agent holds on behalf of customers who hold similar entitlements against the prime execution agent.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Should enforcement of the transaction security be impossible or more costly and time-consuming than expected, this may adversely impact the recovery of the cryptoassets underlying the securities and consequently the amounts available to securityholders which, in turn, may result in investors losing some or even all of their investment in the securities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It should also be noted that the trustee will not be responsible to any of the securityholders for any failure in perfecting or protecting the transaction security unless directly caused by its negligence or wilful misconduct.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There may be no or only a limited active trading market for the securities: Although it is intended that application will be made to the London Stock Exchange for the securities to be admitted to trading on its Main Market, there is no assurance that an active trading secondary market will develop. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the development or liquidity of any trading market for the securities. The securities may trade at a discount to their initial offering price after their initial issuance, depending upon factors including, without limitation, the market for similar securities, general economic and market conditions, the financial condition of the Issuer and the value of the cryptoasset underlying the relevant securities. Should this occur, Securityholders may not be able to sell securities readily or at prices that will enable securityholders to realise their anticipated yield.</span></p><p class=\"\"></p><p class=\"\"><span>Section D - Key information on the offer of the securities to the public and/or the admission to trading on a regulated market</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under which conditions and timetable can I invest in this security?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The conditions and timetable for investing in the securities are set out below. As at the issue date of the above tranche of securities, there will be an aggregate amount of 63,325,328 securities of the series in issue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Purchase of the securities: Only authorised participants may purchase securities directly from the Issuer in the primary market, and these securities can either be subscribed for with units of the cryptoasset (physical subscriptions) or in the case of cash subscriptions (if available), by payment of an amount in the series currency. Investors who are not authorised participants may purchase the securities in the secondary market either (i) from an authorised participant, in compliance with applicable selling restrictions, (ii) via a stock exchange through their broker or (iii) from any person over the counter. Flow Traders B.V., Jane Street Financial Limited and Virtu Financial Ireland Limited have been appointed as initial Authorised Participants.     The offer period will commence not before 17 October 2025 and will be open until the later of (i) the date of expiry of the Prospectus and (ii) the expiry of the validity of a new base prospectus immediately succeeding the Prospectus subject to a shortening of the period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Conditions and technical details of the offer: The offer is not subject to any conditions or time limits other than the time limit resulting from the validity of the Prospectus. No minimum or maximum subscription amounts have been specified, however financial intermediaries (including authorised participants) offering the securities can determine minimum or maximum subscription amounts when offering the securities in their sole and absolute discretion. In the secondary market securities can be purchased by retail investors exclusively with the relevant legal tender.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Method of determination of the issue price and subscription settlement amount: Each series of securities will be issued at an issue price determined by the Issuer which is stated in the relevant final terms. The subscription settlement amount at which authorised participants may subscribe for the securities from the Issuer is equal to the product of the Cryptoasset Entitlement (in kind or (if at the relevant time the Issuer is accepting cash subscriptions) in cash) for the relevant subscription trade date and the aggregate number of securities to be issued pursuant to the relevant subscription order. The Cryptoasset Entitlement will be determined pursuant to the following formula:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CEt = CEt-1 x (1-TERt)1N</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Where:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"CEt\" means the Cryptoasset Entitlement in respect of the relevant day;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"CEt-1\" means the Cryptoasset Entitlement in respect of the immediately preceding day;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"TERt\" means the Total Expense Ratio as at the relevant day in respect of the relevant series, expressed as a decimal; and</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"N\" means 365 (or 366 in a leap year).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As at the series issue date, the Cryptoasset Entitlement was BTC 0.0001 per security.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Expenses: The subscription fee per subscription order chargeable to authorised participants as at the series issue date is USD 1,300. The Issuer has no influence on whether and to what extent the respective authorised participant will charge fees over and above the subscription fee and these fees may vary depending on the authorised participant.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Who is the offeror and/or the person asking for admission to trading?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It has been agreed that, on or after the issue date of the securities, the authorised participants may subscribe for and purchase securities from the Issuer and such securities may subsequently be sold by such authorised participants in the United Kingdom. Any person offering, selling or recommending the securities shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each country or jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers, sells or delivers securities or possesses, distributes or publishes the Prospectus or any other offering material relating to the securities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Why is this prospectus being produced?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The reason for the issue of securities under the programme is primarily to finance the general business development of the Issuer, to invest in cryptoasset to hedge the obligations under the securities and to make profits. Authorised participants may purchase securities directly from the Issuer in the primary market, and these securities can either be subscribed for with units of the cryptoasset (physical subscriptions) or in the case of cash subscriptions (if available), by payment of an amount in the series currency. Assuming that a total of 10,000 securities are issued, the net proceeds for such issuance is 1 bitcoin (based on the Cryptoasset Entitlement as at the series issue date). The offer is not subject to any underwriting agreements on a firm commitment basis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>[1] This is when prices of an asset become unjustifiably inflated with an increased risk of a sudden decline in prices once the bubble ends.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>[2] These are very sudden falls in the price of an asset.</span></p><span>This information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
