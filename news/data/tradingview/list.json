The firm is backing a new Lloyd's of London syndicatedubbed Syndicate 2126launched by Bermuda-based insurer The Fidelis Partnership. The venture is targeting $300 million in gross written premiums by 2026, focusing on property, specialty, and bespoke underwriting.

The two partnered on a $2 billion private credit deal last year, a move that hinted at Blackstone's ambition to blend its asset management scale with Fidelis's underwriting expertise. For Lloyd's, the partnership represents the latest chapter in its push to attract institutional capitalexpanding beyond legacy insurers and individuals in a bid to modernize the 336-year-old market's funding base.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Qasim Abbas, who heads Blackstone's tactical opportunities business internationally, said the firm sees the Lloyd's market as a way to generate potentially strong and uncorrelated returnsan increasingly valuable trait in a world where credit and equity cycles move in sync. The launch could signal a broader trend: alternative asset managers stepping into insurance risk as a long-term play for diversification, steady yield, and exposure to a market that continues to evolve well beyond its traditional boundaries.</span></p></span></div></div>",
