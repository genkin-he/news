It cut its full-year earnings per share guidance to a range of $14-$15 from $13.50-16.50, and lowered its production expectations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The decrease was caused by several factors, including the termination of a large contract to supply BP with solar products, expenses to expand its solar manufacturing in the U.S., and problems at supplier factories that curbed First Solar's production capabilities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All that said, First Solar appears to have strong growth prospects ahead, according to analysts. While President Donald Trump's tax bill cut subsidies for solar installations, his protectionist policies toward Chinese solar panels are helping First Solar.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The tax bill imposed new penalties on companies that use solar goods manufactured elsewhere, increasing the value of domestic manufacturing. First Solar already makes most of its solar modules in the U.S., but is going to bring more of its overseas production here. The company said it plans to build a new factory to do the final assembly on 3.7 gigawatts worth of solar modules at a not-yet-disclosed location. It sold 5.3 gigawatts of modules in the latest quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith wrote that losing the BP order may be a \"blessing in disguise\" for First Solar, because the contract was signed at a lower price-per-watt than First Solar can get if it rebooks the same capacity with a new customer. He increased his price target to $269. Shares now trade around $264.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mizuho analyst Maheep Mandloi agrees, arguing the company is in strong shape to raise prices given the escalating cost to import foreign panels.

Robinhood's robo-advisor, Robinhood Strategies, is gaining traction with customers. The digital advice service has more than 180,000 funded accounts and more than $1 billion in assets under management just over six months after it launched, Chief Investment Officer Stephanie Guild said last week. Robinhood Strategies' portfolios are managed by investment strategists who oversee asset allocation moves and pick individual stocks.

The multitrillion-dollar transfer of wealth from baby boomers to their heirs is under way, and advisors need to grapple with how to work best with Gen Z. The high-net-worth Gen Z demographic now controls 11% of global wealth, according to the latest Capgemini World Wealth Report. Our columnist observes that these 20-somethings have been \"raised on crypto, Coachella, influencer culture, and instant access to nearly everything,\" and now they may shift away from fundamentals-based investing strategies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to advisor.editors@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
