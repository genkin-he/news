Citi expects Baidu's chip unit Kunlunxin to record 13.2 billion yuan in revenue in 2026, accounting for 52% of its AI cloud infrastructure revenue. Its AI-native market revenue could gain 51% in 2026, the analysts estimate. Despite in-line revenue and a profit beat for 4Q, investors are likely disappointed by the absence of a first dividend, the analysts say. Citi maintains a buy call on Baidu given its undemanding valuation and potential gains from the proposed Kunlunxin spinoff. The bank raises Baidu's ADR target price to US$188.00 from $186.00. The ADRs last ended 5.65% lower at $125.15. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

Historical patterns suggest that similar volatility regimes have occasionally preceded upward expansions, yet confirmation would require sustained price acceptance above key resistance and evidence of renewed capital inflows rather than purely speculative repositioning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Ethereum Tests Critical Support After Prolonged Downtrend</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ethereum remains under pressure despite a recent bounce toward the $2,000 area, with the chart showing a clear medium-term downtrend following the rejection near the $4,800 peak. Successive lower highs since late 2025 confirm a persistent bearish structure, while the price continues trading below the 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages. This alignment typically reflects sustained selling dominance rather than a transitional consolidation phase.</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:939.8907103825137px;aspect-ratio:1.5664845173041895\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:889063fbf094b-9aabf1ce500e103dcbe16565487f5dc6-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"ETH testing critical price level | Source: ETHUSDT chart on TradingView\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:889063fbf094b-9aabf1ce500e103dcbe16565487f5dc6-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#1b1e29\"/></picture></div></button></figure><p class=\"\"><span>The recent rebound above $2,000 appears technically modest so far. Volume expanded during the selloff earlier in the year, suggesting strong distribution, while the latest recovery lacks comparable conviction. Unless follow-through demand emerges, this type of bounce often functions as short-term relief rather than a trend reversal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>From a structural perspective, the $1,800–$2,000 zone is becoming a critical support cluster. Repeated tests of this area indicate buyers are defending it, yet each rebound has weakened in amplitude. Persistent pressure near support increases the probability of a breakdown if macro liquidity conditions remain tight.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Conversely, reclaiming the descending moving averages — particularly the 100-day and 200-day — would be necessary to shift sentiment. Until then, Ethereum appears locked in a corrective phase where rallies are vulnerable, and downside risks remain structurally present.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Featured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com </span></p></span></div></div>",
