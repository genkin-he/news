Traders expect two more rate cuts this year, but not until at least June. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>YUAN PAUSES</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The yuan took a breather from a 10-day-long rally, after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) moved on Friday to slow the pace of the rise. It said it would scrap the foreign exchange risk reserves for some forward contracts - seen as a way to encourage dollar buying.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That, alongside a weaker-than-expected yuan midpoint fix, sent the onshore yuan </span><span> down 0.2% to 6.8553 per dollar. It has still gained around 2% so far this year, after appreciating more than 4% in 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It is clear that the PBOC wants the yuan appreciation pace to slow,\" said analysts at Maybank.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They said that its recent gains could reflect the view that China has gained leverage after the U.S. Supreme Court quashed President Donald Trump's tariffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The prospect of a divergence in global interest rates has driven much of the currency market action this month. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Aussie dollar was up 0.12% at $0.7115. It is the best-performing G10 currency this year, with a gain of 6%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Bank of Japan is also set to raise rates, though that has done little to help the yen </span><span> as domestic politics complicate the rate outlook, despite BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda signalling openness to a near-term hike. The Japanese currency has weakened throughout February, allowing the dollar to gain nearly 0.9%. On Friday, it traded at 156.17 yen. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sterling </span><span> was steady at $1.348, and set to snap three straight months of gains with a 1.4% fall in February. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A local election in Manchester on Thursday delivered a landslide victory to Britain's Green Party, in a blow to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour party, whose popularity has slid sharply in the past year. Sterling is fairly sensitive to domestic politics, but with a number of risk events ahead, such as next week's budget update from finance minister Rachel Reeves, any volatility was contained. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Whilst it gives us a lot of interesting information about where Labour sits, it's not sufficient to really put Keir Starmer on a path to the door out,\" City Index's Cincotta said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The euro </span><span> was stable, trading around $1.18, set for a monthly loss of 0.4%.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Elixirr was quoted on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange in 2020 and listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange in July 2025. In addition to strong organic growth, Elixirr has acquired nine boutique firms - Den Creative, Coast Digital, The Retearn Group, iOLAP, Responsum, Insigniam, Hypothesis, TRC Advisory, Kvadrant Consulting - to grow the Group's capabilities, diversify the business, expand into new geographies and access new clients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notification and public disclosure of transactions by persons discharging managerial responsibilities and persons closely associated with them</span></p><div class=\"tableContainer-VG8_37yK\"><table class=\"table-VG8_37yK\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>1. </span></p></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p class=\"\"><span>Details of the person discharging managerial responsibilities / person closely associated</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>a)</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Name</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Simon Retter</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>2. </span></p></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p class=\"\"><span>Reason for the Notification</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>a)</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Position/status</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Non-Executive Director</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>b)</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Initial notification/Amendment</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Initial Notification</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>3. </span></p></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p class=\"\"><span>Details of the issuer, emission allowance market participant, auction platform, auctioneer or auction monitor</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>a)</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Name</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>Elixirr International plc</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>b)</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>LEI</span></p></td><td><p class=\"\"><span>213800MKY7OHMVAKW681</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span>4. </span></p></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p class=\"\"><span>Details of the transaction(s): section to be repeated for (i) each type of instrument;
