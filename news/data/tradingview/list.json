            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Al Root</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The rare earth industry is never dull. After endless reports of government deals, shortages, and capacity additions, investors can get back to some fundamento l data on Thursday afternoon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MP Materials, the largest rare earth producer in the Western Hemisphere, will report fourth-quarter numbers after the close Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wall Street is looking for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, of about $34 million from sales of $68 million. A year ago, MP reported an Ebitda loss of $10.7 million from sales of $61 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ebitda is expected to improve significantly with limited sales growth because MP is shifting from selling intermediate product to higher-value rare earth materials. In the fourth quarter of 2024, it sold 7,802 metric tons of rare earth oxide and 468 metric tons of Neodymium-Praseodymium, or NdPr, alloy. In the third quarter of 2025, it sold no rare earth oxide and 525 metric tons of NdPr.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>NdPr realized pricing in the third quarter was $59 per kilogram, up from $51 in the fourth quarter of 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>NdPr prices are now above $110 per kilogram, according to Canaccord analyst George Gianarikas. That price is key. It's the floor price referenced in the Defense Department's blockbuster July agreement with MP that included a price floor, equity, and offtake agreements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The price rally \"indicates that China's long-standing, administratively managed pricing regime despite strong demand from electrification and robotics, may be starting to ease.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Along with production and pricing, investors will be looking for industry updates from the company, which has emerged as a key domestic supplier of critical minerals. Since the July MP deal, the federal government has continued to invest in critical minerals and sign deals with other countries for mineral access. There have also been threats of Chinese exports restrictions, rare earth shortages, and companies announcing plans to enter the newly hot space.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MP has made news too. Early on Thursday, it announced that Northlake, Texas, would be the location for its next magnet-making facility. The site is less than 10 miles from MP's existing magnet facility in Fort Worth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Fort Worth facility, called Independence, began metal production in 2024 and magnet production in 2025. The Northlake facility will cost about $1.25 billion and is on track for commissioning in 2028. When completed, MP should produce about 10,000 metric tons of rare-earth magnets annually.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A lot is going on, and that volatility has shown up in the stock. MP shares have ranged from $18.64 to $100.25 over the past 12 months. At just under $60 a share in midday trading, MP stock was up about 150% over the past 12 months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MP stock was up 2.2% in midday trading at $59.98 while the S&amp;P 500 was down 0.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Managing human risk is no longer a training initiative, it is a governance mandate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>A Structural Visibility Gap, and a Market Shift</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Cyentia research further finds that 10% of users account for 73% of all risky behavior within their organizations, reinforcing the need for continuous behavioral visibility and targeted intervention rather than broad, one-size-fits-all campaigns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mature Human Risk Management programs deliver significantly greater behavioral visibility and risk prioritization, enabling organizations to identify and reduce exposure among high-risk cohorts before incidents occur.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"These findings validate what enterprise security teams are seeing in real time,\" said Ashley Rose, CEO and Co-Founder of Living Security. \"AI has industrialized social engineering. Without continuous human risk intelligence, organizations are operating reactively. HRM brings measurable governance to the human layer of cybersecurity.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Industry analysts have formally recognized Human Risk Management as a distinct cybersecurity category. In </span><span>The Forrester Wave™: Human Risk Management Solutions, Q3 2024, Living Security was named a Leader, reflecting growing enterprise demand for telemetry-driven behavioral modeling and automated intervention.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>AI Acceleration Expands the Workforce Risk Surface</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>As generative AI becomes embedded in daily workflows, the workforce increasingly includes both human employees and AI agents operating with delegated access. This expands the risk surface beyond phishing clicks to identity misuse, data exposure, and automated systems acting on behalf of users.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Recent 2026 cybersecurity forecasts, including industry predictions from security advisor Matthew Rosenquist, emphasize that organizations must evolve beyond awareness metrics to manage AI-assisted and autonomous risk. Workforce risk measurement and governance are expected to become core components of enterprise security strategy in the coming year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Living Security's AI-native HRM platform correlates behavioral, identity, and threat signals to dynamically score risk and trigger automated, context-aware interventions. In enterprise deployments, organizations have demonstrated measurable reductions in high-risk user concentration and exposure duration within the first 90 days.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adoption momentum is accelerating across highly regulated and innovation-driven sectors, where measurable workforce risk governance is becoming a board-level priority. The shift reflects a broader evolution in enterprise security strategy: moving from measuring participation to measuring exposure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Introducing the HRM Purchasing Toolkit</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>To help organizations operationalize this shift, Living Security developed the Human Risk Management Purchasing Toolkit, a structured framework for CISOs, GRC leaders, and security teams evaluating HRM strategies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The toolkit includes:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Strategic HRM Framework</span></strong><span>, including maturity model and readiness assessment</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Executive Business Case Pack</span></strong><span> with CFO-aligned ROI modeling guidance</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>RFP &amp; Vendor Evaluation Kit</span></strong><span> for structured HRM platform comparison</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>90-Day Deployment Playbook</span></strong><span> for phased rollout and measurable risk reduction</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>GDPR &amp; Works Council Consultation Template (EU)</span></strong><span> for privacy-aligned deployment</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>\"As boards and regulators demand demonstrable workforce risk reduction, HRM is becoming foundational cybersecurity infrastructure,\" Rose added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The HRM Purchasing Toolkit is available at:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>https://www.livingsecurity.com/hrm-purchasing-toolkit</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Living Security</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Living Security is the global leader in Human Risk Management, helping organizations measure and reduce workforce cyber risk through continuous behavioral intelligence and governance-driven security strategy.

It is that DOGE itself should become the trading currency for them. “Make Dogecoin an asset-backed currency in the next 2-3 years by shifting the market for Real World Asset tokenisation to Fractal Engine,” he wrote. “Then once proven, work to migrate RWA tokenization from the sidechain to L1 via protocol upgrades. This would see Dogecoin become the premiere platform for asset tokenisation, denominated in Dogecoin.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stebbing is effectively sketching a path where demand for DOGE would come not only from speculation or meme-cycle reflexivity, but from its use as the medium of exchange for tokenized assets. He framed the opportunity in deliberately broad terms, arguing that tokenization should cover “real assets, Hotels, Businesses, Minerals, Oil &amp; Gas etc.” and adding, “if you want to trade, you do it with Dogecoin.” The proposed rollout is phased: start on a sidechain, prove the model there, then seek eventual migration to L1.</span></p><div class=\"container-n2KCMK3i\" data-qa-id=\"tweet-widget-container\"><blockquote class=\"blockquote-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"header-n2KCMK3i\"><span class=\"profile-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"avatar-n2KCMK3i\"></div><div class=\"name-n2KCMK3i\">Timothy Stebbing</div><div class=\"username-n2KCMK3i\">@tjstebbing</div></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"logo-n2KCMK3i\" role=\"img\"><svg height=\"28\" viewbox=\"0 0 28 28\" width=\"28\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M19.75 5h3.07l-6.7 7.62L24 23h-6.17l-4.84-6.3L7.46 23H4.4l7.17-8.16L4 5h6.33l4.37 5.75L19.75 5Zm-1.24 16h1.7L9.54 7H7.7l10.8 14Z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path></svg></span></div><div class=\"description-n2KCMK3i\"><p class=\"\"><span>The plan I’ve been working toward for the last 12 months: Make Dogecoin an asset-backed currency in the next 2-3 years by shifting the market for Real World Asset tokenisation to Fractal Engine, AKA: the bespoke dogecoin-denominated RWA rules engine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then once proven, work to…</span></p></div><span class=\"date-n2KCMK3i\">Feb 26, 2026</span><span class=\"border-n2KCMK3i\"></span><span class=\"socials-n2KCMK3i\"></span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tjstebbing/status/2026860071553208532\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"></a></blockquote><div></div></div><p class=\"\"><span>The broader backdrop for Stebbing’s pitch is that tokenization is no longer being framed as a crypto niche. In his 2025 chairman’s letter, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink argued that “every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized,” presenting tokenization as a potential redesign of market plumbing rather than a speculative side narrative.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fink said that if markets move in that direction, transactions that now take days could clear in seconds, while capital currently locked up by settlement frictions could be recycled back into the economy more quickly. He also wrote that tokenized funds could one day become as familiar to investors as ETFs, provided digital identity infrastructure catches up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>BlackRock has echoed that view at the firm level. In its 2026 investment-products outlook, it said tokenization is helping “bridge the gap” between traditional finance and DeFi, and that it expects the trend to continue making investing faster, cheaper and more accessible while more assets move on-chain at scale.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That makes Stebbing’s proposal easier to understand in market terms: the bull case is not simply that Dogecoin gains another narrative, but that it tries to attach itself to a theme one of the world’s largest asset managers already treats as a serious part of finance’s next phase.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At press time, DOGE traded at $0.09937.</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:588.28125px;max-width:1200px;aspect-ratio:2.039840637450199\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:b2ae092c4094b-b7340d5e0e9de9e51c426f9cbf7f51f6-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"Dogecoin price chart\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:b2ae092c4094b-b7340d5e0e9de9e51c426f9cbf7f51f6-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#f2f3f5\"/></picture></div></button></figure></span></div></div>",

This unit represents an updated and enhanced version of a previous underground pulling system that PDI originally designed and built in-house.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The pulling unit is mounted on a Peterbilt truck, with PDI engineering and fabricating a custom chassis to support all onboard equipment. The chassis was specifically designed to handle the substantial weight of the pulling system while complying with the Federal Bridge Formula Weights requirements, ensuring both safety and regulatory compliance across a wide range of operating environments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the core of the system is a traction winch and storage reel assembly capable of delivering a constant 50,000 LBS of pulling force over 6,500 feet of 1-1/8-inch wire rope. The traction winch and storage reel are equipped with adjustable pull settings for precise tension control during operation. Offering two-speed operation, the winch system delivers 50,000 LBS at 35 feet per minute in low speed and 25,000 LBS at 70 feet per minute in high speed, allowing operators to effectively balance power and productivity based on job requirements. A free-wheel mode enables easy stripping of wire rope from the drum, and the entire winch system is housed beneath a removable plexiglass bed enclosure to protect the equipment while maintaining accessibility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Powering the unit is a Tier 4 John Deere radiator-cooled diesel engine producing 139 HP at 2,200 RPM, equipped with a hospital-grade silencer to significantly reduce noise pollution. The hydraulic power system incorporates an oil cooler, hydraulic reservoir with return filtration, high-pressure filters, and directional control valves. Fuel and DEF are supplied from the truck's onboard tanks, with the power unit and tanks positioned at the front of the bed to provide ample fore-and-aft clearance for maintenance access.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To ensure stability during demanding pulls, the unit incorporates dual hydraulic outriggers designed to provide exceptional support during high-load operations. Each outrigger operates independently and is capable of supporting the full pulling capacity of the unit, allowing safe and reliable setup on uneven terrain and in confined jobsite conditions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The operator's cab is equipped with an HMI that monitors load, speed, and footage count. The operating system is designed to data-log each pull, providing easily accessible records for analysis and troubleshooting. The unit is also equipped with cellular connectivity, allowing remote monitoring and service support when needed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The primary purpose of the system is to simultaneously pull three high-voltage power conductors through a single underground duct. Designed for versatility, it is capable of performing cable installation work in environments ranging from dense urban settings to remote rural locations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As demonstrated by this project and others, Power Dynamics Innovations LLC specializes in the design and manufacture of custom-engineered equipment solutions for demanding underground utility applications.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Additional photos of the 50,000-lb Underground Cable Pulling Unit are available at www.powerdynamicsllc.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For additional information call (601)-229-0960 or email Sales@PowerDynamicsLLC.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>SOURCE:</span></strong><span> Power Dynamics Innovations, LLC</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire</span></p></span></div></div>",
