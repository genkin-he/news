Yet despite the headline strength — and typically bullish messaging from CEO Jensen Huang — the stock failed to rally, trading flat in the aftermarket before falling more than 5% on Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The muted response appears less about the quality of the result, and more about expectations. With NVIDIA already priced for near—perfection, even a clear beat may not have been enough to satisfy a market increasingly focused on what comes next — particularly around margins, accounting changes, and the sustainability of growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>UBS’s latest research suggests the sell—off may be misplaced.

As the broker puts it, “demand commentary was as bullish as we have probably ever heard from the company with a backlog now building into C2027.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This reinforces the view that AI infrastructure spending is not just robust — it’s accelerating — with hyperscalers and sovereign buyers continuing to commit capital at scale.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite this strength, UBS flags a key disconnect between fundamentals and market reaction. The stock’s muted response appears linked to accounting changes and near—term EPS adjustments, rather than any deterioration in demand. Importantly, UBS believes this won’t last, noting: “it is hard to see how the stock continues to languish” given the expected re—acceleration in year—on—year growth into the second half of 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Beyond the headline numbers, UBS highlights several supporting dynamics reinforcing its constructive view:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Supply build suggests capacity for ~$100 billion of quarterly revenue in coming periods</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Networking growth is accelerating alongside compute demand</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Sovereign AI revenue has surged, reflecting global infrastructure buildout</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Free cash flow generation could drive a step—up in share buybacks</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Rating and price target</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>UBS maintains a Buy rating on NVIDIA with an unchanged price target of $245.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While near—term EPS has been trimmed due to accounting changes, the broker has lifted longer—term earnings forecasts, reflecting stronger data centre assumptions and continued AI—driven demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The key call: fundamentals remain exceptionally strong — and the next leg of upside may depend on growth re—acceleration becoming more visible in reported numbers.</span></p></span></div></div>",
