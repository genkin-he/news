The change in fair value of commodity derivatives is considered in determining Adjusted EBITDA given that the timing of recognizing gains and losses on these derivative contracts differs from the recognition of the related item economically hedged. We believe the exclusion of these items enables investors and other users of our financial information to assess our sequential and year-over-year performance and operating trends on a more comparable basis and is consistent with management's own evaluation of performance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260225159675/en/</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>CONTACT:    Cheniere Partners</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Randy Bhatia, 713-375-5479</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Frances Smith, 713-375-5753</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Media Relations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Randy Bhatia, 713-375-5479</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bernardo Fallas, 713-375-5593</span></p></span></div></div>",

The products included in this order are scheduled to ship within the next six months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We are pleased to receive this production order from our lead AI processor customer that is a manufacturer and supplier of AI processors used in large-scale data center environments for both training and inference workloads as they continue to expand high-volume manufacturing,\" said Gayn Erickson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aehr Test Systems. \"This order further expands their installed base of FOX-XP systems and adds full automation across their production lines, highlighting the growing importance of WLBI to ensure the long-term reliability of today's very high-power, high-current AI processors.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AI processors are increasingly deployed in data centers to support a broad range of applications, including generative AI, large language models, recommendation engines, autonomous systems, and advanced analytics. As power densities, current levels, and device complexity continue to rise, early-life failure screening at the wafer level has become critical to maximizing yield, improving system reliability, and lowering the total cost of ownership for data center operators.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Our FOX-XP systems configured for very-high-power, high-current AI processors began shipping last year and provides the highest power-per-wafer capability available in the market, delivering up to thousands of amperes of current per wafer,\" Erickson added. \"We have also recently completed a significant facility upgrade, adding power, cooling infrastructure, and cleanroom space that substantially increases our production capacity. These investments position us well to support what we believe will be significant increases in demand for both our FOX wafer-level and Sonoma package-level test and burn-in systems and consumables.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Aehr is the first company to successfully demonstrate and ship a WLBI solution for AI processors. In addition to AI processors, Aehr is now in volume production of WLBI solutions for silicon photonics used in data centers, critical components used in read/write heads for data center-focused hard disk drives, silicon carbide and gallium nitride power semiconductors targeted at data center power infrastructure, and is working closely with a major NAND Flash memory supplier for WLBI of their next generation flash memory wafers targeted at the massive build out of data center and AI training and inference infrastructure. New data and forecasts from Synergy Research Group show that the average capacity of hyperscale data centers to be opened over the next four years will be almost double that of current operational hyperscale data centers and there will also be retrofitting of existing data centers to boost their capacity. The overall result is that the total capacity of all operational hyperscale data centers will grow almost threefold by 2030. This is driving massive growth in semiconductors targeted at these data centers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We are excited to grow alongside this customer as they continue to expand their end-customer relationships and increase market share in the rapidly growing AI processor market,\" Erickson concluded.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Aehr Test Systems</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Headquartered in Fremont, California, Aehr Test Systems is a leading provider of test solutions for testing, burning-in, and stabilizing semiconductor devices in wafer level, singulated die, and packaged part form, and has installed thousands of systems worldwide.

As of December 31, 2025, there were investments in four portfolio companies on non-accrual status representing 0.5% of total investments at fair value (or 1.2% of total investments at cost).

As of December 31, 2025, the weighted average yield of our debt and income producing investments decreased to 9.48% from 10.33% as of December 31, 2024, at cost, primarily due to overall tightening of spreads in newly originated investments, the refinancing or repricing of existing portfolio companies, and the decline in base interest rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fourth Quarter</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investment income for the three months ended December 31, 2025 was $50.0 million compared to $57.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net Expenses</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Full Year</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net expenses before excise taxes increased to $114.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2025 from $101.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in management fees and income-based incentive fees. The increase in management fees was primarily attributable to the increase in the management fee base rate from 0.75% to 1.00%, effective March 31, 2025, pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement. Additionally, effective March 31, 2025, the Adviser's waiver of incentive fees on income and on capital gains expired pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2025, income-based incentive fees totaled $11.2 million, of which $2.3 million was waived during the first quarter of 2025 when the fee waiver was in effect. Interest and debt financing expenses decreased primarily due to a lower average interest rate, partially offset by higher average daily borrowings and one-time costs associated with debt facility refinancings completed during the first quarter of 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fourth Quarter</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net expenses before excise taxes increased to $28.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2025 from $26.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net Realized Gain (Loss) and Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded a net realized loss on investments of $(6.0) million, compared to a net realized loss of $(13.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The net realized loss for the year ended December 31, 2025 was primarily driven by the restructuring of an underperforming debt position, partially offset by realized gains from full or partial repayments and sales of investments in portfolio companies. The Company recorded a net change in unrealized loss of $(21.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2025, compared to a net change in unrealized gain of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase in total net change in unrealized loss for the year ended December 31, 2025, compared to the total net change in unrealized gain for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily resulted from decreases in fair value of certain underperforming portfolio companies, partially offset by the reversal of unrealized loss on a debt position that was restructured during the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded a net realized gain on investments of $2.1 million compared to a net realized loss of $(11.7) million for the three months ended December 31, 2024.
