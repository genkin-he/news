The case for keeping interest rates stable was reinforced by Lagarde reiterating her statement that the bank is in \"a good place\" regarding current interest rates, he says. Lagarde noted that risks to the economy have declined due to trade compromises and a ceasefire in the Middle East, though stopped short of describing the overall economic risks as tilted upward. \"We continue to expect the ECB to maintain the deposit rate at 2% at least until the end of next year,\" Kraemer says.

The Plan is intended to provide shareholders with consistent distributions each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value (\"NAV\") of the Fund's common shares, but there can be no assurance that the Plan will be successful in doing so. The Fund is managed with a goal of generating as much of the distribution as possible from net ordinary income and short-term capital gains, that is consistent with the Fund's investment strategy and risk profile. To the extent that sufficient distributable income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution rate. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that was invested in the Fund is paid back to shareholders. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income\". Even though the Fund may realize current year capital gains, such gains may be offset, in whole or in part, by the Fund's capital loss carryovers from prior years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Board may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to the Fund's shareholders. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's common shares. The Plan will be subject to the periodic review by the Board, including a yearly review of the fixed rate to determine if an adjustment should be made.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For further information on Franklin Limited Duration Income Trust, please visit our web site at: www.franklintempleton.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Franklin Resources, Inc. is a global investment management organization with subsidiaries operating as Franklin Templeton and serving clients in over 150 countries.

Annualized eurozone growth was 0.9%, from 0.5% in second quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That was a little better than expectations from a consensus of economists, but still reflects the drag on economic growth from weaker exports to the U.S. after President Trump ramped up tariffs at the start of the second quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are some signs of a revival as the adjustment to higher tariffs on eurozone exports advances. The area's composite purchasing managers' index, which tracks around 5,000 companies in the manufacturing and services sectors, showed activity among private-sector companies strengthened to a 17-month high as the fourth quarter got underway. The European Commission's business and consumer survey showed economic sentiment also rose this month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A revival in Germany drove that pickup, and the country's Ifo Institute survey of business sentiment improved in October. Deutsche Bank on Thursday said it expects Germany's economy to grow by 0.2% in the final three months of the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"For those looking at this from a glass-half-full perspective, the eurozone has remained far from recession despite all the global and domestic turmoil,\" ING economist Bert Colijn said in a note to clients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the half-empty take would be that evidence of sustained growth acceleration on the back of extra investment promises isn't there yet, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Germany's economy has borne the brunt of the higher tariffs, since it relies more heavily than other large eurozone economies on exports and manufacturing. The eurozone's largest economy narrowly avoided a slide into recession in the three months through September, extending a period of weak expansion that dates back to before the Covid-19 pandemic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But with the government now implementing a big increase in spending on defense and a repair of frayed infrastructure, there are hopes of a revival.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>German arms manufacturers such as Rheinmetall have seen share prices soar amid promises over defense spending, and as the U.S. talks down its North Atlantic Treaty Organization commitments despite war continuing in Ukraine. Munich has become a growing military-tech hub, and factories that previously made cars are set to be repurposed as production lines for weapons.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The EU also earlier this year pledged to mobilize as much as 800 billion euros ($928.12 billion) as part of its own rearmament program up to the end of the decade.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet the biggest driver of growth could be German investment in infrastructure--as much as 500 billion euros for creaking railways and green-energy transition programs--which is less subject to being redirected to military imports.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, the eurozone's economy is unlikely to grow strongly without a rise in consumer spending, which has been subdued over recent years. Europeans continue to save more than before the pandemic, reflecting the uncertainty they have faced as Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the U.S. subjected their industries to higher trade barriers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"In Europe, purchasing power has improved, the labor market is strong across multiple countries, inflation has come down, but household sentiment is still not great,\" said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, group chief economist of BNP Paribas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But as time passes and people realize they have more money in their pockets and in their bank accounts, and that they still have a job, spending should accelerate again, she added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The European Central Bank, which left its key rate on hold for a third meeting in a row Thursday, expects its previous series of cuts in borrowing costs will help revive household spending and business investment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I would not complain too much about growth at this point in time,\" its President Christine Lagarde said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The central bank is in a \"good place\", she said, repeating comments from the last few months. Investors are on the fence about whether the ECB will cut again in 2026 to support growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Ed Frankl at edward.frankl@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the issue could create a hazard for other drivers if the part falls onto the road.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tesla notified the government that it will address the problem by adding another attachment or replacing the light bar completely, and it would do this for free for owners. The company claimed that customers will be told and that repairs could be done at Tesla service locations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> Cybertrucks built between November 2023 and October 2025 are affected by the recall. This is when Tesla made its first pickup truck. The car is a big element of Tesla's goal to enter the truck market, but early production has had to make a lot of adjustments as the company works to make the design and assembly process better.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span> The light bar problem isn't a big deal, but it shows how hard it is for Tesla to make new models. This year, the company has already had to recall a lot of products, many of which had to do with the quality of the manufacture or the durability of the parts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors and analysts are keeping an eye on how Tesla deals with these early problems because they see them as a test of the company's capacity to handle development in new areas. The next update on manufacturing and deliveries will give us a better idea of how the Cybertruck rollout is going.</span></p></span></div></div>",
