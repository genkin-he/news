This strategy allows sellers to get feedback and adjust their listing price before going public, Compass says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The practice has been hotly debated within the industry, with some of Compass's competitors arguing that sellers should always advertise their listings as widely as possible to reach more buyers and maximize their sales price. Most homes are listed using local real estate databases that distribute the listings to the major portals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under a new three-year agreement between Compass and Rocket, Compass's \"coming soon\" listings will be shown on Redfin starting immediately. Redfin has about 50 million monthly visitors, according to Rocket.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Those listings won't display days on market or price-cut history, and they will only be available on Compass websites and Redfin until the seller decides to advertise more widely. Redfin will also alert home shoppers when there are other private Compass listings that meet their search criteria, which they can view by contacting Compass.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Compass's agreement with Redfin is a sign that its push to make the exclusive listings more of an industry standard is gaining traction. Redfin for years opposed exclusive listings before being acquired by mortgage lender Rocket in July, but the company said its view on the matter has evolved.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The partnership includes all nine brokerage brands owned by Compass, including Coldwell Banker and Sotheby's International Realty. As part of the partnership, Redfin will direct some buyer leads to Compass agents. Rocket, one of the biggest U.S. mortgage lenders, will offer a discount to buyers who work with a Compass agent and take out a mortgage with Rocket.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's all really focused around increasing inventory, which we know is key to stimulating the housing market,\" said Varun Krishna, Rocket's chief executive, in an interview.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The partnership is also part of Rocket's efforts to offer home buyers one-stop shopping, from searching for a home and securing a mortgage to closing the deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Compass represents brokerage, agents and inventory. Rocket represents mortgage, servicing and traffic,\" Krishna said. \"And we are putting all of those pieces together.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Compass agents will pay Rocket for leads, and Rocket will pay Compass an annual fee to have its mortgage-application process integrated into Compass's technology, according to a person familiar with the arrangement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Redfin isn't paying Compass to display its exclusive listings, this person said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The partnership sets Redfin apart from rival Zillow, which created a policy last year designed to discourage exclusive listings. Compass sued Zillow over this policy in June in a case that is ongoing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Nicole Friedman at nicole.friedman@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. The policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains, net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. A return of capital is not taxable; rather, it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. In addition, distributions from the Fund's investments in real estate investment trusts (REITs) may later be characterized as capital gains and/or a return of capital, depending on the character of the dividends reported to the Fund after year end by REITs held by the Fund. The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the time of each monthly distribution, information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice. However, this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year. Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated.

The latest round of talks over Iran's nuclear program ended Thursday without a deal and both sides remained far apart on key issues. The U.S. increased pressure by presenting tough demands and sending more jets and warships to the region. Continuing tensions in the Middle East and Eastern Europe fuel risk aversion, FXEM's Abdelaziz Albogdady says in an email. This could direct investment flows toward the precious metal, he adds.

The battle for Warner is significant for the futures of both Paramount and Netflix, coming as the entertainment industry struggles to adapt to seismic shifts in technology and viewing habits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both Netflix and Paramount see Warner's library — which includes Harry Potter, Batman and hit TV shows such as \"Friends\" and \"The Sopranos\" — as a valuable asset that could boost their respective streaming services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount on Tuesday submitted a revised bid of $31 a share for all of Warner Discovery, including cable networks such as CNN and Food Network, for an $81 billion deal . Netflix in December reached a deal to buy Warner's studios and HBO Max for $27.75 a share, or $72 billion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As part of its revised bid, Paramount agreed to exclude the Warner cable networks from the proposed agreement's \"material adverse effect\" clause, meaning the deal's price tag won't shrink if the linear TV networks business declines in value before the close.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Additionally, Paramount accelerated the timing of its proposed \"ticking fee\" of 25 cents, which it would pay to Warner shareholders for each quarter its deal hasn't closed, to start after Sept. 30 instead of in January.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The offer also includes an increased $7 billion termination fee that Paramount would pay if the transaction failed to close due to regulatory concerns. Paramount would additionally be on the hook for the $2.8 billion breakup fee Warner would owe Netflix should that deal fall apart.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount's latest bid came after Warner's board of directors set a seven-day window for the companies to negotiate, which Netflix permitted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount has long said its all-cash bid was superior because it wanted the entire company, unlike Netflix, and it believed it had a cleaner path to regulatory approval.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos is in Washington, D.C., Thursday meeting with Justice Department and White House officials to make the case for the deal, a person familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paramount, led by David Ellison, went directly to shareholders with a tender offer in December, after being rebuffed by Warner multiple times. The suitor gradually sweetened its offer — backed by Ellison's billionaire father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison; private-equity firm RedBird Capital; and a group of sovereign-wealth funds — until Warner agreed to reopen negotiations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Joe Flint at Joe.Flint@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
