            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By David Wessel</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About the author: David Wessel is the director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal &amp; Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution, which he joined in 2014 after 30 years as a reporter, editor, and columnist at The Wall Street Journal. He is the author of the 2009 best seller In Fed We Trust: Ben Bernanke's War on the Great Panic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One thing I learned as a Wall Street Journal reporter covering Alan Greenspan's 18-year reign of the Federal Reserve: Don't ask the man a question when you're in a buffet line with coffee in one hand, a plate in the other, and a reporter's notebook in your back pocket. The chairman didn't give short answers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Greenspan, who turns 100 on March 6, often peppered his responses and his speeches with idiosyncratic insights when he didn't want to talk about interest rates. For example, he once observed that gross domestic product was getting lighter. Fiber optic cables were lighter than copper, more of the value in GDP was in ideas not physical goods, et cetera.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the breakfast line at the Fed's annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, I asked if he could really measure the weight of GDP. He told me, at great length, about a recent Commerce Department report that tallied the weight of all imports and exports. That led me to write: \"Having weighed the evidence carefully, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan wants you to know that the U.S. economy is getting lighter. Literally.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Greenspan had other unconventional ways of monitoring the economy. I doubt any of his successors obsessed as he did about freight-car loading statistics. Another key to his acumen was his grasp of history. He was influenced by a Stanford economic historian named Paul David, who showed why it took so long for electricity to yield gains in productivity in the early 20th century. That insight led Greenspan to resist pressure from fellow policymakers to raise interest rates in 1996: He understood that rising productivity from the information technology revolution would allow the economy to grow faster without fueling inflation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When President Ronald Reagan nominated Greenspan to head the Fed in 1987, skeptics suggested the economic consultant-turned-White House aide wouldn't be able to fill the shoes of his predecessor, Paul Volcker. Volcker famously managed to break the back of high inflation with double-digit interest rates in the early 1980s.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But by the time Greenspan retired in 2006, he was hailed the Fed \"maestro\" — an effective leader who had steered the economy through 9/11, two mild recessions, and a couple of stock-market bubble bursts. Through all of that, he gently brought inflation down and ushered in the Great Moderation. His major mistake — failing to understand how vulnerable the financial system was to a housing downturn — became apparent only after he had turned the keys over to Ben Bernanke.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under-regulating banks before the 2008-09 global financial crisis was just one of Greenspan's mistakes as chair. His blessing President George W. Bush's tax cuts was another. But his reign also had highs: responding effectively to the 1987 stock market crash, encouraging President Bill Clinton to tackle the federal government's deficit, and spotting a productivity surge in the 1990s before others.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For a reporter on the Fed beat, Greenspan was a treasure. He understood the role of the press in communicating the Fed's thinking and in burnishing his reputation. He genuinely liked reporters; he did marry NBC news anchor Andrea Mitchell in 1997, after all. He would take our calls or sit down with us, almost always off the record. Once, to be sure that I got a story right, I shared an excerpt of my book manuscript with Greenspan. He blessed it — and corrected my grammar. Data \"are\", not data \"is\".</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unusually, Greenspan refused to talk in the late 1990s when I wanted to ask if he was starting to worry about the ebullience of the stock market, which was riding high on newly public tech companies. I went ahead and wrote a column on the idea anyway. \"If you were Alan Greenspan,\" I wrote in the lede, \"wouldn't you be worried about the soaring stock market?\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A couple of weeks after the column ran, Greenspan made his famous \"irrational exuberance\" speech, warning investors against getting too excited about tech stocks. That phrase that echoes today as AI drives up stock prices of tech companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Greenspan taught me the value of owning up to my mistakes. Before 1994, the Fed didn't disclose when it had moved interest rates. Instead, it signaled a move by the way it intervened in the Treasury market. The day before Thanksgiving in 1989, the Fed made a move that looked to me like it had eased. I spoke to a source who, in the past, had been informed about Fed moves. He agreed with me but didn't disclose that Greenspan had stopped informing him. I wrote in Friday's print paper that the Fed had eased. On Monday, the Fed came into the market with monetary howitzers to make clear it hadn't. Not a good day for this reporter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I wrote Greenspan that I had made his difficult job harder and apologized. A few days later, my phone rang. His assistant said to \"hold for the chairman.\" I braced myself for a tongue-lashing. Instead, in his gravelly voice, Greenspan said, \"This is the first time in history that a reporter has ever apologized to the Federal Reserve.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's newsroom.

The spinoff aims to separate Trump Media's social-media business from its bet on commercial nuclear fusion, as the company looks to capitalize on the artificial-intelligence boom's insatiable appetite for power.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Emese Bartha</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Japanese policymakers will need to strike a delicate balance as they seek to stabilize the yen and keep debt services costs on Japan's significant debt manageable, Eva Sun-Wai, fund manager at M&amp;G Investments said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Japan's government plans aggressive fiscal stimulus to protect the country's fragile domestic growth. At the same time, the central bank will likely need to raise interest rates to fight persistent inflation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They will need to do this without increasing the national debt, which is estimated between 235% and 250% of GDP.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Japan has always had quite a difficult combination of needing to keep interest rates low so that they don't massively increase their debt servicing costs but not keeping rates so low that the currency deteriorates meaningfully,\" she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This balancing act was recently tested when long-dated Japanese government bond yields surged to record highs ahead of the Lower House election on Feb. 8 due to investor concerns over potentially unsustainable fiscal stimulus.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yields have since retreated. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's landslide victory ensured political stability. It reinforced her mandate to pursue expansive fiscal policies, but Takaichi has repeatedly stressed that her government will act fiscally responsibly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Japanese yen has also recovered after falling to an 18-month low of 159.45 yen per U.S. dollar in mid-January, LSEG data show. The dollar last traded at 155.96 yen.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of the main risks Sun-Wai sees is of potential for large-scale repatriation of offshore assets--including U.S. Treasurys--back into Japanese government bonds as the Bank of Japan increases interest rates from their current low level of 0.75% and yields rise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Such a move could be disruptive, potentially causing big selling in U.S. Treasurys, especially as the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates further, she says. However, she considers this a low risk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I don't see the repatriation flow argument as rapid a risk as people say,\" she said. \"I still see it a risk, but I don't think it would happen quickly.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A weak yen and negative real yields are among the factors that would discourage rapid asset repatriation, she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Most Japanese investors are structural, long‑term holders of offshore government bonds for liability-management reasons. These positions aren't leveraged, so there is no risk of rapid margin-call dynamics, she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>External factors which could prompt big selling in U.S. Treasurys and the dollar do pose a risk, however.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These could include the Fed cutting rates more aggressively than expected by markets, U.S. policy uncertainty and Fed independence risks. Still, Fed independence concerns have receded with former Fed governor Kevin Warsh's nomination to Fed Chair, she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Given entrenched inflation in Japan, the BOJ \"will likely need to embark on some sort of rate hike cycle, even if it's very slow and steady,\" she said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Even if it means that it's just to give them room in the next downturn so that they can cut [rates] and stimulate the economy.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>BOJ rate hikes will likely result in a 'bear flattening' of the Japanese bond yield curve, Sun-Wai said. This is where short-term rates rise faster than long-term rates, usually due to expectations of central bank interest-rate hikes. U.S. Treasurys show the opposite trend, with the yield curve steepening.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Japan is now shifting from a trend over the last few decades, when it favoured bolster economic growth via a weaker yen which in turn bolstered exports, Sun-Wai said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>M&amp;G Investments had 365 billion pounds ($491.63 billion) in assets under management as at Sept. 30, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Emese Bartha at emese.bartha@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
