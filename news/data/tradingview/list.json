Disappointment that the company still isn't allowed to resume sales in China could be overshadowing huge spending on artificial-intelligence by major technology companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nvidia shares were down 0.8% at $205.45 in premarket trading. That would put only a small dent in 14% gains over the past five trading days as the chip maker has been buoyed by AI optimism.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors were hoping that President Donald Trump might give the stock another boost by announcing that Nvidia and other U.S. chip makers would be able to resume selling hardware to China after his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. However, Trump told reporters after the meeting that Nvidia's Blackwell chips weren't specifically discussed, according to multiple reports.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nvidia has been targeted by Chinese authorities, who have discouraged the use of its AI processors by domestic customers. Nvidia is currently forecasting  no Chinese revenue for its current quarter, which implies a loss of between $2 billion and $5 billion in potential sales, according to the company's executives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, signs of U.S. spending are strong. Each of Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Google-parent Alphabet said in earnings reports on Wednesday that they will raise their capital expenditure, largely due to investment in AI data centers. That bodes well for future spending on semiconductors from Nvidia and its rivals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices was down 0.8% and Broadcom was rising 0.3% in premarket trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Readers should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements and are encouraged to review the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company's other filings with the SEC for a more complete discussion of risks and other factors that could affect any forward-looking statement. The statements made herein speak only as of the date of this press release and except as required by law, the Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures. A \"non-GAAP financial measure\" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the Company. The non-GAAP financial measures used within this press release are EAD, CAD, EAD and CAD per diluted common share and adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>EAD is defined as net income (loss) attributable to our common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, including realized gains and losses not otherwise included in net income (loss), excluding any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income (loss) for the applicable reporting period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income (loss), or in net income (loss) and adding back amortization of stock-based compensation. The Company also adjusts EAD to remove the income/(losses) from equity method investments as they represent changes in the equity value of our investment rather than distributable earnings. The Company will include income from equity method investments to the extent that we receive cash distributions and upon realizing gains and/or losses. Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders may also be adjusted for the effects of certain GAAP adjustments and transactions that may not be indicative of our current operations. In addition, EAD in this press release includes the dilutive effect of non-controlling interests. We use EAD to evaluate our performance and to assess our long-term ability to pay distributions. We believe providing EAD as a supplement to GAAP net income (loss) to our investors is helpful to their assessment of our performance and our long-term ability to pay distributions. We also use EAD as a component of the management fee paid to our external manager. EAD does not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operating activities, a measure of our liquidity or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. Our computation of EAD may not be comparable to EAD reported by other REITs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We calculate CAD by adjusting EAD by adding back amortization of premiums, depreciation and amortization of real estate investment and amortization of deferred financing costs and by removing accretion of discounts. We use CAD to evaluate our performance and our current ability to pay distributions. We also believe that providing CAD as a supplement to GAAP net income (loss) to our investors is helpful to their assessment of our performance and our current ability to pay distributions. CAD does not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operating activities, a measure of our liquidity or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. Our computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other REITs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>EAD per diluted common share and CAD per diluted common share are based on adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding — diluted. Adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted is calculating by subtracting the dilutive effect of potential redemptions of Series B Preferred shares for shares of our common stock from weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted. We believe providing adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted to our investors is helpful in their assessment of our performance without the potential dilutive effective of the Series B Preferred shares. We have the right to redeem the Series B Preferred shares for cash or shares of our common stock. Additionally, Series B Preferred redemptions are capped at 2% of the outstanding Series B Preferred shares per month, 5% per quarter and 20% per year. The Company maintains sufficient liquidity to pay cash to cover any redemptions up to the quarterly redemption cap. Further, it is the Company's intent to not settle Series B Preferred redemptions in shares of common stock when the Company's common stock price is below book value.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding — diluted should not be considered as an alternative to the GAAP measure. Our computation of adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding — diluted may not be comparable to adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted reported by other companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Contact:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kristen Griffith</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investor Relations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>IR@nexpoint.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Media: Comms@nexpoint.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nref-announces-third-quarter-2025-results-provides-fourth-quarter-2025-guidance-302599405.html</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SOURCE NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc.</span></p></span></div></div>",
