            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Sterling could fall in coming months given the U.K. political risks facing the currency, Rabobank's Jane Foley says in a note. With expectations for further Bank of England interest-rate cuts well priced, sterling could be more vulnerable to political surprises, she says. Thursday's one-off local district election in Gorton and Denton could reignite fears of a leadership challenge for Prime Minister Keir Starmer if his Labour Party loses the seat, she says. A poor showing for Labour in wider local elections in May would add to such concerns. The \"related political uncertainty is likely to worry sterling investors,\" she says. Sterling falls 0.1% to $1.3540. The euro rises 0.1% to 0.8717 pounds. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

While the market welcomes flash sales, today's notice isn't the one many traders were hoping to see. A sale of soybeans to China was rumored among market participants, which gave soybeans support this week. Most-active soybean futures are up 0.5%, while corn rises 0.5% and wheat inches up 0.2%.
