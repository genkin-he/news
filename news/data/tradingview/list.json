The Green Party won the Gorton and Denton election, with Labour coming in third place behind Reform. At the 2024 general election, Labour comfortably took the seat but its popularity has since fallen. The news raises doubts about Starmer's future ahead of wider U.K. local elections in May. Alongside political uncertainty, there are concerns that Starmer could be replaced by a leader that favors more fiscal spending, worsening the public finances. The euro rises to a high of 0.8764 pounds, LSEG data show. Sterling falls 0.1% to $1.3461. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
