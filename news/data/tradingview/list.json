Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people,\" President Donald Trump said in a video message published on his Truth Social account early Saturday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cryptocurrencies, which trade 24/7, offered the first glimpse of how investors might react, as they wait for Asian markets to open on Sunday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) slid 3.1% to $63,561, a level not seen since early February.

The damage done by U.S.-Israeli strikes, and the targets of those strikes, is not yet clear; nor is the impact of any Iranian retaliatory action,\" said Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, in a note to clients. \"In addition, the precise scope of the action, nor mission aims, are obvious at this stage.

Also likely to get bid are haven assets, such as gold (GC00), which jumped nearly 11% in February, finishing at $5,230.50 an ounce on Friday.

That waterway connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In his social-media post, Trump did not indicate how long the strikes would last. The Associated Press reported a daylight Saturday attack on Tehran, with initial blasts hitting near the offices of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He said after the U.S. launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites last June, Iran was warned never to resume its pursuit of nuclear weapons and the U.S. \"sought repeatedly to make a deal.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"They rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions and we can't take it anymore. Instead they attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and continue developing long-range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe and could soon reach the American homeland,\" Trump said in his address.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It has always been the policy of the United States, in particular, my administration, that this terrorist regime can never have a nuclear weapon,\" he said, recounting \"an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder\" against the U.S. over 47 years, as well as attacks on Israel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We're going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Debbie Carlson</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you are planning on spring cleaning soon, put trust reviews on your to-do list.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With generous federal estate-tax exemptions made permanent in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year, trusts that were created years ago to shield wealth from onerous federal estate taxes may be obsolete.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the new tax policy individuals can exempt $15 million in assets from federal estate taxes, $30 million for couples, and those amounts will adjust for inflation annually. Estates still face a 40% federal tax rate for any money above those thresholds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Spurred by the certainty around the federal estate-tax levels, estate planners and financial advisors are scrutinizing older trusts. Here's what to know if you have one:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As recently as 2009, the federal estate-tax exemption was $3.5 million for an individual, with the estate tax rate at 45% for anything above that exemption, according to the Tax Foundation. The estate-tax exemption was also a \"use it or lose it\" system, so couples had to create trusts to maximize each person's exemption or the surviving spouse's estate would face higher taxes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Changes in tax policy in intervening years allowed widows and widowers to access their spouses' unused exemptions and now the more generous exemptions make it worth revisiting these trusts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A lot of those old trusts, notably A/B trusts, have rigid language limiting how widows and widowers can control family money after their spouse died. When a husband and wife use an A/B trust and the wife dies, the trust is split into two parts. Her half goes into an irrevocable trust to support the husband during his lifetime, and whatever is left later goes to the other named beneficiaries, such as their children.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These trusts are outdated, says Patrick Simasko, elder law attorney and financial advisor in Michigan. Having part of the couple's money tied up in an irrevocable trust means it is difficult for the widow or widower to make future changes, such as removing a child as a beneficiary.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There's so many rules and regulations that this trust agreement may be binding your hands to in the future,\" he says. \"At the time the trade-off was worth it...today the tax justification for creating these types of trusts no longer exists.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are a few options you can take if you have an old, rigid trust, Simasko says. If both you and your spouse are alive you can cancel it. You will need to retitle assets, whether to put them in a new trust or to get rid of it completely.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you are a widow or a widower stuck in one of these old trusts, your options are limited to what the trust allows. So read it carefully. Some trusts may allow you to move assets to a new one with fewer restrictions. If beneficiaries agree, you can ask probate court to alter or terminate the trust.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Review if you can withdraw more money from the trust than what you are currently taking. Emily Boothroyd, wealth manager at Merit Financial Advisors, says doing so can save significant money as trusts are expensive and tax-inefficient.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are costs to create the document and annual costs to maintain them. The annual taxes that most irrevocable non-grantor trusts pay can get steep quickly. It only takes $16,000 in taxable annual income for a trust to hit the highest 37% tax bracket; individuals don't hit that level until their income surpasses $640,600.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Taking assets out of trusts also can minimize capital-gains taxes for beneficiaries. When trusts distribute assets to beneficiaries, those assets are valued at the original purchase price, not the fair market value on the date the trust makes its distribution. If the trust sells the asset and sends the proceeds to beneficiaries, it passes along the capital-gains tax bill, which inheritors must pay that year. If it distributes the asset, beneficiaries can wait to sell it, deferring any tax bills.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Either way, given the rise in asset value, from real estate to stocks in the past 20 years, beneficiaries could be on the hook for big capital-gains taxes. If those same assets were in your estate, your beneficiaries will receive a step-up in basis on any assets they inherit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Boothroyd made this move for an elderly client of hers, who was beneficiary of an old irrevocable trust. The trust allowed her client to make larger withdrawals, and she moved assets into her estate because she is in a lower tax bracket than the trust.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>She pays less in income taxes on the assets than the trust would, and she plans to keep the assets in her estate, so her beneficiaries will receive a step-up in basis at her death. The move saves \"her heirs a significant amount in capital-gains tax now that they are not concerned about estate-tax exemption levels,\" Boothroyd says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financial pros say reviewing newer trusts to save money on income and capital-gains taxes are a smart move as well.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mark Weiskind, senior wealth manager at Fairway Wealth Management, says if the trust allows it, send money to beneficiaries now if they are in lower tax brackets and let them pay the income tax, rather than the trust. Sometimes trusts may also send a little extra money to cover the beneficiaries' income taxes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Check the value of the assets in the trust. Weiskind says some trusts allow you to swap assets in an in-kind distribution without triggering taxes. He says trusts should own assets that don't produce much current income but have higher growth potential, such as index funds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He says a client of his funded a trust 20 years ago with Apple stock that had grown to $1 million. Because the client isn't worried about hitting the estate-tax exemption ceiling, he used an in-kind distribution, bringing the Apple stock back to his estate and put in $1 million of another asset. His heirs will get step-up in basis of that Apple stock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Now that the estate tax isn't an issue, they put little bit more of a premium on the step-up in basis,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to editors@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Through UTA Loan, users can borrow assets via Auto Borrow, triggered automatically by trading activity, or Manual Borrow, initiated in advance. With the introduction of fixed-rate borrowing, users can now choose between floating-rate flexibility and fixed-rate cost certainty, while maintaining access to up to 10x leverage for eligible trading activities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The new fixed-rate option represents a significant expansion of UTA Loan, which previously focused on floating-rate borrowing with interest calculated on an hourly basis and without predefined loan maturities, a structure primarily suited for short-term funding needs. By contrast, the new fixed-rate option allows users to lock in both interest rate and loan duration in advance, enabling longer-term planning while maintaining access to higher leverage of up to 10x under UTA.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Effective Feb. 28, 2026, at 8 a.m. UTC, users can access fixed-rate borrowing through Manual Borrow in UTA, with predefined loan tenors ranging from short-term durations to extended borrowing periods of up to 180 days. Users can access fixed-rate borrowing by navigating to Assets → Unified Trading Account → Borrow. Once approved, borrowing quotas are reserved for the selected term, providing clearer expectations around funding availability and cost over the life of the loan.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By pairing longer-dated fixed-rate borrowing (up to 180 days) with leverage available for eligible activities under UTA — including spot margin trading with leverage of up to 10x — Bybit enables users to deploy leveraged strategies over longer horizons with greater visibility into financing costs. In the broader crypto market, fixed-rate loans are typically limited to shorter durations or offered separately from leveraged trading frameworks, making this integrated structure within UTA notably uncommon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the fixed-rate model, both the interest rate and maturity date are confirmed at the time of borrowing and remain unchanged throughout the loan term. This structure is designed for users who prioritize cost predictability when managing leveraged positions beyond short-term market movements.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The fixed-rate UTA Loan also supports continued borrowing within the original loan period. If a loan is repaid before maturity, users may re-borrow during the remaining term without additional interest, while the original maturity date remains unchanged, improving capital efficiency within the same borrowing window.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With the addition of fixed-rate borrowing, extended loan durations of up to 180 days, and access to higher leverage within UTA, Bybit continues to expand its unified account framework to support more structured and long-term capital management in the digital asset market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the maximum fixed-rate loan term is 180 days, users may also choose shorter loan durations to align with different trading strategies and funding needs. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>#Bybit / #CryptoArk </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Bybit</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 80 million users.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Benoît Morenne</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Big Oil has an unusual ask for President Trump: Please stop your battle against offshore wind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oil lobbyists have made the case to Trump officials in recent weeks that his attacks on wind farms off the U.S. coast risk derailing congressional efforts to speed up permits for energy projects, according to people familiar with the matter. The oil-and-gas industry fears missing out on a huge opportunity to ship more of its products to markets via new pipelines.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since coming into office, Trump has repeatedly targeted wind farms he has described as ugly, expensive and destructive for wildlife. His Interior Department suspended all offshore wind projects in the works from Massachusetts to Virginia, prompting energy companies to sue the government. But even as judges have sided with developers against the administration and allowed projects to move forward, Trump has persisted.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"My goal is to not let any windmill be built,\" Trump said last month at a White House meeting with oil executives. \"They are the worst form of energy, the most expensive form of energy.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump's actions have plunged the wind industry into turmoil. Now, they risk backfiring against his oil allies and putting their own projects on shaky ground.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The oil-and-gas industry has for months told the administration that its moves to expedite fossil-fuel projects should be enshrined in law — lest a Democratic president reverse them in the future. But Trump's continued blitz against wind is throwing a monkey wrench into a crucial legislative push to do just that.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Senate Democrats have said they would refuse to negotiate a bipartisan law to reform energy permits as long as Trump keeps stalling wind farms. Oil lobbyists see a narrowing window to break the logjam before the midterm elections, when they expect Democrats to regain control of the House.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This administration has done everything that they could do at the administrative level,\" Mike Sommers, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, the U.S. industry's largest trade group, said last week at an energy conference in Houston. \"If you think that permanent reform is hard to get done now, just wait until the Democrats control the United States House of Representatives.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump's escalating feud with wind is forcing the fossil-fuel industry into odd contortions. It was incensed at former President Joe Biden's decisions to cancel the controversial Keystone XL crude pipeline and pause new exports of natural gas. Now, it has become a de facto, albeit begrudging, mediator between wind developers experiencing their own setbacks and the Trump administration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lobbyists have told staff at the National Energy Dominance Council, a body Trump set up to boost energy projects, that the administration's stance against wind makes it much more difficult to get a bipartisan deal in Congress, one of the people familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>API has made it clear to the administration that permitting is its No. 1 legislative priority, and it supports ensuring that all projects that have received a federal nod can be completed — including wind projects, according to people familiar with the matter. API isn't engaged in lobbying for or against wind projects and is focused on advocating for the oil-and-gas industry, the people said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dustin Meyer, senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs at API, said the group has been crystal clear about its priorities with lawmakers and the administration, which include amending a law that imposes federal reviews of the environmental impact of projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A spokeswoman for the White House reaffirmed Trump's position that \"wind farms are a liability that jeopardizes the safety of the American people.\" She said the administration is working closely with its partners in Congress to drive reforms to the permitting process.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The stalemate in Congress could hurt Trump's goals to reshore critical industries and win the AI race. The U.S. faces a daunting challenge to meet new electricity demand from data centers, factories and electric vehicles that it won't sate without a major energy build-out. Cutting the U.S.'s reliance on imports for critical minerals such as lithium and copper requires new mines. For all these reasons, streamlining the complex web of laws and regulations that govern energy projects has become a bipartisan priority on Capitol Hill.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The oil-and-gas industry sees a huge opportunity to build new pipelines. Environmental groups have become proficient at blocking new conduits by stalling projects in the courts. Delays that companies have incurred fighting regulatory and court challenges have spurred many to scrap multibillion-dollar ventures in recent years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Pipelines have been a bottleneck. Infrastructure has been a bottleneck, \" said Toby Rice, chief executive of natural gas producer EQT. \"It's been harder for us to get our gas to market.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump has successfully used his power to block wind farms as leverage to benefit his oil-and-gas allies. After Trump reversed a stop-work order on a major wind project off New York's coast last May, the state approved a natural gas pipeline project that energy company Williams had previously abandoned.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the fossil-fuel industry is adamant that it needs a law to make sure it can build pipelines and not see its permits yanked by a future administration. In December, it praised the House for passing bipartisan legislation to narrow environmental review timelines and litigation windows for energy projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Four days later, the administration paused the federal leases for five offshore wind projects under construction \"due to national security risks identified by the Department of War in recently completed classified reports.\" In protest, Democrats said they were freezing negotiations to pass a Senate version of the House bill as long as Trump didn't reverse his attacks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some oil lobbyists say privately that Trump's deep aversion to wind farms makes no sense to them. Many in the industry say they have been frustrated with the situation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We've been heavily focused on permitting reform as kind of like the cork in the bottle,\" said Sam Sledge, board chair of the Energy Workforce and Technology Council, an industry trade group. \"I think that's been caught in the crosswinds of some other priorities with Trump's administration.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Benoît Morenne at benoit.morenne@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

If you trade on centralized DeFi interfaces, you need to assume your data is visible. The Axiom scandal shows that insiders could potentially see user IDs, wallet addresses, and position sizes before they hit the public chain. This is a massive breach of crypto security. If you are a high-volume trader, this exposes you to predatory insider trading mechanics that can silently bleed your portfolio dry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the risk isn’t just digital. As we’ve noted before with the Binance employee wrench attack, the physical safety risks of leaked personal data are real. When internal logs create a database of “who has the money,” that database becomes a target. While projects like Hyperliquid launch DeFi policy centers to try and legitimize the space with better standards, incidents like the Axiom scandal drag the industry back into the shadows. For now, the safest bet is to assume that if a human verified your account or built the dashboard, a human can probably see your trades.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>DISCOVER: 5 High-Risk High-Reward Cryptos</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Follow 99Bitcoins on X For the Latest Market Updates and Subscribe on YouTube For Daily Expert Market Analysis.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Key Takeaways</span></strong></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>ZachXBT exposed Axiom Exchange staff for allegedly using internal tools to spy on and front-run users for insider trading.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The scandal highlights severe security gaps in centralized DeFi front-ends, even those backed by Y Combinator.</span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Your trading data on these platforms may be visible to employees, posing both financial and privacy risks.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>The post Axiom Exchange Insider Trading Scandal: Is Your Trading Data Being Used Against You? appeared first on 99Bitcoins.</span></p></span></div></div>",
