Shares are up 6% this year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Finding a new catalyst to make the stock rise more has been difficult. In the past month, Chevron has been trading flat as oil prices have fluctuated on geopolitical news.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Analysts expect Chevron to post $1.71 of earnings per share in the third quarter, down from $2.51 a year ago. Oil prices have fallen from last year's level — international prices were recently trading at $64 a barrel, down 14% on the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>One area where Chevron could impress investors is in its nascent power business. The company has said it's working on plans to build power plants that could power AI data centers. Investors will also be watching closely to see if Chevron changes its stock-buyback policy, after the company slowed the pace of buybacks earlier this year. Shareholder returns are one of the main reasons to buy the stock, given the company's 4.4% dividend yield.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chevron will also hold an investor day on Nov. 12.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The upcoming strategy day is not set to be an event for unveiling big new financial targets, but does come at an opportune time for Chevron to reinforce its message around operating resilience — including delivering on real growth and free cash flow expansion — even in this more challenging oil macro,\" wrote Citi analyst Alastair Syme.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Out of the 30 analysts who cover Chevron and are tracked by FactSet, 15 have a Buy rating, 14 have a Hold rating, and 1 has a Sell rating, with an average price target of $169.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chevron ended Thursday down 1%, closing at $153.52.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Hiroyuki Kume, Tomoko Numajiri and Miho Naganuma / Yomiuri Shimbun Staff Writers</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>JERA Co., a major Japanese power generation company, expressed its intention to expand its offshore wind power generation business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Masato Yamada, CEO of the Japan arm of JERA Nex BP Ltd., said that \"takeoff is key\" for the nation's wind power generation business, during an interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>JERA Nex BP is an offshore wind power generation joint venture established by JERA and British energy giant BP PLC.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yamada talked about JERA's outlook in the wind power generation business. The following is excerpted from his interview.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Yomiuri Shimbun: What do you think about the current business environment?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Masato Yamada: The depreciation of the yen is the biggest factor affecting Japan, in addition to inflation. The economic situation is extremely tough right now. Europe is also facing hardships, with projects being canceled or delayed one after another as they became unprofitable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, Japan's problems extend beyond these issues. We have to start from zero regarding offshore wind power generation, as it's a field we don't have any experience in. We are at the stage of initial investment. We need to prepare everything, from ships to ports.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Costs are going up due to uncertainties and inefficiencies, which stem from a lack of proficiency in the field. Those factors should be distinguished from costs that arise from macroeconomic conditions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The burden of initial investment needs to be shared in some way. Without doing so, it will be difficult for Japan's wind power generation business to take off. You know, an airplane consumes the most fuel during takeoff. Investment is needed to help the launch of the business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As I've said, takeoff is key. After that stage, an ecosystem will be formed, so costs can be pushed down. Europe has proven that costs decrease with experience. If we don't start, we will never reach the stage where costs begin to fall. We must overcome this hurdle first.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Competing in global market</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yomiuri: How many years will it take for your vision to be realized?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yamada: It took Europe 25 years. The world's first offshore wind farm began operating in 1991 in Denmark, and the initial costs were astronomical. During this long journey, wind turbines and ships (used to build and maintain them) have become larger, and construction methods have advanced.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Companies sometimes worked together and sometimes competed against each other, and during this process, they accumulated experience and improved efficiency. Japan lacks large-scale industries involving offshore oil and gas fields, putting the country at a disadvantage in developing offshore projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(In Japan), the public bidding for large-scale projects that are set to be built in general waters have turned into a price war. Hurdles have risen dramatically as companies also face pressure to shorten construction time. Preparation time is very short, and data is lacking. Companies must finish construction cheaply and under tight deadlines. It's safe to say that the demands are beyond the capabilities of the companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yomiuri: What are your plans to advance domestic projects?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yamada: The JERA group has made a strategic decision to team up with British energy giant BP to conduct business globally, based on a decision to continue working on offshore wind power projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We will gather experience and knowledge to compete in the global offshore wind market. My mission is to carry out domestic projects with strong business structure and the best possible methods.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>----</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This article is from The Yomiuri Shimbun.

Despite these challenges, the company achieved a net income of $21 million, a significant improvement from the net loss of $198 million in the prior year period.

Last year's third quarter results were 78 cents per share on net income of $45.0 million. Net income in the third quarter of 2025 and year to date primarily reflects lower sales to industrial customers and inflationary pressures at Minnesota Power, lower sales of renewable projects at the clean energy businesses and transaction related expenses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ALLETE awaits a written order from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (\"MPUC\") in order to execute on the closing of the partnership with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (\"CPP Investments\") and Global Infrastructure Partners (\"GIP\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I am grateful for the MPUC's unanimous approval of ALLETE's partnership with CPP Investments and GIP on October 3, 2025, and extremely proud of our entire ALLETE team for the thoughtful work with our many stakeholders throughout the regulatory process — all as they continue to work diligently to execute our Sustainability-in-Action strategy,\" said ALLETE Chair, President, and Chief Executive Officer Bethany Owen. \"The MPUC's approval results in historic benefits for our customers, our employees, and the communities we serve. We expect to close the transaction once the written order is received from the MPUC, and we are excited for the next chapter of ALLETE's wonderful history with these Partners that are aligned with our values and support our culture and strategy.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ALLETE's Regulated Operations segment, which includes Minnesota Power, SWLP and the Company's investment in the American Transmission Company, recorded third quarter 2025 net income of $32.5 million, compared to $34.0 million in the third quarter a year ago. Net income at Minnesota Power was lower than 2024 reflecting lower margins from industrial customers, and higher operating and maintenance expense, partially offset by lower income tax expense and increased cost recovery rider revenue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ALLETE Clean Energy recorded a third quarter 2025 net loss of $3.6 million compared to net income of $3.9 million in 2024. Net income in 2025 reflected lower production, along with associated tax credits, due to transmission network outages in the SPP market. Net income in the third quarter of 2024 reflected the sale of the Whitetail wind project.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>New Energy Equity recorded 2025 third quarter net income of $1.3 million, compared to net income of $11.7 million for the same period in 2024. Net income in 2025 includes lower sales of renewable energy projects due to the timing of project closings. These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings from tax equity financed solar energy facilities and higher investment tax credits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Corporate and Other businesses, which include BNI Energy, ALLETE Properties and our investments in renewable energy facilities, recorded a net loss of $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to a net loss of $4.6 million in 2024. Net income in 2025 reflects lower merger-related expenses compared to 2024, and lower income tax expense. Merger-related expenses were $3.1 million after-tax in 2025 compared to $3.8 million in 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Results for 2025 have been negatively impacted by lower industrial margins as a result of lower sales to taconite customers at Minnesota Power which are expected to continue through the remainder of 2025,\" said ALLETE Vice President — Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Treasurer Jeff Scissons. \"As a result of the transaction, historic customer, clean-energy, workforce and governance commitments have been made by our Partners. Approximately $200 million of value including rate credits, an immediate return on equity reduction and rate case stay-out provision will be recognized by Minnesota Power customers, while maintaining existing charitable and economic investments will benefit ALLETE stakeholders and our communities. The rate case stay-out provision will have an impact on 2026 financials, but it is a material benefit to all Minnesota Power customers.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ALLETE is an energy company headquartered in Duluth, Minn.
