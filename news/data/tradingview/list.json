After that move, XRP retraced into a sideway band where Osemka labels internal subdivisions “a,” “b,” and “c,” implying a corrective internal chop inside the broader range.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The lower boundary of the range is drawn in the $1.62 area. This lower boundary is simultaneously labeled “A” and described as the base of Reaccumulation, implying that buyers repeatedly defended that zone. The subsequent rally back toward the upper boundary defined the “B” top. What followed was a final flush into “C,” which he explicitly tags “Spring,” with the wick piercing below prior support and then snapping back above $2.20–$2.30 and into the ~$2.58 region shown on the chart.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The message is that the C wave was fast, deep, and terminal. He calls it “a sharp ending in the C wave,” adding that this is “very common.” In classical Elliott interpretation, an A-B-C corrective move that ends with an aggressive C spike often resolves with trend continuation in the direction of the original impulse. In his wording, the surge established the impulse, and everything since has been digestion, not distribution. He argues that “it is hard to see this range as anything less than a long reaccumulation after November’s surge.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notably, Osemka places XRP’s pattern next to gold’s weekly chart during its own multi-quarter sideways phase. Gold’s structure is annotated almost identically: an “A” low anchored around roughly $1,680–$1,700 per ounce, a mid-range chop labeled “a / b / c,” a “B” high pressing into the $2,050–$2,100 ceiling, and finally a “C” leg that undercut that same $1,700 floor before reversing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When gold finally pushed through the long-capped $2,100 area in July 2024 and broke into sustained new all-time highs near $2,480, that break acted like a trigger: safe-haven demand, Fed rate-cut expectations and central bank buying drove an almost uninterrupted vertical phase in the metal, and over the following months gold kept taking out round numbers — $2,500, $3,000, $4,000 and beyond — ultimately stretching more than 80% higher from that $2,100 breakout zone to reach about $4,381 per ounce at the peak.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By placing XRP and gold side by side, using the same lettering, same boundary logic, and the same “Spring” terminology, Osemka is presenting XRP as sitting at the equivalent moment gold occupied just before its parabolic run.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“This one is for the XRP community, where I see some gurus preaching for the end of the cycle. Bros, it is hard to see this range as anything less than a long reaccumulation after November’s surge. In Elliott wave terms: an ABC with a sharp ending in the C wave. Very common. Last shakeout or Spring. There is basically no difference to this reaccumulation example on Gold years ago. Thank me later,” the analyst concluded.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At press time, XRP traded at $2.49.</span></p><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:554.296875px;max-width:1200px;aspect-ratio:2.1649048625792813\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:265d01850094b-4d1211a21b11d017ba1ec63e6ff4e555-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"XRP price\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:265d01850094b-4d1211a21b11d017ba1ec63e6ff4e555-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f7f5f6\"/></picture></div></figure></span></span></div></div>",

When applicable, net auction proceeds are returned to GDM's Settlement Buffer Balance, which helps offset future members' Weekly Sharing Contributions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>How the Partnership Works</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the workflow, GDM assigns total-loss vehicles to Copart for pickup, storage, and documentation. Copart handles title paperwork through its Title Direct system and lists vehicles on its VB3 online auction platform, which provides standardized photos and condition reports. Weekday auctions include a short \"Bonus Time\" window that allows additional bids before closing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Copart operates in 11 countries and has more than 1 million registered buyers across 230 markets, processing roughly 5 million vehicles a year. About 80% of vehicle parts from these sales are reused or recycled, according to the company, reducing waste and supporting local repair industries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A recent example illustrates the process: a 2020 Mercedes GLS involved in a collision in CA in spring of 2025 had an actual cash value of about the high-$30,000s and a repair estimate of roughly the mid-$20,000s - almost 70% of its value. Listed on Copart's platform, the vehicle sold for around the mid-$25,000s, with full documentation available for audit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Why It Matters</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>For GDM, which applies an AI-driven mutuality model rather than an insurance approach, the partnership strengthens its focus on transparency and operational efficiency. Copart's standardized imaging and digital documentation improve traceability and compliance, while coordinated towing and paperwork help shorten turnaround time and reduce the likelihood of additional damage. Additionally, Copart's Catastrophe Response Teams provide for rapid deployment during large scale catastrophes such as hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes. This provides for quicker salvage disposition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The goal is to keep the process open, traceable, and efficient for members,\" GDM said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>What's Next</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>GDM and Copart have established service-level targets and performance metrics covering vehicle assignment, transport, advance charges, paperwork, and salvage auction. GDM will be linking Copart's Seller Portal and Title Direct tools with GDM's case-management platform.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Good Driver Mutuality</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Good Driver Mutuality (GDM) is an innovative non-insurance alternative to collision and comprehensive insurance, fostering a strong network of responsible drivers who share automotive repair costs. By leveraging AI-powered technology and rewarding safe driving habits, GDM helps reduce accidents and lower costs for its members, ultimately enhancing road safety.

Estimates from Goldman Sachs and Nationwide were within that ballpark. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Claims data was unavailable for Arizona, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., Economists made assumptions for the three, in line with what the Labor Department would normally do when data is not available.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the U.S. government being shut for almost a month, states continue to collect the claims data, submitting it to the Labor Department. Economists are accessing the data and using seasonal adjustment factors the government published earlier this year to make the weekly claims estimates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Claims at current estimated levels suggested the labor market remained stable and would argue against additional interest cuts from the Federal Reserve. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This will bolster the view of those at the Fed who think another rate cut isn't necessary in December,\" said Oren Klachkin, financial market economist at Nationwide. \"Low claims demonstrate continued economic resilience.\" </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. central bank on Wednesday cut its benchmark overnight interest rate by another 25 basis points to the 3.75%-4.00% range. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters \"a further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion, far from it.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>NO MATERIAL SHIFT TOWARDS EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTION</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, there has been a pick-up in layoffs, with economists blaming low demand for labor because of economic uncertainty, tariffs on imports and companies embracing artificial intelligence. A sharp reduction in labor supply because of raids on undocumented immigrants is also weighing on the labor market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon </span><span> this week said it would cut up to 14,000 jobs from its global corporate workforce. Layoffs are also happening in the automobile sector. American companies have announced more than 25,000 job cuts this month, according to a Reuters tally.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The labor market still appears far away from a material shift toward a contraction in employment that might signal an imminent recession, despite some recent headlines concerning layoffs at certain large firms,\" said Michael Hanson, an economist at JPMorgan. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The latter points to continued weak labor demand that has pushed up the average duration of unemployment and pushed down the break-even level of payroll growth.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While regular claims remain low by historical standards, applications for benefits by federal employees have surged this month, likely related to the more than 150,000 workers who dropped off payrolls at the end of September after accepting buyouts. Some furloughed federal employees could also be seeking benefits, though they would have to reimburse the program when they receive their back pay.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Haver Analytics estimated federal claims, which are reported under a different program, jumped to 10,062 during the week ending October 18 from 7,287 in the prior week. These claims were about 572 in early September.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The number of people receiving unemployment benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased to a seasonally adjusted 1.957 million during the week ending October 18, a two-and-a-half-month high, from 1.945 million, JPMorgan estimated. That was broadly in line with the calculations from Goldman Sachs and Nationwide.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The so-called continued claims reading aligned with the Conference Board survey, which showed consumers' perceptions of the labor market remained downbeat in October. The unemployment rate was near a four-year high of 4.3% in August.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "title": "Cities Across the U.S. Are Putting Robots to Work — Journal Report",
            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jackie Snow</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Robots are coming to a town near you — deployed by cities to do work that is labor-intensive, repetitive or dangerous for humans.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cities have long lagged behind the private sector when it comes to giving jobs to robots. That's because robots are expensive and work best in highly controlled environments, not exactly the definition of city streets. Questions about safety, cybersecurity and job displacement also loom large in public settings. Police robots, for example, have occasionally stirred up fears about surveillance and the potential for lethal force.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So for now, the robots being rolled out in cities are friendly and low-profile — they mow lawns, clean beaches and guide people through buildings, among other things. And they still have to prove their worth, experts say.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Cities are on relatively tight budgets,\" says Peter Stone, a computer-science professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \"And so far, robots aren't making things less expensive.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But cities and counties have identified some use cases where deploying robots makes sense. Here is a look at some of them:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Kansas City, Mo.: Firefighting</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Kansas City Fire Department deployed a firefighting robot in March 2024 that is capable of delivering more water than most fire engines while keeping firefighters out of hazardous environments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The robot, which has tank-like treads instead of wheels and is roughly the size of a small car, can push out up to 2,500 gallons of water a minute while advancing toward fires and navigating obstacles. Battalion Chief Benjamin Schloegel, who leads the fire department's drone and robotics division, says the robot has been deployed several times, primarily for large-scale fires.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The department operates the remotely controlled robot alongside drones, which help the operator chart the best path. The robot features four thermal and visible-light cameras, a front blade for pushing vehicles, and a winch for clearing paths. Schloegel says the applications could extend beyond firefighting, to wilderness rescue and even active-shooter situations where it could transport patients without exposing personnel to danger.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the robot's first deployment, a fire at a recycling facility, the blaze was under control but the labor-intensive work of extinguishing hot spots remained. The fire initially required 30 firefighters but once the incident commander saw the robot's capabilities, he released more than half in response, freeing crews for other emergencies. The robot, fire officials say, handled work firefighters would typically spend hours doing in calf-high water and muck.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"At that recycling fire, there was 12 hours less of smoke flowing over neighborhoods because we were able to get to the seat of the fire and put it out that much faster,\" Schloegel says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Englewood, Colo.: Building guide</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Arapahoe Libraries, a public library system in Colorado, plans to deploy a four-wheeled robot at a new co-working facility in Englewood, Colo. The robot's job will be to help visitors navigate the public space, which is opening in early 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The building, called the Space and Cafe, will have a 200-person event space, a boardroom and a variety of meeting spaces that can be reserved by the public.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The robot will act as a backup concierge when human staff are unavailable, says Anthony White, the district's director of innovation and technology. Visitors tap the robot's screen to select various spaces, and the robot guides them through the building at a customizable walking pace, navigating around obstacles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The library is testing a second robot for cafe delivery to workspaces.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>White sees the technology as part of the library's broader mission. \"We want to expose our patrons to technology that exists in the world, in a setting where it's functional,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Irvine, Calif.: Assessing public infrastructure</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Irvine deployed five robots, beginning in late August, to conduct a comprehensive assessment of its public infrastructure. The project, aimed at determining compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act, typically would have taken at least two city staff members four years to complete but will be finished in under six months with the robots, according to Vu Tran, a principal civil engineer for the city.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The robots are measuring more than 9,000 curb ramps, 9 50 miles of sidewalk, 400 transit stops and 70 miles of paved trails, documenting compliance issues like crossfall slopes, sidewalk uplift and cracks. Tran says the robots provide far more detailed data than traditional inspection by human assessors. While humans typically measure at 10-foot intervals, the robots take measurements every few centimeters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's going to be a lot more accurate,\" Tran says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The robots operate during weekday business hours and can run for 12 continuous hours before they need to be recharged. The main challenge has been curiosity — the robots are programmed to stop when pedestrians approach, and people frequently pause to take photos, causing minor delays, according to Tran.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sanford, N.C.: Lawn mowing</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sanford has deployed 10 autonomous lawn-mowing robots across roughly 6 acres at City Hall and nearby water towers. The battery-powered robots run up to 23 hours daily, cutting grass continuously in programmed patterns and returning to individual charging docks when needed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The robots provide multiple benefits beyond labor savings, according to Brian Flynn, the horticulturist with the city's grounds division. The robots improve safety by removing workers from potentially hazardous slopes where traditional riding mowers once operated. The frequent cutting also reduces thatch buildup and creates healthier, thicker grass, while minimizing the use of pesticides.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"These mowers give you consistent quality cuts, so the appearance is neat and uniform seven days a week,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The robots have eliminated noise pollution from gas-powered equipment around City Hall offices and conference rooms. They also have freed up staff to focus on other maintenance tasks, he says. The city engaged residents by crowdsourcing names for some of the robots. Now, \"Jason Ma Mowa,\" \"Britney Shears\" and \"Snippy Longstockings\" patrol the grounds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Detroit: Trash scooping</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Detroit deployed a beach-cleaning robot on Belle Isle, a popular island park in the Detroit River, to remove debris from sand and waterways while showcasing emerging technology to residents.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The robot, which can clean up to 32,000 square feet of sand an hour, digs up the top layer and shakes it like a prospector panning for gold, says Tim Slusser, Detroit's Chief of Mobility Innovation. But instead of gold, the robot is collecting cigarette butts, food wrappers and broken glass. The robot is remotely controlled, though autonomous capabilities are being investigated for future versions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Detroit also has a water-based drone that filters up to 200 pounds of debris daily from the island's streams and marina. The Belle Isle Conservancy, which helps the city operate both robots, analyzes the collected debris to identify patterns and develop mitigation strategies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To encourage more experimentation with robots, the city offers streamlined permitting for companies and researchers. The approach has supported diverse projects including autonomous food-waste collection robots and mobile EV charging robots. Slusser says the goal is to create pathways for companies to demonstrate real-world applications and attract customers or investors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We want them to understand that these are the opportunities of the future,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jackie Snow is a writer in Los Angeles.
