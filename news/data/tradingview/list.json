After that move, XRP retraced into a sideway band where Osemka labels internal subdivisions “a,” “b,” and “c,” implying a corrective internal chop inside the broader range.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The lower boundary of the range is drawn in the $1.62 area. This lower boundary is simultaneously labeled “A” and described as the base of Reaccumulation, implying that buyers repeatedly defended that zone. The subsequent rally back toward the upper boundary defined the “B” top. What followed was a final flush into “C,” which he explicitly tags “Spring,” with the wick piercing below prior support and then snapping back above $2.20–$2.30 and into the ~$2.58 region shown on the chart.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The message is that the C wave was fast, deep, and terminal. He calls it “a sharp ending in the C wave,” adding that this is “very common.” In classical Elliott interpretation, an A-B-C corrective move that ends with an aggressive C spike often resolves with trend continuation in the direction of the original impulse. In his wording, the surge established the impulse, and everything since has been digestion, not distribution. He argues that “it is hard to see this range as anything less than a long reaccumulation after November’s surge.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notably, Osemka places XRP’s pattern next to gold’s weekly chart during its own multi-quarter sideways phase. Gold’s structure is annotated almost identically: an “A” low anchored around roughly $1,680–$1,700 per ounce, a mid-range chop labeled “a / b / c,” a “B” high pressing into the $2,050–$2,100 ceiling, and finally a “C” leg that undercut that same $1,700 floor before reversing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When gold finally pushed through the long-capped $2,100 area in July 2024 and broke into sustained new all-time highs near $2,480, that break acted like a trigger: safe-haven demand, Fed rate-cut expectations and central bank buying drove an almost uninterrupted vertical phase in the metal, and over the following months gold kept taking out round numbers — $2,500, $3,000, $4,000 and beyond — ultimately stretching more than 80% higher from that $2,100 breakout zone to reach about $4,381 per ounce at the peak.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By placing XRP and gold side by side, using the same lettering, same boundary logic, and the same “Spring” terminology, Osemka is presenting XRP as sitting at the equivalent moment gold occupied just before its parabolic run.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“This one is for the XRP community, where I see some gurus preaching for the end of the cycle. Bros, it is hard to see this range as anything less than a long reaccumulation after November’s surge. In Elliott wave terms: an ABC with a sharp ending in the C wave. Very common. Last shakeout or Spring. There is basically no difference to this reaccumulation example on Gold years ago. Thank me later,” the analyst concluded.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At press time, XRP traded at $2.49.</span></p><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:554.296875px;max-width:1200px;aspect-ratio:2.1649048625792813\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:265d01850094b-4d1211a21b11d017ba1ec63e6ff4e555-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"XRP price\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:265d01850094b-4d1211a21b11d017ba1ec63e6ff4e555-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f7f5f6\"/></picture></div></figure></span></span></div></div>",

When applicable, net auction proceeds are returned to GDM's Settlement Buffer Balance, which helps offset future members' Weekly Sharing Contributions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>How the Partnership Works</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the workflow, GDM assigns total-loss vehicles to Copart for pickup, storage, and documentation.

Weekday auctions include a short \"Bonus Time\" window that allows additional bids before closing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Copart operates in 11 countries and has more than 1 million registered buyers across 230 markets, processing roughly 5 million vehicles a year. About 80% of vehicle parts from these sales are reused or recycled, according to the company, reducing waste and supporting local repair industries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A recent example illustrates the process: a 2020 Mercedes GLS involved in a collision in CA in spring of 2025 had an actual cash value of about the high-$30,000s and a repair estimate of roughly the mid-$20,000s - almost 70% of its value.

Copart's standardized imaging and digital documentation improve traceability and compliance, while coordinated towing and paperwork help shorten turnaround time and reduce the likelihood of additional damage. Additionally, Copart's Catastrophe Response Teams provide for rapid deployment during large scale catastrophes such as hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes. This provides for quicker salvage disposition.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The goal is to keep the process open, traceable, and efficient for members,\" GDM said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>What's Next</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>GDM and Copart have established service-level targets and performance metrics covering vehicle assignment, transport, advance charges, paperwork, and salvage auction.

Estimates from Goldman Sachs and Nationwide were within that ballpark. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Claims data was unavailable for Arizona, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., Economists made assumptions for the three, in line with what the Labor Department would normally do when data is not available.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite the U.S. government being shut for almost a month, states continue to collect the claims data, submitting it to the Labor Department. Economists are accessing the data and using seasonal adjustment factors the government published earlier this year to make the weekly claims estimates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Claims at current estimated levels suggested the labor market remained stable and would argue against additional interest cuts from the Federal Reserve. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This will bolster the view of those at the Fed who think another rate cut isn't necessary in December,\" said Oren Klachkin, financial market economist at Nationwide. \"Low claims demonstrate continued economic resilience.\" </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. central bank on Wednesday cut its benchmark overnight interest rate by another 25 basis points to the 3.75%-4.00% range. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters \"a further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion, far from it.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>NO MATERIAL SHIFT TOWARDS EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTION</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, there has been a pick-up in layoffs, with economists blaming low demand for labor because of economic uncertainty, tariffs on imports and companies embracing artificial intelligence. A sharp reduction in labor supply because of raids on undocumented immigrants is also weighing on the labor market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon </span><span> this week said it would cut up to 14,000 jobs from its global corporate workforce. Layoffs are also happening in the automobile sector. American companies have announced more than 25,000 job cuts this month, according to a Reuters tally.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The labor market still appears far away from a material shift toward a contraction in employment that might signal an imminent recession, despite some recent headlines concerning layoffs at certain large firms,\" said Michael Hanson, an economist at JPMorgan. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The latter points to continued weak labor demand that has pushed up the average duration of unemployment and pushed down the break-even level of payroll growth.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While regular claims remain low by historical standards, applications for benefits by federal employees have surged this month, likely related to the more than 150,000 workers who dropped off payrolls at the end of September after accepting buyouts. Some furloughed federal employees could also be seeking benefits, though they would have to reimburse the program when they receive their back pay.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Haver Analytics estimated federal claims, which are reported under a different program, jumped to 10,062 during the week ending October 18 from 7,287 in the prior week. These claims were about 572 in early September.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The number of people receiving unemployment benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased to a seasonally adjusted 1.957 million during the week ending October 18, a two-and-a-half-month high, from 1.945 million, JPMorgan estimated. That was broadly in line with the calculations from Goldman Sachs and Nationwide.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The so-called continued claims reading aligned with the Conference Board survey, which showed consumers' perceptions of the labor market remained downbeat in October. The unemployment rate was near a four-year high of 4.3% in August.</span></p></span></div></div>",
