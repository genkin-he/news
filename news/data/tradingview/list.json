Crude benchmarks are at their highest level in about seven months, with Brent crude above $72 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate at $66 a barrel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MACRO: Markets are still betting that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates further this year, though the pace of potential cuts remains uncertain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The latest U.S. producer price index data showed that wholesale inflation unexpectedly accelerated in January. The PPI is closely watched because several of its components feed into the calculation of the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariff policy and the future of existing trade agreements following a recent Supreme Court ruling continues to weigh on market sentiment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>GEOPOLITICAL RISKS: The U.S. and Iran are set to resume discussions next week after the latest round of talks concluded on Thursday without reaching an agreement. Further negotiations \"at a technical level\" will take place in Vienna, Oman's Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi said in a post on X.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Markets remain cautious, however, as any escalation in tensions could threaten energy flows, particularly after Washington increased its military presence in the Middle East. The impact of potential U.S. military action on oil prices would largely depend on whether it disrupts global supply and shipping traffic through the Strait of Hormuz.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SUPPLY AND DEMAND: The broader outlook remains bearish, as global oil supply is still expected to exceed demand this year. Under normal circumstances, such a surplus would put significant downward pressure on prices. Instead, crude futures have held up, supported by persistent geopolitical tensions that continue to sustain a sizeable risk premium in the market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, U.S. crude inventories surged by 16 million barrels last week to 435.8 million barrels--far above expectations and marking the largest weekly increase since February 2023, the EIA said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>NEXT WEEK: Heightened uncertainty over developments in the Middle East is expected to keep a significant risk premium embedded in oil prices, as markets weigh the possibility of supply disruption.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"President Trump's deadline for an agreement expires in a week at the latest,\" analysts at Commerzbank said. \"The continuing risk of a U.S. military strike is therefore likely to remain the dominant issue on the oil market, which suggests that oil prices will remain well supported.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Traders are also focused on the upcoming OPEC+ meeting on Sunday for guidance on future production policy, with the group now widely expected to resume output increases, beginning with a modest 137,000 barrel-a-day rise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the economic front, investors will be watching some remarks from Federal Reserve speakers, manufacturing PMI, ADP employment figures and weekly jobless claims for fresh clues on the strength of the economy and interest-rate outlook.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Giulia Petroni at giulia.petroni@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

As outlined in THORWallet’s post, merged unlocks allow holders to consolidate and use unlocked tokens to boost rewards, with top wallets targeting 200,000+ TITN. Mechanically, this creates a short-term incentive to accumulate or retain TITN to maximize airdrop allocation, which can generate buy pressure and higher on-chain activity into the event. After distribution, increased circulating supply and concentrated large rewards may introduce sell pressure, so traders should watch vesting behavior and on-chain flows closely.</span></p><div class=\"container-n2KCMK3i\" data-qa-id=\"tweet-widget-container\"><blockquote class=\"blockquote-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"header-n2KCMK3i\"><span class=\"profile-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"avatar-n2KCMK3i\"></div><div class=\"name-n2KCMK3i\">THORWallet - Onchain Finance</div><div class=\"username-n2KCMK3i\">@Thorwallet</div></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"logo-n2KCMK3i\" role=\"img\"><svg height=\"28\" viewbox=\"0 0 28 28\" width=\"28\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M19.75 5h3.07l-6.7 7.62L24 23h-6.17l-4.84-6.3L7.46 23H4.4l7.17-8.16L4 5h6.33l4.37 5.75L19.75 5Zm-1.24 16h1.7L9.54 7H7.7l10.8 14Z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path></svg></span></div><div class=\"description-n2KCMK3i\"><p class=\"\"><span>TITN Community Unlock</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>March 3rd · 15:00 CET ️</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Merged TITN unlocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You can now use your unlocked TITN to actively increase your share of the 5,000,000 TITN airdrop.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Top wallets estimate 200,000+ TITN rewards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Unlock → Participate → Compound</span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://t.co/EsyLhCM8Tx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.co/EsyLhCM8Tx</a></p></div><span class=\"date-n2KCMK3i\">Feb 27, 2026</span><span class=\"border-n2KCMK3i\"></span><span class=\"socials-n2KCMK3i\"></span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Thorwallet/status/2027363016711274540\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"></a></blockquote><div></div></div></span></div></div>",

In the project’s teaser, the team confirms that a fresh “Illuvium Beyond” wave will drop on that date, signaling another cycle of collectible or ecosystem-related releases. For ILV, new content waves can drive user engagement, secondary-market activity, and speculative interest around the broader Illuvium ecosystem, which may translate into higher demand for ILV exposure if participants expect increased platform traction. However, the direct on-chain economic impact depends on how much this wave actually uses ILV or contributes to protocol revenue, so price reaction may be driven more by sentiment than fundamentals.</span></p><div class=\"container-n2KCMK3i\" data-qa-id=\"tweet-widget-container\"><blockquote class=\"blockquote-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"header-n2KCMK3i\"><span class=\"profile-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"avatar-n2KCMK3i\"></div><div class=\"name-n2KCMK3i\">Kieran.eth</div><div class=\"username-n2KCMK3i\">@KieranWarwick</div></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"logo-n2KCMK3i\" role=\"img\"><svg height=\"28\" viewbox=\"0 0 28 28\" width=\"28\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M19.75 5h3.07l-6.7 7.62L24 23h-6.17l-4.84-6.3L7.46 23H4.4l7.17-8.16L4 5h6.33l4.37 5.75L19.75 5Zm-1.24 16h1.7L9.54 7H7.7l10.8 14Z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path></svg></span></div><div class=\"description-n2KCMK3i\"><p class=\"\"><span>Illuvium Beyond. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>New wave dropping March 12. </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://t.co/Kq8RnEXdYv\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/Kq8RnEXdYv</a></p></div><span class=\"date-n2KCMK3i\">Feb 27, 2026</span><span class=\"border-n2KCMK3i\"></span><span class=\"socials-n2KCMK3i\"></span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KieranWarwick/status/2027293622094492107\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"></a></blockquote><div></div></div></span></div></div>",
