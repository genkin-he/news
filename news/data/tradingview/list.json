            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Collin Eaton and Kejal Vyas</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When Chevron won a new license to drill in Venezuela, it celebrated a return to one of the world's richest oil regions, where it had operated for more than a century. Three months later, the company is in a bind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Trump administration has amassed the biggest American military buildup in the Caribbean since the 1980s to exert pressure on Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. has carried out airstrikes on alleged drug boats, killing dozens. Land targets could come next, President Trump has said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For Chevron and its joint ventures, which employ about 3,000 people in the Latin American country, the tense situation is a reminder of the dangers that come with operating in an authoritarian state in Washington's crosshairs. B-52 bombers now fly above waters where its oil tankers sail.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Our top priority is the safety of our personnel, the communities in which we operate, the environment and the integrity of our joint-venture assets,\" a Chevron spokesman said. He referred any questions about the security situation in Venezuela to the U.S. government.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth has orchestrated a yearslong campaign to keep Venezuela open for oil production. He told senior U.S. officials that if his company couldn't pump oil in Venezuela, China would do so instead and lay claim to the region's oil riches.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the midst of uncertainty about the status of Chevron's license earlier this year, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez visited Beijing on a mission to shore up economic ties with China, the largest buyer of its crude oil.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wirth spent much of the summer lobbying for an extension to Chevron's license to drill in Venezuela after the Trump administration revoked its permit. His argument that its departure could curtail American influence in the region resonated with Trump's team — and overcame opposition from U.S. hard-liners determined to oust Maduro.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chevron has long calculated that it has the means and resilience to outlast changing governments in Caracas and Washington alike. It has remained committed to operating in Venezuela even after Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips pulled out when their assets were nationalized.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wirth and Chevron are well-versed in the risks. Maduro's regime has taken and released several American hostages, including two Chevron executives for two months in 2018. It imprisoned at least three former presidents of Venezuela's state oil company on corruption allegations — one of whom died in custody — and has sought the extradition of another from Italy. In 2017, Venezuela jailed six Citgo executives for nearly five years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is without a doubt a tough time for Chevron,\" said Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. \"I imagine Chevron personnel in Caracas are very jittery.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Spain's Repsol, Italy's Eni and a handful of other companies lost their permits for Venezuela earlier this year. Chevron's output there has historically represented less than 10% of its worldwide production, and Venezuela accounted for 3% of its $31.5 billion cash flow from operations last year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. has sanctions in place that prohibit companies from trading Venezuelan oil; Chevron's license is essentially an exemption to the rule. Trump has warned that he will level hefty tariffs on countries that buy oil from Caracas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, Chevron has faced years of criticism for aiding, even indirectly, Maduro's hold on power.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"What you have is a conflict between the interests of one oil company and the United States,\" said Elliott Abrams, who was the U.S.'s top envoy to Venezuela during the first Trump administration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Maduro, he said, can tell his constituents that the Chevron deal shows the U.S. isn't serious about its anti-Maduro stance. \"It undermines the political argument the United States is making,\" Abrams added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chevron said it operates globally in compliance with laws and regulations that apply to its business, including the U.S. sanctions framework in Venezuela. \"We believe our presence continues to be a stabilizing force for the local economy, the region and U.S. energy security,\" the company spokesman said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chevron is handing over to the Maduro regime about half its oil production in the country as payment under the new license, according to people close to the Venezuelan government. Vessel-tracking data from the market-intelligence firm Kpler shows oil exports from Venezuela to the U.S. fell to about 133,000 barrels a day in September, from about 300,000 in December, when the prior license was in effect.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Much of Venezuela's share ends up in China through sales on the black market, according to the Kpler data, which also shows that Venezuelan exports to China have risen in recent months and overall shipments have remained flat.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Rodriguez, the Venezuelan vice president, has been working with China to cut out intermediaries and allow the oil to reach Asia directly. But much of the imported oil still hits the market at steep discounts, according to people close to the Maduro government. The regime pays off billions in loans from China with cheap oil.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is a very inefficient scheme for Maduro when he desperately needs fresh cash to try to build capabilities in Venezuela,\" said José Ignacio Hernández, a law professor, consultant and public-debt expert at Aurora Macro Strategies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The first Trump administration moved to curtail Chevron's operations in Venezuela as part of a \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Maduro's rule, which had plunged the country into economic turmoil. Maduro withstood the pressure, and in late 2022, the Biden administration allowed Chevron to go back in. When Trump returned to office, he revoked the license again, before reinstating it in July.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The terms of Chevron's new license, which prohibits cash payments to the Maduro government, are thought to be less profitable to the regime than those under the Biden-era permit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The previous permit allowed Chevron to sell all the oil it pumped, and Venezuela's proceeds were funneled through private banks to the local economy. Aides to President Joe Biden said at the time that the arrangement was part of an effort to stabilize the country's beleaguered economy to reduce the exodus of Venezuelans. It was part of an unsuccessful attempt to coax Caracas into holding free and fair elections.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Maduro's government received between $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion tied to licensed foreign oil activities in both 2023 and 2024, according to estimates from Aurora's Hernández. Chevron accounted for most of that revenue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For now, Venezuela wants Chevron to keep pumping.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Caracas, desperate to attract international investors, has appreciated that the company's ambitions have often left it clashing with U.S. foreign policy and doesn't see Chevron as aligned with Washington, a person familiar with the Venezuelan government's thinking said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>David Goldwyn, head of Goldwyn Global Strategies and a former Obama administration official, said cutting off the \"relatively negligible\" revenue stream of Chevron's output in Venezuela wouldn't unseat Maduro or bring the regime to the negotiating table.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"That will just create a different problem, which is foreign influence,\" he said. \"If we leave, someone will come in.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Collin Eaton at collin.eaton@wsj.com and Kejal Vyas at kejal.vyas@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Asa Fitch</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the fast-moving artificial intelligence race, thriving sometimes isn't good enough.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That is what Amazon has learned this year, with investors reluctant to reward it for what many saw as underwhelming growth in its cloud-computing business. Amazon's stock had risen about 1% this year as of Thursday's close, lagging far behind its Big Tech peers and the S&amp;P 500, which is up about 16%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But Amazon's lack of market pizazz belies a strong cloud business that looks set to accelerate in the months ahead.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That business, called Amazon Web Services, is the largest of its kind and is a profit center for the company. Its sales grew 17.5% in the second quarter, and on Thursday reported an acceleration for the third quarter to 20%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That may not appear to stack up well against Microsoft, which is growing its cloud-computing arm at a 40% clip, or Alphabet's Google, which on Wednesday reported a similar increase in cloud revenue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In one sense, AWS's slower growth simply reflects that big increases are harder the larger you are. AWS on Thursday said it had $33 billion of revenue in the third quarter, well above the $23 billion or so analysts estimate for the second-largest player — Microsoft's Azure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet even despite its size hurdle, a breakout for AWS in the coming quarters could easily be in the cards — something its acceleration to 20% revenue growth in the third quarter, its best since 2022, seemed to preview. Amazon's stock rose 14% in after-hours trading Thursday following its results, despite a worse-than-expected revenue outlook for the company overall.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The reason for the revival is mostly straightforward: Amazon is rapidly adding to its cloud-computing infrastructure for AI at a time when the mantra in the industry is more or less: \"Build it, because the customers are already there.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>All of the big cloud-computing players say demand for AI computing power far outstrips supply, a situation that isn't likely to come into balance for a few quarters, if not longer. So the spoils go to those that can build data centers fastest.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Among its projects, Amazon is developing an $11 billion data center campus for the large language model developer Anthropic in Indiana that it said this week was now fully operational. Anthropic, which counts Amazon as a major investor, is less flashy than its rival OpenAI, but has a clearer path to sustainable revenue growth and looks likely to be a core AI customer for years to come.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sales to Anthropic should add nearly 2 percentage points to AWS's revenue growth this year, Wedbush analysts said in a recent note.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And Amazon isn't putting on the brakes. Chief Executive Andy Jassy said the company added 3.8 gigawatts of data center capacity in the past 12 months — a vast amount of power for AI chips that the company said was more than any of its rivals over that period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking forward, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said in a call with analysts that capital spending would come in at around $34.2 billion in the current quarter and reach $125 billion this year before increasing in 2026. If AWS can avoid getting hampered by constraints like electricity and chip availability — a big unknown, to be sure — AWS should have plenty of computing power to grow with in the coming months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon has another advantage in this race, too: the luxury of focus. When it comes to its AI computing infrastructure, its cloud business is a big priority. AWS is crucial for Amazon's appeal to investors, counterbalancing an online retail operation that is much larger in scope but delivers much thinner margins.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The focus for Microsoft, by contrast, is more divided. The company has added AI features to core corporate software like Word, Excel and PowerPoint that has led to bumper sales in the AI boom. That has placed demands on its computing infrastructure that it must prioritize to honor commitments to corporate customers. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said Wednesday that that prioritization was hampering growth in Azure, which is expected to slow to a 37% growth pace in the current quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon's cloud-computing story has disappointed investors recently. A plot twist may be under way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

The Company intends to enter into the Aircraft Sales Framework Agreement with Beijing Leasing Company to increase the certainty of aircraft sales and shorten the aircraft sales cycle by leveraging the relevant expertise of Beijing Leasing Company in aircraft-related assets.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Dow Jones Newswires Staff</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. futures were up, while global markets were mostly lower after many indexes hit record highs this week. The highly anticipated agreement between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping received a muted response with market watchers saying China appeared set to maintain the rare-earth curbs introduced in the spring, and businesses expecting more rocky times ahead for U.S.-China commerce. Gold rose, while oil fell.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>U.S. futures for the S&amp;P 500 were up 0.6% and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1% after both indexes closed lower Thursday following earnings from Meta Platforms and Microsoft. Tech stocks fell on concerns over increased spending outlooks for the two companies.</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Asia stocks were mostly lower, except Japan's Nikkei which closed up 2.1% after data indicated the economy is showing signs of improvement. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.8% lower, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.4%.</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>All major indexes in Europe were lower, with London's FTSE down 0.3% and Germany's DAX 0.4% lower. France's CAC 40 was down 0.15% and the Stoxx 600 fell 0.4%, lead by the technology sector which was down 0.9%. Bucking the trend were Fuchs and Puig which were up 9.5% and 7.9%, respectively after third-quarter earnings.</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>U.S. Treasury yields edged higher in Asian trade across the curve except for the two-year maturity, but moves were overall small after this week's major central-bank policy decisions. The two-year Treasury yield was down 0.1 basis point at 3.612%, while the 10-year yield rose 1.2bps to 4.103%, according to Tradeweb.</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Eurozone government bond yields rose in early trade, absorbing the European Central Bank's policy meeting on Thursday. The ECB left the key interest rates unchanged, as expected, and sounded relatively relaxed about the eurozone's growth outlook. The 10-year German Bund yield rose 0.8bp to 2.646%, according to Tradeweb.</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The dollar remained higher, supported by reduced bets for another interest-rate cut in December after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said it was far from a done deal. The Fed delivered a widely expected 25-basis-point rate cut on Wednesday. The DXY dollar index rose 0.1% to 99.658, close to the three-month high of 99.724 reached Thursday.</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Bitcoin recovered marginally but remains below the key $110,000 level following losses sustained overnight after a tech-led selloff in U.S. stocks. Reduced market bets for another interest-rate cut by the Fed in December also weighed on risk appetite. Bitcoin rose 1.9% to $109,559 after reaching a one-and-a-half-week low of $106,396 late Thursday, LSEG data show.</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Gold prices rose in early trading as investors digest the trade deal between the U.S. and China and the Fed's hawkish tone on December interest-rate cuts. Futures in New York are up 0.4% to $4,032.10 a troy ounce after retreating back below the $4,000 mark earlier this week, and are now set for monthly gains of more than 4%.</span></li></ul><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Oil prices were headed for a monthly loss of nearly 3% ahead of Sunday's OPEC+ meeting. In early trade, Brent crude and WTI both slipped 0.6% to $63.98 and $60.20 a barrel, respectively. The market has largely priced in a modest output increase of 137,000 barrels a day for December, but concerns over a growing supply glut continue to weigh on sentiment.</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Barcelona Editors at barcelonaeditors@dowjones.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
