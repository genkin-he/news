But the absence of a major tax — such as a sales tax, or levies on corporate or individual income — is a theme of many of the states that top a new ranking of tax policies around the country.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank that often favors policies to reduce or simplify tax burdens, looked at more than 150 variables to compile its annual ranking of the most and least favorable states, published on Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The winner? Wyoming, a sparsely populated western state with no corporate or individual income tax, tops the Tax Foundation's list. South Dakota, a state with a similar profile that also doesn't tax corporate or individual income, is No. 2.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The others in the Tax Foundation's top five also don't impose one or more of the major taxes. New Hampshire and Alaska, which both don't have a statewide sales tax or individual income tax, ranked Nos. 3 and 4, respectively. Florida, which has no individual income tax, ranked No. 5 on the list.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the other end of the spectrum, the Tax Foundation ranked New York the state with the worst tax environment. The researchers cited its high individual income rate, the benefit recapture policy that phases out benefits from lower rates, and the imposition of local taxes in areas like New York City, among other factors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The ranking's methodology weighs factors such as rates and complexity and groups the variables it considers into the five categories of corporate taxes, individual income taxes, sales and excise taxes, property and wealth taxes, and unemployment insurance taxes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Tax Foundation dinged the second-lowest ranked state, New Jersey, for levying taxes in all the major categories, \"typically at high rates and significant levels of complexity.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The group awarded California the third-lowest spot on the list, followed by Connecticut and Maryland.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It cites California's high rates and a tax structure the researchers say is hostile to businesses, including the assessment of corporate tax on certain out-of-state income that would be tax-free in other states. \"The state has a great deal going for it,\" the researchers say, citing California's research universities, moderate climate, and Silicon Valley, \"but a tax code that is uncompetitive and threatens to get worse is increasingly driving jobs to other states.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Connecticut gets a poor score both because of its high rates and an individual tax code that is \"one of the most complex\" and progressive in the country, the analysts say.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Maryland has one of the most progressive individual tax codes in the country, and state lawmakers recently created two new tax brackets for the highest earners, according to the Tax Foundation's analysis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Among the states the Tax Foundation deems most favorable, Wyoming and South Dakota, Nos. 1 and 2, are the only two states that don't tax corporate or individual income and don't impose a gross receipts tax, which applies to a company's gross sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The analysts lauded New Hampshire for taking steps to make its corporate tax structure more competitive and noted that it phased out taxes on interest and dividends at the beginning of this year, \"further solidifying the state's competitive standing.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alaska ranks highly due to its lack of individual income tax and sales tax, but the Tax Foundation notes that it could improve its policy framework by lowering corporate and property taxes and blocking cities and boroughs from setting their own sales-tax rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Tax Foundation credits Florida for not imposing an individual income-tax rate and having a reasonable corporate rate, as well as a sales tax rate that is lower than many other southern states.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Nexperia said it is financially independent of Wingtech and it does not raise capital from Wingtech, the letter showed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A spokesperson for Nexperia confirmed it sent the letter and the company could not comment further.

He was detained in April over comments criticising the judiciary and describing the country's judges as working \"with a knife to their heads\".   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     Tunisian authorities said the remark was a threat, while Souab’s defence said it referred to the political pressure faced by the judiciary.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     \"Five years in prison, for what? For a figurative phrase, a spontaneous expression that everyone understood as symbolic, except the authorities. Ahmed Souab is imprisoned in our place,\" said his lawyer Sami Ben Ghazi.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     This week,     three prominent NGOs     announced that the authorities had suspended their activities over alleged foreign funding — a move they described as an attempt to silence the strong voice of     civil society    .  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     Since Saied seized wide-ranging powers in 2021, dissolving parliament and ruling by decree, opponents say he has destroyed the independence of the judiciary.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     He dissolved the Supreme Judicial Council and sacked dozens of judges in 2022 — moves that opposition groups and rights advocates condemned as a coup.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     Most opposition leaders are in prison on various charges, including Rached Ghannouchi, head of the opposition Ennahda party, and Abir Moussi, leader of the Free Constitutional Party.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>     Saied denies using the judiciary against his political opponents and says he is cleansing the country of what he calls traitors and corrupt figures, adding that judges who acquit them are their accomplices. He says he will not be a dictator.  </span></p></span></div></div>",
