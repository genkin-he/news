Typically, a stronger U.S. dollar makes U.S. grain exports less attractive for global customers versus the exports of other countries. Seemingly outweighing this uptick in the dollar is the desire of traders to get their books in order ahead of the weekend, said Brady Huck of Advance Trading.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Next Episode: The agricultural market is now looking past the U.S.-China deal and spent the day searching for the next major mover of futures. \"Grain action and volume slowed considerably overnight with the U.S.-China trade deal having come and gone,\" said Matt Zeller of StoneX in a note. Zeller adds that with the government shut down, it will be difficult for traders and analysts to get confirmation of whether or not China is following through with promised purchases, although reports of cargoes did circulate today.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>INSIGHT</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Going the Distance: Some analysts are unsure if soybean purchasing under the pending U.S.-China trade truce will take place as promised, even amid reports of Chinese buyers securing some new soybean cargoes. One reason is because there are no penalties described to enforce China's purchasing of 12 million metric tons of soybeans in this marketing year, along with 25 million tons of soybeans annually for the following three years. \"Whether China secures 25 MMTs in future years depends on the price relationships between South America and the U.S.\" AgResource said in a note. \"China buys what China needs at the cheapest price offered — it's that simple.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dried Out: The U.S. Drought Monitor, which has remained in operation through the government shutdown, is showing dryness spread throughout the eastern Corn Belt states. Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri all have small pockets of extreme or exceptional drought, according to the latest map, but also large areas of dry conditions ranging from abnormally dry to severe drought. The USDA's Crop Progress report has not been published since late September, so traders and analysts are unsure of crop conditions through the harvest — but the dryness likely hasn't helped those conditions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>AHEAD</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Note: The government shutdown is impacting the timing of USDA reports and data releases.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Zoetis Inc. will release its third quarter earnings report at 7 a.m. ET Tuesday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Mosaic Co. will release its third quarter earnings report after the  stock market closes on Tuesday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Tyson Foods Co. will release its fourth quarter earnings report at 7:30 a.m. ET Monday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Kirk Maltais at kirk.maltais@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

Saefong</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The crude-oil market is seeing a 'rare occasion' where supply risks are more focused on the Americas</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Any potential U.S. strike on Venezuela's military sites could pave the way for Venezuela's elected government to return to power - and that raises significant risks for oil markets, said the Price Futures Group's Phil Flynn.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Escalating U.S. tensions with Venezuela and an upcoming monthly decision by major oil producers on crude output targets were the focus of traders heading into the weekend.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. plans to attack military installations inside Venezuela and the strikes could come at any moment, the Miami Herald reported Friday, citing sources with knowledge of the situation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In response to the report, White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly told MarketWatch in an email that \"unnamed sources don't know what they're talking about. Any announcements regarding Venezuela policy would come directly from the President.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Still, oil prices found some support in the wake of the news report of potential strikes, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery (CLZ25) (CL.1) edging up by 0.6% to $60.93 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices were still trading lower for the week and have declined for the month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Although the U.S. already has certain sanctions on Venezuela in place, \"those do not impact physical [oil] production and transport in the same way that possible damage from military activity could,\" Colin Cieszynski, portfolio manager and chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management, told MarketWatch. \"So this appears to be forcing investors to adjust their supply-risk expectations.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This is a \"rare occasion,\" Cieszynski noted, where \"supply risks are more focused in the Americas.\" He pointed out that U.S. crude prices were up a bit more than global benchmark Brent crude, which saw its January contract (BRNF26) - which becomes the front month at the end of the session - move up by 0.4% to $64.62 on ICE Futures Europe.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A U.S. strike on Venezuela's military sites would potentially pave the way for Venezuela's elected government to return to power, said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group. \"This raises significant risks for oil markets, particularly diesel, as supplies are already low and Venezuelan heavy oil is an important source.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The situation, meanwhile, could overshadow concerns about the recent sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft Oil Company and Lukoil OAO, said Flynn.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Oil traders also are anticipating the latest decision by the major oil producers known as OPEC+ over the weekend. The group plans to hold its monthly meeting on Sunday and is expected to decide on production targets for the month of December.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the last meeting in early October, OPEC+ agreed to increase production in November by another 137,000 barrels a day, despite rising concerns of a global supply glut. The group has been announcing monthly production increases since April.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2026, the global oil market may see an average surplus of 4 million barrels per day, according to reports from the International Energy Agency and World Bank Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read: An oil supply glut could sink prices to $35 a barrel next year. Why the U.S.-China trade truce won't change that.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the short term, analysts were expecting oil officials to announce a similar rise of 137,000 barrels per day in production targets, said David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But long term, it looks as if the oil market wants to go lower, retesting the double bottom from this past May of $55 front-month WTI, he said in emailed comments to MarketWatch Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The reason is simply the ongoing slowdown in global demand growth, against recent reports that there will be a supply overhang of around 4 million bpd next year,\" said Morrison. \"That could be countered by U.S. sanctions on Rosneft/Lukoil, but I don't think traders put much store in the effectiveness of sanctions. Maybe this time it's different.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Myra P. Saefong</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

But the absence of a major tax — such as a sales tax, or levies on corporate or individual income — is a theme of many of the states that top a new ranking of tax policies around the country.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank that often favors policies to reduce or simplify tax burdens, looked at more than 150 variables to compile its annual ranking of the most and least favorable states, published on Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The winner? Wyoming, a sparsely populated western state with no corporate or individual income tax, tops the Tax Foundation's list. South Dakota, a state with a similar profile that also doesn't tax corporate or individual income, is No. 2.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The others in the Tax Foundation's top five also don't impose one or more of the major taxes. New Hampshire and Alaska, which both don't have a statewide sales tax or individual income tax, ranked Nos. 3 and 4, respectively. Florida, which has no individual income tax, ranked No. 5 on the list.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the other end of the spectrum, the Tax Foundation ranked New York the state with the worst tax environment. The researchers cited its high individual income rate, the benefit recapture policy that phases out benefits from lower rates, and the imposition of local taxes in areas like New York City, among other factors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The ranking's methodology weighs factors such as rates and complexity and groups the variables it considers into the five categories of corporate taxes, individual income taxes, sales and excise taxes, property and wealth taxes, and unemployment insurance taxes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Tax Foundation dinged the second-lowest ranked state, New Jersey, for levying taxes in all the major categories, \"typically at high rates and significant levels of complexity.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The group awarded California the third-lowest spot on the list, followed by Connecticut and Maryland.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It cites California's high rates and a tax structure the researchers say is hostile to businesses, including the assessment of corporate tax on certain out-of-state income that would be tax-free in other states. \"The state has a great deal going for it,\" the researchers say, citing California's research universities, moderate climate, and Silicon Valley, \"but a tax code that is uncompetitive and threatens to get worse is increasingly driving jobs to other states.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Connecticut gets a poor score both because of its high rates and an individual tax code that is \"one of the most complex\" and progressive in the country, the analysts say.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Maryland has one of the most progressive individual tax codes in the country, and state lawmakers recently created two new tax brackets for the highest earners, according to the Tax Foundation's analysis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Among the states the Tax Foundation deems most favorable, Wyoming and South Dakota, Nos. 1 and 2, are the only two states that don't tax corporate or individual income and don't impose a gross receipts tax, which applies to a company's gross sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The analysts lauded New Hampshire for taking steps to make its corporate tax structure more competitive and noted that it phased out taxes on interest and dividends at the beginning of this year, \"further solidifying the state's competitive standing.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alaska ranks highly due to its lack of individual income tax and sales tax, but the Tax Foundation notes that it could improve its policy framework by lowering corporate and property taxes and blocking cities and boroughs from setting their own sales-tax rates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Tax Foundation credits Florida for not imposing an individual income-tax rate and having a reasonable corporate rate, as well as a sales tax rate that is lower than many other southern states.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
