It has 525 member organizations from around the world and 106 associate members.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dr. Preziosi was elected to serve for the 2025-29 term this week at the 28th CoNGO General Assembly, which took place in New York with the virtual participation of organizations from around the world. He succeeds the Rev. Dr. Liberato C. Bautista, the main representative to the UN for the General Board of Church and Society of The United Methodist Church, who has served as CoNGO's President since 2017 and also held the post from 2007 to 2011.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>TruMerit has been a member of CoNGO since 2018 and is active in the organization's affairs, having served as the organization's Secretary to the CoNGO Board and as chair of its Membership Committee.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dr. Preziosi is the first Registered Nurse to serve as CoNGO President. He is a nonprofit executive who since early 2023 has led TruMerit, formerly known as CGFNS International, a health workforce development organization committed to advancing the ethical mobility and professional growth of health workers worldwide. Previously, he was employed by the World Health Organization to help establish its technology-driven global learning center, the WHO Academy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dr. Bautista, the former President of CoNGO, extended his warm congratulations to Dr. Preziosi on his election. \"His experience at TruMerit and at WHO, coupled with his profound dedication to multilateralism and his engagement with civil society, provide a basis for optimism regarding CoNGO's future. In an era where the voice and influence of civil society are of paramount importance in shaping a shared future that upholds human dignity and rights, as well as planetary sustainability, Dr. Preziosi's leadership is expected to enhance CoNGO's role as a pivotal supporter and advocate for democratic and equitable participation within the United Nations and beyond,\" he stated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"CoNGO has long been a vital convener of NGOs, a bridge between civil society and an advocate for their engagement at the United Nations, as well as a steadfast champion of inclusive multilateralism - a concept that, unfortunately, is increasingly under attack,\" said Preziosi.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"In response, let us assert civil society participation at the United Nations not as a plea, but as a principle - one that is essential to legitimate, effective, and ethical multilateralism, and thereby is critical to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals and adherence to the rule of law,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About CoNGO (Conference of Non-Governmental Organizations in Consultative Relationship with the United Nations)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Conference of Non-Governmental Organizations in Consultative Relationship with the United Nations (CoNGO) is an independent, international membership association founded in 1948, the year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jamie McGeever</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell surprised many market-watchers on Wednesday when he declared that another interest rate cut in December was not a slam dunk. Perhaps even more surprising was his apparent suggestion that if boosting the labor market is the goal, rate cuts might not be that useful. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the press conference after the central bank lowered its fed funds policy target range by 25 basis points, Powell cited several reasons why a similar move in December is \"far from\" a done deal. These included \"strongly different\" views among rate-setters, limited data visibility due to the government shutdown, above-target inflation, and doubts about how quickly the labor market is slowing. He also noted that policy may be close to neutral after 150 basis points of easing. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But perhaps the most telling reason was the most simple: cutting rates won't work. At least, doing so won't address the current problem, which is supporting the softening labor market. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alluding to this, Powell admitted that the job market is weakening primarily because of shrinking labor supply rather than cooling demand for workers. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But lower borrowing costs are designed to boost demand for workers. If the job market's problems are \"mostly\" a function of labor supply, as Powell said, then cutting interest rates is akin to pushing on a string.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"So the question then is what does our tool do, which supports demand? Some people argue that this is supply, and we really can't affect it much with our tools. But others argue, as I do, that ... we should use our tools to support the labor market when we see this happening,\" Powell told reporters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It's a complicated situation.\" </span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1061.3827993254638px;aspect-ratio:1.7689713322091063\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3WB0XC-aa1c88068fe19d0b2ca56a7ba93ca3b4-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"chart\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3WB0XC-aa1c88068fe19d0b2ca56a7ba93ca3b4-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#d4dbe2\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-S5VA5POt\"><span class=\"copyright-S5VA5POt\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-S5VA5POt\">US payrolls breakeven estimates - Dallas Fed</span></figcaption></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:880.1652892561983px;aspect-ratio:1.4669421487603307\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3WB0XC-289c494539f4f3d1bcc9e74fd7ea5b5a-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"The bar chart shows U.S. non-farm payrolls for one year ending August 2025.\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/tag:reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3WB0XC-289c494539f4f3d1bcc9e74fd7ea5b5a-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#392d24\"/></picture></div><figcaption class=\"caption-S5VA5POt\"><span class=\"copyright-S5VA5POt\">Thomson Reuters</span><span class=\"description-S5VA5POt\">No jobs data</span></figcaption></figure></span></p><p class=\"\"><span>'K-SHAPED' ECONOMY</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The current U.S. economic picture is indeed complicated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Job growth has slowed in the U.S. over the past year, but this has been offset by a steep decline in the number of people looking for work. That's a result of the tighter immigration controls, increased deportations, and both young people and retirees leaving the labor force. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the last official monthly jobs report, which was for August, the unemployment rate climbed to a four-year high of 4.3%. But that's only one tenth of a percentage point up on the previous year, and is still ultra-low by historical standards. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Powell also said there's no evidence of a worrisome deterioration in the broader labor market, though the recent announcement of some high-profile corporate layoffs may suggest otherwise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, economic indicators such as business investment and retail sales still appear fairly healthy. Both are strongly linked to the booming stock market - big companies' rising share price and profits fund their capex, and the asset-owning top 10% continue to drive around half of all U.S. consumer spending. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What we appear to see taking shape is a so-called 'K-shaped' economy: the rich are getting richer from the asset price boom, while the rest are struggling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This curious balance is new for the Fed and a tricky one to navigate, especially with the government shutdown reducing visibility even further.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Just as the Fed's blunt interest rate tool doesn't fix supply-side issues in the jobs market, it may not do much to support lower-income households and individuals either, even though ensuring a stronger labor market is the \"best thing\" the Fed can do for the American people. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cheaper money is also likely to benefit the richest cohorts by inflating asset prices even more, which may also push already lofty valuations to unsustainable levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Six weeks is a long way off, but a third successive rate cut in December is suddenly in the balance. If the subtext of Powell's press conference is anything to go by, that may be for the best.    </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Enjoying this column?

Data released earlier showed consumer inflation in Tokyo, excluding volatile fresh food prices, climbed 2.8% in October from a year earlier, exceeding economists' expectations for a 2.6% increase. The Tokyo figures are considered an early indicator of nationwide trends. Another price-negative factor for the JGB market is the yen's latest weakness, which typically boosts Japan's import prices and leads to higher inflation. Ten-year JGB futures are 0.11 yen lower at 136.10 yen. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

Adjusted for $22 million of asset impairments and restructuring costs, and $5 million of tax valuation allowance reserve, partially offset by $4 million of sale leaseback transaction gain, adjusted net income was $3 million or approximately $0.27 per diluted share.(1)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Neal Lux, President and Chief Executive Officer, remarked, \"Our team achieved another strong quarter, demonstrating why FET is a great company and even better investment. We extended our track record of outperformance, delivered significant capital returns, and believe we remain an incredible value while poised for long-term growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Our 'Beat the Market' strategy drove strong bookings and meaningful backlog growth. Revenue and EBITDA were at the high end of our guidance range. Our commercial and product development efforts allowed us to grow market share in a challenging environment. In addition, we exceeded free cash flow expectations and are raising 2025 guidance to between $70 and $80 million.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"By utilizing our global footprint, we generated strong bookings in the offshore and international markets, increasing backlog 21%. In addition, we accelerated cost savings efforts in the quarter, extending our annualized target by 50% to $15 million. We forecast fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA in the range of $19 to $23 million. Looking further ahead, we expect that our strong backlog, anticipated market share gains, and cost reductions will provide a tailwind in 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"FET executed significant capital returns through further net debt reductions and share repurchases. We achieved our expected year-end net leverage ratio of 1.3 times ahead of schedule. Year-to-date through September, we repurchased 8% of our outstanding shares. Even after this year's stock price appreciation of around 100%, we believe FET's free cash flow yield remains attractive.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>____________________ </span><br/><span>(1) See Tables 1-7 for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial </span><br/><span>information, including a breakdown of adjusting items.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Segment Results (unless otherwise noted, comparisons are third quarter 2025 versus second quarter 2025)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Drilling and Completions segment revenue was $117 million, flat sequentially. Strong sales of wireline products, heat transfer units, coiled line pipe, and subsea ROVs were offset by lower consumable product sales. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $12 million, a 3% increase, due to favorable product mix and cost savings. Book-to-bill was 129% with strong orders for ROVs, drilling capital equipment, wireline cables, and heat transfer units. The Drilling and Completions segment provides consumable products and capital equipment for drilling, subsea, coiled tubing, wireline, and stimulation markets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Artificial Lift and Downhole segment revenue was $79 million, a 4% decrease. Lower downhole casing equipment and processing technologies sales drove a decrease that was partially offset by higher revenue from valve and sand control products. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $17 million, a 2% increase, due to favorable product mix and cost savings. Book-to-bill was 112%, with awards for sand control products to support an extended drilling program for a large Canadian customer. The Artificial Lift and Downhole segment engineers, manufactures, and supplies products for well construction, artificial lift, and oil and natural gas processing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>FET(R) is a global manufacturing company, serving the oil, natural gas, industrial and renewable energy industries.
