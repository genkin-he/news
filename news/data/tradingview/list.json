Areddy and Yoko Kubota</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney spent much of his first six months in office trying to persuade the U.S. to lower tariffs on Canadian goods. With hopes for a speedy resolution now dashed, Carney is turning to America's biggest rival, China.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Carney is expected to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday at the APEC leaders summit in South Korea. It will be the first official meeting between the two countries' leaders since 2017, when Justin Trudeau was Canada's prime minister, and marks a significant thaw in a relationship that has been mired in acrimony for several years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Repairing relations with China has become a priority for Carney, who is seeking other markets to offset the damage caused by U.S. tariffs on Canadian exports like steel, aluminum and lumber. Canada is trying to reopen the Chinese market to agricultural products like canola oil, pork and seafood, on which China has imposed tariffs in retaliation for Canadian duties on its electric vehicles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This is our second-largest trading partner. This is the second-largest economy in the world,\" said Carney on Monday, explaining why he thinks Canada needs a pragmatic approach to engagement with China. \"This is one of the most influential actors in terms of the global system such as it is, and it is a country with whom we had no senior-level contact for seven years.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The price of better relations with China may not be cheap. To get tariffs on agricultural exports lifted, China has demanded that Canada lower a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles. That would put Canada in the position of having to choose farmers over its auto industry, which would suffer if cheap Chinese vehicles came into the market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Give it to the Chinese, they are pretty good at weaponizing some of these relationships,\" said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels think tank.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While the leaders of Canada's canola-producing provinces have supported the EV-for-canola tariff, Carney has so far been noncommittal. He cautioned that a deal with China on electric cars could hurt its dealings with the U.S. \"It's not that simple,\" he said, earlier this month. \"Nor is the relationship in the auto sector that simple as just open the door to China here with no impact on the relationship with the United States.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Canada has had little official contact with China since 2018, when Canada detained Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. request. China then arrested two Canadians, and it took a complex swap in 2021 to break the stalemate. Relations never fully recovered.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Canada has since accused China of interfering in its elections, restricted Chinese investments in infrastructure and mining projects and accused the country of acting as an \"increasingly disruptive global power\" in a report on Canada's Indo-Pacific strategy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>China has appeared to seize on President Trump's arrival in the White House-and his tariffs and calls to turn Canada into the 51st state-as an opening to mend fences with Ottawa. Beijing responded positively to Justin Trudeau's exit as prime minister in March. In June, Carney spoke by telephone with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, and the two met in New York in September.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In recent months, Canada has begun exporting natural gas to China and referring to it as a \"strategic partner.\" Beijing has said there is \"positive momentum\" between the two countries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"They are facing the same pressure, the same sanctions, the same tactics and restrictions imposed by the U.S. unilaterally,\" Wang Huiyao, president of Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization, said of China and Canada. \"I'm sure they have a lot of common feelings.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Canada's warming relationship with China stands in contrast to its rocky ride with the U.S. Canada has been trying to persuade the U.S. to lower 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, but talks between the countries were scuttled last week after Trump became angry at an anti-tariff television commercial sponsored by the Canadian province of Ontario. The U.S. ambassador to Canada, Pete Hoekstra, on Monday said in a local television interview that \"Canada burned the bridges with America.\" In Asia this week for meetings with regional leaders, Trump also closed the door to further talks with Carney. \"I'm not going to be meeting with him for a while,\" he said to reporters on Air Force One.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Chinese officials have been more positive. Earlier this month, China's ambassador to Canada, Wang Di, sent overtures to Canada. \"China has always regarded Canada as a friend and partner, and is willing to move forward with Canada,\" he wrote in an opinion piece in the Ottawa-based publication the Hill Times.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Some former Canadian officials cautioned that Carney could find dealing with China as challenging as dealing with the U.S., despite the recent softening in tone.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"My one big warning is, tread carefully when dealing with China,\" said Brian Clow, former deputy chief of staff for Trudeau. China can be as ruthless in negotiations as the Trump administration, he said, noting that Beijing also uses tariffs to punish other countries.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shi Yinhong, a distinguished professor at Renmin University of China, said the Carney-Xi meeting is unlikely to result in major breakthroughs, though the two leaders could agree on smaller points. Canada would have limitations on the scope of any trade deal, Shi said. \"Canadians will say that, even if Trump is not good, I will not agree with China's positions,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Also complicating things for Carney is Trump. The U.S. insisted that the U.S., Mexico, Canada free-trade agreement that was negotiated during Trump's first term include a clause that effectively barred any of the countries from signing agreements with \"nonmarket economies,\" a description aimed specifically at China, said Clow.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If the Canadian government thinks it's going to all of a sudden do a big deal with China, it should think again,\" Clow said. \"The Americans won't let them.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Vipal Monga at [vipal.monga@wsj.com], James T.

Its oil-equivalent production — a metric that includes products like natural gas — is on track to grow to 5.4 million barrels a day by 2030, from 4.3 million in 2024. Shares are up 8% this year even though oil prices are down.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company is expected to report $1.82 of earnings per share, down from $1.92 in the same quarter last year. Results should be hurt by low oil prices, but helped by strong refining margins.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Exxon may need to make some tough decisions if international oil prices fall into the $50 range, however. They have dropped about 14% this year to a recent $64 per barrel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

(the \"Company\") </span><span>, the holding company for Somerset Regal Bank (the \"Bank\"), announced net income of $693,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2025 (unaudited), or $0.09 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (unaudited). Excluding $303,000 of net accretion income related to fair value adjustments resulting from the acquisition of Regal Bank in September 2023, net income would have been $475,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2025. Excluding $1.0 million of net accretion income related to fair value adjustments resulting from the acquisition of Regal Bank in September 2023, net income would have been $627,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" contained herein for additional information.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total assets were $1.11 billion at September 30, 2025, an increase of $25.7 million, or 2.4%, from $1.08 billion at June 30, 2025. Net loans were $826.4 million, an increase of $29.2 million, or 3.7%, from $797.2 million at June 30, 2025. Total deposits were $869.6 million, an increase of $23.6 million, or 2.8%, from $846.0 million at June 30, 2025. The increase in loans was funded primarily through increased deposits and an additional $5.0 million of borrowings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>General. Net income decreased $674,000, or 49.3%, to $693,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to net income of $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 included $303,000 and $1.0 million, respectively, of net accretion income related to fair value adjustments resulting from the acquisition of Regal Bank in September 2023.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interest Income.  Interest income increased $468,000, or 4.1%, to $11.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from $11.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to a $50.6 million increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets, offset by a 6 basis point decrease in the yield. The increase resulted from a $609,000, or 5.9%, increase in interest income on loans, offset by a $64,000, or 12.3%, decrease in interest income on interest-bearing deposits at other banks and a $77,000, or 11.6%, decrease in interest income on securities. The increase in interest income on loans was due to a $60.7 million increase in the average balance of loans from $748.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to $809.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, offset by an 11 basis point decrease in the yield on loans. The decrease in interest income on securities was primarily due to a $14.5 million decrease in the average balance of securities resulting from maturities and repayments. The decrease in interest income on interest-bearing deposits at other banks was due to a 107 basis point decrease in the yield.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased $467,000, or 12.1%, to $4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from $3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to a $55.1 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and an nine basis point increase in the cost. The increase in the average balance was primarily due to a $22.6 million, or 187.4%, increase in the average balance of borrowings for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024 and an increase of $61.4 million, or 22.5%, in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits.  The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase of 51 basis points in the cost of interest-bearing deposits to 1.87% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from 1.36% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as the Bank raised rates on certain interest-bearing deposit products in an effort to remain competitive in the market area, offset by a 50 basis point decrease in the average rate of certificates of deposit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Net Interest Income.  Net interest income was $7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively. Net interest rate spread decreased 14 basis points to 2.56% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from 2.70% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Net interest margin decreased 16 basis points to 3.05% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from 3.21% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Net interest-earning assets decreased $4.5 million, or 2.0%, to $219.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from $223.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in the Bank's net interest rate spread and net interest margin were primarily a result of the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increasing while the yield on interest-earning assets decreased.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Provision for Credit Losses.  The Bank establishes provisions for credit losses, which are charged to operations to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level it considers necessary to absorb probable credit losses attributable to loans that are reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date. In determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Bank considers, among other factors, past and current loss experience, evaluations of real estate collateral, economic conditions, the type and volume of lending, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's repayment capacity, while adjusting for delinquency trends, classified or criticized loans, and other risk factors. The allowance is developed using reasonable and supportable forecasts and quantitative modeling techniques, combined with qualitative factors to address risks not captured in historical data, including emerging loan products or localized economic changes. Actual losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change. The Bank assesses the allowance for credit losses and records provisions for credit losses in the income statement on a quarterly basis.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Bank recorded a provision for credit losses of $171,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2025 reflecting the loan growth during the period, compared to a recovery for credit losses of $154,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting updates made to the risk levels of certain qualitative factors in the calculation of the Bank's allowance. The Bank had no charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2025 or 2024. The Bank had no non-performing loans at September 30, 2025 and $9,000 of non-performing loans at September 30, 2024. The Bank's allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.67% at September 30, 2025 compared to 0.66% at September 30, 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Noninterest Income.  Noninterest income decreased $236,000, or 29.5%, to $565,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from $801,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in other income of $123,000 and a decrease in service charges and fees of $66,000 primarily due to a lower volume of account fees and card charges incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Noninterest Expense.  Noninterest expense increased $275,000, or 4.0%, to $7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from $6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a $613,000, or 18.9%, increase in salaries and employee benefits expense primarily driven by the recognition of stock-based compensation during the three months ended September 30, 2025, whereas no such expense was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was offset by a decrease of $210,000 in other expenses, driven by a decrease of $71,000 in the amortization expense of fair value adjustments resulting from the acquisition of Regal Bank in September 2023, a decrease of $96,000 in occupancy expenses due to the closure of a retail branch location and a decrease of $89,000 in data processing fees.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Income Tax Expense.  The provision for income taxes was $202,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $363,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Bank's effective tax rate was 22.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 21.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The higher effective tax rate in 2025 related to the non-deductibility of expenses recognized related to incentive stock options.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2025 and June 30, 2025</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Assets . Assets increased $25.7 million, or 2.4%, to $1.11 billion at September 30, 2025 from $1.08 billion at June 30, 2025. The increase was primarily driven by new loan originations, resulting in a net increase of $29.2 million in loans receivable, offset by a $3.6 million decrease in securities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cash and Cash Equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents increased $526,000, or 0.9%, to $58.3 million at September 30, 2025 from $57.8 million at June 30, 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Securities. Securities held-to-maturity decreased $3.6 million, or 2.5%, to $138.2 million at September 30, 2025 from $141.8 million at June 30, 2025. The decrease was primarily due to principal repayments and maturities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Loans. Loans receivable, net, increased $29.2 million, or 3.7%, to $826.4 million at September 30, 2025 from $797.2 million at June 30, 2025, driven by residential mortgage loan growth of $12.5 million and commercial loan growth of $16.0 million as a result of strong market demand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Deposits. Deposits increased $23.6 million, or 2.8%, to $869.6 million at September 30, 2025 from $846.0 million at June 30, 2025. Increases in interest-bearing deposit accounts resulted from the Bank having raised rates on certain money market and time deposit accounts in an effort to remain competitive in the market area. At September 30, 2025, $116.9 million, or 13.4%, of total deposits consisted of noninterest-bearing deposits. At September 30, 2025, $168.2 million, or 19.3%, of total deposits were uninsured.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Borrowings. During the quarter ended September 30, 2025, the Bank borrowed an additional $5.0 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York to provide additional liquidity to fund new loans. At September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Bank had $35.0 million and $30.0 million in outstanding borrowings, respectively.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Equity. Equity decreased $1.8 million, or 1.0%, to $191.9 million at September 30, 2025 from $193.8 million at June 30, 2025. The decrease was primarily due to the repurchase of 198,310 shares of common stock at a cost of $2.9 million, partially offset by net earnings of $693,000. All repurchased shares of common stock were retired upon acquisition and are no longer outstanding.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About Somerset Regal Bank</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Somerset Regal Bank is a full-service New Jersey commercial bank headquartered in Bound Brook, New Jersey that operates 14 branches in Essex, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union Counties, New Jersey.
