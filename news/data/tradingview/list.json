Mast cell activation plays a central role in the onset and progression of CSU. While the goal of CSU treatment is the complete absence of symptoms, the vast majority of patients today, even those receiving the most advanced approved and available therapies, continue to suffer from itch, hives, swelling, sleep disruption, and unrelenting anxiety about when the next flare up will occur.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Chronic Inducible Urticaria (CIndU), Cold Urticaria (ColdU), Symptomatic Dermographism (SD)</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>CIndU is characterized by the occurrence of hives or wheals that have an attributable trigger associated with them. ColdU symptoms include itching, burning wheals/hives and angioedema when skin is exposed to cold temperatures. SD symptoms include the development of wheals in response to stroking, scratching or rubbing of the skin. For these diseases, mast cell activation leading to release of soluble mediators is thought to be the driving mechanism leading to the wheals and other symptoms. There are currently no approved therapies for chronic inducible urticarias other than antihistamines and patients attempt to manage symptoms associated with their disease through avoidance of triggers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Barzolvolimab</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Barzolvolimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with a completely novel mechanism of action that targets mast cells by binding with high specificity to a unique part of the KIT receptor and potently inhibiting its activity. The KIT receptor is abundantly expressed by mast cells and critical for their function and survival. Mast cells are drivers of inflammatory responses such as hypersensitivity and allergic reactions and, in certain inflammatory diseases, such as chronic urticarias, mast cell activation plays a central role in the onset and progression of the disease. Based on data from robust, randomized, placebo controlled Phase 2 studies, barzolvolimab has significant potential as a first-in-class and best-in-disease treatment option for patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), cold urticaria (ColdU) and symptomatic dermographism (SD). Barzolvolimab is currently being studied in Phase 3 studies in CSU and ColdU/SD and Phase 2 studies in prurigo nodularis (PN) and atopic dermatitis (AD), with additional indications planned for the future.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Celldex </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Celldex is pioneering new horizons in immunology to deliver life-changing therapies.

The appointment strengthens MAX’s nationwide coverage while supporting structured, sustainable dealer growth across the platform.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>TRL Outdoors brings substantial industry experience, having previously represented Hydra-Trek and Land Tamer, manufacturers of industrial-grade amphibious vehicles with pricing that typically began above $100,000 and frequently exceeded $150,000. This experience positions TRL Outdoors to introduce MAX vehicles to customers historically served by significantly higher-priced industrial platforms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As part of the agreement, the Company and TRL Outdoors have established quarterly performance milestones focused on measurable dealer onboarding, market penetration, and brand expansion. Management believes this milestone-based structure supports meaningful expansion while maintaining operational discipline and long-term sustainability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“This agreement aligns with our strategy of expanding deliberately and building a high-quality dealer network,” said Andrew Lapp, CEO of Recreatives Industries. “TRL Outdoors has firsthand experience selling premium amphibious vehicles into demanding commercial environments. Their understanding of dealer development, combined with MAX’s proven designs and compelling value proposition, positions us well as we expand into new regions and applications.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company expects TRL Outdoors to assist in expanding MAX’s presence in utility, industrial, and commercial sectors as the MAX 4 and Buffalo models become available. Management believes MAX vehicles offer a compelling value proposition for these markets by delivering capable amphibious performance at a substantially lower cost than many legacy industrial platforms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This appointment supports Recreatives Industries’ broader strategy of strengthening its dealer network, expanding into new market segments, and positioning the MAX brand for disciplined long-term growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To receive frequent updates, follow Recreatives Industries, Inc.:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Facebook: facebook.com/maxatv</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On X (formerly Twitter): x.com/recreativesind</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>MAX Mailing List: maxatvs.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To learn more about MAX ATVs and for general inquiries, visit www.maxatvs.com or contact 1-800-255-2511.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Recreatives Industries, Inc.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>RECREATIVES INDUSTRIES, INC. (\"RECX\") is the manufacturer of MAX amphibious six-wheel-drive (6x6) all-terrain vehicles (www.maxatvs.com), originally manufactured by Recreatives Industries Inc. of Buffalo, NY, from 1970 to 2013. RECX is continuing MAX's brand legacy of 53 years by relaunching the entire MAX ATV product line from existing, proven designs, which will ensure a rapid re-entry into the global ATV and UTV. Beyond traditional MAX ATV production, RECX plans to diversify its product line by introducing new vehicles and products to market in a compressed timeframe. The company's planned diversification includes larger eight-wheeled vehicles (8x8) as well as electric vehicle (EV) drivetrains to draw on recent advancements in battery and drive motor technology, which make fitment in smaller vehicles possible. RECX management believes that electric vehicles can ultimately offer performance that exceeds that of the traditional mechanical transmissions that most all-terrain vehicles employ.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Safe Harbor</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>This news release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, intended to be covered by the \"safe harbor\" created by those sections.

The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV, an exchange-traded fund that tracks software stocks, was almost 2%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Concerns have been brewing among investors that AI could do away with the need for workers across sectors, from insurance to wealth management to real estate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors not only worry that AI efficiencies will drive companies to cut costs and head counts; they also fear that fewer employees will directly translate to shrinking demand for traditional software licenses. Many business-software companies sell their products based on customer head count, or on a per-seat basis, and investors are looking carefully at whether software companies will be hit by a decline in these subscriptions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>So when Block (XYZ) announced on Thursday that it is cutting more than 40% of its employees, some analysts interpreted the news as a prequel to a future where AI will replace the workforce. And those fears hit software stocks that were trying to recover after weeks of negative sentiment driven by AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Block job cuts are the latest blow to investor confidence in the software sector's ability to withstand the ongoing threat that AI will dramatically shift the future of work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Monday, software stocks lost over $200 billion in market capitalization after Citrini Research released a blog post depicting a hypothetical future where AI leads to mass layoffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read more: Did a blog post just cause software stocks to lose more than $200 billion in market cap?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Truist Securities analyst Matthew Coad said in a note that Block may be a   \"case study\" for how companies' investments in AI could \"adversely impact employment rates.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>J.P.

The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF looked poised to eke out a small gain for the week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And some of the biggest software-sector declines on Friday seemed largely unrelated to the AI hysteria around Block's layoffs. Shares of Zscaler (ZS) and Elastic NV (ESTC) were losing more than 13% and 15%, respectively, as of midday, while PAR Technology's stock (PAR) was off nearly 30%. All three companies reported earnings on Thursday afternoon that were being poorly received by the market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That said, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a Friday note to clients that he expects the software space to see a \"major comeback\" in the coming months, as investors will recognize that the \"disconnected doomsday software trade\" is \"mispriced.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Hannah Pedone</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>PRFoods’ second quarter of the financial year continued to take place in a challenging economic environment, characterized by weak consumption, price sensitivity, and increased cost pressure. This has particularly affected the Group’s operations in Estonia and nearby markets. At the same time, management has remained focused on core activities, cost control, and strengthening the financial structure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the second quarter of the financial year, the Group’s revenue amounted to EUR 5.1 million, decreasing by EUR 1.7 million, or 25%, compared to the same period last year. The decline in revenue was mainly due to lower sales volumes in the Estonian and Finnish markets. Quarterly gross profit was EUR 1.0 million, down 43% year-on-year, reflecting lower production volumes and price pressure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>EBITDA in the second quarter was EUR 0.2 million, below the EUR 0.6 million recorded in the previous financial year. Depreciation expenses remained stable, and operating profit was close to zero, compared to an operating profit of EUR 0.4 million in the previous financial year. The net loss for the second quarter amounted to EUR 0.7 million, compared to a net loss of EUR 0.1 million in the previous financial year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the first half of the year, the Group’s revenue reached EUR 8.7 million, decreasing by EUR 2.7 million, or 23%, compared to the same period of the previous financial year. Gross profit for the six-month period totalled EUR 1.7 million, which is 34% lower than in the previous financial year. EBITDA for the six months amounted to EUR -0.1 million, compared to a positive EUR 0.7 million in the previous financial year. The operating loss amounted to EUR 0.3 million and the net loss to EUR 1.5 million, significantly affected by increased financial expenses related to the restructuring of debt obligations in the previous financial year and lower operating volumes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Geographically, the Group’s sales were mainly concentrated in the United Kingdom market, where six-month revenue amounted to EUR 7.7 million, representing 87.7% of the Group’s total revenue. Compared to the previous financial year, sales in the United Kingdom remained essentially stable. Revenue in the Estonian market declined to EUR 1.0 million during the same period, decreasing by EUR 2.5 million, or more than 70%, clearly reflecting weak consumption in Estonia and nearby markets and pressure in the retail sector.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We are entering the third quarter in continued uncertain market conditions, and a recovery in consumption is not yet visible either in Estonia or in nearby markets. In this environment, management’s priorities are further improving efficiency, controlling the cost base, and managing financial obligations. Activities already initiated to strengthen the Group’s capital structure and long-term sustainability will also be continued.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>KEY

Nvidia beat earnings forecasts, is seeing fast growth for its high-margin data-center chips, and even guided for $78 billion in first-quarter sales — $5 billion above expectations. The stock, however, dropped 9% for the last two days of this week, helping to lead the market lower.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.6% for the week, and was on pace for its worst week since late November, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3% and the S&amp;P 500 index declined 0.8%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The [AI] trade has gotten stretched,\" says Kenny Polcari, veteran trader and chief market strategist at SlateStone Wealth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If only the market didn't have other things to worry about. Private-credit fears have hit financial stocks. January's producer price index revealed hotter-than-expected cost inflation. A U.S. attack on Iran could be in the works. And the administration is increasing base tariffs on imports moving into the U.S.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But ultimately it comes back to earnings, especially profit margins. While nothing in Nvidia's earnings call pointed to slowing data-center growth — one of the market's greatest fears — its 75% full-year gross margin guidance beat estimates by only a few tenths of a percentage point.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And it's not just Nvidia whose margins could be peaking — or even coming under pressure. Aggregate reported gross margins for S&amp;P 500 companies — excluding financials and real estate companies — recently dropped to roughly 45% from a multidecade peak of over 47% in 2021, according to Trivariate Research. Gross margins are important because they're a key indicator of a company's future earnings. Lower ones indicate each product or service it offers is inherently less profitable and is often consistent with waning demand and growth, even if net margins, which companies can boost through cost cutting, suggest everything is fine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There's a direct link between margins and valuations. Price/earnings multiples are largely higher for companies with fatter gross margins, Trivariate's data show, so disappointments on margins would reduce multiples — and cause individual stocks to fall.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The result: The S&amp;P 500 has gone nowhere for the past two months. To Frank Cappelleri, market technician and founder of CappThesis, the selling suggests a market that looks \"toppy.\" Unless something changes for the better, selloffs could resurface when the index hits 7000, putting a \"potential bearish pattern\" in play.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>No bell has rung just yet. The S&amp;P 500 is still holding key support between 6750 and 6800, Cappelleri says. But anything below that level opens the door to an even larger drop. Beyond that, the next key level to watch would be 6538, where buyers stepped in after a decline in late November. That's about 5% below the current level. By contrast, the iShares MSCI ACWI ex US exchange-traded fund, which holds non-U.S. stocks, rose 0.4% this past week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stocks have little margin for error now — and the problem might be us.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Jacob Sonenshine at jacob.sonenshine@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Although Metallic Minerals believes the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of material factors and assumptions. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include failure to obtain necessary approvals, unsuccessful exploration results, unsuccessful operations, changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined, results of future resource estimates, future metal prices, availability of capital and financing on acceptable terms, general economic, market or business conditions, risks associated with regulatory changes, defects in title, availability of personnel, materials and equipment on a timely basis, accidents or equipment breakdowns, uninsured risks, delays in receiving government approvals, unanticipated environmental impacts on operations and costs to remedy same and other exploration or other risks detailed herein and from time to time in the filings made by the Company with securities regulators. Readers are cautioned that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral exploration, development of mines and mining operations is an inherently risky business. Accordingly, the actual events may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. oil production fell for the second consecutive month in December to its lowest level since June last year, while demand reached a multi-month high, the Energy Information Administration said on Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Crude oil output averaged 13.66 million barrels per day in December, down about 133,000 bpd from November, the EIA said. That was the largest month-over-month decline in U.S. oil output since January 2025, when adverse weather caused shut-ins at major production centers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. is the world's top oil-producing nation as well as its top consumer, but analysts have been expecting output to slow in response to the decline in oil prices in recent years. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were trading near $67 on Friday, compared with about $77.50 at the same time in 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Total U.S. petroleum demand rose 624,000 bpd to 20.85 million bpd in December, highest since August, the EIA data showed. Gasoline demand rose 101,000 bpd to 8.78 million bpd in December, while demand for distillate fuels, which include diesel and heating oil, rose 16,000 bpd to 3.81 million bpd, the data showed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, U.S. gross natural gas production from the Lower 48 states rose to a record 135.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in December, up from the prior all-time high of 134.2 bcfd in November.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In top gas-producing states, monthly output in December rose by 1% to a monthly record high of 38.5 bcfd in Texas.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Teresa Rivas</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Not two months have gone by since the start of 2026, and the U.S. has seen heightened political tensions with Europe, China, Latin America, and the Middle East; mass protests; two partial government shutdowns; more tariff drama; and the market's spiraling fears about artificial intelligence, just to name some highlights.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With all those headlines, investors can be forgiven for forgetting about earnings. Yet the latest round of financial results is one bright spot that might carry stocks to new highs, despite this year's turmoil.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With fourth-quarter reporting season largely in the rearview mirror, more S&amp;P 500 companies are beating estimates than the long-term average, and at a higher rate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Those strong results and guidance support Citi strategist Scott Chronert's bullish full-year outlook. Per-share earnings for the index look likely to surpass Citi's $275 estimate for 2025 at this point, thereby making it easier for companies to match or exceed 2026 estimates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition, full-year earnings estimates have remained stable for the S&amp;P 500 as a whole. That's particularly encouraging because the fourth-quarter reporting period is when companies typically issue forecasts for the year ahead. Those outlooks tend to be conservative — after all, it's better to underpromise and overdeliver — often leading to estimate cuts. But that hasn't happened this year, outside of a few sectors like energy and healthcare, and those cases likely reflect most or all of the bad news.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It's also worth noting that the fourth quarter's earnings wins were spread out across sectors, and not just concentrated among big tech companies. For all the recent worries that AI will destroy whole industries and gobble up tech's cash, Chronert says the ongoing spending boom will boost profits this year. However, \"AI disruption concerns will persist and be reflected more in valuations than in 2026 earnings expectations,\" he warned.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Therefore Chronert left his 2026 S&amp;P 500 EPS estimate unchanged at $320, slightly above consensus.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Focusing on earnings might ultimately be a way to cut through the increasing noise that has been denting stocks recently. While it's certainly true that AI's impact makes it harder to forecast profits for front-line companies like software firms, the overall picture remains strong. And at the end of the day, solid results have supported much of the rally.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The earnings backdrop makes it easier to see how the market could climb higher this year, despite a chaotic news cycle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The S&amp;P 500 is up less than 1% year to date through Thursday's close and has basically gone nowhere since October, a \"near-unprecedented holding pattern,\" notes Mark Hackett, Chief Markets Strategist for Nationwide.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Yet that's actually impressive, he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Given the tall wall of worry — AI volatility, Nvidia-driven swings, tariffs, geopolitics and stubborn inflation — you'd expect a sharper drop. Instead, the market is grinding sideways,\" Hackett writes. \"That resilience suggests this is more of a pause than a turning point, and once it clears, the path of least resistance is higher.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Numbers don't lie, and U.S. companies are still throwing up good ones. That should let the market climb higher, if it weren't for everything else getting in the way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
