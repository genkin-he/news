Instead, Bitcoin finished the month down, creating a gap of approximately 13% from its all-time high. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Historical Trends Suggest Bitcoin Could Rebound</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Joel Kruger, a market strategist at LMAX Group, noted that while October was a letdown compared to historical trends, it’s essential to contextualize the price movements. He remarked, “Prices have held up well overall, especially after a September that actually bucked the usual weakness.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notably, on the 6th of this month, the market’s leading cryptocurrency reached an all-time high just beyond $126,000.

Adam McCarthy, a senior research analyst at digital market data provider Kaiko, observed that cryptocurrencies entered October tracking gold and stocks at near all-time highs. However, as uncertainty crept into the market, investors did not flow back into Bitcoin as anticipated. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In addition, October witnessed the largest liquidation event in cryptocurrency history, triggered by President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, alongside threats of export controls on crucial software.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>McCarthy commented on the impact of this liquidation, stating, “That washout on the 10th really reminded people that this asset class is very narrow.” He emphasized that even dominant cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum can experience sharp drawdowns, citing instances of 10% declines occurring in just 15 to 20 minutes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amid these developments, concerns have been raised by several figures regarding the high valuations in equity markets. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, recently warned of a heightened risk of a significant correction in the US stock market within the next six months to two years. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Jake Ostrovskis, head of trading at Wintermute’s over-the-counter desk, noted that participants in the market remain hesitant as they grapple with the implications of the largest liquidation event on record.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>A gold loan is a one-time, lump-sum loan you get by pledging jewellery or coins. The lender values your gold, sanctions an amount, and disburses it to your bank account. You repay in fixed monthly instalments over a defined tenure. It feels like any other EMI loan—predictable amount, fixed end date, and a clear path to closing the loan and releasing your gold.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What a gold overdraft is</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A gold overdraft turns your pledged gold into a revolving credit line. You receive a sanctioned limit and can draw, repay, and redraw within that limit during the facility’s validity. Interest accrues only on the amount you actually use and only for the days you use it. It works like a credit card backed by gold, but without the card—highly flexible and usage-based.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Interest and total cost</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A standard gold loan charges interest on the full disbursed amount from day one, so your total cost depends on the rate and the tenure you choose. A gold overdraft charges interest only on drawn funds, which can cut costs if your usage is intermittent or short-term. If you expect to keep the balance high for most of the tenure, the overdraft’s flexibility won’t save much, and the cost may resemble a regular loan.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Repayment experience</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With a gold loan, EMIs bring discipline and certainty. You know exactly what leaves your account each month and when the loan will end. With a gold overdraft, there is no fixed EMI unless you set one up; you can repay partially or fully any time. That flexibility is useful for uneven cash flows but demands self-control so the balance doesn’t linger and rack up interest.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Best-fit situations</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Choose a gold loan when you have a clear, one-time need—a medical bill, a vehicle repair, or a planned home expense—and you’re comfortable with EMIs. Choose a gold overdraft when your needs are uncertain or recurring—working capital top-ups, periodic school fees, or seasonal cash gaps—and you want to pay only for what you actually use.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Fees, LTV and fine print</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both products may come with processing fees, valuation charges, renewal fees (for overdrafts), and penal interest on delays. The loan-to-value (LTV) determines how much you can borrow against your gold, and lenders may revalue or ask for top-ups if gold prices fall. Tenure matters too: loans have a fixed end date, while overdrafts typically run for a shorter validity and can be renewed. Always check foreclosure, part-prepayment, and auction clauses so you know exactly how you’ll get your gold back—or what happens if you miss payments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A quick rule of thumb</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you need most of the money immediately and will hold it for months, a gold loan with EMIs is usually the smarter, calmer choice. If you’ll dip in and out, keeping low balances and repaying fast, a gold overdraft often wins on interest saved.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A simple example</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Imagine you need up to Rs 3 lakh across the next six months but only in bursts—Rs 1 lakh for two weeks, nothing for a month, then Rs 50,000 for 10 days. A gold overdraft lets you draw just those amounts and pay interest only for those days. If instead you know you need Rs 3 lakh today for a renovation and will take a year to repay, an EMI-based gold loan offers predictable payments and an automatic finish line.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bottom lineThink of your gold as collateral powering a tool. Pick the tool that matches your cash-flow pattern. For one-shot needs and certainty, take the gold loan.

His latest technical breakdown links the recent strength in the NASDAQ to potential moves within the crypto sector, warning that the “unthinkable” is about to occur for XRP soon. The analyst highlighted that XRP’s price structure and broader crypto signals are aligning for a decisive move that could determine whether the current bull market cycle continues or starts to reverse.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>XRP Set For Unthinkable Upside Rally </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to @BullrunnersHQ, the equity market is approaching critical levels that could dictate the next major trend in the crypto market and XRP price. Despite the crypto market struggling to reach similar highs, XRP remains firmly above the $2.50 range. He described this setup as “the unthinkable” moment for XRP, where the asset could finally break free from its prolonged consolidation and rally by “multiple hundreds of percent.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notably, @BullrunnersHQ asserts that XRP’s price structure remains technically healthy despite market volatility. The analyst also noted that the overall crypto market cap and sentiment indicators have improved, with the Fear &amp; Greed Index climbing to 42 from mid-October lows. He further emphasized that Bitcoin continues to hold comfortably above its 50-week EMA, showing a pattern consistent with previous rallies that led to new peaks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The analyst added that BTC’s new local high around $116,000 and a bullish crossover between the 10 EMA and 20 EMA suggest that momentum is returning to risk assets, setting the stage for XRP to outperform potentially. Notably, this period mirrors earlier market cycles where Bitcoin’s consolidation above key levels triggered explosive altcoin rallies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>XRP, which has held its support much longer than most cryptocurrencies in the market, could climb to a new all-time high once momentum shifts. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To support his analysis, @BullrunnersHQ has referenced crypto market expert and Chartist Peter Brandt’s discussion about whether the NASDAQ’s recent price action represents a breakaway or an exhaustion gap. While Brandt leans cautiously bearish from an equities standpoint, @BullerunnersHQ remains confident that even if stocks slightly pull back or halt temporarily, money could still rotate into cryptocurrencies, potentially fueling XRP’s next major rally. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Analyst Warns Of Exhaustion Gap And End Of Bull Market</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>In his analysis, @BullrunnersHQ also referenced crypto trader Abdullah, who believes that the NASDAQ’s rally also shows signs of an exhaustion gap, a signal often seen near the end of a bull market uptrend. Absullah points to overbought readings in both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic RSI on the weekly timeframe, indicating that the markets could be nearing the end of their current bull market phase. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>@BullrunnersHQ agreed that the market may be nearing exhaustion but reiterated that XRP’s position offers more upside potential compared to other assets. He also emphasized that Bitcoin must continue to hold between $107,000 and $109,000 on the weekly timeframe. A failure to do so could signal the end of the broader bull market.</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>US equities have zoomed to another banner year, but going by the derivatives market, there may not be much left in the tank.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Options bets on the S&amp;P 500 Index’s level in late December are clustering near 7,000, a round-number milestone that would put the index up 19% in 2025. But that’s just 2.5% from Thursday’s close of 6,822.34, with two months left to go.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While Wall Street remains generally bullish about the prospects for US stocks, there are legitimate reasons for caution. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said a third interest-rate cut is far from assured. And results from tech behemoths raised concern about spending on artificial intelligence.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are signs that the economy is slowing and cracks are forming in the riskier parts of the credit market, calling into question the health of the American consumer. A handful of stocks are responsible for the bulk of the index’s gains, an alarming development should those heavyweights falter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And while some strategists have started dialing down their bullishness after Powell’s comments on Wednesday — even though the final two months of the year are generally seasonally strong — there is another, more pedestrian explanation for the bets crowding where they are: investors tend to load up near big, round numbers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“The 7,000 strike price is a very popular psychological level,” said Joseph Ferrara, an investment strategist at Gateway Investment Advisors. In options parlance, a strike is the level a trader can buy or sell the underlying asset as of the expiry date.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“A round strike is just going to get more attention,” said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then there are the more abstruse reasons, owing to the complexities and vagaries of the options market. One is a type of equity financing trade known as a box spread that often uses index options. Murphy attributes around half the open interest at the 7,000 level to such “financing plays.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Then, there are what’s known in the industry as the call-selling “whales,” notably, JPMorgan Asset Management, which has a large number of call-selling funds. One of them, the JPMorgan Hedged Equity Fund, has a wager that the S&amp;P 500 won’t end the year past 7,000. Such funds gives away upside to buy insurance against a market drop. A host of asset managers now systematically sell calls, which can help anchor the market at certain levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Regardless of the reasons, Murphy suggests investors who have missed out on some of the gains in the AI darlings consider single-stock options rather than making bets on the broader index. For portfolio managers in the unenviable position of chasing the retail-driven AI surge, calls on individual names represent a more efficient tool than index options, he said.“The S&amp;P has not been as explosive as single names,” Murphy said. “Long story short, retail has been all in on AI, institutional investors have been a little more cautious and skeptical of the rally, so it’s something of a no-brainer for them to buy upside in Mag7 names.”</span></p></span></div></div>",
