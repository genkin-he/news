They cost more and are not carbon free, but they can balance the grid more effectively than intermittent renewable energy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As the share of electricity produced by wind and solar declined to 55.5% last year from 56.8% in 2024, the average price of electricity on the Spanish spot market rose by around 9% to 83.45 euros per megawatt-hour, according to Redeia data.   </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last year, net profit rose about 37% to 505.6 million euros, it said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>($1 = 0.8477 euros)</span></p></span></div></div>",
