The capital stack includes a $550 million senior mortgage and a $50 million mezzanine loan originated by Citi, making it the third-largest multifamily transaction in the U.S. in 2025(1) .</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The closing marks West Shore's second SASB transaction in the past 12 months, exemplifying the firm's continued growth among the most active multifamily owners in the Sunbelt region. Under the leadership of President Lee Rosenthal, West Shore has expanded its footprint to more than 18,500 units across nine states.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Closing a $600 million SASB as borrower and acquiring three multifamily assets in high-growth markets marks a pivotal moment in our expansion strategy,\" said Rosenthal. \"We're proud to strengthen our portfolio footprint while continuing to invest in communities that reflect long-term opportunity and resilience.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Citi's market-leading capital markets team, led by James Goldberg, was able to price the transaction at the tightest levels achieved of any multifamily SASB so far this year. This transaction underscores the strength of the current CMBS market and investor demand for high quality multifamily portfolios with best-in-class sponsorship.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This financing reflects the strong demand for well-leased, institutionally managed multifamily properties, particularly in high-growth and Sunbelt-adjacent markets,\" said Gosalia. \"The borrower was able to take advantage of a competitive debt environment to lock in a low cost of capital and generate liquidity to support further portfolio growth.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The eight-property portfolio comprises 3,241 units with a blended occupancy of 93.4% and average unit size of 1,014 square feet. Communities included in the refinancing are located in Richmond, Virginia; Clearwater, Florida; Waxhaw, North Carolina and Lexington, Kentucky. The newly purchased properties are located in Columbus, Ohio; North Augusta, South Carolina and Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to Newmark Research, U.S. multifamily investment volume reached $41 billion in the second quarter of 2025 — a 15% quarter-over-quarter increase — driven by easing interest rate volatility and a rebound in institutional capital flows. Lending conditions have improved as investors seek stable, income-generating opportunities in high-growth regions. The Sun Belt and Southeast continue to lead the nation in rent growth and absorption, fueling portfolio-level transactions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About Newmark</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Newmark Group, Inc. </span><span>, together with its subsidiaries (\"Newmark\"), is a world leader in commercial real estate, seamlessly powering every phase of the property life cycle.

After that move, XRP retraced into a sideway band where Osemka labels internal subdivisions “a,” “b,” and “c,” implying a corrective internal chop inside the broader range.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The lower boundary of the range is drawn in the $1.62 area. This lower boundary is simultaneously labeled “A” and described as the base of Reaccumulation, implying that buyers repeatedly defended that zone. The subsequent rally back toward the upper boundary defined the “B” top. What followed was a final flush into “C,” which he explicitly tags “Spring,” with the wick piercing below prior support and then snapping back above $2.20–$2.30 and into the ~$2.58 region shown on the chart.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The message is that the C wave was fast, deep, and terminal. He calls it “a sharp ending in the C wave,” adding that this is “very common.” In classical Elliott interpretation, an A-B-C corrective move that ends with an aggressive C spike often resolves with trend continuation in the direction of the original impulse. In his wording, the surge established the impulse, and everything since has been digestion, not distribution. He argues that “it is hard to see this range as anything less than a long reaccumulation after November’s surge.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notably, Osemka places XRP’s pattern next to gold’s weekly chart during its own multi-quarter sideways phase. Gold’s structure is annotated almost identically: an “A” low anchored around roughly $1,680–$1,700 per ounce, a mid-range chop labeled “a / b / c,” a “B” high pressing into the $2,050–$2,100 ceiling, and finally a “C” leg that undercut that same $1,700 floor before reversing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When gold finally pushed through the long-capped $2,100 area in July 2024 and broke into sustained new all-time highs near $2,480, that break acted like a trigger: safe-haven demand, Fed rate-cut expectations and central bank buying drove an almost uninterrupted vertical phase in the metal, and over the following months gold kept taking out round numbers — $2,500, $3,000, $4,000 and beyond — ultimately stretching more than 80% higher from that $2,100 breakout zone to reach about $4,381 per ounce at the peak.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By placing XRP and gold side by side, using the same lettering, same boundary logic, and the same “Spring” terminology, Osemka is presenting XRP as sitting at the equivalent moment gold occupied just before its parabolic run.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“This one is for the XRP community, where I see some gurus preaching for the end of the cycle. Bros, it is hard to see this range as anything less than a long reaccumulation after November’s surge. In Elliott wave terms: an ABC with a sharp ending in the C wave. Very common. Last shakeout or Spring. There is basically no difference to this reaccumulation example on Gold years ago. Thank me later,” the analyst concluded.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At press time, XRP traded at $2.49.</span></p><span class=\"container-S5VA5POt\"><figure><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-S5VA5POt\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:554.296875px;max-width:1200px;aspect-ratio:2.1649048625792813\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:265d01850094b-4d1211a21b11d017ba1ec63e6ff4e555-resized.webp\" type=\"images/webp\"/><img alt=\"XRP price\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-S5VA5POt\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/newsbtc:265d01850094b-4d1211a21b11d017ba1ec63e6ff4e555-resized.jpeg\" style=\"background-color:#f7f5f6\"/></picture></div></figure></span></span></div></div>",
