Division operating income of $16.4 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased $0.7 million and was negatively impacted by an increase in depreciation expense of $0.5 million due to hotel renovations completed during fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025.

The company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) attributable to The Marcus Corporation before investment income or loss, interest expense, other expense, gain or loss on disposition of property, equipment and other assets, equity earnings or losses from unconsolidated joint ventures, net earnings or losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and non-cash share-based compensation expense, adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the company does not consider indicative of its core operating performance. A reconciliation of this measure to the equivalent measure under GAAP, along with reconciliations of this measure for each of our operating segments, are set forth in the attached table.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management and the company's board of directors to assess the company's financial performance and enterprise value. The company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure, as it eliminates certain expenses and gains that are not indicative of the company's core operating performance and facilitates a comparison of the company's core operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period. The company also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a basis to determine certain annual cash bonuses and long-term incentive awards, to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and to compare its performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by analysts, investors and other interested parties as a performance measure to evaluate industry competitors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of the company's financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings (loss) as a measure of financial performance, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and it should not be construed as an inference that the company's future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or free cash flow for management's discretionary use. In addition, this non-GAAP measure excludes certain non-recurring and other charges and has its limitations as an analytical tool. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the company will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the items eliminated in the adjustments made to determine Adjusted EBITDA, such as acquisition expenses, preopening expenses, accelerated depreciation, impairment charges and other adjustments. The company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that the company's future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Definitions and calculations of Adjusted EBITDA differ among companies in our industries, and therefore Adjusted EBITDA disclosed by the company may not be comparable to the measures disclosed by other companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>About The Marcus Corporation</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Headquartered in Milwaukee, Marcus Corporation is a leader in the lodging and entertainment industries, with significant company-owned real estate assets.

Inflation edged down to 2.1% in October from 2.2% in September, entirely due to energy and food inflation, though core inflation was unchanged at 2.4%. Inflation is set to cool further to 1.5% by the start of next year, as energy inflation falls further below zero, and services--where prices accelerated in October--trends down again, Kenningham says. \"While the ECB is clearly in no hurry to changes its policy settings we suspect policymakers will eventually cut interest rates again to stave off the risk of inflation getting stuck below target,\" he says.

The company posted a net loss of $0.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $5.1 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA saw a significant increase to $28.8 million from $18.8 million in the previous year, driven by cost-cutting measures in Canada and growth in the Australian segment.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Business and Operational Highlights</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>The Australian segment continued to perform strongly, generating revenues of $124.5 million, up from $116.6 million in the third quarter of 2024. This growth was primarily due to the acquisition of four villages in May 2025 and increased occupancy in the Bowen Basin owned villages. Adjusted EBITDA for the Australian segment increased to $26.7 million from $22.5 million in the previous year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In Canada, despite a decline in revenues to $46.0 million from $57.7 million, the segment showed improved profitability due to cost-cutting measures.

In the third quarter alone, the company repurchased approximately 1.05 million shares for $26.2 million. Year-to-date, Civeo has returned approximately $52 million to shareholders.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company also reported a total liquidity of $70.2 million and a net debt of $175.9 million as of September 30, 2025.

Dodson, Civeo's President and CEO, highlighted the company's operational and strategic efforts, noting the continued growth in Australia and improved cost structure in Canada. He emphasized the company's focus on capitalizing on customer demand in Australia and driving top-line growth in Canada.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Dodson also reiterated the company's commitment to its share repurchase program, viewing it as the optimal path to accelerate the return of capital to shareholders.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Future Outlook</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>For the full year of 2025, Civeo has tightened its revenue guidance to a range of $640 million to $655 million and its Adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $86 million to $91 million.
