We strengthened our portfolio through the acquisition of Generis and advanced innovation initiatives, such as early-stage AI tools, designed to enhance the customer experience and deliver scalable efficiency in our processes. These actions reflect our focus on building dynamic, high-impact platforms that help businesses connect and grow in an increasingly complex marketplace.

We delivered positive organic growth, especially when taking into consideration our recent acquisitions, strong growth in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, and maintained strong liquidity and prudent capital management. Our results in the third quarter, by far our smallest quarter of the year, were in line with expectations and primarily reflect the on-going and soon to be completed construction at the Las Vegas Convention Center which affected our largest event in the quarter, as well as some modest and anticipated tariff headwinds related to that event.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-cBh_FN2P logosContainer-cwMMKgmm\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>The A-Team is here to save the day. Amazon and Apple that is, rather than the 80s crack commando unit. The two companies put a gloss on Big Tech earnings season as they reversed the narrative about the risks they faced from slow progress in AI and the impact of tariffs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon took the starring role, as the market applauded an acceleration in growth in its cloud-computing business to its best rate in three years. That helped put to bed concerns that Microsoft and Google are eating into Amazon Web Services' market share amid the artificial-intelligence race. Amazon also shrugged off tariff costs, noting it hadn't seen significant price increases from sellers on its retail platforms.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple was a decent supporting actor, with the main action being an expected double-digit increase in iPhone sales in the holiday quarter. After months of debate over Apple being too slow to integrate AI, the strong start for the iPhone 17 suggests concerns that might have dragged on sales look overblown. A $1.1 billion tariff hit for the quarter also looked more than manageable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Taken together, it's a reminder that sometimes it pays to bet on overlooked stocks. Amazon and Apple were the two worst-performing members of the Magnificent Seven group of companies this year ahead of their earnings reports and trailed far behind a 16% gain for the wider S&amp;P 500. But with worries mounting about the level of capital expenditure required for the AI boom, Apple's relatively modest spending and Amazon's huge revenue from its retail business provide a level of comfort.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With tariff headwinds potentially set to ease amid a U.S.-China trade truce and consumer spending holding up, investors look set to love it as Amazon and Apple's plans come together.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Adam Clark</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>***</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple Is Betting On a Big Holiday Season For iPhone</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apple beat fourth-quarter sales expectations and set the bar high for the holiday season, forecasting revenue to rise 10% to 12% as consumers upgrade to the new iPhone 17. CFO Kevan Parekh said they see a \"double-digit\" increase in iPhone sales from a year ago.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>If Apple's prediction comes true, it would be the best revenue quarter   and the best iPhone sales quarter in its history, Parekh said on a call   with analysts. For the just ended period, Apple set a new sales milestone   of over $400 billion for the full fiscal year.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Still despite record sales in India, quarterly iPhone sales and sales in   China both missed projections. Fourth-quarter iPhone sales of $49 billion   were up 5% from the year-ago quarter, but fell short of the $50 billion   expected. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings were $1.85 a share and revenue   was $102.5 billion.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Apple's high-margin services segment, home of its App Stores, AppleCare   support, and iCloud+, remains the all-star of its income statement.   Revenue of $28.8 billion, up 15% from a year ago, and gross margin of   75.3% both surpassed projections and boosted companywide gross margin to   over 47%.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The number of Apple customers still using their iPhones, iPads, and other   devices reached a new all-time high across all product categories and   geographic segments, Parekh said. \"Nearly half\" of Mac users and \"over   half\" of iPad and Watch customers are using new devices. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>What's Next: Tariffs cost Apple $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, and Apple expects that bill to rise to $1.4 billion in the current quarter. CEO Tim Cook said the current quarter figure would have been higher had tariffs on imports from China not been lowered to 10% from 20%.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Adam Levine and Janet H. Cho</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>***</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon Says Web Services Growing Fastest Since 2022</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Like its rivals in the cloud computing business, Amazon reported double digit revenue gains in the third quarter, beating expectations as Amazon Web Services grows at a pace not seen since 2022, according to CEO Andy Jassy. It also has big plans to build out data center capacity.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>For the September quarter, Amazon reported adjusted earnings of $1.95 a   share, including investment gains from AI start-up Anthropic. Overall   revenue was $180.2 billion, up 13%. Revenue for the AWS division was $33   billion, up 20% and above analyst expectations.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Jassy told analysts Amazon has doubled AWS capacity measured by power   from 2022 and is on track to double capacity again by 2027. It expects   capital spending to be $125 billion for the full year, ahead of   expectations, and it expects capex to increase again next year.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>UBS analyst Stephen Ju said AWS's revenue could improve in the fourth   quarter and the first half of next year as Amazon adds more data-center   capacity. But his checks on spending by AWS customers points to a \"less   robust\" picture than for Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Advertising sales revenue rose 24% in the quarter. Consumer spending   remains resilient despite concerns about the labor market. While many   Amazon sellers rely on materials and manufacturing in China, Amazon   hasn't seen \"meaningful\" price increases on its e-commerce platform. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>What's Next: Amazon forecasts fourth-quarter sales to be between $206 billion and $213 billion, with operating profit in a range of $21 billion and $26 billion, to mark the holiday shopping season.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Tae Kim and Liz Moyer</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>***</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix Weighs Up Warner Bros. Bid, Report Says</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix may be about to own the Harry Potter and Batman franchises. The video streamer is weighing up making a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studios business, according to a report.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Netflix is retaining the investment bank Moelis &amp; Co. as a financial   advisor and has been granted access to key financial information, Reuters   reported, citing three people familiar with the matter. Moelis, Netflix,   and Warner Bros. didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from   Barron's.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>The deal would give Netflix control over the rival HBO Max streaming   service, as well as intellectual property like DC Comics and Harry   Potter. That would feed the tech giant's flywheel model, a   self-sustaining cycle of growth in which more subscribers means more   money to spend on content, which in turn attracts even more users.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Netflix announced a 10-for-1 stock split late Thursday, which it said   would help reset shares to a range that would make it easier for   employees taking part in an options program to buy in. The stock has   climbed 22% this year, although third-quarter earnings took some of the   shine off a bigger rally, as a continuing dispute with Brazilian tax   authorities led to the company missing Wall Street's profit target. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>What's Next: The news could kick-start a bidding war. Paramount Skydance has already made three offers for Warner Bros. that have all been rejected, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month, citing people familiar with the matter. Its last offer was for $23.50 a share, the people said, which is still way below the $40 a share level that Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav is reportedly aiming for.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>George Glover</span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>***</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pfizer and Novo Nordisk Find Themselves In a Bidding War</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Pfizer has found itself in a bidding war with Danish rival drugmaker Novo Nordisk over the weight-loss drugmaker Metsera, with just three days left to strike a better deal. Novo Nordisk made the dramatic $6 billion cash bid for Metsera after it already accepted Pfizer's $4.9 billion cash offer.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Metsera's main drug is similar to Novo Nordisk's blockbuster weight-loss   injectable Wegovy, but it is administered monthly rather than weekly.   Pfizer called Novo's bid an attempt by a dominant market leader to   \"suppress competition in violation of law by taking over an emerging   American challenger.\"   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Novo has picked this fight as the Trump administration pressures the   industry to lower drug prices. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has touted his   friendship with President Donald Trump, who wants to cut prices of   branded weight-loss drugs to \"about $150,\" a fraction of Wegovy's current   list price.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Novo's bid could reflect a new level of aggression at the company, or   perhaps desperation, during a tumultuous year that has seen the ouster of   its CEO, the resignation of all its independent board directors, and a   60% drop in its share price since the middle of 2024.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Novo likely was already a bidder for Metsera. Securities filings by the   smaller drugmaker show that it discussed a potential acquisition with   seven companies, including Pfizer, and at least three made offers. The   filings do not name the other companies aside from Pfizer. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>What's Next: Metsera said Novo's offer is better than Pfizer's, and is giving Pfizer four days from Thursday to negotiate a superior offer. Pfizer called Novo's offer \"illusory\" and said it shouldn't trigger a renegotiation of its existing agreement.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Josh Nathan-Kazis and Janet H.

and (ii) other net income and losses not related to the performance of the investment portfolio.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company has three primary variables that impact its performance: (i) net interest margin on assets held within the investment portfolio; (ii) realized and unrealized gains or losses on assets held within the investment portfolio, including any impairment or reserve for expected credit losses; and (iii) the Company's operating expenses and taxes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company's definition of earnings available for distribution excludes certain realized and unrealized losses, which although they represent a part of the Company's recurring operations, are subject to significant variability and are generally limited to a potential indicator of future economic performance. Within other net income and losses, management primarily excludes equity-based compensation expenses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With regard to non-capitalized transaction-related expenses, management does not view these costs as part of the Company's core operations, as they are considered by management to be similar to realized losses incurred at acquisition. Non-capitalized transaction-related expenses generally relate to legal and valuation service costs, as well as other professional service fees, incurred when the Company acquires certain investments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Management believes that the adjustments to compute \"earnings available for distribution\" specified above allow investors and analysts to readily identify and track the operating performance of the assets that form the core of the Company's activity, assist in comparing the core operating results between periods, and enable investors to evaluate the Company's current core performance using the same financial measure that management uses to operate the business. Management also utilizes earnings available for distribution as a financial measure in its decision-making process relating to improvements to the underlying fundamental operations of the Company's investments, as well as the allocation of resources between those investments, and management also relies on earnings available for distribution as an indicator of the results of such decisions. Earnings available for distribution excludes certain recurring items, such as gains and losses (including impairment) and non-capitalized transaction-related expenses, because they are not considered by management to be part of the Company's core operations for the reasons described herein. As such earnings available for distribution is not intended to reflect all of the Company's activity and should be considered as only one of the factors used by management in assessing the Company's performance, along with GAAP comprehensive (loss)/income which is inclusive of all of the Company's activities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Company views earnings available for distribution as a consistent financial measure of its portfolio's ability to generate income for distribution to common stockholders. Earnings available for distribution does not represent and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, comprehensive (loss)/income or as a substitute for, or superior to, cash flows from operating activities, each as determined in accordance with GAAP, and the Company's calculation of this financial measure may not be comparable to similarly entitled financial measures reported by other companies. Furthermore, to maintain qualification as a REIT, U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that the Company distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income annually, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. Because the Company views earnings available for distribution as a consistent financial measure of its ability to generate income for distribution to common stockholders, earnings available for distribution is one metric, but not the exclusive metric, that the Company's board of directors uses to determine the amount, if any, and the payment date of dividends on common stock. However, earnings available for distribution should not be considered as an indication of the Company's taxable income, a guaranty of its ability to pay dividends or as a proxy for the amount of dividends it may pay, as earnings available for distribution excludes certain items that impact its cash needs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reconciliation of GAAP Comprehensive (Loss)/Income to Earnings Available for Distribution</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>($ in thousands except per share amounts)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The table below provides a reconciliation of earnings available for distribution to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:</span></p><pre class=\"preformatted-zagxxLT_\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"><span> </span><br/><span>                                             Three months ended </span><br/><span>                                   --------------------------------------- </span><br/><span>                                    September 30, 2025     June 30, 2025 </span><br/><span>                                   --------------------  ----------------- </span><br/><span>Comprehensive (loss)/income -- </span><br/><span> GAAP                               $             (381)   $       1,393 </span><br/><span>Adjustments: </span><br/><span>    Net income attributable to </span><br/><span>     noncontrolling interest                        --                1 </span><br/><span>    Realized and unrealized gains                 (272)          (1,265) </span><br/><span>    Other adjustments(1)                           (47)               5 </span><br/><span>                                       ---------------       ---------- </span><br/><span>Earnings Available for </span><br/><span> Distribution -- Non-GAAP           $             (700)   $         134 </span><br/><span>                                       ===============       ========== </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Weighted average shares - basic             45,422,527       45,418,752 </span><br/><span>Weighted average shares - diluted           45,422,527       45,420,364 </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Basic Earnings Available for </span><br/><span> Distribution per common share      $            (0.02)   $        0.00 </span><br/><span>Diluted Earnings Available for </span><br/><span> Distribution per common share      $            (0.02)   $        0.00 </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>_________________________ </span><br/><span>(1)    Other adjustments include amortization and income taxes. </span><br/><span> </span></pre><p class=\"\"><span>CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This press release contains certain information which constitutes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The ECB targets an inflation rate of 2%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The slowdown was largely due to a smaller increase in food prices over the year through October. Prices of manufactured goods cooled, while services prices rose at a slightly faster pace.

But inflation could also pick up if the tariffs scramble global supply chains.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We will take the necessary measures and steps on the basis of data, meeting by meeting, to make sure that we stay in a good place,\" Lagarde said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The ECB's economists expect the inflation rate to fall further in 2026 and average just 1.7%, before picking up to 1.9% in 2027. The central bank Friday said that economists at banks and other institutions it surveyed in early October expect inflation to be 1.8% next year, and 2% in 2027.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a separate report summarizing its recent contacts with eurozone businesses, the ECB said they had reported a \"further slight slowdown\" in their selling prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This was mainly driven by price moderation in the services sector, reflecting some cooling in price growth in labour-intensive sectors such as hospitality,,\" the ECB said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Policymakers have said they wouldn't change the key rate in response to what they perceive as short-lived deviations in the pace of price rises from their target, but would respond to larger shocks that threaten to move inflation away from 2% for a prolonged period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",
