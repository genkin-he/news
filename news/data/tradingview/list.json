Unfortunately, we have seen none of this in our engagement,\" Wilson wrote.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Lululemon spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The company said in prior statements to Barron's that its board and leadership team had engaged \"extensively and in good faith\" with Wilson to understand his perspectives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wilson stepped down from the board over a decade ago, but still owns about 9% of the shares.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lululemon stock was down 1.1% to $184.02 in midmorning trading Friday. The stock has shed 11% this year, and about 50% over the past 12 months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wilson nominated three candidates to the company's board: Marc Maurer, former co-CEO of On Running; Laura Gentile, former chief marketing officer at ESPN; and Eric Hirshberg, former CEO of Activision. One of the candidates has met with some directors, he wrote, but the response from the board was \"weak and insufficient.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"While we have proposed changing three directors, our strong feeling is that more than three directors should be replaced,\" he wrote. \"The staggered nature of the Board limits how much change we can affect in one year, but we do not think the Board should constrain itself on refreshment.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lululemon has previously said the board will review Wilson's three nominees and will present a formal recommendation regarding them in the company's definitive proxy statement ahead of its 2026 shareholder meeting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wilson also discussed his proposal that calls for a change to the board's election structure. Now, directors are elected in groups that come up for election at different times, sometimes requiring years to fully replace the board. Wilson wants the board to declassify immediately so all directors are elected annually.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to Wilson, the board indicated an \"openness\" to some unspecified director refreshment over several years and a phased de-staggering of the board over time. In his letter, Wilson requested the Board provide shareholders with details on how many incumbent directors will be retiring and when new candidates will be added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>However, Wilson said the board rejected his proposal to create a Brand Product Committee, which would oversee the development of the company's products. Lululemon has struggled to execute some of its new product launches recently — its latest \"Get Low\" line of leggings were criticized for being see-through, and the company paused sales of its 2024 Breezethrough collection just a few weeks after launching because of issues with execution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wilson isn't the only activist pushing for change at Lululemon, which has seen sales growth stall in recent years. Elliott Investment Management took a $1 billion stake and is pushing for Jane Nielsen, Ralph Lauren's former chief financial officer, to be the next chief executive after CEO Calvin McDonald stepped down in January. A search for his successor is under way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The CEO shuffle inspired Wilson to launch his proxy campaign. He has said Lululemon shareholders won't trust any CEO picked by the current board, so he wants to change the board before someone is chosen.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Sabrina Escobar at sabrina.escobar@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Has it gone too far already?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A rare alliance against Big Tech came together in February. Now that could be put to the test.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>February has brought a sharp rotation away from the group of megacap tech stocks known as the Magnificent Seven MAGS, sparking an \"everything but tech\" rally that lifted economically sensitive names as well as recession shelters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That unusual unity, however, may already be starting to crack as the month draws to a close, suggesting the market's temporary alliance against Big Tech may not last.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In February, defensive sectors like consumer staples and utilities XX:SP500.55 have surged alongside economically sensitive groups such as industrials and materials, while technology stocks XX:SP500.45 have been under sharp pressure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This comes as concerns about tech spending and artificial intelligence were on full display this week, with the big drop in Nvidia's stock (NVDA) that followed its blowout earnings report dragging the rest of the stock market lower.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See: Why Nvidia's stock is falling despite a historic earnings beat</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That backdrop has led to the S&amp;P 500's SPX consumer staples XX:SP500.30, industrials XX:SP500.20 and materials XX:SP500.15 sectors being among the best-performing of the large-cap benchmark index's 11 sectors so far in February, with each up over 6.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 0.4% in the same period, according to FactSet data (see table below).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SOURCE: DOW JONES MARKET DATA; FACTSET</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I don't think anybody had that on their bingo card coming into 2026,\" said Stephen Hoedt, head of equities at Key Private Bank. \"It has created a really difficult environment for market participants to navigate, because there's no playbook that you could come up with over the last 10 years where cyclicals and and defensives were rallying at the same time while tech was getting smashed.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cyclicals and defensive stocks rarely move in tandem, as they tend to benefit from different, and often opposing, market and economic conditions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Defensive stocks are shares of companies that provide essential goods and services that tend to remain in demand regardless of economic conditions. These safe-haven investments often offer low volatility and could help protect investors from market downturns, but they generally lag during bull markets. Cyclical stocks, on the other hand, are closely tied to the economic cycle. They typically perform well during expansions, but could underperform during economic downturns or even recessions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A central theme around the rapid pace of AI advancements is that it could be a driving force for growth. But it also might trigger painful job losses and render some business lines obsolete, which could ultimately hurt the consumer-centric U.S. economy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Meanwhile, investors have focused on the consumer staples sector, which was up a total of 14.2% in January and February, while the industrials sector rose 13% and materials stocks were up 15.7% in the year to date, according to FactSet data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See: The S&amp;P 500 is caught in an extremely narrow trading range. What's happening beneath the surface could decide where the index goes next.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>More broadly, there has been a rising \"united front\" against Big Tech that has \"nothing to do with economic conditions,\" Hoedt told MarketWatch in a phone interview.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"But it has everything to do with the market looking for stuff that is not AI impacted and figuring out what is a safe place to hide. What we see here is the anti-AI trade really writ large in these sector rotations,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cyclicals may extend their leadership</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>According to Hoedt, the correlation between cyclicals and defensive stocks is likely to break down soon, as defensive trades become crowded and expensive. Should the economy run hot, cyclical stocks could see further gains from here.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It strikes us that the defensive trade has gotten a bit overcooked and crowded. But we don't think that people are going to back off the cyclicals when we're in a hot economy, so cyclicals are the place to be in,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See: Block plans to lay off nearly half its staff in 'deliberate and bold' embrace of AI</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Economic conditions remain a wild card for the rest of 2026 as investors parse how AI will reshape the labor market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ken Mahoney, president and chief executive officer at Mahoney Asset Management, said that cyclicals such as industrials and materials are also benefiting from the rise of \"physical AI\" as they provide support in the build-out of infrastructure, including power grids, data centers and factories, that will support the next phase of the AI race.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Technology stories are usually more exciting than the materials, but you need all these materials to get up and running for all the contracts that have been signed and construction to be done in the next few years,\" Mahoney told MarketWatch via phone on Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That's why the rally in materials and industrials \"still has legs,\" he added.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>See: AI jitters are turning discount chains and shampoo makers into the stock market's hottest trade - and that's risky</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>U.S. stocks were lower on Friday. The Nasdaq composite COMP was down 0.8% and the S&amp;P 500 was off 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was 1.2% lower, according to FactSet data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Isabel Wang</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

According to TD Cowen's Michael Tupholme, the 4Q miss was driven by a higher-than-expected lump-sum turnkey loss, with the segment posting a C$59 million EBIT hit, wider than the $17 million expected. Because LSTK contracts locked AtkinsRealis into fixed-price delivery, the overrun becomes their loss, which is why these old projects keep distorting results even as the core business performs. Tupholme still characterizes the quarter as neutral, noting that ex-LSTK, Services EBIT was about 2% above consensus and backlog reached a record C$21.2 billion. With 2026 guidance broadly in line, the analyst says the underlying services and nuclear segments remain solid, but its shrinking LSTK book continues to drag.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Shalini Ramachandran, Heather Somerville and Amrith Ramkumar</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Officials at multiple federal agencies have raised concerns about the safety and reliability of Elon Musk's xAI artificial-intelligence tools in recent months, highlighting continuing disagreements within the U.S. government about which AI models to deploy, according to people familiar with the matter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The warnings preceded the Pentagon's decision this week to put xAI at the center of some of the nation's most sensitive and secretive operations by agreeing to allow its chatbot Grok to be used in classified settings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Pentagon has given one of xAI's rivals, Anthropic, a Friday deadline to agree to looser rules on its use by the U.S. military. Anthropic was the only developer approved for classified use before the deal between xAI and the military.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Throughout the government, agencies are racing to deploy AI for a host of purposes but the debate over which models to use has become increasingly political. Senior U.S. officials including at the White House view Anthropic's outspoken stances on safety and ties to big Democratic donors as potentially making the company too \"woke\" to be a reliable provider, people familiar with the matter said. The looser controls on Grok, and Musk's absolutist stance on free speech, have made it a more attractive choice to the Pentagon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other officials have questioned whether Grok's looser controls present risks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ed Forst, the top official at the General Services Administration, a procurement arm of the federal government, in recent months sounded an alarm with White House officials about potential safety issues with Grok, people familiar with the matter said. Other GSA officials under him had also raised safety concerns about Grok, which they viewed as sycophantic and too susceptible to manipulation or corruption by faulty or biased data — creating a potential system risk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the time, in late December and early January, Grok was under fire for allowing sexualized editing of photos, including of children. Government officials saw the issue as representative of how Grok could be exploited by bad actors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The matter reached Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, who called a senior xAI executive about the concerns, the people said. The executive told her that xAI was working on addressing the safety issues that made Grok over-compliant. Josh Gruenbaum, a senior GSA acquisitions official recruited through Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, assured government officials that the government platform of Grok was separate from the public one. Wiles was satisfied, the people said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Musk, who has said he is committed to preventing child exploitation, announced in January that the company would limit the image-generation and editing tools to paying customers. He and xAI didn't respond to requests for comment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In recent weeks, GSA officials were told to put xAI's logo on a tool called USAi, which is essentially a sandbox for federal employees to experiment with different AI models. Grok hadn't been made accessible through USAi largely due to safety concerns, and it remains off the platform, people familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The website shows xAI's logo but only offers models from Anthropic, Google and Meta .</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A team at the GSA studying AI has circulated a report to top agency officials that flags Grok's safety problems, the people said. Grok has been suspended for use by GSA staffers for months. Demand from other agencies to use Grok has been anemic, people familiar with the matter said, except in a few cases where people wanted to use it to mimic a bad actor for defensive testing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a statement, Gruenbaum said the agency takes AI safety seriously. \"We rigorously evaluate frontier AI models, including xAI, through a comprehensive internal review process. In this instance, we followed established procedures and maintain our determination to keep it on schedule,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Two weeks ago, Matthew Johnson, the Pentagon's chief of responsible AI, stepped down in part over his concerns that safety and governance had become an afterthought amid the Defense Department's intense push to expand AI capabilities, people familiar with the matter said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Previously, Johnson's team had circulated memos that had highlighted Grok's safety issues and questioned whether it was aligned with government ethics and standards. Those notes had been sent up their chain of command at the Pentagon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reached for comment, Johnson pointed to a LinkedIn post announcing his departure where he said he was proud of his team of \"true, quiet professionals, who had outsized impact and undersized recognition\" in the DOD's Responsible AI Division: \"We were continually faced with impossible situations, but somehow always delivered through a combination of grit &amp; repeated all-nighters.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The department will continue to ensure the safety and security of all models utilized regardless of classification level,\" a Pentagon official said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The National Security Agency, which oversees much of the country's intelligence gathering and processing, conducted a classified review in November 2024 of large language models, including Grok. It determined Grok had particular security concerns that other models, including Anthropic's Claude, didn't, people familiar with the review said. Its conclusion served as a red flag that deterred some parts of the Pentagon from using Grok, the people said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The use of Anthropic's Claude in the U.S. military's operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro last month intensified its tense dispute with the Pentagon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Anthropic's usage guidelines prohibit Claude from being used to facilitate violence, develop weapons or conduct surveillance, and the company has refused to let the military use its models in all lawful scenarios. xAI has agreed to that language.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given Anthropic until Friday to agree to the military's request for more flexibility or he may bar the company from government work or take legal action to compel it to meet the demands.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Many parts of the military have preferred Anthropic's Claude for even unclassified work, people familiar with the work said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>xAI got a foothold in the Pentagon through a July contract from the AI office worth up to $200 million, which was also awarded to Google, OpenAI and Anthropic. Google and OpenAI have approval for use in unclassified settings but not classified activities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Until recently, the military has leaned on Claude over Grok because it is seen by many in the industry as a more reliable model, AI and security analysts said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I do not believe they are peers in performance right now across all of the capabilities that matter to a customer like the Department of War,\" said Gregory Allen, a senior adviser focused on AI at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. He previously worked on the Defense Department's AI strategy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the Biden administration, the Chief Digital and AI Office, which is part of the Pentagon, declined to pursue any use of Grok, people familiar with the matter said. The concerns included that Grok made it difficult to track the data sources used to train the model, didn't follow federal government standards for responsible AI, and had weak guardrails for safety. xAI didn't sufficiently try to hack its own technology to identify and fix vulnerabilities, a process known in technology as red teaming, the people said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>People who have reviewed Grok in the government setting said that recent testing shows the chatbot is more susceptible than other models to \"data poisoning,\" in which manipulated, biased or inaccurate data corrupts the underlying data sets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the plus side, U.S. officials have determined Grok to be effective at imitating an adversarial actor, which is useful for example in war gaming, people familiar with the discussions said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last year, the Pentagon moved the Chief Digital and AI Office under the Research and Engineering Office, a move that was designed to accelerate AI adoption. Critics said the move stripped the office of much of its authority, particularly to enforce responsible AI standards, in favor of expediency.</span></p></span></div></div>",
