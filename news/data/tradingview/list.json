Seamus Mac Gorain, who heads rates at the $3.4 trillion fund, said the tide is changing after years of oversupply in government debt. With debt offices cutting back on longer maturities and central banks dialing down their balance-sheet roll-offs, the firm believes the recent decline in 30-year yields could run further. JPMorgan's positioning favors longer-dated British and Australian bonds, while also expecting Japan's yield curve to flatten as the long end outperforms. Mac Gorain noted that officials are proactively realigning supply, aware that investor appetite for long-term paper has thinned.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Since early September, yields on 30-year Treasuries have dropped more than 30 basis points, with similar declines across major marketsU.K. gilts down 55 basis points and Japanese long yields off 30 basis points from their October peak. Behind the shift is a wave of coordinated policy moves: the U.K. and Japan have tilted issuance toward shorter maturities, the U.S. Treasury has restarted buybacks, and the Fed will halt its $5 billion-a-month Treasury runoff starting December 1. That slower pace of quantitative tightening, mirrored by the Bank of England and Bank of Canada, could be helping stabilize long-end sentiment. It helps that central banks are shifting away from QT now, Mac Gorain said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the U.S., easing bank capital rules and the Trump administration's push to advance stablecoins may further support Treasuries, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggesting the measures could lower yields by several dozen basis points. Yet, the broader backdrop still looks demandinggovernments are under pressure to fund defense and green projects, while pension funds are rotating into riskier assets to chase returns. Mac Gorain sees inflation as the main swing factor that could disrupt the trend but believes policymakers will intervene if long yields spike again. They're not going to stand idly by while you have very high long-term yields, he said.</span></p></span></div></div>",

But volatility picked up, and some big-name stocks got punished as investors questioned their earnings reports.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tech came close to spoiling the party as the industry signaled much more spending on artificial intelligence. Meta Platforms' margins dropped in the third quarter as it aggressively ramped up outlays, including on AI, sending its stock down 11% after reporting earnings. Microsoft also announced hefty capital investment plans for AI, pressuring its stock despite strong quarterly results.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Amazon.com was a standout, bucking the downturn after beating estimates across all segments. Apple, spending less on AI, also soothed nerves with better-than-expected earnings and an aggressive growth forecast for the fourth quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A slowdown in AI-related spending will come, but the big spenders — Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle — say they're still planning double-digit percentage increases in the near term. They'll report their fourth quarters in late January and early February, providing a reprieve about bubble concerns at least until then.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If there is trouble ahead, it's \"probably more quarters than months\" away, says AllianceBernstein economist Eric Winograd.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tech companies aren't the only ones spooking the market. Chipotle Mexican Grill dropped 18% after cutting its full-year forecast for same-store sales. Also hit hard were health insurer Cigna and financial-technology company Fiserv, the latter losing more than 40% of its market value after issuing a drastically reduced outlook.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Part of the problem may simply be market fatigue after a stellar bull run. Steep expectations for earnings beats create a setup for disappointment if companies fall even slightly short.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even good deeds aren't going unpunished: Consumer discretionary companies' earnings have beaten expectations by 14% on average, but their stocks still dropped 2% the trading day after reporting, according to Evercore ISI. Energy is similarly under pressure, down 2% in October even though companies beat earnings estimates by 11% on average, according to Fundstrat.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Another pressing risk is the Federal Reserve's plans for interest rate cuts. The rate of inflation, at around 3%, remains above the Fed's target. Chair Jerome Powell indicated in his Wednesday news conference that a December cut isn't a shoo-in, partly because of a lack of economic data during the government shutdown.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Powell emphasized that the Fed will operate cautiously. But the market would almost certainly slump if the Fed doesn't cut in December, leaving rates higher than expected next year and putting the economy at greater risk of a recession.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"If we start seeing layoffs throughout the economy, that will signal a recession is possible, maybe even probable,\" says Winograd.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Expect modest gains for the rest of the year — or a selloff if the Fed doesn't come through in December. The S&amp;P 500 is trading 13% above its 200-day moving average, a technical sign that it's overextended. The market traded 9% above that average in early 2022 when it peaked — and then dropped 25% — as the Fed surprised the market with rate hikes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The market is entirely too complacent about downside risks,\" writes Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BTIG.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Jacob Sonenshine at jacob.sonenshine@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Democrats must flip only three Republican-held seats to wrest back control of the House.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Democratic-controlled Virginia Senate on Friday approved a proposed constitutional amendment — passed earlier by the House of Delegates — that would let lawmakers redraw congressional districts next year if voters sign off. The 21-16 vote fell along party lines.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Virginia Democrats hold six of the state's 11 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and hope to gain at least two more by reconfiguring their districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Friday's action was the first step toward bypassing the state’s independent redistricting commission — created by voters in 2020 — and taking control of the map-drawing process.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The amendment must pass again in the next legislative session and then be approved by voters. Democrats plan to hold the second vote early next year after Tuesday’s statewide election and to put the measure on a special election ballot.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>        AN UNPRECEDENTED REDISTRICTING WAR</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This year's widening coast-to-coast redistricting scramble is unprecedented in modern U.S. politics.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Virginia Republicans, including Governor Glenn Youngkin, whose constitutionally limited four-year term ends in January, accused Democrats of attempting a power grab. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"This amendment is being proposed not to protect our citizens or to make our government better,\" Republican state Senator J.D. \"Danny\" Diggs said on the chamber floor on Friday. \"This amendment is about increasing the political power of the Democrat Party.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Republicans also criticized the Democrats for pursuing their redistricting agenda after early voting was already under way for Virginia's gubernatorial race, in which Youngkin's Republican lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, trails Democratic former U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger in opinion polls.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Democrats say they are fighting fire with fire after Trump unleashed a rare mid-decade redistricting push starting in Texas, where the legislature enacted new maps designed to flip five seats to the Republican column. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The system is being rigged by a wannabe dictator out of Washington,\" Democratic state Senator Aaron Rouse said on Friday during debate over the bill.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At Trump's behest, Missouri and North Carolina followed Texas with their own redistricting measures aimed at picking up one additional Republican seat each. Indiana's Republican governor has called a special session next week to consider redistricting, and Republicans in Florida and Kansas have also said they are weighing redrawing their maps.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the deeply Democratic-led state of California, the party launched a redistricting counter-offensive seeking to flip five Republican-held seats, a plan that requires voter approval in a special election on Tuesday. As in Virginia, California's lawmakers and voters must alter their state's constitution to clear the way for a new partisan map.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The process of redistricting - the periodic redrawing of the boundaries that define each state's congressional and legislative districts - has traditionally been conducted just once a decade to account for demographic changes following the decennial U.S. Census.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have used redistricting to draw congressional maps to favor their own party, a practice known as partisan gerrymandering.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>OHIO REACHES BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In Ohio, state law required a new map this year because the previous map - under which Republicans won 10 of the state's 15 U.S. House seats last year - was passed with no Democratic support.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Ohio Redistricting Commission, which includes five Republicans and two Democrats, unanimously approved a new map on Friday that makes two Democratic incumbents more vulnerable to Republican challenges next year, while shifting another competitive Democratic-held district further to the left.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While favorable to Republicans, the map represents a compromise struck between Republicans and Democrats reflecting the uncertainty each party could have faced if the commission had failed to reach an agreement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In that scenario, the task of redistricting would have reverted to the Republican-controlled legislature, giving lawmakers a chance to pursue a far more aggressive map. But any bill passed by the legislature would have potentially been subject to a Democratic-backed voter referendum that could have kept the old map in place.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under Friday's map, Republicans have 10 \"safe\" seats in 2026 while Democrats have two, according to Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, which handicaps congressional races. The remaining three seats are rated \"Leans Republican,\" \"Leans Democratic\" and \"Toss-up\" - all considered competitive.</span></p></span></div></div>",
