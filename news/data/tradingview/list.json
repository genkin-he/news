Some of these limitations are:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and the cash requirements for such replacements are not reflected in EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Earnings Per Share exclude the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, which is a necessary element of certain of our acquisitions.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>The omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not include the payment of taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Earnings Per Share should not be considered as measures of cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by not viewing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Earnings Per Share in isolation and specifically by using other U.S. GAAP measures, such as net sales and operating profit, to measure our operating performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and they should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our calculations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Earnings Per Share may not be comparable to the calculations of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Future Looking Statements</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>This press release includes express or implied forward-looking statements.

Our expectations and beliefs are expressed in management's good faith, and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them, however, the forward-looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, or changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to changes in global, regional, or local economic, business, competitive, market, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that these factors include but are not limited to the following: the almost exclusive focus of our business on the aerospace and defense industry; our heavy reliance on certain customers for a significant portion of our sales; the fact that we have in the past consummated acquisitions and our intention to continue to pursue acquisitions, and that our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms, or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations; and the other risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on March 31, 2025, as well as the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K that will be filed following this earnings release, and other periodic reports filed by the Company from time to time with the SEC.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this press release.

Any forward-looking statement made by us in this press release speaks only as of the date of this press release and is expressly qualified in its entirety by the cautionary statements included in this press release. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, investments, or other strategic transactions we may make.

With over 700 GW of grid connection requests currently overwhelming utilities, state regulators are increasingly pushing back amid rising consumer energy costs and localized grid instability.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lithium's Role in Backup Storage and Grid Resilience</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lithium-ion batteries have become essential components of Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) systems - providing instant backup power during outages to prevent data loss and enable safe generator startup - as well as peak shaving and renewable energy integration for resilient, round-the-clock data center operations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The U.S. added a record 58 GWh of battery energy storage in 2025, with lithium demand climbing 55% year-over-year as grid operators adapt to new realities. Elektros' high-purity lithium is uniquely positioned to enable scalable Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), serving as a critical bridge between data centers and sustainable long-term power solutions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Lithium is the backbone of this emerging energy ecosystem,\" said Shlomo Bleier, Chief Executive Officer of Elektros Inc. \"Our vertically integrated supply chain positions Elektros to play a meaningful role in fueling tomorrow's critical infrastructure.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors can access the IR Agent at www.elektros.energy/investors</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>About Elektros, Inc.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Elektros Inc.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Mark Hulbert</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investment professionals rarely outperform in a bull market. If you want stock picking to pay off, you're essentially rooting for a crash.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Will this year bring a bear market?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If this really is a time for stock pickers to get greedy, then a market downturn is likely.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investment advisers hoping for a return of a \"stock-pickers market\" should be careful what they wish for. I'm referring to the age-old distinction between an investment environment in which most stocks march to the beats of their own individual drummers (a so-called \"market of stocks\") and its opposite, an environment in which most stocks rise and fall in tandem with each other (a so-called \"stock market\").</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a \"stock market\" the best strategy is simply investing in a broad stock-market index fund, while in a \"market of stocks\" the strategy most likely to beat the market is picking and choosing individual stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There have been a rash of declarations that we have entered a market-of-stocks environment. Bloomberg even declared that \"for stock pickers, now might be the time to get greedy.\" But what many analysts don't appreciate is that the distinction between these two market environments is correlated with the market's cycle. Stock picking is far more likely to be successful when the overall market is falling than when it's rising. To hope for a \"market of stocks\" is functionally equivalent in many ways to hoping for a bear market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This functional equivalence is illustrated in the accompanying chart. Each dot represents one of the calendar years since 1981; its place on the vertical axis represents the percentage of investment newsletter portfolios that beat the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index XX:W5000FLT in that calendar year (as measured by the portfolios tracked by my performance auditing firm). Each dot's place along the horizontal axis reflects the Wilshire 5000's return in that year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notice the steep downwardly sloping trendline that best fits these dots, the statistical significance of which is quite high (as signified by its impressive r-squared). That means, on average, more portfolios beat the market when the stock market is falling - and vice versa. The implication: If it's really time for stock pickers to get greedy, then the market as a whole is likely to fall.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Last year is a good case in point. The broad market, as measured by the Wilshire 5000's total return, gained 17.1% in 2025 - well-above the U.S. stock market's long-term average rate of return. Sure enough, stock pickers struggled: Just 31% of monitored investment newsletter portfolios beat the market, in fact. A similarly low proportion of actively-managed equity funds and ETFs beat the market, according to Morningstar's Active/Passive Barometer - just 38%.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Of course, none of this discussion sheds any light on whether there actually will be a bear market in 2026, and therefore whether or not the odds favor stock picking.

These programs outlined mineralization over approximately 1,200 meters laterally and to depths approaching 900 meters. The mineralized horizon occurs at the contact between mafic and felsic volcanic units, a geological setting characteristic of volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits..</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Recent compilation of historical data by the Company suggests that the known mineralization may be controlled by a large-scale fold structure, leaving open the possibility of additional lateral and structural extensions that remain partially or entirely untested.

The Company holds a 100% interest in the Bousquet (Au), Langlade (Cu, Zn, Ag, Au), Bodo (Cu, Au, Ag, Zn, Ni, Li, Co, Mn, Pb) and Terragold (Au) projects.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Bousquet Project has been optioned to the Australian company Olympio Metals (Oly), which may acquire up to an 80% interest in the gold project in consideration for C$1.25 million in cash and shares, as well as C$2 million in exploration expenditures. Should Olympio fulfill all its obligations, Bullion would retain a 20% net carried, undivided non-participating interest.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Langlade Project (72 claims - 4,127 ha) is a volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) project currently in development and drill-ready.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Bodo Project (761 claims - 410 km²) is an early-stage exploration project. Anomalous and indicative occurrences of critical and strategic minerals (Au, Ag, Cu, Zn, Ni, Li, Pb, Co, Mn) have been identified across the property. The main showings - Rivon Lake, Canico, Licé, Tichégami and Didi - demonstrate polymetallic, VMS and IOC potential.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bullion recently acquired the Terragold Project, located in the Senneterre region of Abitibi. The main showing, known since the early 1960s, has been intersected by drilling over a cumulative strike length of approximately 2 kilometres and has not been the subject of exploration work since 1984. The mineralized corridor associated with a quartz-porphyry system remains open in all directions. The Company plans to undertake various exploration activities on this project in 2026.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>For further information, please contact:</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Guy Morissette</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>President and CEO</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>gmorissette@bulliongold.ca</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Other Information</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><em><span>The TSX Venture Exchange and its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts no responsibility for the veracity or accuracy of its content.</span></em></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Forward-Looking Statements:</span></strong><em><span> This press release contains forward-looking statements.
