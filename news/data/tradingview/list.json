We no longer see Bitcoin mining operations as the end goal, but instead as a means to an end, and that end is maximizing the value of our megawatts,” he said, adding: </span></p><div class=\"blockquote-xrkxvh37\"><span>“Over time, this means transitioning the megawatts in our power portfolio for data center development. Ready-for-service power in the right locations is increasingly scarce and valuable, which in turn forms the basis for the enormous value creation opportunity ahead of us.”</span></div><p class=\"\"><span>As per the firm’s Q3 report, Riot posted a record quarterly revenue of $180.2 million, up 112.5% from Q3 2024 and net income of $104.5 million compared to a net loss of $154.4 million the year before. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The firm also saw a 27% increase in Bitcoin (BTC) mining production year-over-year, mining 1,406 BTC in Q3 and taking its total tally up to 19,287 BTC, worth over $2.1 billion at current prices. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Notably, 90% of Riot’s Q3 revenue came from its Bitcoin mining ventures, indicating the firm still has a significant reliance on digital gold. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Commenting on this, Kane said Riot will continue to maximize potential in Bitcoin mining but will use the funds to support its data center-focused plans. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“We will continue to utilize the opportunity Bitcoin mining brings to secure power and drive strong cash flow that we will leverage to support the ongoing transformation of our overall business,” he said. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Will Bitcoin mining just be a side hustle? </span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Riot started laying the groundwork for a diversification strategy at the beginning of this year, after the firm paused building out any further Bitcoin mining projects at Corsicana, instead seeking out new opportunities to set up high-performance infrastructure geared toward AI.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Alongside the financial results, the firm announced the “initiation of the core and shell development” of the first two buildings on its Corsicana Data campus in Texas, which will account for a “combined 112 megawatts of critical IT data center capacity.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Moving forward, the Riot executives outlined their intentions to fill every spare bit of land at Corsicana, eventually turning it into a “1 gigawatt utility-load data center campus.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>“It’s all under the lens of maximizing the value of all of the megawatts that we have, trying to leave no unutilized power while we aggressively build out the data center business. Eventually, we aim to have the entire site be a one-gigawatt utility-load data center campus,” noted CEO Jason Les. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Magazine: </span></strong><span>Mysterious Mr Nakamoto author: Finding Satoshi would hurt Bitcoin</span></p></span></div></div>",

They tell clients in a note that market feedback is positive on the strength of sales, and reckon that JB Hi-Fi's relatively short fulfillment time should benefit its December-quarter performance. Longer term, they see sales growth driven by a continued upgrade cycle, including in laptop computers. Macquarie lifts its target price 2.5% to A$121.00 and keeps its outperform rating on the stock, which is down 3.5% at A$104.70. (stuart.condie@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
