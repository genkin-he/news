class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>CEO Kari Sundbäck</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The implementation of the strategy we published in June progressed rapidly during the third quarter. Our strategic focus was reflected in the strengthened order backlog and the improved adjusted EBITDA margin in our core businesses. We sold our Marine and Offshore Unit to Davie at the beginning of the review period, completing the strategic refocusing started in summer 2024 and allowing us to fully concentrate on increasing shareholder value in our core business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tomorrow’s society is powered by clean energy and is built on reliable connections. Electricity consumption in our markets grows significantly, which means accelerating investments in the transmission grid. For example, Fingrid predicts that electricity consumption in Finland will double between 2025 and 2035. Finland’s well-functioning energy market attracts investments in our core businesses' strong areas of expertise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Our updated strategy responds to the market change and provides a clear direction for our business. Our strategic goal is to be a trusted lifecycle partner for our customers operating in energy transmission and production, the industrial energy transition, and telecommunications, as well as in growing customer segments such as data centres. We aim for profitable growth in Finland, the Baltics and selectively elsewhere in the Nordics. The foundation of Enersense’s business lies in efficiently and transparently executed projects and services. In addition, we optimise the lifecycle performance of our customers’ networks, systems and production facilities. Our lifecycle offering covers design, construction, operation and maintenance, as well as upgrades and modernisations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The order backlog of our core businesses continued to grow for the second consecutive period, rising to EUR 379 (335) million. We are developing our lifecycle offering in close cooperation with our customers. Third-quarter revenue for the core businesses declined by 11% from the comparison period due to a smaller project portfolio and large projects carried out in the Baltics during the comparison period.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The relative profitability of the core businesses has continued to improve throughout the beginning of the year. Adjusted EBITDA for the core businesses improved to EUR 9.2 (8.7) million, and the adjusted EBITDA margin strengthened to EUR 11.2 (9.6) per cent. Strengthening profitability and our financial base are elementary for to advancing the development outlined in our strategy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Journey towards lifecycle partnership progressing</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>We continued our Value Uplift programme, aimed at supporting profitable growth, and made progress in assessing fixed costs and resources. We renewed our operating model to support the implementation of the strategy and to reinforce our ability to respond to future needs with the right kind of expertise. As a result of the renewal, our responsibility areas are clearer and our performance is better. The operating model became effective after the review period on 1 October 2025.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The measures implemented in the Value Uplift programme by the end of September to improve procurement performance will contribute EUR 4 million improvement to the annual EBIT/EBITDA run-rate. During the rest of the year, we will continue to develop our procurement performance and aim for an annual EBIT/EBITDA run-rate improvement of EUR 5 million by the end of the year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We have set ambitious climate targets that will enable us to improve our customers’ sustainability. After the review period, in October, we submitted our climate targets for validation in accordance with the Science Based Targets Initiative and drew up a climate roadmap. At the same time, we conducted practical climate actions; we started in Satakunta on a substation built from recycled steel, and by the end of the year, we will have replaced a third of our service vehicles in Finland with electric ones.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>During the year, we have built a solid foundation for Enersense’s profitable growth and increased shareholder value. The commitment of our employees and valuable feedback from our customers help us achieve our goal of being a trusted lifecycle partner for our Power, Energy Transition and Connectivity customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Significant events after the review period</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>On 7 October 2025, Enersense announced that Fingrid selected Enersense to construct 100 kilometres of new 400-kilovolt transmission line in Central Finland. The project includes dismantling the old line, constructing a new one and connecting the new line to four different substations. The project is worth approximately EUR 27 million and was recorded in the company’s order backlog for the third quarter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On 24 October 2025, Enersense announced that it had completed the share buyback programme. Between 19 August and 23 October 2025, Enersense repurchased a total of 187,713 of its own shares at an average price of EUR 3.727. The repurchases of the buy-back programme reduced the company’s unrestricted equity by EUR 699,548. Following the completion of the programme, Enersense held 187,713 of treasury shares, corresponding to approximately 1.1% of the total number of shares.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On 27 October 2025, Anu Henttonen (Master of Education, Licentiate of Science (Technology)) was appointed as EVP, HR, HSEQ, Communications and Sustainability, and a member of Enersense’s Group Leadership Team.

The contract covers the entire project from design to construction and commissioning. Valued at approximately EUR 27 million, it is the largest individual substation project in Enersense’s history.
