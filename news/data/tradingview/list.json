I have always sought to make decisions in the best interests of the Group, its clients, its employees, and its shareholders. Over recent months, I have devoted all my energy with Chairman Moulay Hafid Elalamy and Thomas Mackenbrock to ensuring that the Group is not only able to navigate change, but to emerge stronger as the agentic revolution unfolds, offering exceptional opportunities for those able to make the right decisions and execute them with strength, discipline, and speed. In light of these necessary changes, we concluded that Jorge was the right person and I am pleased to entrust him with the leadership of a solid Group, which again in 2025 demonstrated the resilience of its business model in a challenging environment, while delivering its transformation agenda. I am fully aware of the extraordinary privilege I have had in leading this Group, and at this moment I feel deep gratitude toward all those I have encountered along the way, starting with our clients. I will leave the Group with great confidence in its strengths and its prospects. As founder, I have been--and will remain--a long-term shareholder, and I intend to further support TP as we enter this new chapter.\" Jorge Amar, designated CEO of TP Group, commented: \"I am very pleased to be joining TP, a group I have come to know in depth over the last year. I would like to thank Chairman Moulay Hafid Elalamy and founder Daniel Julien for their trust. I am fully aware of the responsibility I am assuming. Since the unveiling of Future Forward, important decisions have been made, and significant progress has been achieved. We now need to accelerate rolling out our existing offerings, enriching our solution portfolio, and enabling our clients to capture the efficiency and productivity gains that technology now makes possible. I am eager to get to work and to deliver on the 2028 objectives we have set for ourselves.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Thomas Mackenbrock, incoming Board Member, said: \"Working alongside Chairman Moulay Hafid, Daniel and the exceptional team at TP has been a remarkable experience.

As I am transitioning to the Board of Directors, I do so with confidence in the direction Jorge will take this Group.

The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance, business operations, strategic initiatives, and the challenges it faces in the current market environment.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Financial Highlights</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>POOL CORP reported net sales of $5,289.4 million for 2025, maintaining consistency with the previous year. The company's gross profit stood at $1,572.5 million, with a gross margin of 29.7%, unchanged from 2024. Operating income was $580.2 million, reflecting a 6% decrease from the prior year, primarily due to increased operating expenses driven by technology investments and inflationary pressures. Net income for 2025 was $406.4 million, down from $434.3 million in 2024, influenced by the absence of a prior year import tax reversal benefit. The diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $10.85, a 4% decline from $11.30 in 2024, impacted by a lower tax benefit from share-based payment accounting.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Business Highlights</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>POOL CORP continues to hold a dominant position in the industry as the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment, and related leisure products. The company operates 456 sales centers across North America, Europe, and Australia, distributing products through five main networks: SCP Distributors, Superior Pool Products, Horizon Distributors, National Pool Trends, and Sun Wholesale Supply. Serving approximately 125,000 customers, primarily small, entrepreneurial, family-owned businesses, the company offers over 200,000 products, including pool maintenance products, repair and replacement parts, building materials, pool equipment, irrigation products, and commercial pool products.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2025, approximately 95% of sales were generated in North America, with California, Florida, Texas, and Arizona accounting for about 53% of net sales. The company also operates in Europe and Australia, contributing 4% and less than 1% of sales, respectively. Sales segmentation for 2025 showed that 64% of sales were from recurring maintenance and minor repair, 22% from pool remodeling and upgrades, and 14% from new pool construction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Looking ahead, POOL CORP plans to open 5 to 8 new sales centers in 2026 and make selective acquisitions. The company expects sales to increase slightly, with a focus on leveraging existing infrastructure and managing discretionary spending. The business remains highly seasonal, with peak sales and operating income occurring in the second and third quarters, and weather conditions significantly impacting sales.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Strategic Initiatives</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>POOL CORP is focused on expanding its geographic presence by opening new sales centers and making selective acquisitions when appropriate opportunities arise. The company is also investing in technology and automation to enhance operational efficiency and customer service. In 2025, POOL CORP repurchased $346.3 million of its own shares and paid $184.9 million in cash dividends. The company utilized its credit facilities to manage liquidity and fund operations, maintaining a target leverage ratio between 1.5 and 2.0. Capital expenditures were approximately 1.1% of net sales, consistent with previous years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For 2026, POOL CORP projects earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $10.85 to $11.15. The company plans to continue using cash for dividend payments and opportunistic share repurchases, maintaining capital expenditure at approximately 1% to 1.5% of net sales. The company aims to fund these through cash from operations and borrowings, leveraging its digital transformation initiatives and existing investments to drive growth and efficiency.</span></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Challenges and Risks</span></strong></p><span> </span><p class=\"\"><span>POOL CORP operates in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, facing intense competition from national, regional, and local distributors, as well as mass market retailers and internet-based merchants. The low barriers to entry in the industry could lead to new competitors emerging, particularly in key markets like California, Florida, Texas, and Arizona, which represent a significant portion of the company's sales.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The company is exposed to several macroeconomic risks, including unfavorable economic conditions that could reduce consumer discretionary spending, impacting sales of swimming pool, irrigation, and outdoor living products. High interest rates and inflation have already led to decreased new pool construction and remodeling activities. Additionally, the company faces operational risks from adverse weather conditions, which can significantly impact sales during peak seasons.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Supply chain disruptions pose a risk, particularly if key suppliers decide to bypass distribution channels or face operational difficulties. The reliance on a few large suppliers for a significant portion of product costs poses a risk if these suppliers change their terms or face financial instability. Technological risks include the potential for cybersecurity attacks and the challenges of integrating artificial intelligence responsibly into business operations. The evolving legal and regulatory landscape around AI and data privacy could impose additional compliance costs and risks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Regulatory risks include potential changes in environmental, health, and safety regulations, which could increase operational costs. The company also faces risks from international operations, including currency fluctuations and compliance with foreign laws. Management plans to leverage existing infrastructure and manage discretionary spending strategically, while continuing to invest in digital transformation to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency. The company expects to face continued inflationary pressures and plans to pass these costs through to customers where possible, leveraging technological solutions to enhance capacity and efficiency.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>SEC Filing: </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000119312526074833/pool-20251231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">POOL CORP [ POOL ] - 10-K - Feb. 26, 2026</a></p></span></div></div>",
