When activated in an uncontrolled manner, the complement cascade over-responds, leading the body to attack its own healthy cells. Concurrent binding of gefurulimab to serum albumin provides an extended half-life, enabling once-weekly dosing.

The Dutch lender announced 1.6 billion in new investor payouts and lifted its full-year revenue forecast to about 22.8 billion, from 22.6 billion previously. The return will come via a 1.1 billion share buyback and a 500 million dividendsending the stock up as much as 4.8% in Amsterdam, its biggest jump since May. RBC Capital's Anke Reingen said the raised outlook positions ING well for 2026 and 2027, as management leans on fee growth and disciplined balance-sheet strategy to steady the ship beyond the rate-peak cycle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Quarterly results underscored that pivot. Net income fell 4.9% year-on-year to 1.79 billion but still beat analysts' expectations of 1.65 billion. Fee and commission income jumped 16% to 1.17 billion as the bank expanded investment products and underwriting of larger transactions, offsetting flat net interest income of 3.71 billion. CFO Tanate Phutrakul told Bloomberg TV that after years of excess capital distributions, the bank is now operating at the right level of around 13% capital, suggesting shareholder returns could normalize as ING focuses on stability over sheer payout volume.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That 13% figure isn't arbitraryit marks an increase in the bank's CET1 capital target to meet tighter regulatory demands, up from a prior plan of 12.5%. The adjustment slightly narrows ING's flexibility for future buybacks, but also strengthens its balance sheet against macro headwinds. The latest 1.1 billion buyback is smaller than the one announced in May, signaling a more cautious capital stance. With Ida Lerner set to take over as CFO next year and Ljiljana Cortan stepping up as head of wholesale banking, CEO Steven van Rijswijk's strategy seems aimed at building durable fee-based income growth while keeping investors close through consistent, if measured, returns.</span></p></span></div></div>",

Now, with the exponential growth in artificial intelligence (AI) applications, high-performance computing and advanced memory are driving a new wave of demand for semiconductor chips - and stretching the limits of traditional manufacturing processes in semiconductor fabrication facilities, also called \"fabs.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Industry groups project global wafer-fabrication equipment spending will set new records in 2025 as manufacturers add capacity to support AI and advanced packaging, like those driven by the latest chip designs. In addition to industry-leading trends like chiplets, hybrid bonding, and 3D integration, technologies like silicon photonics and co-packaged optics (CPOs) will reshape how chips are interconnected, driving new requirements for yield, flatness, and thermal stability. Meeting these needs requires not just new tools, but also new materials that can improve efficiency, reduce waste, and shorten time-to-yield.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"3M collaborates and innovates with our customers and eco-system partners to push the boundaries of materials science to help them unlock new efficiencies across the fab,\" said Lung Lin, vice president of 3M Display and Electronics. \"From cleaner, flatter surfaces for next-generation interconnects, to smarter thermal solutions, our innovations are designed to help improve process stability and deliver efficiency. And as new technologies like silicon photonics and co-packaged optics emerge, we're ready to help our customers integrate them with confidence.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Materials that enable efficiency across the fab</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>For decades, 3M has partnered with semiconductor manufacturers to deliver advanced materials that support cleaner processes, higher yields, and greater throughput. Today, our portfolio spans multiple stages of wafer manufacturing:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>CMP materials (pads, and composite systems): Enable precise planarization - these polishing materials smooth each wafer layer so the next one can be built on a perfectly flat surface.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Pad conditioners: Maintain pad performance and uniformity - these pads act like \"refreshening\" tools to keep polishing pads effective, making sure that wafers are polished evenly.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Wafer support systems including bonding and protective tapes: Support wafer thinning, handling, and backside processing - these tapes hold wafers securely during processing, then the tapes remove easily</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>Heat-resistant tapes: Safeguards sensitive parts of the chip through soldering, molding, and high-temperature processing.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Each of these solutions reflects 3M's ability to apply deep expertise in abrasives, adhesives, and thermal management to some of the most complex manufacturing environments in the world.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Aligning with industry trends</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Global shifts are reinforcing the need for advanced semiconductor materials:</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>AI and packaging growth: As AI chips get larger and pull in more memory, the connections between different parts of the chips need to be ultra-precise, requiring extremely flat, clean, and bondable wafer surfaces that fit and work together reliably.</span></p></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><p class=\"\"><span>3D integration and chiplets: Instead of just making chips smaller, manufacturers are stacking them and linking smaller chiplets together, driving new approaches to stacking and interconnecting.

The International Energy Agency projects that global data center electricity use could more than double by 2030, with AI noted as a leading driver. That's why 3M's broader energy solutions, including sensored cable accessories, and optical interconnects - complement our semiconductor offerings. Together, they support a more sustainable digital infrastructure, from the wafer fabrication to the data center.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>3M is committed to advancing the semiconductor industry through materials innovation.

The list of companies announcing layoffs continues to grow. Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft, Intel Corp, United Parcel Service, Applied Materials, and Target are just some of the names disclosing job cuts in recent weeks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Shares of payroll processors, staffing firms, and the like — companies that often lead employment trends — have begun to weaken. Stocks like Automatic Data Processing, Paychex, Robert Half, and ManpowerGroup are rolling over from multi-month highs. With no official job numbers thanks to the government shutdown, the market is using these stocks to send a cautionary message. The old adage \"stocks don't lie, people do\" comes to mind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When technicians see blatant weakness in individual stocks while indexes trade at all-time highs, it is a red flag. Take the S&amp;P 500's 17% year to date return, which has it within a stone's throw of the very round 7000 number, and hold it up against some of these names.</span></p><ul class=\"list-bmN0_SHH list--padded-bmN0_SHH\"><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Robert Half, is down 61% in 2025 and paying a dividend of almost 9%. That   is dangerously high and likely unsustainable.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Automatic Data Processing, on a nine-week losing streak and down another   7% this week after yesterday's ugly earnings reaction.   </span></li><li class=\"listItem-bmN0_SHH\"><span>Paychex has declined 13 of the last 20 weeks and has shed nearly one   third of its value since its 52-week high in early June. </span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span>Bottom line: this sector is facing headwinds and deserves re-evaluation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Two software stocks in this sector are showing particularly worrisome charts: Paycom Software and Paylocity Holding. The former I wrote about one month ago and yesterday it broke below a bear flag pattern. Round number theory is coming into play as well, with the $200 figure acting as the trigger. The explosive downside move we are seeing this week was preceded by four consecutive weeks that closed very tautly, all within 1%. This should now see a potential move toward $165 by year end, 12% below today's price. Notice that since the start of September, the 200-day simple moving average has started to slope lower, often a canary in the coal mine. The bearish move began with a bearish rounded top breakdown. This drop speaks volumes. Paycom Software reports earnings after the close on Nov. 5.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paycom Software was trading around $187 Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Paylocity Holding, a payroll software company focused on midsize companies, is also feeling the pain. The stock advanced in just three sessions during the entire month of September, demonstrating how persistent the selling has been. Bearish filled-in candles were recorded after earnings on Feb. 7 and Aug. 6. The stock currently trades 37% off its most recent 52-week high and is 14% from the April low. The chart shows how it has been stuck below its 21-day exponential moving average the last three months. Yesterday it slumped 5% in ballooning volume, breaking below a bear flag. This looks like it could move toward $115 by year end, 19% below today's prices. Paylocity Holding reports earnings Nov. 5 after the close.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The stock was trading around $142 Thursday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Doug Busch at douglas.busch@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
