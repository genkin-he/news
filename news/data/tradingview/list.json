            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Tom Wilk</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I didn't realize it then, but I received my first piece of advice about when to claim Social Security benefits 60 years ago, when I was 10.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For me, 1966 was a year of transition. My mother remarried that July, 14 months after my father died of a heart attack at age 41. My sister, my mother and I moved to a new town to live with our new father, also a widower, and his son.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The adjustment wasn't always easy. When things got tense, my new dad used to say, \"Patience is a virtue.\" That old saw became a household mantra — a reminder to think before acting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As an adult, I learned that patience had financial applications. Don't make major purchases impulsively. And perhaps most consequential of all: Don't be in a hurry to claim Social Security benefits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That patience paid off when I turned 70 on New Year's Day and received my first Social Security check shortly thereafter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Weighty decision</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financial planners often describe Social Security as the best annuity available. It lasts for life, rises with inflation and provides a guaranteed income stream. The longer you wait to claim, the larger that stream becomes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Waiting isn't for everyone. Some people need the income earlier in retirement to make ends meet. Others may be in poor health and doubt they will live long enough to benefit from waiting. Still others don't trust the government to deliver full benefits, given Social Security's long-term funding challenges or the possibility of congressional changes to shore up the system.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In fact, when I talked with friends and family in my early 60s, I learned that most had claimed benefits sometime between 62 and full retirement age. Of the roughly 20 people I asked, only two waited until 70. That tracks with national data: About 90% of new Social Security claims come from people younger than 70, according to the Social Security Administration.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In the end, deciding when to claim Social Security is personal, shaped by one's health, finances and family circumstances.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Why  I  waited</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Based on financial and personal considerations — and a suggestion from our financial advisor — I resolved not to take Social Security at age 62 and wait until at least full retirement age, which for me was 66 and two months. And after reaching full retirement age in 2022, I decided I could hold out for nearly four more years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For me, the decision came down to a few factors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>First, by waiting, I increased the survivor benefit Elizabeth, my wife, will receive if I die first. She is six years and four months younger than I am, and this extra income could come in handy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>What's more, Elizabeth and I were fortunate to be financially prepared for retirement. Her full-time job covered our health insurance, and I supplemented our income with contract work for newspapers and magazines. An inheritance and a timely refinancing allowed us to pay off our mortgage nearly two years early, and we invested a portion of the remainder to generate dividend income.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To supplement our income, I began taking penalty-free monthly distributions from a SEP individual retirement account at age 60. I later tapped my Roth IRA for a monthly check starting at 63.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Longevity was a wild card given my father's early death. But my Mom lived five months past her 90th birthday in 2015, and I am in good health.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>No regrets</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Recently, I found a Social Security statement from late 2017. Had I claimed benefits at 62 in January 2018, I would have received $1,715 a month — about $2,242 in January 2026 dollars. At full retirement age, my benefit would have been $2,980 a month. By waiting until 70, my monthly benefit is just under $4,000.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>My break-even point — the age at which I will receive as much in benefits as I would have had I claimed when first eligible — is somewhere around age 81 or 82, depending on cost-of-living increases.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even if I don't hit break-even, I don't regret waiting. Frugality is a habit. We learned to spend conservatively and look for savings wherever possible, including shopping for groceries on senior-discount days. I drove a 2003 Toyota Corolla for 22 years and more than 200,000 miles — and would probably still be driving it if I hadn't been rear-ended in 2024.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I may splurge on something after receiving a few checks, though extravagance isn't really our style. Elizabeth retired in August 2024, and we decided to put off any long-distance traveling until I started collecting. We took a family trip to Florida in February.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There's no perfect time to take it,\" my financial advisor once told me about claiming Social Security benefits. When people ask him when they should start collecting, he says he needs just one piece of information. \"Let me know when you're going to die.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to editors@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Tom Wilk, of Pitman, N.J., is a retired journalist.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Yasmeen Serhan</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    As the United States prepares to mark 250 years since its founding, Ken Burns is urging viewers to revisit that moment anew. The award-winning documentarian — whose work has chronicled everything from the Civil War to the history of jazz — spent nearly a decade on his latest 12-hour series, “The American Revolution,” which premiered on PBS in November. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Speaking with Reuters at the British Library in London ahead of the film’s international release this summer, Burns discusses the myths and nostalgia that define many Americans’ understanding of the revolutionary period and his guarded optimism for the next 250 years. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    What first drew you to filmmaking — and to films about U.S. history, in particular?  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I knew by age 12, out of tragedy, that I wanted to be a filmmaker. My mother had cancer and had spent my entire conscious life dying, and then died when I was 11. When I was 12, I watched my dad cry — who I had never seen cry — at an old movie called \"Odd Man Out\" and I decided to be a Hollywood filmmaker.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By the time I got to Hampshire College in the fall of 1971, all of the teachers were social documentary still photographers. So I suddenly was (into) documentary. And then I realized that I had this completely untrained and untutored interest in American history. I don't know where it came from other than this just deep, abiding curiosity about how the country works.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Your latest film recounts what you describe as the most profound revolution in history. How did telling this story compare to some of your past projects?  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>I’ve dealt in 18th-century subjects before ... but this has no photographs. It has no newsreels. And so it presents problems. I've not been a big fan of reenactments and so what we did is over five or six years of filming (we) collected a critical mass of photography in a very impressionistic way of people who do reenactments. We collected enough material that we could use, so a volley from a set of British soldiers firing their muskets dissolves into a painting of the very same thing. And so you treat the paintings as if they're live and you treat the live as if they're paintings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We've always had complex narratives. We've always been interested in lots of different ways to see the subjects and, to use the American baseball metaphor, to call balls and strikes. We just say what actually happened. The heroes are not diminished; they just have more dimension. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>And so our films are filled with not just top-down but bottom-up stories: In this case, of women who are essential to keeping the resistance in the decade before the revolution going and are at every single battle, sometimes fighting, but more often than not burying the dead, washing the clothes. We follow many children who sign up and fight; teenagers fighting, seasoned veterans at 18 or 19. And then Native American and Black (populations). And then of course we want to know what a British and Irish soldier felt, what a German soldier felt, what the French were involved in, what the Spanish were thinking and give dimension and multiplicity to those Native American tribes that (history) just sort of reduced to a single \"them.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    And not unlike your past projects, this one took nearly a decade to complete, right?  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are literally a million decisions you have to make that overcome difficulties to be able to do this, which is why it takes us 10 years — and why I've stayed with public broadcasting because I couldn't have done any of these films. I could get the money instantly. The fundraising is a pain and goes on for most of those 10 years. But nobody (else) would give me 10 years to do it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The recent rescission that eliminated the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is devastating to us. It's even more devastating for the new filmmaker coming up or for the rural stations. We’ll get by. We'll figure out how to do it. It's still the best place to be.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    Most Americans learn a sentimental version of the country’s origin story — taxes, tea, freedom. But your series argues that democracy wasn’t an intention of the Revolution so much as an inadvertent byproduct. What do people most misunderstand about the founding moment?  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We sentimentalize it for understandable reasons. We know it’s about really big ideas and we don’t want those ideas diminished by the real stuff, so we suppress the violence of it. We say you can get an A on your test if you say taxes and representation. But it's really Indian land, taxes, and representation. And then all of a sudden it's \"pay no attention to those people on the other side of the woods.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We called the Congress that we set up the Continental Congress. We put George Washington at the head of the Continental Army. We knew where we were going. We had dreams of empire. Americans like to say, \"Well, at least we're not like the empires of Britain and Spain and France and Portugal and the Netherlands.\" But in fact, we are. We took over in the continental United States 300 separate sovereign nations and we don't like to tell that story and we don't like to confuse it. And I think it’s always better to confuse it and it’s so much more interesting to understand all the range of characters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    And the film captures those characters while also pointing out their very clear contradictions, right?  George Washington, for example, rails against “enslavement” by British policy while himself enslaving hundreds.  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He's deeply flawed, he’s rash, and he makes really bad military decisions in a couple of really important cases. But he's able to inspire people in the dead of night to fight for this thing that's never been tried. He defers to Congress. He has an unbelievable humility. He's able to pick subordinate talent that is better than him and is not threatened by that. And he's convincing somebody from New Hampshire, where I live, and somebody from Georgia that they're not from separate countries, but they're one thing: American. And more important than anything else: He surrenders his military commission the second the war is over. Within weeks of the British leaving New York City, he resigns. And then he's unanimously elected president and then resigns that after two terms. That giving up of power has set in motion for at least 250 years this idea that the office is more important than the individuals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    This summer marks 250 years since American Independence. How are you feeling about the next 250?  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>You have this current political crisis that we're in, which is the lopsided power that the executive has taken vis-a-vis the legislative and the judicial (branches). It's unprecedented in that it's not happened at this highest level, but things happen. So I think that this is our supreme test. I think this — along with the Civil War and the Depression and the Second World War — is one of the greatest crises in American history. And in all those cases, we figured out a way. We were much more divided during the Revolution than we are now. We were much more divided during the Civil War, the Vietnam period, (and) the Depression than we are now. There's a bit of arrogance that the present always has, because we're alive, our stuff is the worst or the best or whatever. But a study of history tells you maybe it's not the worst.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    What’s next? Do you have another 10-year project in you?  </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>We've taken on a project on Reconstruction that has been going on for enough years that it might be close to 10 when it's out. I've just decided in the last year to do a film on the history of the CIA and that could take that long to get it right. What I've always said is that if I were given a thousand years to live, I wouldn't run out of topics in American history.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>    The perspectives expressed in Culture Current are the subject’s own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Reuters News. </span></p></span></div></div>",

If that is the case, the one named WOH G64 might be considered the stellar equivalent of Jimi Hendrix. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WOH G64, which is 28 times the mass of the sun and resides in a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way called the Large Magellanic Cloud, is one of a handful of the biggest stars known, just like Hendrix was in rock 'n' roll. And observations spanning more than three decades show it is behaving unlike any star seen before.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Astronomers have only an incomplete understanding of the life history of the largest stars, and the WOH G64 observations are providing new insight.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Researchers observed a change that occurred in 2014 in the star's color, corresponding to an increase in its surface temperature, as it evolved from red to yellow. The star had been classified as an extreme red supergiant but rapidly became a yellow hypergiant. This transition happened quickly, in cosmic terms, and with no evidence of an eruption or explosion.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Typically the evolution of a star takes place on timescales of billions of years. On human timescales, we only observe more abrupt and violent events, such as eruptions, the merger of two stars or their explosive deaths,\" said astronomer Gonzalo Muñoz-Sanchez, lead author of the research published this week in the journal Nature Astronomy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"No current stellar models can fully explain this transformation\" in WOH G64, said Muñoz-Sanchez, who worked on the study at the National Observatory of Athens.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Compared to the sun, its luminosity is about 300,000 times greater and its diameter about 1,500 times greater. If it were in the place of the sun, its surface would extend to a distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, our solar system's fifth and sixth planets. Traveling at the speed of light would take six hours to circumnavigate the star's surface.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>WOH G64, around 10 million years old, appears to be near the end of its lifespan. In contrast, the sun is about 4.5 billion years old and has an estimated 5 billion more years left. WOH G64 is located about 160,000 light-years from Earth. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"WOH G64 is a massive star and very different from the sun,\" Muñoz-Sanchez said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Stars between about eight and 23 times the sun's mass are expected to evolve into red supergiants and eventually explode as a supernova. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For stars in the range of 23 to 30 times the sun's mass, their fate is less certain. It remains unclear whether they go boom as a supernova, collapse directly into forming a black hole or evolve from a red supergiant phase into a yellow hypergiant stage before ending their lives. Black holes are exceptionally dense objects with gravity so strong not even light can escape.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Hence, WOH G64 might be the solution to this question,\" Muñoz-Sanchez said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adding another layer of complexity to understanding WOH G64  is the fact that the observations indicated it is gravitationally bound to another star in what is called a binary system. The researchers were unable to determine the size or characteristics of the stellar companion, but said the two might at some point merge.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The researchers have come up with hypotheses concerning WOH G64's recent changes. They said it may have experienced a violent episode predating the observational data that turned it red and is now returning to its usual yellow quiescent state. They said it also is possible that an interaction between WOH G64 and its companion had temporarily mimicked the appearance of a red supergiant.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"As astronomers continue to monitor this remarkable system, WOH G64 is poised to reshape our understanding of how the most massive stars live and die,\" Muñoz-Sanchez said.</span></p></span></div></div>",

As selling momentum fades across major assets, traders are increasingly focused on where the next reversal could begin. The XRP price rally narrative is now gaining traction in that context. Despite muted price action, a combination of on-chain accumulation, improving derivatives positioning, rising ETF inflows, and a constructive technical structure suggests that XRP may be approaching a structural bottom. The question now is whether XRP is quietly setting up for its next major move. Let’s take a closer look at what the on-chain data and charts are revealing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>XRP’s Taker Buy-Sell Ratio Shows Buyers Taking Control</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>One of the clearest short-term signals comes from the taker buy-sell ratio, which measures whether market participants are entering trades aggressively on the buy or sell side.</span></p><figure class=\"container-CvWHk7Ya\"><button class=\"previewButton-CvWHk7Ya\"><div class=\"preview-gDIex6UB fixedHeight-gDIex6UB preview-CvWHk7Ya\" style=\"height:inherit;margin:0 auto;max-height:600px;max-width:1066.6666666666667px;aspect-ratio:1.7777777777777777\"><picture class=\"picture-gDIex6UB\"><source src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/coinpedia:e7b2b4a3f094b-72066d77defa3ca516ffc9eca9872346-resized.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"XRP taker buy sell\" class=\"image-gDIex6UB image-CvWHk7Ya\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.tradingview.com/news/image/coinpedia:e7b2b4a3f094b-72066d77defa3ca516ffc9eca9872346-resized.webp\" style=\"background-color:#1c1b20\"/></picture></div></button></figure><p class=\"\"><span>Recent data shows the ratio consistently holding above the neutral 1.0 level, with repeated readings in the 1.05–1.12 range. This indicates that buy market orders are dominating, a sign of active demand rather than passive accumulation. Crucially, this shift has occurred while price remains range-bound. Historically, XRP rallies have tended to begin after taker dominance builds quietly, not when price is already breaking out. The current setup suggests traders are positioning early rather than reacting late.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>XRP’s Ledger Activity Confirms Network Engagement Is Holding Firm</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>Network data from the XRP Ledger reinforces the bullish undertone.

Cumulative net inflows now stand near $1.24 billion, while total net assets held across XRP ETFs remain stable around the $1.0–$1.06 billion range, despite broader market weakness.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>ETF inflows are particularly meaningful because they reflect longer-term institutional positioning, not short-term speculative trading. The fact that inflows are occurring during consolidation, rather than after a breakout, suggests early accumulation rather than momentum chasing. </span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>XRP Price Analysis: Cup-and-Handle Pattern Takes Shape</span></strong></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>XRP’s price chart is displaying a cup-and-handle pattern. The rounded base of the cup reflects a prolonged period of consolidation where selling pressure gradually weakened. This phase is typically associated with accumulation, as price stabilizes and volatility contracts. The current handle formation, a shallow pullback following the rounded recovery suggests controlled profit-taking rather than aggressive selling. </span></p><div class=\"container-n2KCMK3i\" data-qa-id=\"tweet-widget-container\"><blockquote class=\"blockquote-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"header-n2KCMK3i\"><span class=\"profile-n2KCMK3i\"><div class=\"avatar-n2KCMK3i\"></div><div class=\"name-n2KCMK3i\">STEPH IS CRYPTO</div><div class=\"username-n2KCMK3i\">@Steph_iscrypto</div></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"logo-n2KCMK3i\" role=\"img\"><svg height=\"28\" viewbox=\"0 0 28 28\" width=\"28\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M19.75 5h3.07l-6.7 7.62L24 23h-6.17l-4.84-6.3L7.46 23H4.4l7.17-8.16L4 5h6.33l4.37 5.75L19.75 5Zm-1.24 16h1.7L9.54 7H7.7l10.8 14Z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path></svg></span></div><div class=\"description-n2KCMK3i\"><p class=\"\"><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XRP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">BITSTAMP:XRPUSD</a><span> Cup and Handle formation. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Price target: $30 </span><a class=\"link-zw5jRdec icon-zw5jRdec\" href=\"https://t.co/skNiWldVmW\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/skNiWldVmW</a></p></div><span class=\"date-n2KCMK3i\">Feb 26, 2026</span><span class=\"border-n2KCMK3i\"></span><span class=\"socials-n2KCMK3i\"></span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Steph_iscrypto/status/2026986854101250401\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"></a></blockquote><div></div></div><p class=\"\"><span>As long as XRP holds above the lower boundary of the handle near $1.20, the structure remains valid.

Roughly $75 billion in total crypto market cap vanished before most traders even woke up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Over 154,000 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with total liquidations hitting $522 million. Of that, $449 million came from longs alone. The largest single wipeout was an $11.17 million BTC position on Aster.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But the real tell is in the derivatives data. BTC futures volume hit $76.27 billion in the past 24 hours while spot volume sat at just $7.62 billion, per CoinGlass data.

By October, it had climbed back to new all-time highs above $125,000. In April 2024, when Iran fired missiles at Israel, BTC fell to $61,000. Months later, it broke previous highs again.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>War crashes have historically acted as springboards. But there’s a catch.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong class=\"root-Tkn6WL2y\"><span>Why “Just Buy the Dip” Could Backfire This Time</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span>The market walking into this strike was already broken.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Bitcoin is down nearly 50% from its October 2025 peak of $126,000. The Fear and Greed Index sits at 14, deep in extreme fear territory. More critically, CryptoQuant confirmed that US spot Bitcoin ETFs have flipped to net sellers in February 2026, reversing last year’s trend when they were net buyers of 46,000 BTC.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On Deribit, the $60,000 put remains the largest put position by open interest at over 5,200 BTC, with the $55,000 put close behind at 4,657 BTC.

Exchange netflows show roughly 522 BTC leaving platforms, which is an accumulation signal even as retail panics. Someone is buying what others are panic-selling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The key level now is $63,100, where descending channel support sits. A clean break below that opens the door to $60,000. On the upside, $73,000 to $74,000 remains heavy resistance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The pattern says bounce. The structure says caution.

That can leave the other person in the dark about how to locate and access the family's accounts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Payal Adhikari, a Chicago pediatrician, came to this realization recently.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>When she got married in 2014, she had debt from medical school. Her husband, Shashank Sane, offered to handle their living expenses while she focused on paying off her student loans. As the years went by and they bought a house and had two children, they stayed in their lanes, with her managing the kids' lives and household needs and Sane managing the bills.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Late last year , she was reading a book called \"Strangers: A Memoir of Marriage,\" about a woman disentangling the family finances after her husband of 20 years abruptly leaves her. While Adhikari had no concerns about her husband running off, the book did get her thinking about how little she knew of their monetary logistics. If something happened to Sane, she wouldn't know where to begin handling the digital subscriptions, bills and investments.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"I was overwhelmed by the number of things I didn't know,\" she says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Adhikari told her husband she wanted to get up to speed. She jotted down questions: What accounts were the streaming services and athletic club membership paid out of? Who held their life and disability insurance policies? To whom did they make car payments? Where were all their passwords?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sane, an energy company executive, says he was happy to oblige. He had seen the trouble his mother had gone through to access accounts after his father died a few years prior. (My colleague Veronica Dagher recently wrote about a woman who spent a year untangling her family finances following the death of her husband.)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"The concept of dividing the responsibilities of the house and family makes sense, but knowing what's happening is important,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Spreadsheets and coffee</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With her list of unknowns complete, Adhikari and her husband each brought their laptops to a coffee shop in January. They spent an hour creating a shared master document in a Google drive, listing all of their accounts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There were things Adhikari added that Sane didn't have, including access to the bank accounts she had set up for their kids, her disability insurance information and a health savings account from a prior employer. They double-checked that both of their names were on all accounts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>They also printed out a list of account passwords, which they keep in a safe. They also store them digitally in a password manager both can access. (Our personal tech columnist Nicole Nguyen recommends 1Password and Dashlane).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The exercise was empowering, Adhikari says. \"I always tell my kids not to put things off, to do things now, and yet here I was with these things lingering in my brain,\" she says. \"You just have to rip the Band-Aid off.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Sane says the date was helpful for him, too, because it motivated him to consolidate all of their account information into a living document that can be updated as needed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>How to do it</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner, had managed his family's finances until a few years ago, when his wife, Heather, decided she wanted more visibility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"When you intentionally or unintentionally step away from household finances, you don't realize right away that you're losing agency and options, but over time you start to feel it,\" Heather says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The two have since co-written a book, \"Money Together,\" and give talks on how couples should have equal involvement in the family finances.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There's a low-threat way to open these conversations. You can say, 'If something happened to you, I'm concerned I wouldn't know where everything is,\" says Heather, a former corporate attorney who now manages their financial planning business. \"If your partner doesn't want you to be involved or tries to block access, that's a red flag.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Boneparths offered some tips on how both partners can get up to speed:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Do it now. Don't wait until an emergency to figure out how to access accounts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Ensure authorization. Even when you have joint accounts, a bank might consider one person the primary account holder. Make sure you're both authorized to talk to the bank and conduct transactions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Do a trial run. Whatever your partner would normally do in a given month — flagging fraudulent charges, transferring money, checking investments — you try to do instead (and vice versa). Make sure you get the hang of handling the things your partner usually does, and that institutions recognize your ability to do so.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write a note. Douglas composed what he calls a one-page, annually updated \"death note\" for Heather, detailing who to call and what to do if something were to happen to him. It includes the password to his computer. Heather made one for him, too. They keep the notes in their safe.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Make it a regular date. Douglas recommends couples meet quarterly to go over any account changes and to update passwords and documents. (Many multigenerational families do this.) If things are pretty stable, you might prefer doing it just once a year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Julie Jargon at Julie.Jargon@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

And lately he's been doing a lot of the latter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"They ruined my fun,\" he said of Hershey.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>His Reese's opinions include but aren't limited to: Hershey should advertise the General Mills-produced Reese's Puffs Cereal on its website; Hershey should create a Reese's-branded credit card; Hershey should put more money into advertising Reese's in Europe. More than anything, he worries that any change in ingredients will erode consumer trust in the Reese's brand.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Valentine's Day letter to Hershey executive Todd Scott, accusing the company of doing just that by quietly replacing milk chocolate and peanut butter with cheaper substitutes, went viral after MrBeast directed his 34 million followers to it. The YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, made sure to note the \"real peanut butter\" in his Feastables cups.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Hershey said the famous peanut-butter cups are made the same way they always have been. The company noted it makes recipe adjustments to some Reese's products to allow for new shapes, sizes and innovations.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reese hates what he calls the new flavor, but he still eats — and champions — the candy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"What my grandfather did was astronomical and to this day I'm in awe, and I like to honor him,\" said Reese, who was 7 when Hershey bought the family business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For the best part of a decade, he has been posting almost exclusively Reese's-tinted thoughts to LinkedIn, where his job description often matches his mood: \"Reese's Economic Engine,\" \"Growing REESE'S Worldwide One Peanut Butter Cup at a Time,\" \"Protecting REESE's Brand Integrity.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There is no formal relationship between Brad Reese and the Hershey Company or Reese's,\" a company spokesperson said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>People who meet Reese in his brightly colored paraphernalia could be forgiven for thinking otherwise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You run into people asking 'Do you have any free Reese's?'\" he said. \"And I say, 'No, I get much more pleasure and satisfaction out of watching people pay for them.'\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>People also ask how much Reese gets paid to be a brand ambassador. \"They don't believe that I'm out here doing what I'm doing, and not being an employee,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reese said his parents never encouraged him or his four siblings to get involved with the Hershey Company. His younger brother Andrew shares his love of the brand, and even owns the rights to their grandfather's name. But the other siblings prefer not to draw attention to their candy royalty status, he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Other Reese family members — H.B. had 16 children, 13 of whom survived into adulthood — wish Brad would do the same; a group of them recently issued a statement distancing themselves from his views.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reese's father, Charles, co-owned the H.B. Reese Candy Company with his five brothers until 1963, when they merged the business with what was then the Hershey Chocolate Corporation. Hershey said the brothers' decision to sell transformed a $12 million-$14 million brand into a more than $3 billion icon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>It also transformed the Reeses' lives. Brad Reese spent his early childhood in Hershey, Pa. Immediately after the sale, his newly moneyed parents moved the family to Minneapolis. They divorced soon after and his father moved to Niagara Falls, N.Y., to oversee the construction of the Skylon Tower, which was financed in part by his Hershey shareholdings.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reese said he disclaimed any inheritance. He served a stint in the military before attending Babson College and working as a trader and a consultant in digital infrastructure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In 2007, he got his first taste of life online, blogging about the strategies and inner workings of Cisco on the website Network World and later his own site, BradReese.com. Wall Street Journal articles reporting on Cisco at the time occasionally featured the phrase \"first reported by blogger Brad Reese.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"He was outspoken, he wanted to do a good job,\" said Larry Chafin, chief executive and chairman of Pluto Cloud Services, who blogged for Network World at the same time as Reese. \"Cisco didn't like us too much.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By 2015, Cisco's CEO had resigned and Reese felt the company was in good shape. It was time to move on. He turned his site into a shrine to Reese's — and a hub for his opinions on Hershey's management of the candy. It also features links to his social media and dating profiles.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reese briefly moved back to Hershey in 2012, 50 years after his father left, but eventually settled in Florida. He now lives a relaxed beachside life. When he's not spreading his love of Reese's, he spends weekday afternoons singing Rolling Stones songs on karaoke machines in bars near the pier.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Reese has spent the past 15 years in and out of remission with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which often fatigues him, he said. Once a month, he receives a five-hour infusion of immunotherapy. It hasn't yet put a stop to his work as the unofficial Reese's brand keeper.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At this point, a job at Hershey wouldn't interest him — he prefers the freedom to say what he wants.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"You have to have a purpose in life,\" Reese said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Katie Deighton at katie.deighton@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Dan Gallagher</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix investors are getting a happy ending, just not the one the company's management first envisioned.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The streaming giant's formal exit from the bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery has cheered its own shareholders, sending the stock up nearly 14% on Friday. The stock has languished since Netflix announced its deal to acquire Warner in early December, and it was trending down even before that simply on rumors that it might make a play for the storied Hollywood studio. Before Friday, Netflix had shed about a third of its market value since The Wall Street Journal reported in mid-September that Paramount was preparing a bid for Warner.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Why such a harsh reaction? Buying Warner Bros. made sense for Paramount Skydance, whose subscale streaming service has long struggled to compete against the much larger offerings from Netflix, Disney and Warner.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But for Netflix, such a deal would have complicated the business model for a company that had already vaulted to a leading position in Hollywood on its strength as a streaming pure-play. Even its recently diminished market cap had Netflix nearly twice as valuable as Disney and far above any other media outlet. And at $72 billion, the price for Warner was steep for a company with just under $10 billion in annual free cash flow — and no history of doing megasize deals.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Warner could have ended up costing Netflix even more, in terms of both Hollywood drama and political trouble. The entertainment industry remained highly skeptical of Netflix's stated plans to keep Warner Bros. active in the theatrical movie business. And lawmakers had worries about a deal that could make Netflix even more dominant in the business of scripted entertainment. The need for government approval also made Netflix extra vulnerable to the whims of President Trump, who demanded last week that the company kick a former Biden administration official off its board of directors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Instead, Netflix will walk away about $2.8 billion richer thanks to the termination fee outlined in their agreement with Warner. And it has run up the price on what will be a larger competitor, once Paramount Skydance and Warner Discovery get their merger over the necessary regulatory hurdles. One risk to losing the deal had been that a combined Paramount-Warner entity could pull popular content off Netflix to use for their own streaming offerings. But the merged company will now need all the cash flow it can muster to service a substantial debt load, so it is unlikely to fully turn away from the biggest payer in town.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That debt load — which Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon estimates will total close to $100 billion — raises fresh questions about how combining two major studios will affect Hollywood, which has already been battered by shrinking TV and movie production. Substantial layoffs seem certain, but cost cutting alone won't make the operation into the sort of entertainment powerhouse that can better compete with the likes of Netflix and Disney. Compelling shows and movies will still be needed, and the costs of producing quality content are only going up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In a report Friday, Robert Fishman of MoffettNathanson said content spending by Paramount-Warner will need to rank \"atop its media peers.\" But the company will also need to pay down a lot of debt to get back to an investment-grade credit rating, which Paramount Chief Strategy Officer Andy Gordon said the company was \"absolutely committed to\" in an earnings call on Wednesday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Peter Supino of Wolfe Research said in his own report that Paramount Warner faces \"the difficult task of growing share while simultaneously deleveraging, a balance that could come at the expense of content investment.\" In a statement Friday afternoon, Paramount said it sees \"a clear path\" to investment-grade credit metrics within three years of the deal closing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Netflix, meanwhile, now needs to convince investors that its pursuit of Warner wasn't coming from a place of weakness. Even with Friday's jump, the stock remains about 7% below the price it fetched before the company announced the deal in December. \"We believe it is important that Netflix management articulate how it can achieve its long-term growth goals, despite failing to obtain an asset for which it undertook significant risk in trying to acquire,\" Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris wrote on Friday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>To that end, Netflix at least showed some strength by pulling the plug early. The company had four business days to top Paramount's latest offer after Warner said Thursday that it found that bid superior. But Netflix called the whole thing off less than two hours after Warner's announcement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That move showed discipline and helped buttress the case by Netflix management that Warner was nice to have, but not a need to have. Keeping a viewing audience engaged in a world awash in YouTube and TikTok videos will provide Netflix plenty of drama on its own.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div class=\"symbolsContainer-uFduEtAF logosContainer-diQOvrPB\" data-no-swipe=\"true\"></div><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Jurica Dujmovic</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A massive backlog of maintenance and software contracts will ensure recurring revenue</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor 4001 stealth fighter is silhouetted against the setting sun in this undated file photo. Saturday's strikes on Iran by the U.S. and Israel will likely shine an even bigger spotlight on defense stocks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Wars end. Maintenance contracts do not.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Defense stocks have been treated as geopolitical barometer. When tensions rise and military conflict breaks out, shares climb. When headlines cool, the trade fades. It's a narrative built around procurement cycles and crisis-driven spending. The attack on Tehran on Saturday by Israel and the U.S. should repeat this pattern for defense stocks in coming days.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>But something more structural and long-term has been unfolding, something that looks far less like a one-off weapons sale and more like a long-term service contract. Parts of the defense industry are beginning to resemble subscription businesses, recurring revenue layered on top of a growing installed base.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>For investors focused on earnings durability rather than war headlines, that distinction matters.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Weapons systems have evolved from disposable purchases to multi-decade ecosystems nowadays. Once a country fields a fleet of fighter jets, missile defense batteries, or naval destroyers, it commits to years or even decades of operating and support costs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The Government Accountability Office has repeatedly noted that operating and support costs can account for roughly 70% of a major weapon system's total life-cycle cost, according to recent GAO report. Upkeep includes spare parts, depot maintenance, training, software updates, systems integration and availability guarantees. Since national defense cannot tolerate downtime, readiness spending tends to persist even when procurement ebbs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In practical terms, the contractor that builds the platform often remains embedded in its upkeep. Every additional aircraft delivered expands the pool of long-term maintenance, logistics and modernization revenue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>That dynamic increasingly resembles aerospace aftermarket economy (and, in some respects, enterprise software) where installed bases drive recurring cash flow. Three companies that stand to benefit: Lockheed Martin (LMT); RTX (RTX) and Northrop Grumman (NOC).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Lockheed Martin: The ecosystem model: Lockheed Martin provides the clearest example of this shift. The F-35 program represented 26% of consolidated net sales in 2024, according to the company's latest Form 10-K. The filing explicitly states that F-35 revenue includes development, production, and maintenance, underscoring how support and logistics are embedded in the program's economy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Service sales increased in 2024, driven in part by higher volume on F-35 upkeep contracts, the company disclosed in that same annual report.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>By the end of 2025, Lockheed Martin reported a record $194 billion backlog and strong free cash flow generation in its full-year earnings release. That backlog provides multi-year revenue visibility that many industrial companies lack.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Support performance is not immune from scrutiny; a Pentagon watchdog has recently criticized aspects of F-35 maintenance and aircraft availability. Recurring revenue in defense is contractual and performance-based, not automatic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Even so, the installed-base effect is unmistakable: every aircraft delivered expands a long-term revenue stream tied to readiness and modernization.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>RTX: Installed base, diversified: RTX offers a different version of installed-base economy. The company has recently reported strong sales growth and highlighted a backlog approaching $268 billion, according to its latest earnings results.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>On the defense side, missile systems and air defense platforms require ongoing upgrades and upkeep. Collins Aerospace operates within a vast installed base of aircraft systems that generate recurring parts and maintenance demand, the approach the company emphasizes in its investor materials.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Commercial aftermarket revenue behaves in many ways like an annuity tied to flight hours, while defense modernization cycles add a second layer of durability. The combination smooths earnings compared to pure production-driven models.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Northrop Grumman and the long arc of modernization: Northrop Grumman's portfolio is heavily weighted toward advanced systems - stealth aircraft, space assets, sensors and mission technologies.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Once fielded, those systems demand continuous upgrades and integration work as modern defense doctrine emphasizes ongoing modernization rather than static platforms. Sensors are refreshed. Software evolves. Networks expand. The company ended 2025 with backlog nearing $95.7 billion, according to its most recent annual report.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Northrop's strength in high-end systems integration positions it to benefit from that long modernization arc, although development-heavy programs can introduce project timing volatility.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The software layer: Defense as ongoing service: The transformation is perhaps the most visible in defense's growing digital footprint. The U.S. Defense Department's Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability contract vehicle reflects a shift toward acquiring commercial cloud services across classification levels.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Software-native companies like Palantir Technologies (PLTR) operate directly in that layer, providing analytics and AI systems through multi-year government contracts. Recent analyst coverage has highlighted the company's expanding government engagements and recurring revenue profile.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While valuation and volatility differ from traditional primes, the software layer most closely resembles true subscription economy within defense budgets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The market may be behind the curve</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Despite these structural shifts, defense contractors are often valued like cyclical industrial companies. The implicit assumption is that earnings are driven primarily by procurement wins and geopolitical events.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If maintenance, modernization and software continue rising as a share of revenue, that assumption will grow increasingly incomplete. Recurring support contracts and installed-base monetization can dampen earnings swings and support steadier free cash flow.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>At the same time, intellectual property and data rights in maintenance contracts is a critical issue that the U.S. Government Accountability Office examined in its recent review of IP and sustainment planning. Control over technical data can shape who captures margin over the life of a program.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Markets tend to reward predictability. Businesses with durable cash flows often command stronger valuation multiples than those dependent on episodic demand. If defense contractors continue migrating toward service-heavy revenue mixes, the sector's risk profile may increasingly resemble infrastructure rather than crisis trade.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Defense stocks will continue to react to geopolitical headlines, but beneath those swings lies a structural evolution in how revenue is generated and sustained. The companies that control large, technologically complex installed bases -aircraft fleets, missile systems, naval platforms, secure networks - are not merely selling equipment. They are managing ecosystems that require continuous funding to remain operational.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This shift reframes the opportunity. Defense may no longer be just a trade on conflict. Increasingly, it resembles a long-duration cash-flow business anchored in readiness, modernization and software-driven support.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>The market may still be pricing yesterday's model. Wars end. Maintenance contracts do not.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read: Trump says 'massive' strike against Iran underway - bitcoin plunge offers a glimpse of how markets could react</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>-Jurica Dujmovic</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.

Two loud blasts were heard in Tehran on Feb. 28 morning by AFP journalists, and two plumes of thick smoke were seen over the center and east of the Iranian capital.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Investors roiled for weeks by AI disruption and then hotter-than-expected inflation on Friday faced a fresh level of stress after the U.S. and Israel launched attacks on Iran to destabilize its nuclear ambitions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"A short time ago, the United States military began major combat operations in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people,\" President Donald Trump said in a video message published on his Truth Social account early Saturday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Cryptocurrencies, which trade 24/7, offered the first glimpse of how investors might react, as they wait for Asian markets to open on Sunday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) slid 3.1% to $63,561, a level not seen since early February. Oil (CL.1) (BRN00) prices jumped on Friday as traders began to sense strikes could be nearing, with Trump suggesting to reporters that the window for diplomacy with Iran could be closing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"At this stage there are many unknowns, and the situation is incredibly fast moving. The damage done by U.S.-Israeli strikes, and the targets of those strikes, is not yet clear; nor is the impact of any Iranian retaliatory action,\" said Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, in a note to clients. \"In addition, the precise scope of the action, nor mission aims, are obvious at this stage. Furthermore, it is not known whether any crude infrastructure has been targeted, or impacted, at the present time.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Apart from surging oil prices on Friday, the S&amp;P 500 SPX and Nasdaq Composite COMP  and Dow industrials DJIA tumbled after a surprise spike in producer prices.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Brown said investors could see a \"relatively predictable\" reaction to the strikes on Iran, starting with a big leap in crude prices. Also likely to get bid are haven assets, such as gold (GC00), which jumped nearly 11% in February, finishing at $5,230.50 an ounce on Friday. That marked gold's biggest one-month percentage gain since January 2012, and its monthly gain of $516.60 was the biggest one-month net gain on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Brown said the Japanese yen (USDJPY), Swiss franc (USDCHF) and U.S. Treasurys BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD30Ywould also likely be in the outperformer category. Investors have been increasingly pushing into U.S. government debt recently, a move strategists have attributed to fears over AI threats to employment and economic growth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Read: The bond market has been doing something strange despite a hot inflation report</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>While equities will likely \"face headwinds,\" Brown said investors should remember that \"geopolitical events tend not to be a trigger for durable or longer-lasting market moves in any asset. Of course, there's a risk that this time could be different, however it is unlikely to be the case once participants have discounted the initial shock triggered by this weekend's events.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Trump last week offered a deadline of 10 to 15 days to make a deal with Iran, which left this weekend as a possibility for a U.S. strike. Iran has been one of the world's biggest oil producers, controlling to several crucial \"chokepoints,\" such as the Strait of Hormuz. That waterway connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>In his social-media post, Trump did not indicate how long the strikes would last. The Associated Press reported a daylight Saturday attack on Tehran, with initial blasts hitting near the offices of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He said after the U.S. launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites last June, Iran was warned never to resume its pursuit of nuclear weapons and the U.S. \"sought repeatedly to make a deal.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"They rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions and we can't take it anymore. Instead they attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and continue developing long-range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe and could soon reach the American homeland,\" Trump said in his address.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"It has always been the policy of the United States, in particular, my administration, that this terrorist regime can never have a nuclear weapon,\" he said, recounting \"an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder\" against the U.S. over 47 years, as well as attacks on Israel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"We're going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally, again, obliterated. We're going to annihilate their navy, we're going to ensure that the region's terrorist proxies can no longer destabilize the region or the world and attack our forces,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Addressing the people of Iran - thousands of protesters were killed during protests at the start of the year - Trump also said the U.S. was giving them their \"only chance for generations\" to rise up against their government.

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-nzzZVyQ3 content-nzzZVyQ3\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>By Debbie Carlson</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you are planning on spring cleaning soon, put trust reviews on your to-do list.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>With generous federal estate-tax exemptions made permanent in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year, trusts that were created years ago to shield wealth from onerous federal estate taxes may be obsolete.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Under the new tax policy individuals can exempt $15 million in assets from federal estate taxes, $30 million for couples, and those amounts will adjust for inflation annually. Estates still face a 40% federal tax rate for any money above those thresholds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Spurred by the certainty around the federal estate-tax levels, estate planners and financial advisors are scrutinizing older trusts. Here's what to know if you have one:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>As recently as 2009, the federal estate-tax exemption was $3.5 million for an individual, with the estate tax rate at 45% for anything above that exemption, according to the Tax Foundation. The estate-tax exemption was also a \"use it or lose it\" system, so couples had to create trusts to maximize each person's exemption or the surviving spouse's estate would face higher taxes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Changes in tax policy in intervening years allowed widows and widowers to access their spouses' unused exemptions and now the more generous exemptions make it worth revisiting these trusts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>A lot of those old trusts, notably A/B trusts, have rigid language limiting how widows and widowers can control family money after their spouse died. When a husband and wife use an A/B trust and the wife dies, the trust is split into two parts. Her half goes into an irrevocable trust to support the husband during his lifetime, and whatever is left later goes to the other named beneficiaries, such as their children.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>These trusts are outdated, says Patrick Simasko, elder law attorney and financial advisor in Michigan. Having part of the couple's money tied up in an irrevocable trust means it is difficult for the widow or widower to make future changes, such as removing a child as a beneficiary.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"There's so many rules and regulations that this trust agreement may be binding your hands to in the future,\" he says. \"At the time the trade-off was worth it...today the tax justification for creating these types of trusts no longer exists.\"</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are a few options you can take if you have an old, rigid trust, Simasko says. If both you and your spouse are alive you can cancel it. You will need to retitle assets, whether to put them in a new trust or to get rid of it completely.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>If you are a widow or a widower stuck in one of these old trusts, your options are limited to what the trust allows. So read it carefully. Some trusts may allow you to move assets to a new one with fewer restrictions. If beneficiaries agree, you can ask probate court to alter or terminate the trust.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Review if you can withdraw more money from the trust than what you are currently taking. Emily Boothroyd, wealth manager at Merit Financial Advisors, says doing so can save significant money as trusts are expensive and tax-inefficient.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>There are costs to create the document and annual costs to maintain them. The annual taxes that most irrevocable non-grantor trusts pay can get steep quickly. It only takes $16,000 in taxable annual income for a trust to hit the highest 37% tax bracket; individuals don't hit that level until their income surpasses $640,600.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Taking assets out of trusts also can minimize capital-gains taxes for beneficiaries. When trusts distribute assets to beneficiaries, those assets are valued at the original purchase price, not the fair market value on the date the trust makes its distribution. If the trust sells the asset and sends the proceeds to beneficiaries, it passes along the capital-gains tax bill, which inheritors must pay that year. If it distributes the asset, beneficiaries can wait to sell it, deferring any tax bills.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Either way, given the rise in asset value, from real estate to stocks in the past 20 years, beneficiaries could be on the hook for big capital-gains taxes. If those same assets were in your estate, your beneficiaries will receive a step-up in basis on any assets they inherit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Boothroyd made this move for an elderly client of hers, who was beneficiary of an old irrevocable trust. The trust allowed her client to make larger withdrawals, and she moved assets into her estate because she is in a lower tax bracket than the trust.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>She pays less in income taxes on the assets than the trust would, and she plans to keep the assets in her estate, so her beneficiaries will receive a step-up in basis at her death. The move saves \"her heirs a significant amount in capital-gains tax now that they are not concerned about estate-tax exemption levels,\" Boothroyd says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Financial pros say reviewing newer trusts to save money on income and capital-gains taxes are a smart move as well.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Mark Weiskind, senior wealth manager at Fairway Wealth Management, says if the trust allows it, send money to beneficiaries now if they are in lower tax brackets and let them pay the income tax, rather than the trust. Sometimes trusts may also send a little extra money to cover the beneficiaries' income taxes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Check the value of the assets in the trust. Weiskind says some trusts allow you to swap assets in an in-kind distribution without triggering taxes. He says trusts should own assets that don't produce much current income but have higher growth potential, such as index funds.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>He says a client of his funded a trust 20 years ago with Apple stock that had grown to $1 million. Because the client isn't worried about hitting the estate-tax exemption ceiling, he used an in-kind distribution, bringing the Apple stock back to his estate and put in $1 million of another asset. His heirs will get step-up in basis of that Apple stock.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>\"Now that the estate tax isn't an issue, they put little bit more of a premium on the step-up in basis,\" he says.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>Write to editors@barrons.com</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
