            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>Sterling and U.K. government bonds would face elevated volatility if U.K. Treasury chief Rachel Reeves unexpectedly resigned, ING's Francesco Pesole says in a note. The opposition is calling for Reeves to resign after she failed to obtain a license to rent out her home but Prime Minister Keir Starmer has backed her and her letting agent has taken responsibility. In July when Reeves appeared close to leaving, gilt fell sharply alongside sterling. Markets are wary that her resignation would \"herald more relaxed fiscal rules and additional borrowing at a time when gilt issuance remains elevated.\" Sterling falls 0.1% to $1.3141, while the euro rises 0.1% to 0.8802 pounds. The 10-year gilt yield rises 2.2 basis points to 4.430%, Tradeweb data show. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"body-KX2tCBZq body-pIO_GYwT content-pIO_GYwT\"><div><span><p class=\"\"><span>0938 GMT - Investors will likely feel more assured about the geopolitical outlook heading into 2026 following this week's U.S.-China trade truce, CGS International analyst Edith Qian says in a note. The reduction in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods after the Trump-Xi meeting should boost the price competitiveness of Chinese exports and ease pressure on exporters, while the suspension of shipping levies will benefit Chinese shipbuilders and shipping firms. Although the summit didn't resolve deeper structural issues, it sets the stage for continued high-level exchanges next year that should help contain the risk of significant escalation in tensions, she adds. CGS International believes the improved backdrop strengthens the case for global investors to increase their Chinese equities allocation. (jason.chau@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0831 GMT - Stocks ended lower in Hong Kong, as a lack of specific details on exports of Nvidia's Blackwell chips to China following a meeting between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping likely disappointed market participants, DBS Group Research analysts say in an email. Despite a trade deal between the two countries, there was no concrete timeline or guidance on when Chinese companies might gain access to Nvidia's advanced AI chips, analysts led by Andy Yu write. This ambiguity is likely to weigh on AI infrastructure names, including data-center stocks, and large tech companies that depend on advanced chip availability for their AI-related businesses. Index heavyweights Tencent and Alibaba Group shed 3.4% and 4.1%, respectively, sending the benchmark Hang Seng Index 1.4% lower to 25906.65. (megan.cheah@wsj.com)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span>0812 GMT - Bitcoin recovers marginally but remains below the key $110,000 level following losses sustained overnight after a tech-led selloff in U.S. stocks. Tech stocks fell on concerns over increased spending outlooks for Meta and Microsoft. Reduced market bets for another interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve in December following comments at Wednesday's meeting also weighed on risk appetite. Meanwhile, the U.S. and China agreed a trade truce but \"structural differences persist, and it's easy for there to be some skepticism of the deal's scope due to the lack of concrete commitments,\" Deutsche Bank analysts say in a note. Bitcoin rises 1.9% to $109,559 after reaching a one-and-a-half-week low of $106,396 late Thursday, LSEG data show. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</span></p></span></div></div>",
