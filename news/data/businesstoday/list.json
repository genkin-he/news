The move was fuelled by renewed ETF inflows and short-covering activity, signalling institutional buyers are stepping back into the market after recent volatility.</p><div class=\"g g-1\"><div class=\"g-dyn a-70 c-1\"></div></div>\n<p>Ethereum outperformed on a percentage basis, rising more than 8% earlier in the week and reclaiming ground above US$2,000 before moderating. The rally in Ethereum and broader altcoins suggests risk appetite is returning, though conviction remains fragile.\n\n\n\n</p><p>The immediate catalyst: Billions of dollars in Bitcoin and Ethereum options contracts set to expire. Large derivatives settlements often compress price ranges or trigger sharp swings as traders rebalance positions. With “max pain” levels clustered below current spot prices, volatility risk remains elevated.\n\n\n\n</p><p>For now, the market narrative is one of cautious stabilisation. A sustained move above US$70,000 for Bitcoin or US$2,100 for Ethereum would signal renewed bullish momentum. Failure to hold recent gains, however, could reopen downside pressure.\n\n</p></div>",

New job wins for FY25 stood at approximately RM865 million, with a projected replenishment of RM1 billion for FY26.\n\n\n\n</p><p>RHB Research’s target price reflects a sum-of-parts valuation pegged to FY26F earnings per share with an 11 times P/E multiple, including a 2% ESG premium based on a 3.1 ESG score. \n\n\n\n</p><p>The stock currently trades at 5.9 times FY26F P/E, below the five-year mean of the Bursa Malaysia Construction Index at 14 times, a gap the analyst views as unjustified given INTA’s consistent project wins and upcoming property developments valued at around RM500 million. \n\n\n\n</p><p>Potential upside catalysts include further job wins in Johor from long-term clients such as Ecoworld and UEM Sunrise, while sluggish job replenishment remains a key downside risk.\n\n\n\n</p><p>As of 3.10 pm, the stock price was noted at RM0.425.\n\n\n\n</p><p>\n</p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tdb-block-inner td-fix-index\">\n<p>RHB Investment Bank Bhd (RHB Research) has identified AMMB Holdings Bhd and Orkim Bhd as stocks displaying bullish technical momentum, following recent breakouts on strong trading volumes.\n\n\n\n</p><p>AMMB Holdings may see its upward trajectory extended after breaching the RM6.60 resistance level with high volume, validating a bullish continuation pattern. </p><div class=\"g g-1\"><div class=\"g-dyn a-70 c-1\"></div></div>\n<p>RHB Research said sustaining prices above this breakout point could pave the way towards the next resistance at RM6.90, followed by RM7.15. However, a decline below the RM6.35 support level would invalidate the bullish setup and signal a potential pullback.\n\n\n\n</p><p>Meanwhile, Orkim has extended its rally with a decisive breakout above its resistance level, supported by elevated trading activity. \n\n\n\n</p><p>The stock’s close above RM1.06 confirms that bullish momentum remains intact, positioning it to test the next resistance at RM1.12 and subsequently RM1.17, according to the research house. On the downside, a move below the RM1.01 support level would negate the positive outlook and could trigger a correction.\n\n\n\n</p><p>RHB Research’s technical view suggests both counters are trading within favourable momentum trends, although key support levels will need to hold to sustain the bullish bias.\n\n</p></div>",

The S&amp;P 500 advanced 56.06 points, or 0.81%, to 6,946.13, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 307.65 points, or 0.63%, to 49,482.15.</p><div class=\"g g-1\"><div class=\"g-dyn a-70 c-1\"></div></div>\n<p>Chipmakers and software counters spearheaded gains. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index climbed 1.6% ahead of Nvidia’s earnings, while the S&amp;P Software &amp; Services index rebounded 2.9%, trimming part of its 23% year-to-date decline.\n\n\n\n</p><p>Nvidia, at the forefront of the AI revolution, reported fourth-quarter revenue of $68.13 billion, beating analyst estimates. Its shares were up about 3% in extended trading.\n\n\n\n</p><p>“We’re in the middle of a push-pull here between some negative sentiment and some extreme price action in parts of the market,” said Zach Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\n\n</p><p>“I think the (AI) disruption concerns are more acute right now than worries over return on investment,” Hill added. “Investors are trying to grapple with what could potentially be existential risk, and that’s a bigger deal than not receiving as much payout as you would like.”\n\n\n\n</p><p>Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin said it is not clear that the AI rollout will displace workers, adding that the technology could enable workers and improve labour market efficiency.\n\n\n\n</p><p>Gains were broad, with advancing issues outnumbering decliners by 1.78-to-1 on the NYSE and 2.02-to-1 on the Nasdaq.

Brown-Forman dropped 7.6% and Molson Coors declined 4.8% after Diageo projected a 2% to 3% organic sales decline in 2026 and halved its interim dividend.
