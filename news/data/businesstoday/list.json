A sustained move above US$70,000 for Bitcoin or US$2,100 for Ethereum would signal renewed bullish momentum. Failure to hold recent gains, however, could reopen downside pressure.\n\n</p></div>",

New job wins for FY25 stood at approximately RM865 million, with a projected replenishment of RM1 billion for FY26.\n\n\n\n</p><p>RHB Research’s target price reflects a sum-of-parts valuation pegged to FY26F earnings per share with an 11 times P/E multiple, including a 2% ESG premium based on a 3.1 ESG score. \n\n\n\n</p><p>The stock currently trades at 5.9 times FY26F P/E, below the five-year mean of the Bursa Malaysia Construction Index at 14 times, a gap the analyst views as unjustified given INTA’s consistent project wins and upcoming property developments valued at around RM500 million. \n\n\n\n</p><p>Potential upside catalysts include further job wins in Johor from long-term clients such as Ecoworld and UEM Sunrise, while sluggish job replenishment remains a key downside risk.\n\n\n\n</p><p>As of 3.10 pm, the stock price was noted at RM0.425.\n\n\n\n</p><p>\n</p></div>",
