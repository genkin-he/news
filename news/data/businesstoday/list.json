Strong buying interest subsequently emerged, pushing the index to a high of 26,843 pts before it closed at 26,758 pts, forming a bullish candlestick.

With buyers now holding the technical advantage, the research house advised traders to hold long positions initiated at 21,416 pts, or at the close on Apr 14 2025.\n\n\n\n</p><p>To manage trading risks, the stop-loss level has been raised to 26,400 pts.

            "description": "<div class=\"tdb-block-inner td-fix-index\">\n<p>RHB Investment Bank Bhd maintained its BUY call on Ranhill Utilities Bhd, assigning a revised target price of RM2.35, representing a potential 40% upside from its current market price of RM1.68.\n\n\n\n</p><p>The research house highlighted that the company’s 1HFY26 core profit of RM66.6 million exceeded both RHB Research and Street projections, driven largely by stronger-than-expected gross margins and robust performance in the water segment following the August tariff hike.</p><div class=\"g g-1\"><div class=\"g-dyn a-70 c-1\"></div></div>\n<p>Ranhill’s water division posted a quarterly record revenue of RM464 million in 2QFY26, up 19% year-on-year, with a segmental pre-tax profit of RM58.3 million. \n\n\n\n</p><p>The consultancy and services segment returned a pre-tax profit of RM6.5 million, reversing a pre-tax loss of RM13.5 million a year ago. The power segment, however, saw a 45% decline in revenue, attributed to maintenance and finance costs linked to its power assets.\n\n\n\n</p><p>Following the stronger results, RHB Research revised Ranhill’s FY26–28 earnings forecasts upwards by 14.8%, 13%, and 14.8%, respectively, reflecting improved gross margin assumptions. \n\n\n\n</p><p>The bank also adjusted the discount rate for the water segment to 7% from 6% to account for the expected uptake of reclaimed water in data centres by Johor Special Water.\n\n\n\n</p><p>Looking ahead, an additional water supply of approximately 1,100 million litres per day (MLD) is expected from new treatment plants such as Semanggar (60 MLD, 2026) and Layang 2 Phase 2 (150 MLD, 2027). \n\n\n\n</p><p>Further capacity of 890 MLD is anticipated from three other plants post-2027, supporting Johor’s plan to expand total water supply to around 3,000 MLD by 2030. This expansion will cater to industrial and residential growth, particularly in the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone.\n\n\n\n</p><p>RHB Research noted that participation in the Corporate Renewable Energy Supply Scheme could also act as a growth catalyst, while lower-than-expected water consumption remains the main downside risk to earnings.\n\n\n\n</p><p>As of midday, the stock price increased slightly (0.60%) to RM1.69.\n\n\n\n</p><p>\n</p></div>",
