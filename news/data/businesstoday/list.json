In contrast, First Solar slid 13.6% and Lowe’s Companies fell 5.6% after issuing weaker-than-expected annual sales guidance, dragging housing and homebuilder stocks lower despite mortgage rates hitting a three-and-a-half-year low last week.\n\n\n\n</p><p>Consumer staples also lagged. Brown-Forman dropped 7.6% and Molson Coors declined 4.8% after Diageo projected a 2% to 3% organic sales decline in 2026 and halved its interim dividend.

            "description": "<div class=\"tdb-block-inner td-fix-index\">\n<p>RHB Investment Bank Bhd (RHB Research) maintained its positive trading bias on Hang Seng Index Futures (HSIF) after the contract rebounded strongly from its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), signalling renewed upward momentum.\n\n\n\n</p><p>The HSIF advanced 199 pts to settle at 26,758 pts, after opening at 26,566 pts and sliding to an intraday low of 25,525 pts. Strong buying interest subsequently emerged, pushing the index to a high of 26,843 pts before it closed at 26,758 pts, forming a bullish candlestick. During the evening session, it gained a further 189 pts, closing at 26,947 pts.</p><div class=\"g g-1\"><div class=\"g-dyn a-70 c-1\"></div></div>\n<p>RHB Research said the latest price action confirms that firm support has developed near the 50-day SMA line. A decisive close above the 20-day SMA would signal a resumption of the upward trajectory, while continued trading above the 50-day SMA raises the likelihood of a bullish crossover at the 20-day SMA.\n\n\n\n</p><p>The relative strength index is trending higher, indicating that bullish momentum is picking up pace. With buyers now holding the technical advantage, the research house advised traders to hold long positions initiated at 21,416 pts, or at the close on Apr 14 2025.\n\n\n\n</p><p>To manage trading risks, the stop-loss level has been raised to 26,400 pts.

The rally in Ethereum and broader altcoins suggests risk appetite is returning, though conviction remains fragile.\n\n\n\n</p><p>The immediate catalyst: Billions of dollars in Bitcoin and Ethereum options contracts set to expire. Large derivatives settlements often compress price ranges or trigger sharp swings as traders rebalance positions. With “max pain” levels clustered below current spot prices, volatility risk remains elevated.\n\n\n\n</p><p>For now, the market narrative is one of cautious stabilisation. A sustained move above US$70,000 for Bitcoin or US$2,100 for Ethereum would signal renewed bullish momentum. Failure to hold recent gains, however, could reopen downside pressure.\n\n</p></div>",
