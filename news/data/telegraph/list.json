The bank unveiled plans last month for a $13.6bn deal to take its troubled Hong Kong-listed business Hang Seng Bank private.</p><p>HSBC’s shares tumbled after it said it would suspend share buybacks for the next three quarters to boost cash reserves needed for the deal. However, the bank’s shares remain up nearly 27pc so far this year following a huge restructuring effort by Georges Elhedery, its chief executive.</p></div></div></div></div>",

The ‘£100-deals’ will no longer cut it, as most providers are offering almost double that amount these days.”</p><p>Equally, while a one-off bonus may sound pretty appealing, if you’re prepared to put in the legwork, there’s potentially some serious money to be made by repeatedly switching accounts – as long as you carefully navigate the banks’ various terms and conditions.</p><p>The guide will cover:</p><ul><li><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"#the-biggest-switching-bonusesundefined\">The biggest switching bonuses</a></li><li><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"#switching-via-the-cassundefined\">Switching via the CASS</a></li><li><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"#how-to-become-a-serial-switcherundefined\">How to become a serial switcher</a></li><li><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"#top-tips-for-switching-bank-accountsundefined\">Top tips for switching bank accounts</a></li></ul><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\"><a class=\"ck-anchor\" id=\"the-biggest-switching-bonusesundefined\" name=\"the-biggest-switching-bonusesundefined\">The biggest switching bonuses</a></h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Barclays: £200</h2><p>Available until Nov 27, this sizeable deal from Barclays is for new customers who open one of its bank accounts, completing a “full switch” that includes at least two direct debits.</p><p>However, there are more caveats. Once the account is open, you’ll need to join the Blue Rewards scheme, which costs £5 a month. It does come with other perks, though, such as an Apple TV+ subscription, enhanced savings rates and cashback on everyday spending.</p><p>The final step is paying in at least £2,000 to the new account within 30 days of opening it. This can be done all at once or in instalments.</p><p>You should receive a text when you’ve satisfied all of the bonus criteria, and the money will be paid within 28 days.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">First Direct: £175</h2><p>If you can get past the caveats, switching to First Direct can be very lucrative.</p><p>A one-off £175 is up for grabs for those who switch to its 1st Account via the Current Account Switch Service (CASS). You must switch at least two <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/banking/credit-cards/direct-debit-vs-standing-order/\">direct debits or standing orders</a>, and within the first 45 days of the account opening, you must deposit at least £1,000, make at least five debit card transactions and log in to digital banking.</p><p>The kicker is you can’t get the payment if you’ve held a First Direct account before, or if you’ve opened an account with HSBC since Jan 1 2018.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Lloyds Bank: £200</h2><p>As of September 2025, Lloyds Bank has launched a switching offer for eligible new and existing customers who switch to a Club Lloyds (Classic, Silver or Platinum) or Lloyds Premier account.</p><p>The switch must be completed using the CASS, including a minimum of three direct debits.</p><p>You won’t be eligible if you have received a switching offer from Lloyds Bank, Halifax or Bank of Scotland since April 2020.</p><p>Note that all three accounts come with a monthly fee; Club Lloyds is £5 a month unless you pay in at least £2,000 a month. Club Lloyds Silver and Platinum are an additional £11.50 and £22.50 per month respectively, and also come with features such as breakdown cover and travel insurance.</p><p>Lloyds Premier costs £15 a month, and comes with a Bupa Family GP and wellbeing subscription, plus other benefits – though you can have the monthly fee refunded if you pay in £5,000 a month or hold £100,000 qualifying savings or investments.</p><p>If you fulfil all of the criteria, the money will be paid into your new Lloyds account within three working days.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Nationwide: £175</h2><p>Nationwide is also offering £175 for those who switch to one of its three main current accounts – FlexPlus, a packaged account costing £13 a month that comes with family worldwide travel insurance, mobile phone insurance and breakdown cover; FlexDirect, which pays 5pc on balances up to £1,500 and 1pc cashback up to £5 per month for the first 12 months; FlexAccount, an everyday bank account.</p><p>Using the CASS, you’ll need to transfer at least two active direct debits, deposit at least £1,000 and make a qualifying debit card payment within the first 31 days. You’ll receive the bonus payment within 10 days of fulfilling all the requirements.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">NatWest and RBS: £175</h2><p>Switch to either of these sister providers and you can get £175 for your trouble if you meet all requirements.</p><p>You’ll need to open a Select or Reward account, or the Premier equivalents, and within 60 days of switching log in to the mobile banking app and pay in at least £1,250 – this can be done in instalments, but the full amount must be held in the account for at least 24 hours.</p><p>The bonus payment will be made within 30 days of completing these steps.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">TSB: £180</h2><p>TSB is offering a £150 welcome bonus, plus £10 monthly cashback for three months when you open and switch to one of its Spend &amp; Save accounts, as of Sept 30 2025.</p><p>There are some requirements to fulfil, though. Firstly, your switch (via CASS) must be completed by Dec 9 2025, and to get the £150, you must log in to the TSB mobile banking app and make at least five debit card payments by that date. You must also pay in at least £1,000 from a non-TSB account. If successful, the initial part of the bonus will be paid between March 28 and April 11.</p><p>To earn the monthly cashback, you need to make at least 20 card payments in each calendar month.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\"><a class=\"ck-anchor\" id=\"switching-via-the-cassundefined\" name=\"switching-via-the-cassundefined\">Switching via the CASS</a></h2><p>To qualify for the free cash handouts, you have to go down the “official” transfer route, and this means using the Current Account Switch Service (CASS).</p><p>This is a free scheme which aims to take the hassle out of switching, with the process completed in seven working days. While most banks are signed up, not all of them are, so you will need to check availability when you’re looking to move.</p><p>All payments going out, such as direct debits, and those coming in, such as your salary, will be moved for you. Any payments accidentally made or requested from the old account after you’ve moved will be automatically redirected.</p><p>There is also a guarantee that acts as a safety net if anything goes wrong, meaning you will receive a refund of interest and charges on both your old and new accounts.</p><p>Mr Hagger said: “The CASS has given many consumers the confidence to ditch their existing bank.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Check qualifying terms</h2><p>As we’ve noted earlier, there can sometimes be several hoops to jump through in order to qualify for a switching bonus; if this is a big part of why you want to move accounts then it’s worth ensuring you meet all the criteria laid down by your chosen provider.</p><p>Mr Hagger added: “This might mean ensuring you <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/private-bank-accounts-coutts-swiss/\">credit the account with a certain amount each month</a>, or checking you have the right number of direct debits or standing orders set up on the account.”</p><p>If you’re a regular current account switcher, you’ll likely need to avoid going back to the same provider – or group of providers – for a few years before you’re able to get another switching bonus.</p><p>The key is to read the full terms before you agree to switch.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\"><a class=\"ck-anchor\" id=\"how-to-become-a-serial-switcherundefined\" name=\"how-to-become-a-serial-switcherundefined\">How to become a serial switcher</a></h2><p>If you’re savvy with your money, and have the time to dedicate to regularly scouring switching offers, there’s decent cash to be earned by switching more than once.</p><p>Mr Hagger said: “If you’re comfortable opening and closing bank accounts, and happy with the idea of getting new debit cards, account numbers, sort codes, PINs, new online banking set-ups and passwords, then there’s money to be made.”</p><p>This trick involves cashing in on all of the available switching deals – so it makes sense to time it for whenever there are several available.</p><p>Better still, further deals may appear in the weeks to come. By the time you get to the end of the process of switching to these providers, you could find there are fresh offers available from the other banks, meaning you could potentially earn even more.</p><p>Before you get excited, don’t bank on having that cash to spend right away.</p><p>Kate Brain, banking expert at ratings firm Defaqto, said: “While the CASS means you can switch accounts within seven days, be aware that some of the conditions mean it does take longer for the money to be paid out.”</p><p>One tip she recommends for “serial switchers” is to think about opening a separate account from your main current account. So, keeping some direct debits and spending in one account that you hold more consistently, while transferring others around. This can be a help if you are concerned about transferring all your outgoings.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">How exactly do you switch bank accounts?</h2><p>Once you’ve found a new account you’d like to move to, compare it against other offerings, just to be sure you’re making the right choice.</p><p>Then, check that you’re eligible for the account, and the switching offer.</p><p>If you’re happy that you qualify, all you need to do is open the new account and let your new provider know you’re switching over. It should only take a matter of minutes to fill out the form.</p><p>Your new bank will then do all the legwork for you. This includes transferring all your direct debits and standing orders being transferred to your new account.</p><p>It’s then down to you to select the date you want your account switched, and down to your former bank to take care of closing your old account.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\"><a class=\"ck-anchor\" id=\"top-tips-for-switching-bank-accountsundefined\" name=\"top-tips-for-switching-bank-accountsundefined\">Top tips for switching bank accounts</a></h2><p>While the CASS aims to make the switching process as seamless as possible, it can still be a little disruptive – but there are things you can do to make sure you don’t lose track of your payments.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Download your bank statements</h2><p>Before your old account gets shut down, download your bank statements from the past few months. That way, you will have them if you need them – they might be required if you need to remortgage or apply for another kind of borrowing, for example.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Assess your direct debits</h2><p>Seize the opportunity to make a note of all your direct debits, standing orders and subscriptions, so you know you’ve moved everything over. Also use this as a chance to look for better deals and weed out any payments for services you no longer use.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Hold off setting up new payments</h2><p>In the few days while the switching process is taking place, don’t set up any regular payments from your old account, as they may not be moved over.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Check your overdraft eligibility</h2><p>If you have an overdraft with your existing provider, you will need to speak to your new bank first to see if this facility can be agreed on your new account. Borrowing rules can vary between providers, so don’t assume you’ll be able to get the same amount of overdraft.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Consider your credit score</h2><p>While switching accounts shouldn’t <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/mortgages/how-boost-credit-score-mortgage-repayments/\">affect your credit score</a>, tread carefully if you are thinking of taking out a mortgage or loan in the near future. Mortgage providers and other lenders don’t like to see too many accounts opened in a short space of time, as this could suggest money problems. With this in mind, avoid switching providers too frequently ahead of applying for any type of borrowing.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Seen an offer you like? Don’t delay</h2><p>If you decide one of the accounts offering a cash incentive is right for you, you need to act fast, as these latest switching deals may not hang around for long.</p><p>Rachel Springall, from Moneyfactscompare.co.uk, said: “Switching bonuses come and go. There is no guarantee such lucrative perks will remain on offer forever.”</p><p>That being said, it’s also important to research any deals carefully before making any decision.</p><p>Ms Springall added: “Consumers may be tempted to grab a free cash perk, but it is imperative you weigh up the overall package on offer before committing to any new account.”</p><p>It’s not all about the money; your current account is likely to be the financial service you use most often, so you also need to be sure the account suits you, and the way you manage your finances. If, for instance, you’re switching to an online-only bank, when you value visiting a branch, then the switch may not be the best decision.</p></div></div></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"grid-col grid-col-12 tpl-article__layout tpl-article__layout--content\"><div class=\"tpl-article-body-comment\" data-js=\"article-body\" data-test=\"tpl-article-body-recipe\"><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text article-body-text--drop-cap article-body-text--drop-cap-comment\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Change is an inevitable but daunting proposition, and for the last two years there has been a lot of <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/29/red-flags-redbird-spymaster-beijing-banker-telegraph/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">anxiety over the change in ownership</a> at The Telegraph. But there is another change that does not get enough debate and is a wake-up call for the industry – namely, the technological disintermediation that is threatening the business model of journalism. Navigating this will require change – but not change to editorial standards or to journalism. The task at hand is to evolve The Telegraph’s business model to serve its readers, invest in more high-quality journalism, and retain and attract the very best talent to reach a larger audience, both in the UK and globally.</p><p>RedBird Capital Partners wants to buy The Telegraph for one simple reason: we believe it has the potential to become the most successful conservative newspaper in the English-speaking world, and we have the investment resources and operating expertise to help transform a legacy newspaper business (that everyone says is in decline) into a growth-oriented media company.</p><p>As with all our intellectual property-based businesses over the last 25 years, we will never compromise the integrity of the content which is core to the investment thesis in our underwriting plans. We don’t tell Ben Affleck and Matt Damon what movies to make at Artists Equity, and we won’t ever compromise the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/30/telegraph-bidder-independence-safeguard-amid-china-scrutiny/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">editorial independence of The Telegraph</a>. At RedBird, we are very clear about one fundamental premise: don’t invest in a newspaper if you want to influence it – that will kill the investment thesis and is just bad business.</p><p>RedBird has a track record of investing in world class media businesses to help them transition their business models and navigate secular transitions like the ones facing the newspaper industry today. With our partner Skydance Media, we recently acquired Paramount Global, the owner of CBS News and 60 Minutes, America’s leading in-depth news programme for more than<br/>half a century. Last month we added The Free Press, which was founded by Bari Weiss, a champion of free speech and independent journalism.</p><p>Our investment underwriting case for The Telegraph justifies the price we are paying. Our returns are driven by subscriber growth as well as reinvestment into other strategic revenue initiatives. And our valuation is substantially below those of The New York Times and News Corp. As we drive digital revenue growth across the flywheel of new initiatives, the market should reward us with multiples more consistent with our industry peers.</p><p>The Telegraph has a distinguished history of championing freedom of expression. To reinforce this, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/30/telegraph-bidder-independence-safeguard-amid-china-scrutiny/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">we will establish an independent advisory board</a> tasked with upholding the highest standards of journalistic integrity. We have asked the deputy chairman of Telegraph Media Group, Lord Black of Brentwood – who has the strongest press freedom credentials and a long<br/>track record in media ethics and regulation – to make recommendations on how such a mechanism would work and how it might be composed. We are delighted he has agreed to do so.</p><p>RedBird’s ownership of The Telegraph will be through our heavily regulated fund, not as an individual proprietor, which is an important distinction that gets overlooked in the debates around ownership. Our funds are backed by a diverse group of leading global blue-chip institutional investors and family offices, which do not include any institutions or individuals from the UAE or from China.</p><p>In terms of the concerns around influence by external actors, RedBird is regulated by both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in the United States. Both ensure that we fulfill our fiduciary responsibility to our investors in compliance with the law. The notion that we could be influenced by any external<br/>group would violate our fiduciary duty. And it would be against the law.</p><p>RedBird’s partner IMI has reduced its stake to 15pc with no governance rights, in full accordance with UK law. We have also assembled a group of leading UK-based investors who bring important news and media expertise, including Lord Rothermere, the chairman and controlling shareholder of the Daily Mail and General Trust, who is a champion of editorial freedom and independence. These are sophisticated investors who have joined us because they share The Telegraph’s values and believe in our ambitious growth plans.</p><p>These are worrying times for newspapers. Total UK newspaper circulation has fallen 60pc over the last decade. Over half of the UK public already get some, if not all, of their news from social media, and young people increasingly get their news from TikTok. This transition from print to digital has been complicated by the decline of Google Search, which is how many new readers discover The Telegraph’s journalism. Thanks to AI and tools such as ChatGPT, this decline has accelerated. But this technological reckoning also brings an opportunity to harness AI as a tool to strengthen journalism – giving journalists and editors the tools to tell stories with greater immediacy and reach, while ensuring that the same editorial rigour, independence and values that have defined The Telegraph for generations remain core to its foundation.</p><p>For some time, The New York Times has prospered on the global stage, offering its users digital products and services alongside its journalism and attracting almost 12 million subscribers. Our ambitious plans for The Telegraph would see it become the global centre right equivalent to The New York Times, offering world class journalism and commentary that resonates in the UK and globally. After all, The Telegraph’s values – fearlessness, insightfulness, pro-enterprise, fair play, free speech and the rule of law – are timeless.</p><hr/><p><em>Gerry Cardinale is managing partner of RedBird Capital Partners</em></p></div></div></div></div>",

They come nearly two and a half years after ownership of The Telegraph was thrown into doubt by the financial troubles of the Barclay family, the previous owners.</p><p>RedBird’s consortium includes a 15pc stake for the United Arab Emirates. The firm also has multiple links to China, including through its controversial chairman John Thornton. His long standing financial and political ties to Beijing have prompted calls in the House of Lords for a national security investigation of the proposed takeover.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Mr Cardinale said: “RedBird’s ownership of The Telegraph will be through our heavily regulated fund, not as an individual proprietor, which is an important distinction that gets overlooked in the debates around ownership.</p><p>“Our funds are backed by a diverse group of leading global blue-chip institutional investors and family offices which do not include any institutions or individuals from the UAE or from China.</p><p>“The notion that we could be influenced by any external group would violate our fiduciary duty.

Lord Rothermere is expected to take a 10pc stake.</p><p>RedBird made an earlier takeover attempt using mostly funds from the royal family of the United Arab Emirates, but was blocked following an outcry over press freedom. That bid also included proposals for an independent “editorial trust board” composed of senior figures from journalism and politics who were never revealed.</p><p>The effectiveness of such structures has been debated in the news industry. Rupert Murdoch agreed to create an independent board of directors for The Times to win approval for his 1981 takeover.</p><p>On paper, they were meant to safeguard editorial independence and have final say on top appointments. In practice, Mr Murdoch was often closely involved in newsroom decisions and able to impose his leadership choices in the face of opposition from the directors. The board was disbanded in 2021 with ministerial approval.</p><p>Mr Murdoch proposed a comparable structure to safeguard Sky News when he made a second bid for control of Sky in 2017. The proposal was eventually adopted by Comcast when it won a bidding war for the satellite broadcaster, along with a 10-year guarantee of investment.</p></div></div></div></div>",

The US pharmaceutical giant now has four working days to salvage a deal.</p><p>It comes as drug giants scramble to secure the newest and most innovative weight-loss treatments to meet soaring demand.</p><p>Metsera is developing treatments based on the hormone amylin, which researchers have suggested could <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/02/08/weight-loss-drugs-lose-muscle-mass-astrazeneca/\">stop people from losing muscle</a> during rapid weight loss.</p><p>Currently, Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy help people to shed pounds, but also lead them to lose muscle as well as fat.</p><p>The same goes for Novo’s Ozempic, which is a diabetes drug used off-label for weight loss.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘Ozempic face’</h2><p>As well as being praised for the weight-loss credentials, the drugs have also been blamed for the rise of “Ozempic face”. This is where people receiving treatment start to appear gaunt as they lose muscle mass in their cheeks.</p><p>However, researchers have suggested that amylin could help people to maintain muscle even as they lose weight, as the hormone appears to play a role in maintaining body composition.</p><p>Dimitris Papamargaritis, an associate professor at the University of Leicester, earlier this year said: “Early lab studies suggest that adding amylin could help people lose more fat while sparing muscle, though this still needs confirmation in humans.”</p><p>Pharmaceutical companies have become increasingly aware of the issue as the drugs grow in popularity.</p><p>Sir Pascal Soriot, the AstraZeneca chief executive, last year said weight-loss medicines needed to be <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/lose-fat-maintain-muscle-diet-advice-meal-plan/\">more targeted towards fat</a> to help people avoid losing too much muscle in the long term.</p><p>He said: “Today you lose weight but you lose fat and you lose muscle. The problem with many of [the treatments] is when you stop, you regain weight, because obesity is a chronic disease.</p><p>“Most people, as soon as they stop taking the medicines, they regain fat, but not so much the muscle that they have lost unless, of course, they go to the gym.”</p><p>AstraZeneca is developing its own weight-loss treatments, with the aim of leapfrogging rivals with new, potentially cheaper, obesity drugs. In 2023, it bought a Chinese biotech which was working on a weight-loss pill.</p><p>Metsera is also developing pill-based weight-loss drugs, as well as longer-lasting treatments. It is testing one injection that people would only have to take once a month, compared to current weight-loss jabs that require once-a-week injections.</p><p>Novo Nordisk made the offer for the US biotech as it battles a slump in performance, having recently announced <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/10/ozempic-maker-to-cut-9000-jobs/\">plans to cut 9,000 jobs</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>",

Are they telling us something more fundamental about the private finance and private assets sector?”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Last week, the IMF warned that a downturn could have ripple effects across the financial system, as banks become increasingly exposed to an industry that is largely unregulated.</p><p>Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, warned we could now be set to see <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/14/uk-unemployment-ons-trump-china-ftse-100-us-wall-street/\">the emergence of more “cockroaches”</a> in the financial system.</p><p>One of the first challenges Bailey and the Financial Conduct Authority face is attempting to keep up with the exposure of the UK financial sector.</p><p>HSBC recently launched its own bid to build a $50bn (£38bn) private credit fund over the next five years. NatWest has around £5bn of private credit loans on its balance sheet, The Telegraph understands.</p><p>The terms of Phoenix Group’s investments in Edinburgh Airport are confidential, but the insurer has over £15bn worth of private credit investments worldwide on its books.</p><p>L&amp;G has teamed up with Blackstone in a deal that will see L&amp;G invest 10pc of all future sales from its pensions annuity policies into Blackstone’s private credit deals.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Breakneck expansion</h2><p>Investment manager M&amp;G bought a majority stake in Swedish private credit firm P Capital Partners earlier this year to add to its £73bn private markets arm.</p><p>M&amp;G has also been exploring ways to open up private credit to other types of investors. It launched its first European Long-Term Investment Fund in 2023, with the aim of making such investments available to a much wider pool than the big institutions who have acted as the main players in the private credit world.</p><p>At the launch, Catherine Ross, the head of private credit at M&amp;G, said: “Once a niche asset class, the significant growth in private equity in the past decade and companies staying private for longer has further evolved the depth and breadth of the corporate credit market.”</p><p>This breakneck expansion has led to concerns that less sophisticated investors could be ploughing money into private credit without truly knowing what they’re in for.</p><p>“Most of the customers for private credit are these big institutional pension plans, the beneficiaries of which are ex-cops or ex-school teachers, ex-state employees … any shortfall ultimately would decrease their payouts,” Jeffrey Hooke, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, said.</p><p>The rise of the shadow banking system itself is largely a result of tighter regulations on banks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>The stringent rules helped fuel the growth of private loans, as big banks pulled away from lending due to heightened scrutiny and concerns over risks. Hedge funds, private equity firms and big financiers stepped in to fill the void.</p><p>With the promise of stronger returns than other types of lending and less volatility than stock markets, this new market has attracted huge investments from banks and asset managers seeking new avenues to generate returns on their money.</p><p>In the hunt for fresh pools of capital to finance their dealmaking, private credit firms have swooped on a string of UK insurers. In April, Esure was sold to Ageas for £1.3bn. In July, Athora, which is backed by Apollo, struck a £5.7bn deal to buy out Pensions Insurance Corporation. The following month, Brookfield bought out Just Group for £2.4bn.</p><p>The value of the private credit market is now expected to double over the next five years to more than $4.5tn by 2030.</p><p>Gareth Mee, who heads L&amp;G’s pensions division, said: “Ten years ago private credit was considered non-traditional but today it’s a mainstay of insurance companies’ portfolios.”</p><p>The investments are particularly attractive to insurers due to the extensive timelines on which they work, with private credit typically promising stronger returns to investors willing to lock in their cash over periods of at least five years.</p><p>“We are uniquely interested in very long-dated assets and if you think about the capital markets, there are a lot more assets at the short end than there are at the long end,” Mee said.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘Marketing hype’</h2><p>However, Hooke, the economist, dismisses the promises of “fantastic returns” from private credit firms as “marketing hype”.</p><p>“It’s very similar to private equity. They run around screaming about how great their returns are then when you put pen to paper, they’re not so great. The same with private credit. They say they’ve got these fantastic returns but when you actually study it, it doesn’t look that way.”</p><p>“We don’t really know whether those claims are even real until the funds are fully liquidated, and even after eight or nine years, a lot of them still have a big percentage of un-liquidated assets,” he added.</p><p>A study he and fellow academics at Johns Hopkins and the University of California conducted found “private credit funds barely outperform, or in some cases underperform, the benchmarks”.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Insurers say their own investments in private credit are subject to stringent controls that limit any risks to a minimum.</p><p>Mike Eakins, the chief investment officer at Phoenix Group, says: “The type of companies that we lend to, both public and private, are very solid businesses that are producing revenues and profits that have been modelled out for many, many years.</p><p>“When people think of private credit, understandably they think it’s more risk, but for insurers that’s genuinely not the case.”</p><p>Insurers say the huge buffers they are required to have in place would shield them from any crisis.</p><p>Still, analysts warn a lack of transparency in the private credit market means it’s hard to know where the risks are until they actually emerge.</p><p>Vivek Raja, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: “The biggest issue here is the opacity. You don’t know the s--- has hit the fan until it’s in your face.”</p><p>He adds that the extent to which big institutions are now invested in private credit means any meltdowns risk having widespread impacts throughout the financial system.</p><p>“It’s become a whole ecosystem with leverage lines into various places. If something unravels it can have a cascading impact,” he warned.</p><p>The FCA declined to comment.</p></div></div></div></div>",

I have personally admired his work for a long time.</p><p>He is someone who most people in the street would recognise, particularly because of his work on our public broadcaster the BBC.</p><p>But I, and many others, cannot help wondering what has happened to the man. Many Jews have been deeply disturbed by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/10/21/louis-therouxs-whitewashing-of-bob-vylan-is-disgraceful/\">Mr Theroux’s interview with the frontman of Bob Vylan</a>, the musician who <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/06/30/police-investigating-glastonbury-hate-speech-rapper/\">chanted “Death to the IDF”</a> and complained about working for “a Zionist” during a Glastonbury performance broadcast by the BBC and condemned as anti-Semitic by the Prime Minister.</p><p>Mr Theroux has interviewed many people with extreme views in the past and there is nothing wrong with doing so in principle. </p><p>What is shocking is the way he interviewed Bob Vylan and most particularly what Theroux chose to say himself during the interview. Much of the reaction to the podcast so far has focused on Vylan’s offensive and aggressive language, but many Jewish people are far more concerned with Theroux’s own words.</p><p>“I think I’d add to that”, Theroux said, “that Jewish identity in the Jewish community, as expressed in Israel, has become almost like an acceptable quote, unquote way of understanding ethno-nationalism… they’re prototyping an aggressive, militarised form of ethno-nationalism which is then rolled out, whether it’s by people like Viktor Orban in Hungary or Trump in the US. It’s become sort of this certain sense of post-Holocaust Jewish exceptionalism or Zionist exceptionalism, has become a role model on the national stage for what these white identitarians would like to do in their own countries.”</p><p>To claim that Jews have inspired modern ethno-nationalism around the world is not analysis. It is inversion. It echoes the oldest anti-Semitic trope of all: that Jews are at the centre of a global conspiracy and ultimately to blame for the world’s ills.</p><p>That such words were spoken by one of Britain’s once most respected broadcasters marks a new low in our cultural discourse. This is how anti-Semitism becomes mainstream, not through cranks on street corners but through influential voices who dress hostility up as nuance and pseudo-intellectualism.</p><p>In response, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/10/25/ba-pulls-louis-theroux-podcast-funding-bob-vylan-interview/\">British Airways has now paused its sponsorship of the podcast</a>. That decision deserves praise. But the question remains: how did we reach a point in Britain where Theroux and his production company believed that these views were acceptable public discourse?</p><p>Theroux’s comments do not exist in isolation. They are part of a wider cultural drift, in which hatred of Jews has become the one form of bigotry that can still be excused, rationalised, or dressed up as intellectual critique.</p><p>Across British culture, the moral boundaries that once protected Jews from vilification are eroding. Again and again, institutions and individuals who proudly parade their anti-racist credentials fall silent when the victims are Jews. In too many spaces, anti-Semitism has become the one form of hatred that still earns a hearing.</p><p>Over the past two years, Britain’s Jewish community has warned of a growing normalisation of anti-Semitism in mainstream culture. What was once the language of extremists is now spoken comfortably in our cultural institutions and by mainstream celebrities.</p><p>That is why this moment matters. Louis Theroux was not some anonymous podcaster courting controversy; he is a central figure in our broadcasting tradition. To hear him describe Jewish identity as a prototype for white nationalism, to see him so openly flirt with anti-Semitic conspiracy theories should frighten us all.</p><p>The question is what happens now? Will the BBC cease to work with Theroux or will they turn a blind eye because it is easier and more convenient to do so? Do BBC executives really mean it when they say that anti-Semitism in any form is unacceptable? And will Netflix, Theroux’s new partner, tolerate this and proudly feature him on their platform?</p><p>No one should look away when anti-Semitism attempts to hide behind sophistication. If we stay silent when anti-Semitism arrives wrapped in apparent respectability it will not stop with podcasts. It will spread further into our classrooms, our workplaces, and on to our streets.</p><hr/><p><em>Danny Cohen is a former director of BBC Television</em></p></div></div></div></div>",

Isas aren’t too dissimilar to their traditional savings counterparts with easy access, notice, fixed and regular accounts being an option.</p><p>“It is worth considering that for the variable rate options, interest could increase or decrease over time, and those Isas that are fixed for an agreed term will either not allow earlier access or may deduct a certain amount of interest.”</p><p>Cash Isas can also be an effective way of saving for the longer term.</p><p>Mark Hicks, of Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Cash Isas have certainly seen a resurgence of late. Looking at what may be coming in Labour’s Budget, and the rhetoric around higher taxes, cash Isas should be the first port of call for all savers at the moment.</p><p>“If you’ve got £20,000 or less, definitely go for a cash Isa first and ensure your money is protected from tax. If you’re fortunate enough to have more than <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/isas/can-put-20000-in-isa-annually/\">£20,000 to save in an Isa</a>, then you can look at other saving accounts as well.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\"><a class=\"ck-anchor\" id=\"why-choose-a-cash-isaundefined\" name=\"why-choose-a-cash-isaundefined\">Why choose a cash Isa?</a></h2><p>Cash Isas are beneficial for many savers as they offer an easy way to make sure your returns remain free from tax.</p><p>Their popularity took a dip when the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/tax/how-tax-personal-savings-works/\">personal savings allowance</a> (PSA) was introduced in 2016, as it means some savers can earn up to £1,000 in tax-free savings interest each tax year. When interest rates are low, only those with large savings pots or high incomes come into the scope of paying tax on savings interest.</p><p>However, savings rates have been high for some time; until recently it was not uncommon to be earning 5pc. Someone with a £1,000 PSA could face a savings tax bill with £20,000 in savings – a problem that doesn’t occur with a cash Isa. What’s more, your growth is protected as it compounds for years into the future, which has helped some savers <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/isas/how-become-isa-millionaire-key-steps-calculator/\">become Isa millionaires.</a></p><p>The main issue that comes with a cash Isa is the £20,000 Isa limit on how much you can pay into it each tax year. If you want to move a large savings deposit in order to protect your returns from tax, it may need to be moved gradually over several years.</p><p>In some cases, interest rates offered by cash Isas can be lower than their savings equivalent. Providers are well aware of the extra tax benefit Isas offer, and know they don’t have to be as competitive with rates.</p><p>It’s important to shop around and find the most competitive rate you can. Cash Isa rates can be lower than their savings account counterparts, but the tax-free benefits of an Isa will often outweigh the loss of a little interest.</p><p>If you’re not sure whether you could be in danger of having to pay tax on your savings interest, try the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/banking/savings-accounts/tax-calculator-how-much-will-pay-savings/\">Telegraph Money savings tax calculator</a> – simply enter your savings, interest rate and tax band and it can tell you whether you’d be better off getting an Isa.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\"><a class=\"ck-anchor\" id=\"faqs\" name=\"faqs\">Cash Isa FAQs</a></h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">How many cash Isas can I have?</h2><p>There is no limit to the number of cash Isas you can have – but it’s a good idea not to have so many that you lose track of them.</p><p>You can hold cash Isas you’ve paid into in past tax years, and – now that Isa rules have changed – you can also open and pay into as many as you like in the same tax year. The key thing is to make sure you don’t pay in more than £20,000 across all Isas in the same tax year.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Can you combine multiple Isas into one?</h2><p>Yes, you can combine Isas into one account – but in order to do this without affecting the tax status of the money, or your Isa allowance, you must move the cash via an Isa transfer.</p><p>There are quite a few rules to bear in mind when you do this – you can find out more in our <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/banking/savings-accounts/isa-transfer-rules-tax-bill-interest-rates-stocks-shares/\">comprehensive guide to Isa transfers</a>.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Would a cash Isa beat inflation?</h2><p>This depends on the rate you’re earning and the rate of inflation. At the time of writing, lots of cash Isas can beat inflation, but you increasingly need to shop around for them as rates continue to slide. It’s a good idea to keep an eye on what’s happening with inflation versus the best Isa rates so you can gauge whether or not you have a competitive deal.</p><p>Our <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/banking/savings-accounts/how-much-inflation-costing-you-savings-assets/\">inflation calculator</a> shows the effect rising prices can have on your savings.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Is it too late to put money in an Isa?</h2><p>It’s never too late to put money in an Isa to benefit from its tax-free status. However, you may miss the end of the tax year if you leave it too late to make a deposit.</p><p>The annual <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/isas/isa-allowance-guide/\">Isa allowance</a> resets at the start of a tax year on April 6. You can put all of this into one account, or split it among several.</p><p>Mr Hicks said: “Isas were typically seasonal, with a big spike in demand around the end of the tax year. They are much less timely now and every year the cash Isa season gets longer and longer.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

One said: “The numbers were statistically absurd.”</p><p>Separately on Tuesday, Spanish utilities giant Iberdrola, which owns Scottish Power, also reported a 5pc drop in UK wind farm generation because of “lower wind resource”.</p><p>A turbine’s efficiency can be affected by a variety of factors, such as wind speeds, “wind theft” from other nearby farms and how often the structures are paid to switch off to prevent over-congestion on the network.</p><p>Wind speeds have also been dropping across the UK and Europe over decades, a phenomenon known as “stilling”. However, a recent Cardiff University study found that wind speeds have begun picking up in recent years.</p><p>The Government’s new estimates slashed the predicted “load factor” – the proportion of the year turbines are expected to generate power – from 61pc to 43.6pc for offshore wind. The estimated load factor for onshore turbines was also revised down, from 48.7pc to 33.4pc.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The changes were blamed on new modelling showing that wind turbines generated less power at various wind speeds than previously thought, as well as updated assumptions on what can cause turbines to lose power.</p><p>A spokesman for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) did not address why the Government had revised its estimates down so drastically.</p><p>Claire Coutinho, the shadow energy secretary and Mr Miliband’s predecessor in the last Tory government, said: “My time in the department convinced me that the Government is relying on bogus numbers that make net zero look artificially cheap.</p><p>“I started a full system cost analysis to reveal the true cost of an energy system dependent on wind and solar, but Ed Miliband has scrapped it because he doesn’t want to know the truth. That tells you all you need to know. Bad data leads to bad policy.”</p><p>The downgrade has also raised doubts about Mr Miliband’s ability to hit his clean power targets. Labour is committed to switching the electricity system to <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/01/27/ed-miliband-poised-to-miss-2030-net-zero-targets/\">95pc clean power sources by 2030</a>, a goal that will require a tripling of current offshore wind capacity alone.</p><p>Less efficient wind turbines still face the same construction costs, pushing up the amount of subsidy needed to make projects viable. Industry experts said the latest round of subsidies was not generous enough to deliver the level of wind power needed to hit the Energy Secretary’s goals.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Mr Miliband still needs to secure at least another 12 gigawatts of capacity, but RenewableUK, which represents wind farm owners, said he had only budgeted enough in the latest auction for five gigawatts.</p><p>This is significant because this year’s auction, known as <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/27/miliband-make-households-pay-11bn-a-year-for-offshore-wind/\">allocation round 7 (AR7)</a>, is seen as one of the Energy Secretary’s last chances to acquire enough power for his target.</p><p><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/09/14/sleepwalking-into-net-zero-disaster-starmer-must-miliband/\">Kathryn Porter</a>, an independent energy consultant, said the Government’s load factor revisions could not “change budget reality” and meant that Mr Miliband would be able to procure less capacity than last year.</p><p>She added: “You can assume higher load factors in a spreadsheet, but that doesn’t reduce the actual capital outlay or construction cost per gigawatt.”</p><p>The “likely practical outcome” was that this year’s £900m budget would “underwrite fewer gigawatts” than before, Ms Porter said.</p><p>An DESNZ spokesman stressed that the revision did not necessarily mean higher subsidies would need to be paid out, as the money is only paid out if wholesale power prices in the future fall below a certain level.</p><p>However, the Government admitted the reduced load factors did influence the maximum budget ministers were willing to set overall for offshore wind power support.</p><p>Nick Hibberd, of RenewableUK, said: “In previous auctions, load factor assumptions have been very high compared to reasonable expectations of offshore wind generation in future years.”</p><p>RenewableUK said the current actual load factor for offshore turbines was about 38pc. That figure has tended to improve over time due to improved technology and the growing use of bigger, more efficient turbines.</p></div></div></div></div>",

The Chinese certainly are, and I think that is one of the things that we have to be a little bit careful about,” he said. <br/><br/>“They are taking an approach that’s incompatible with the way the West is regulating, which has a geopolitical overlay because it could lead to polarisation into different spheres of influence.</p><p>“There are 50 companies in China, and they are looking at all sorts of things.

However, that has begun to shift.</p><p>Western nations have meanwhile taken steps towards a unified approach to the regulation of the new aircraft, with the “five eyes” intelligence alliance of Britain, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand forming the joint National Aviation Authority in June.<br/><br/>The White House also issued an executive order mandating the acceleration of safe eVTOL deployment in the US.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘More work to be done’</h2><p>Mr Allison said the developments were positive, though “there is more work to be done”.<br/><br/>He said it is also vital that politicians and regulators view flying taxis not as a niche product but as one that could unleash a huge new industry in years to come.<br/><br/>He said: “Air taxis are just the first application for all-electric power, which happens to be really exciting and which everyone wants to see happen.</p><p>“But it’s not just a nice thing to do. This technology will be foundational for the next era of aviation. The great transitions in this industry have come on the heels of new propulsion systems.”<br/><br/>Mr Allison said the FAA is aware of the risks and has been “leaning in harder than ever” despite changes in personnel as part of Donald Trump’s efforts to shrink the federal workforce.<br/><br/>Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority also appears “enthusiastic” about the eVTOL sector after regaining its status as an independent regulator following Brexit, he said.<br/><br/>Joby Aviation, which has an outline deal to supply flying taxis to Virgin Atlantic for flights between Heathrow and the City, is planning its first commercial services in the United Arab Emirates.</p></div></div></div></div>",

The markets also view it this way, as it’s about constructive dialogue between the industry and the Government.</p><p>“The US is by far the biggest priority market for our industry because the US is the best country in the world to discover and develop innovation.”</p><p>As the country’s largest drugmaker, GSK has become a national champion for the UK pharmaceutical sector, despite generating only a small proportion of its revenues in the UK.</p><p><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/10/our-pharma-industry-powerhouses-need-emergency-treatment/\">Britain represents just 2pc</a> of the £65bn drugmaker sales, compared to 52pc in the US.</p><p>Despite this, Dame Emma said the group would not ditch its listing on the London stock market for New York. GSK’s shares have fallen overall in the eight years since she took over in 2017.</p><p>“I’m not getting distracted by the listing questions that everyone keeps asking about,” Dame Emma told Bloomberg’s Women, Money &amp; Power conference.</p><p>“Our listing location doesn’t distract from where we allocate our capital in terms of investments. There are no plans for that.”</p><p>She also said there had been “zero engagement” on a potential merger with any other UK pharmaceutical company.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">AstraZeneca fears</h2><p>Her comments come days after AstraZeneca stoked fears that Britain’s <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/29/astrazeneca-strengthens-ties-to-america-in-listing-shake-up/\">biggest drugmaker could quit London</a> after it announced plans to list shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>In a shake-up announced on Monday, the FTSE pharmaceuticals giant said it would upgrade its US listing to ensure it is equally as important in New York as it is on the London Stock Exchange.</p><p>Bosses said the move would make it easier for the company to raise money from US investors, describing it as “a global listing for global investors in a global company”.</p><p>Analysts at AJ Bell said the decision hinted “at the possibility of a more dramatic shift at some point in the future”.</p></div></div></div></div>",

Volkswagen, which is the EU’s biggest carmaker, is heavily exposed as it makes most of its vehicles in Europe.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Sweeping job cuts</h2><p>Volkswagen, which employs over 650,000 workers worldwide, outlined plans for a sweeping overhaul of its business last year that will see it lay off 35,000 of its German staff over the next five years, in a push to make €4bn in annual savings.</p><p>The restructuring plans will see the industrial giant slash production by roughly 700,000 vehicles a year, and move production of its iconic VW Golf from Germany to Mexico.</p><p>Meanwhile, Volkswagen recorded a €4.7bn hit from Porsche in the third quarter after the luxury carmaker delayed plans to transition towards mainly selling electric vehicles.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>In September, the luxury marque said it would continue producing fossil fuel-powered cars “well into the 2030s”.</p><p>Porsche had previously said it expected 80pc of the cars it sold would be battery-powered by 2030. It pinned the change on the slow development of the market for EVs.</p><p>The last time Volkswagen posted a quarterly loss was at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in the second quarter of 2020, when it lost €2.4bn.</p><p>The German carmaker also warned that its performance moving forward would depend on securing enough semiconductors, amid uncertainty over crucial supply <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/28/china-took-uk-secrets-from-manchester-chip-factory/\">from Chinese-owned manufacturer Nexperia</a>.</p><p>The Dutch government <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/26/national-security-chinese-owned-manchester-chip-factory/\">recently took control of a Nexperia factory</a> in the Netherlands over national security concerns, prompting a stand-off with its Chinese owners.</p><p>Shares in Volkswagen slipped around 0.9pc in early trade.</p></div></div></div></div>",

It stated that the proportion of unfilled coach and <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/09/10/tube-strikes-london-bus-drivers/\">bus driver roles</a> in the UK was 12.4 per cent and 3.4 per cent respectively, resulting in a total shortfall of more than 4,000 drivers.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘I wish I could have started sooner’</h2><p>Keith McNally, CPT operations director, said: “The evidence is clear: age itself is not a key determinant of collision risk – experience is.</p><p>“Department for Transport (DfT) and Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency data show that young vocational drivers have fewer collisions than their peers with car licences, and perform comparably with drivers aged 21 and over.”</p><p>Aidan Travasso, who turned 20 earlier this month, became a driver for Swindon-based Barnes Coaches when he was 18 and was disappointed to discover he could not fulfil most of the company’s contracts.</p><p>He said: “It didn’t make sense.

I just wish I could have started sooner.”</p><p>The DfT announced in May it will lower the minimum age for train drivers from 20 to 18 to ease staff shortages.</p><p>A consultation on a proposal to take similar action for bus and coach drivers was conducted by the Conservative government last year, but no outcome has been published.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘Remove these outdated restrictions’</h2><p>The CPT also warned that “many willing applicants drift to other sectors” because they could not start training until they had received their provisional licence, which “often takes weeks or months”.</p><p>The body called for this requirement to be dropped.</p><p>Graham Vidler, CPT chief executive, said: “We all want safe, reliable and affordable bus and coach services. The quickest way to support that is to unlock the potential of young people who are eager to start their careers in our sector.</p><p>“The Government has already taken this step for rail – now it’s time to back Britain’s buses and coaches by removing these outdated restrictions.”</p><p>Richard Holden, the shadow transport secretary, said scrapping the 30-mile limit would “open up new opportunities for young drivers, strengthen the coach and bus sectors, and get more services running in rural communities”.</p><p>A Department for Transport spokesman said: “Better buses are central to the Government’s Plan for Change, and after decades of decline, we’re providing £1 billion in funding this year to improve the reliability and frequency of bus services across the country through our landmark Bus Services Bill.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

Compared with traditional bank lending, there is less regulation and transparency.</p><p>The market’s size has ballooned 50pc in recent years, and the International Monetary Fund estimates that banks worldwide now have about $4.5tn of exposure to private credit players, not all of which has been drawn down.</p><p>Fitch has previously said that the private credit market is still too small to pose a systemic risk to the financial system.</p><p>But in its new note, the agency warns that private credit was “emerging from being a niche product for institutional investors to a more significant asset class that is growing not only in scale but complexity”.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>This meant that “a financial shock event could reveal unexpected transmission channels” to the wider financial markets. This transmission risk could be exacerbated by “the emergence of traditional ‘bubble-like’ characteristics”.</p><p>These included the growing involvement of individual investors alongside big banks and fund managers, and the increased leverage or debt that borrowers were taking on.</p><p>Fitch was also seeing more creative ways of packaging the debt, known as “financial innovation”.</p><p>Another bubble-like trend was “spread compression”, where investors accept a lower yield on these risky investments, which can signal weaker lending standards.</p><p>But Fitch also said it was not yet seeing “classic bubble signs” because investors were still pricing the most high-risk credit more cautiously.</p><p>Also, many banks’ exposures to risky borrowers were indirect. The banks also had only “limited liquidity risk”, meaning they would be able, if required, to pull money out of the private credit vehicles.</p><p>Fitch also warned, though, that “signs of an economic slowdown in the US are building” could create a risk of more defaults among heavy borrowers in sectors like auto parts and used cars, where private credit user Tricolor Holdings has also filed for bankruptcy.</p><p>Fitch said that the US jobs market was “starting to weaken” and “pockets of consumer-related credit performance indicators [are] showing signs of deterioration”.</p><p>The Tricolor and First Brands collapses prompted JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon to warn that more problem-borrowers may be <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/14/uk-unemployment-ons-trump-china-ftse-100-us-wall-street/\">lurking inside the private-credit market</a>.</p><p>“My antenna goes up when things like that happen,” he said. “I probably shouldn’t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there’s probably more.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

That’s not a trick question. Fry some onions, garlic, maybe some carrots and celery, brown the mince, then add a tin of tomatoes, maybe a splash of milk (“lends a desirable sweetness” according to my favourite Marcella Hazan <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/everyday/dinner/best-ragu-bolognese-recipe-beef-leftover-cook-sauce/\">ragu</a> recipe), leave to bubble away on the hob and then serve with pasta, and you used to have a <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/rosie-kellet-in-for-dinner-recipes/\">budget meal</a> for a family of four.</p><p>Those were the days. I have been following a guy on X who is posting a weekly “mince watch”, although prices seem to be going up by the hour. It feels like the hyper-inflationary Weimar Republic. Not long, Marjorie, before we’re wheeling a barrow full of tenners to Aldi to purchase a punnet of blueberries.</p><p>Everywhere I go, people are complaining about <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/26/slash-taxes-cut-food-bills-supermarket-bosses-reeves/\">food costs</a>. “Minced beef now over £5 for 500g. Ridiculous.”</p><p>“What the heck just happened to the price of mince?” demands another shopper next to a picture of Asda lean mince at £8.32.</p><p>The latest shock update: “£9.50 for 500g of mince in Sainsbury’s. Plus security tag, that says it all really.” While inspecting the mince in Waitrose, I notice that no one is <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/best-supermarket-steak-restaurant-worthy-aldi-waitrose-lidl/\">buying steak</a>; the shelves are full. If the Waitrose classes are tightening their belts, things must be bad.</p><p>Whatever the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/banking/savings-accounts/how-much-inflation-costing-you-savings-assets/\">Consumer Price Index (CPI)</a> may say, food inflation is not running at 3.8 per cent or 4.9 per cent or even 5.1 per cent. (Is someone massaging the figures to hide the full dreadful picture from the consumer?) It feels like we are in the middle of the worst <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/jobs/work-benefits/why-i-am-leaving-london-berlin/\">cost of living crisis</a> I can remember, but there is hardly a peep about it on the news.</p><p>There will be a lot in that position this winter, I fear. “I use exactly the same shopping list every four weeks (pension day),” one reader wrote. “I did my shopping yesterday and it cost £190. Four weeks ago exactly the same items cost me £120. Government figures on inflation are a complete nonsense.” Yes, they are.</p><p>“Prices are mad!” says another Telegraph subscriber. “I can do a weekly shop using a small trolley, used to cost me about £70 max, now it’s around £100. I buy very similar every week, no booze or cleaning products, just food. Will fill three bags for life, you don’t get much for your money. The supermarkets have been continually raising their prices since Labour took power. Everyone can see and feel the pain of it.”</p><p>Pole-vault price jumps are common. Items no longer go up by a couple of pence. A <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/gut-health/diet-gut-health-bowel-removed/\">meal deal</a> can leap 23p over a weekend. (How is that justified?) Your favourite salted butter is a quarter more expensive. HOW MUCH?</p><p>Pop into the supermarket for a few bits and suddenly it’s 60 quid. “Have I put a bottle of champagne in there by mistake?” I ask my favourite check-out lady. “I know, it’s scary,” she sighs. “Everyone is really worried.” I notice people are removing items from their baskets and abandoning them, presumably in shock.</p><p>A pensioner admits that she and her husband have almost stopped buying protein – far too expensive – and are subsisting on soup and toast. She wonders if they will be able to stay healthy. “I may have to start shoplifting; <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/08/15/arresting-shoplifters-courts-free-police-katy-bourne-prison/\">everyone else does</a>,” jokes Clara. At least I think she’s joking. Clara is 87.</p><p>Actually, an octogenarian shoplifting gang cruising the aisles on mobility scooters and using sticks to knock items off the shelves might shame the four big supermarkets who are making <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/08/waitrose-outperforms-rivals-for-fourth-month-running/\">record profits</a> while their customers hear the pips squeak. Only pressure from Aldi and Lidl is forcing them to keep prices within reason, and some people claim even Lidl has got pricey.</p><p>What on earth is going on? I blame the useless Labour Government – who doesn’t? Chancellor Rachel Reeves promised to “put more money in your pocket” but the wretched woman’s calamitous, economically innumerate Budget last year only drove up expenses. It’s definitely not the farmers’ fault. “I get the same price for my lamb as I did eight years ago,” moans one.</p><p>It looks like the vertiginous rise in consumer food and catering prices since summer 2024 is a result of the supermarkets passing on the rise in employers’ National Insurance contributions and minimum wage increases introduced by Labour. (So much for Rachel from Accounts not taxing “working people”, the dim mare.)</p><p>The <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/05/26/pubs-and-restaurants-fear-recycling-tax-will-drive-them-out/\">new packaging tax (EPR)</a>, designed to end our throwaway society, is also significantly adding to food inflation, pushing up the cost of everything from sausages to soft drinks. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) expects more than 80 per cent of the EPR’s cost to be passed on to the luckless consumer. Thanks a lot.</p><p>“It’s about 3p on a pack of sausages,” says Andrew Keeble, the co-founder of Heck. This year’s packaging-tax bill for the family-run food manufacturer, based near Bedale, North Yorkshire, is £153,000. Like other food companies, Heck has already absorbed the increases in National Insurance and the “national living wage”, but Keeble suggests this new tax will have to be “passed on to a fairly cash-strapped nation”.</p><p>Green initiatives in general are costing us horribly dear. Ed Miliband’s <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/05/miliband-net-zero-russia-china-sabotage-electricity-cables/\">net zero zealotry</a> and windmill lunacy have given the UK pretty much the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/30/britain-paying-highest-electricity-prices-in-the-world-as-net-zero-costs-rise/\">highest manufacturing electricity prices in the developed world</a> – food manufacturers pass on those costs.</p><p>My friend Karen, who runs the wonderful deli and grocers in our town, explains how everything that goes into producing a jar of strawberry jam – from picking the fruit to making the glass jar – has soared in price. “Customers wonder why we’ve jacked up the prices, but we’re not making any more money. Quite the contrary; like any shop still left open, we’re just about hanging in there.”</p><p>If the Chancellor raises the minimum wage again in <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/28/another-tax-raid-would-send-the-economy-backwards/\">her upcoming Budget</a> – a suicidal display of fake socialist magnanimity – God help us, we’ll all be grubbing for roots and making soup out of bird seed. The family of four goldfinches that are dependent on me feeding them are one of my biggest outgoings, and I can’t abandon the little beauties in the winter.</p><p>How are you finding the cost of food? Have you cut back? Let me know. Don’t, er, mince your words.</p></div></div></div></div>",

One can see why the company, ministers and the industry regulator might be minded to give it the green light in the coming weeks.</p><p>The pressure to hammer out a deal is intense. The threat of a multibillion-pound bill landing on Rachel Reeves’s desk <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/01/bosses-confidence-falls-to-record-low-as-reeves-plots-fresh/\">before her Budget in November</a> is concentrating Whitehall minds.</p><p>Thames is burning cash rapidly. A separate announcement from the company revealed that in August it called on the remaining £628m of a £1.5bn emergency loan.</p><p>It is further worrying evidence of the extent to which an organisation providing critical services to 13 million people continues to live hand-to-mouth after years of reckless ownership.</p><p>With the clock ticking, the “London and Valley” consortium of lenders has come up with a decent upgrade on the somewhat vague proposal published a month ago.</p><p>Then, the prospective new owners declared their undying commitment to “a new transparent and collaborative relationship with regulators”, before outlining a plan lacking in details.</p><p>The highlights of their latest attempt include a more generous portion of equity and a bigger debt write-off than previously envisaged. A commitment to not pay dividends for five years, along with the ambition of eventually returning Thames to the stock market are also welcome measures.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Yet all the hard work that has gone into answering many of the concerns of regulators, Government and long-suffering customers risks being overshadowed by what amounts to a <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/27/thames-water-to-delay-fine-payments-nationalisation/\">fresh attempt to wriggle out of fines</a>.</p><p>Having sensibly given up on trying to dodge outstanding penalties for <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/01/24/thames-water-pumps-sewage-river-ver-chalk-stream-1000-hours/\">pumping sewage into waterways</a>, Thames’s wannabe owners are now trying to inoculate themselves against future punishment.</p><p>“The current regulatory framework for the water industry does not allow it to successfully turnaround its business,” London and Valley says.</p><p>The consortium won’t take “no” for an answer, it seems.</p><p>Steve Reed, the former environment secretary, told parliament in June that Thames must meet its statutory obligations, after being asked about possible “regulatory easements”.</p><p>But the very idea that an industry that treats Britain’s rivers as its dumping ground should face softer environmental targets – or “stretching but achievable incentives” in the consortium’s words – won’t wash.</p><p>It’s hard to square this with the consortium’s warm words.</p><p>Mike McTighe, the proposed future chairman of Thames – he is also chairman of the company behind The Telegraph – talks about “rebuilding public trust”.</p><p>The creditors themselves admit that Thames has presided over “a cycle of underinvestment and underperformance that has driven trust in Thames Water to an all-time low.”</p><p>Few would argue with that assessment. Yet any agreement that makes it easier for the company to pollute with greater impunity is an improbable basis for the restoration of Thames’s relationship with the public.</p><p>Consider that in an industry that has vandalised the environment, this is a chronic offender.</p><p>Thames’s record is getting worse, not better. Some 50pc more raw sewage was discharged into Britain’s waterways from Thames’s ageing system last year, compared with the previous 12 months.</p><p>In May, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/05/28/thames-water-hit-with-record-123m-fine-for-sewage-failings/\">Thames Water was fined £123m by Ofwat</a> – the biggest ever fine imposed by the regulator.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>From a purely financial perspective, the creditors’ plea for clemency is understandable.</p><p>They expect future fines of more than £1bn if current regulations are applied and argue that something has to give if Thames is to receive the investment it needs.</p><p>This financial hole was of Thames’s own making, however. Its creditors bankrolled it as it hollowed itself out. To turn around now and demand that the rules are changed to make pumping effluent into rivers a less costly business is an affront to justice and risks setting a horrible precedent.</p><p>Perhaps even now, after months and months of negotiations, the hedge funds that swooped in to buy up debt on the cheap when Thames was on the brink, still don’t understand the extent of public and political anger.</p><p>Customer ire stretches to the whole gamut of misdeeds – rising bills, poor service, undeserved dividends and <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/12/18/six-figure-bonuses-for-sewage-dumping-water-bosses/\">excessive executive pay</a>.</p><p>But it is the epidemic of pollution that has attracted the most fury. That the creditors have chosen to attack on that front seems “courageous”, as they say in the Civil Service.</p><p>Indeed, I am willing to bet that the majority of people want to see stiffer fines, not softer ones, particularly if the current set-up has failed to act as a deterrent. Weaker rules would surely lead to more pollution, not less.</p><p>Meanwhile, the knock-on effect of granting Thames an easier ride would be that every other water company in Britain would be entitled to expect the same exemptions on the basis of fairness.</p><p>A reminder from the creditors that their offer is the only credible one left after private equity firm KKR abandoned its bid looks designed to focus minds. Ditto talks of how the plan “will avoid special administration”, and ensure that “Thames Water’s turnaround will not fall to the UK taxpayer”.</p><p>Decency, however, demands that Ofwat and the Government don’t allow themselves to be pushed around by a bunch of opportunistic hedge funds.</p></div></div></div></div>",

The rain barely bothered me.</p><p>This was Wales. What did I expect? Sunstroke? Anyway, the principality looks good, and richly green, in the rain. And there were plenty of pubs in which to dry out. Externally, I mean.</p><p>Along the way, though, I noticed a few things which I’d either forgotten about, hadn’t noticed before or had cropped up since my last visit.</p><p>Among them were, in no particular order:</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">The demise of tourist information centres</h2><p>Turn up in even quite big towns – <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/wales/carmarthenshire/hotels/\">Carmarthen</a>, Swansea – ask for the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/tourist-information-centre-closure-britain-scotland/\">tourist office</a> and people look blank.</p><p>“It’s all online now,” a council fellow told me. “People look it up before they leave home.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Not everyone. Not me. For a start, before you leave home, you don’t necessarily know everywhere you’re going to be visiting. And when you get there, do you really want to scroll through the infinite reams of hysterical promo material which constitute most official tourism websites?</p><p>Wouldn’t you rather talk to a real person who may address your particular interest without your having to wade through disquisitions on zip lining and activities for single mothers with school-age children?</p><p>Or, to put it another way, every town in France has a tourist office, as do many villages, and theirs is the planet’s most visited country. Could it be that this is one thing that the French have got right?</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">We seem to have lost all our family-run restaurants</h2><p>Every French town has an abundance. Where are they in Britain? Don’t get me wrong. We ate well – but in pubs and chain restaurants.</p><p>The establishments where husband cooks and wife serves (or vice versa) cram by the score into city-centre streets in France. Although we looked, we found precisely none in our 11 days in the UK.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">The health-and-safety obsession has gone into overdrive</h2><p>“Welcome. Table for two? Any allergies?” This rang out upon arrival at nearly every restaurant we visited. It may be linked to a sense that Britain spends much of its time protecting everyone against, well, everything.</p><p>As if the average Briton were rather daft. (By a breakfast room toaster: “Warning: may get hot”; at traffic lights: “Stop at red light”.)</p><p>This assumption that Britons lack both gumption and resilience seemed new to me. Then again, given the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/17/record-number-mobility-scooter-deaths-tougher-safety-laws/\">epidemic of mobility scooters</a> on city streets – I saw more in a week in the UK than in a decade in France – the question perhaps requires further research.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Nobody stays out late</h2><p>Spending happy moments in a good restaurant which, last time I looked around, was humming with diners. Now it’s 8.45pm, I look around again, and everyone’s gone. Our noisy little party is all that’s left.</p><p>Waiters and waitresses are smiling but clearly hanging about, waiting for us to leave. This happened often. Was nightlife always this way? Have all those people really gone home? At this hour?</p><p>How do Spanish visitors cope with having to eat dinner before they’ve finished lunch?</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Public transport is actually pretty good</h2><p>“We’re going to travel by train and bus,” I said. “Ha! Good luck with that,” replied a wiseacre British friend. But over 11 days, public transport worked terrifically – frequent, reliable, operated by drivers, especially in Wales, who had clearly taken vows of helpfulness. It got us into small towns and villages which, were they in France, wouldn’t have seen a bus unless that bus were lost.</p><p>It meant we got to appreciate the landscape without having to navigate or negotiate a way through, and faced no parking problems. Plus public transport favours encounters.</p><p>Such as the three well-dressed young women who polished off two bottles of Prosecco on the mid-morning train from Manchester Piccadilly to <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/chester/hotels/\">Chester</a>. Thus did they tee themselves up nicely for a day at the races. “Talkative” didn’t do them justice.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Slovenly speech has become an epidemic</h2><p>I do wish that the language fairy might move among my fellow citizens and restore the letter “T” to its proper place (so “lighting”, not “li’ing”; “little”, not “li’el”; “better”, not “beh’er”), and banish entirely “Know what I mean?”, “No worries”, “Enjoy”, and “Mate”. She might also rid us of split infinitives and misuse of words such as “hopefully” and “decimate”.</p><p>I bumped into all these in spoken or written English during the stay – though, oddly, less so in Wales. It is, perhaps, more difficult to speak badly with a Welsh lilt. Most of all, I’d like the fairy to disabuse us of the notion that speaking properly is a snobbish affectation.</p><p>It isn’t. In France, second-division football players usually express themselves as if they were deputy headmasters. Like everyone else in the country, they wish to be taken for clever, not stupid.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">The pubs are a mixed bag</h2><p>Wetherspoons, 4pm, Tuesday afternoon, Carmarthen – the enormous place is heaving. Heaving. I can barely hear my wife say: “Do we have to stay?” Who are the dozens drinking through the afternoon on a Tuesday?</p><p>Might this explain the mobility scooters? Wetherspoons obviously does a fantastic job, but this is not the image I have when, from a foreign field, I imagine a <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/best-pubs-england/\">British pub</a>.</p><p>Fortunately, the Plume of Feathers (“Wales’s smallest pub” – about the size of our lounge) is nearby, with its memories of Richard Burton and Ray Gravell.</p><p>Swansea’s No Sign bar – venerable outpost of wood, wine, Welsh whiskey and warmth amid the mini-Vegas of Swansea’s Wind Street – also fulfils a proper pub function. It lays on a Wednesday night quiz. We took part. I wish to say no more on the subject.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">There are street signs everywhere, but not the ones you need</h2><p>Amid the frenzy of signs clogging up Britain, the only ones you actually need – telling you where you are in any given town or city – are very often AWOL.</p><p>Please replace them.

I’m looking really closely at that, and I’ll be making other announcements in the not too distant future.”</p><p>He also hinted that the Government would press ahead with its deregulation drive and pledged to “get the balance right” on an employment rights bill that businesses and Left-leaning think tanks have warned will damage growth and the economy.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Speaking after the Lords voted through several amendments related to day one rights and increasing the powers of the unions, Mr Kyle said: “There will be 27 consultations that will be launched by my department. And consultation means I will listen. It means that I will act. I will act in a way that is pro growth, and is certainly fit for the modern age that we live in.”</p><p>He also suggested that the Government would go further and faster in its deregulation drive as the government dashes for growth.</p><p>“There will be more announcements to come into the future when it comes to energy, but … we’re going to carry on with the same kind of zeal and urgency into the future, on planning reform, on regulatory reform, and these targeted bits of support.”</p><p>Businesses tentatively welcomed the energy’s announcement.</p><p>Louise Hellem, at the Confederation of British Industry, said: “Bringing down costs for energy intensive businesses by cutting network charges and bringing costs <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/30/britain-paying-highest-electricity-prices-in-the-world-as-net-zero-costs-rise/\">closer in line with our European competitors</a> fulfils an important commitment in the UK’s modern industrial strategy.”</p><p>However, she added: “There’s still further to go, easing energy cost pressures for all businesses is essential to provide the headroom to invest. As firms urgently await the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme consultation, the upcoming autumn Budget presents a vital opportunity to introduce targeted measures that help more businesses cut energy and electrify their processes.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

South East Water will increase bills to £322, while Southern will charge £638.</p><p>Wessex was handed the biggest increase of 5pc, meaning its bills will rise to £622. All had asked for larger increases.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Appeal to the CMA</h2><p>It comes after the companies appealed to the CMA earlier this year, requesting permission to increase their bills higher than Ofwat, the water regulator, had previously ruled.</p><p>In defence of its decision, the CMA said the extra money would help reduce pollution and strengthen supply, although it also said it would help cover the companies’ rising debt costs.</p><p>Kirstin Baker, who chaired an independent group of experts appointed by the CMA, said: “We’ve found that water companies’ <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/10/22/one-of-worst-performing-water-companies-84pc-bill-increase/\">requests for significant bill increases</a>, on top of those allowed by Ofwat, are largely unjustified.</p><p>“We understand the real pressure on household budgets and have worked to keep increases to a minimum, while still ensuring there is funding to deliver essential improvements at a reasonable cost.”</p><p>Thames Water, Britain’s biggest water company, had also appealed, but its proceedings have been put on hold while it battles to stave off nationalisation.</p><p>Ms Hardy said efforts were being made to restore the public’s trust in water companies.</p><p>She said: “We’ve made sure that investment cash goes into infrastructure upgrades, not bonuses, and we’re creating a tough new regulator to clean up our waterways and restore trust in the system.”</p><p>It comes amid growing anger over the state of the water sector, which has been responsible for a rise in <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/07/18/serious-pollution-water-company-incidents-rises-60-per-cent/\">sewage failures in recent years</a>.</p><p>Mike Keil, the chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), said: “Many customers are still trying to absorb the impact of April’s unprecedented rise in water bills, so any further increases will be very unwelcome.</p><p>“CCW’s own analysis suggests there was an opportunity to reduce these five companies’ financing costs, cutting bills by around £41 a year, but instead the CMA has chosen to increase their rate of return.</p><p>“There is a danger the customers of these companies will end up paying more, without seeing any additional improvements in return.”</p><p>Joanna Elson, the chief executive of Independent Age, a charity, said higher bills would be “extremely damaging to people on low incomes living in these areas”.</p><p>She said: “The people in later life we support tell us the drastic lengths they are taking to reduce their water costs, including only washing a couple of times a week, not flushing the toilet and cutting down on laundry. This shouldn’t be happening in modern Britain.”</p><p>Ms Elson added: “We urge the UK Government to protect customers on low incomes from rising water bills by establishing a national water social tariff. This will end the postcode lottery.</p><p> “It’s not right that your address dictates how much financial support you receive.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

Crisis talks with lenders are scheduled for the weekend.</p><p>The Aberdeen-based company’s 2,000 skilled UK workers provide operational and construction services for many of the UK’s offshore platforms, including Shell, BP, Ithaca Energy and TotalEnergies.</p><p>Petrofac oversees the safe maintenance and operations of many offshore platforms and is the “duty holder” – making it legally responsible for safety – for at least two.</p><p>Officials from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero are understood to be monitoring the situation and are aware of the risks of a collapse.</p><p>Ashley Kelty, an analyst at Panmure Liberum, said: “It is a duty holder on a number of offshore fields, which poses issues for the UK Government. If a problem happens on a Petrofac-managed platform, it would mean the UK taxpayer would have to pick up the tab, as Petrofac couldn’t cover costs.”</p><p>On Friday, Tareq Kawash, Petrofac’s chief executive, was locked in emergency talks with the company’s lenders to try to save it, which employs 8,000 people worldwide.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Insiders said the leadership team was still trying to save the company, but analysts said a breakup was increasingly likely.</p><p>The UK business is vital to the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/17/extra-11bn-barrels-of-oil-found-in-north-sea/\">UK’s North Sea operations</a>, but has been dragged down by financial disasters at operations in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Last week, a potential restructuring deal, worked on for a year, collapsed in disarray after Petrofac’s biggest client cancelled a multibillion-pound contract.</p><p>TenneT, the power grid operator for the Netherlands and much of Germany, terminated its multi-year contract to build offshore platforms and onshore converter stations for six wind farms. The contract was a joint venture with Hitachi and was said to be worth €13bn (£11bn).</p><p>Mr Kelty said: “It looks like Petrofac is on the brink. The Gulf-based engineering division has been a mess for years. It should have been restructured and taken a hit on bad contracts in the past, rather than trying to carry on. Its collapse may help to focus Labour ministers’ minds on helping UK industry.”</p><p>Alex Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said: “It’s going to be very hard to attract new capital now. The equity is worth nothing, and the various forms of debt are going to get written down to a very, very low level. The outcome is some break-up of the group where parts will be sold off.”</p><p>Petrofac designs, constructs and operates equipment for offshore energy firms. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2005.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Impact of separate disasters</h2><p>Three separate disasters have hit the company. They include a clean fuels project at a Thai oil refinery where Petrofac was supposed to increase daily crude throughput from 275,000 barrels to 400,000 barrels from 2018, but which never worked out.</p><p>It was also hit by the Covid pandemic, which caused construction delays, disrupted cash flow and forced Petrofac to halt debt repayments.</p><p>The company has also been entangled in a corruption scandal in the Middle East. The company was fined £77m in 2021 following a Serious Fraud Office (SFO) investigation.</p><p>In May, the UK’s High Court approved plans for Petrofac to raise $355m (£280m) in rescue funding. Counterparties Samsung and Saipem successfully challenged the restructure in the Court of Appeal, forcing Petrofac to extend its debt standstill further.</p><p>Daniel Slater, an energy analyst at Zeus Capital, said: “Clearly, it would be good for Aberdeen, jobs and national capabilities if the UK element of Petrofac, in particular, can be preserved, and this may form part of ongoing restructuring negotiations.”</p><p>A spokesman for Petrofac confirmed that talks were under way and would continue through the weekend in the hope of saving the company as a going concern.</p></div></div></div></div>",

Petrofac is important to the North Sea oil field services market, but the skills are held by the staff. Someone else will either acquire them or employ them to continue the work they have been doing.”</p><p>Michael Shanks, the energy minister, told the Commons there was “reason to be optimistic about a commercial resolution”, adding: “The UK arm of Petrofac is continuing to operate as normal, as an in demand business with a highly skilled workforce and many successful contracts... the Government has been and will remain in close contact with the company.”</p><p>A Petrofac spokesman said: “Our long-established North Sea business continues to operate as normal, and management are working to minimise disruption for clients and employees.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Repercussions throughout sector</h2><p>An estimated 2,000 direct <strong>UK </strong>jobs are at risk, mostly in Scotland, with many more in the company’s supply chains and partners.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>A collapse<strong> </strong>would be hugely damaging for Aberdeen, where most of Petrofac’s operations and staff are based, and is likely to play into the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/06/01/nigel-farage-reform-scotland-hamilton-larkhall-by-election/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">looming Scottish parliament elections</a> where Labour is desperate for victory.</p><p>While Petrofac has been dragged down by financial disasters at operations based in Abu Dhabi,<strong> b</strong>usiness chiefs said the crisis also highlighted the desperate need for the Government to roll back its <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/01/windfall-tax-risks-killing-off-north-sea-oil-within-years/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">punishing windfall tax</a> on the oil and gas sector.</p><p>Russell Borthwick, head of the Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: “While many of Petrofac’s challenges predate the current Government, this is another stark reminder that the Government must urgently act to restore confidence and stability in the energy industry.</p><p>“That means removing the windfall tax – the Energy Profits Levy – and lifting the de facto ban on new North Sea exploration and production licences.”</p><p>Andrew Bowie, the shadow Scottish secretary, blamed Labour for Petrofac filing for administration, arguing that the Government had created a “hostile environment” for oil and gas companies.</p><p>Mr Bowie, who is also a shadow energy minister, said: “Another week, yet another hammer blow to our North Sea oil and gas industry, another gut punch to energy workers, another blow to our energy security and the blame, whatever the minister says today, lies squarely with this Labour Government.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Restructuring deal fell through</h2><p>A potential restructuring deal worked on for a year collapsed in disarray last week after Petrofac’s biggest client cancelled a multibillion-pound contract.</p><p>TenneT, the power grid operator for the Netherlands and much of Germany, terminated its multi-year contract to build offshore platforms and onshore converter stations for six wind farms.</p><p>Tareq Kawash, Petrofac’s chief executive, spent the weekend locked in emergency talks with the company’s lenders.

Not even close.</p><p>Yes, bills won’t be increasing to the extent that suppliers were asking for – but the point is that an independent panel of “experts” has still sanctioned further rises beyond <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/05/embattled-ofwat-boss-resigns-amid-sewage-crisis/\">what Ofwat had approved</a> and most objective observers thought those rises were already pretty steep.</p><p>So the idea that this is somehow a big victory for households and a defeat for water companies is profound nonsense. The opposite is true.</p><p>In fact, it is impossible to see further bill hikes as anything other than a reward for failure for an industry that has long treated customers and the environment <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/07/18/crumbling-water-industry-damaging-britains-economy-mps-warn/\">with complete contempt</a>.</p><p>Not that Emma Hardy, the minister for water and flooding, seems even remotely prepared to acknowledge what is really happening here.</p><p>“We are laser-focused on helping ease the cost-of-living pressure on households. We’ve frozen fuel duty, raised the minimum wage and pensions and brought down <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/mortgages/best-mortgage-rates/\">mortgage rates</a>, putting more money in people’s pockets,” she said – though hopefully not with a straight face.</p><p>This is gaslighting territory. It takes a special kind of shamelessness to boast about making people better off at the precise moment that millions of families are having a fresh round of bill rises imposed on them.</p><p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Thursday it is allowing five water companies – Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Southern Water, South East Water and Wessex Water – to lift bills by up to 5pc over the next five years.</p><p>That might seem fairly tame if it wasn’t for the fact that it comes on top of an average increase of 24pc that industry regulator Ofwat had already approved in April.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>As Mike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), pointed out: “Many customers are still trying to absorb the impact of April’s unprecedented rise in water bills, so any further increases will be very unwelcome.”</p><p>In fact, two in five of the households these companies serve say they will struggle to afford the increases coming down their pipe, according to the CCW, which represents water customers across England and Wales.</p><p>What’s more, the CCW has conducted its own analysis showing there was an opportunity to reduce these five companies’ financing costs to cut bills by around £41 a year – “but instead the CMA has chosen to increase their rate of return,” Keil said.</p><p>However, you would’ve thought otherwise when reading Hardy’s hollow words on Thursday.</p><p>“I understand the public anger over bill rises – that’s why I expect every water company to offer proper support to anyone struggling to pay,” she said.</p><p>But as Keil said: “Three of these five companies also have no plans to end water poverty by 2030.”</p><p>The CMA doesn’t come out of this much better. It makes a big song and dance about how the additional funding will ensure “essential improvements”, such as more resilient supply and a reduction in pollution, are delivered “at reasonable cost”.</p><p>Most people will accept some level of inflation in their household expenses but I’m willing to bet that few regard a 27pc surge as reasonable – even if it is over five years.</p><p>Some customers are already grappling with rises close to, or more than, 50pc once inflation is added because suppliers have been outrageously front-loading increases to help pay for long-overdue infrastructure improvements.</p><p>The reality is that bill-payers are being asked to subsidise an era of playing catch-up because water suppliers failed in the past to keep pace with investment, maintenance and environmental duties.</p><p>The money was there but instead of being spent modernising the system, repairing antiquated pipes and ensuring sewage wasn’t pouring into our waterways, it was being lavished on greedy investors and weak-kneed bosses or vanishing straight out the door in the form of heavy debt repayments.</p><p>Research from the University of Greenwich has found that 35p in every pound spent on customer bills is swallowed up in debt and dividend costs.</p><p>With the system buckling, it is surely no coincidence that these are the highest bill increases since privatisation.</p><p>It is also no surprise that the suppliers that went crying to the CMA are also among the most debt-laden in a sector that has long been leveraged up to the gills.</p><p>Meanwhile, the competition policeman quietly concedes that alongside a much-trumpeted round of additional investment, bill increases will also help pay down debt and boost returns for investors – many of whom are the same faceless funds that presided over the current wretched state of affairs in the first place.</p><p>For all the talk of long overdue reform and a new era of genuine accountability from Labour, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that our broken water industry has effectively been handed a huge taxpayer-funded bailout.</p></div></div></div></div>",

Its padlocked gates are overgrown with weeds, and the only sign of ongoing work is a board with the words “supported by the Mayor of London” written on it.</p><p>The large construction project was supposed to provide 40 affordable homes once finished, but it remains covered in white tarpaulin from top to bottom. According to Molior Consultancy, the site has not progressed since 2022.</p><p>Not far from Wembley Stadium, another development, Afrex House, is in a similar state.

It’s as low as five schemes a year coming through.</p><p>“It’s a trickle. And the number of sales that we’re doing has just collapsed. Our competitors are in the same boat. No one is having any better luck, really.”</p><p>Mr Khan overhauled London’s planning regulations in 2016, requiring developers to ensure that 35pc of housing in new projects was affordable. However, Housing Secretary Steve Reed this week told MPs the target would be cut to 25pc to incentivise developers to meet the Government’s 1.5 million new homes target.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘They were always impossible targets’</h2><p>The Government is also reportedly considering loosening design standards, such as the requirement for bicycle storage space and the provision of “dual aspect dwellings”, meaning homes with windows opening on at least two external walls.</p><p>Robert Colvile, of The Centre for Policy Studies think tank, said: “His plans were stuffed with loads of things that developers could just about cope with in an environment where housebuilding was absolutely booming and they were making huge amounts of money.</p><p>“But that’s not the world we’re living in any more,” he added.</p><p>“There’s a really simple lesson: the only way you can get builders to build is if they can make money by building. A lot of people on the Left are hugely uncomfortable with that.</p><p>“They and many others have been taken aback by the sheer scale of the housing shortfall in London.”</p><p>The Centre for Policy Studies blamed the slowdown on Mr Khan’s “misguided” London Plan, the Mayor’s new blueprint for development, as well as excessive affordable housing requirements and the new building safety regulator introduced after the Grenfell Tower disaster.</p><p>Discussing whether Labour’s mooted reversals would be enough to restore the sector, Colvile said: “I don’t think it’s enough.</p><p>“Each of these was the straw that broke the camel’s back. The camel’s back is now broken, so taking off the straws isn’t going to do all that much.”</p><p>Tim Craine, director of Molior Consultancy, said: “The key thing with development is that it’s risky.

Awards range from £1,500 to as much as £25,000, depending on the scale of renovation, according to FOI responses.</p><p>However, across the 30 authorities contacted, only a few dozen homes in most of them have benefited from the Empty Homes Grant, even in areas with thousands of vacant properties.</p><p>In Labour-run Cheshire West and Chester, where there are an estimated 2,300 empty homes, just six grants worth an average of £1,730 each have been awarded since 2020. The council told The Telegraph it noted a “decline in interest and uptake”, but had taken steps to bolster its popularity.</p><p>A council spokesman said it was “not possible to completely eliminate all empty homes” as properties naturally become vacant for long periods “due to normal life events like death, moving into a care facility or a relationship breakdown”.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Meanwhile, in Rhondda Cynon Taf in Wales, which last year <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/second-homes/welsh-council-forced-embarrassing-climbdown-second-homes/\">opted to charge second home owners double council tax</a> and is also run by Labour, just 54 of 186 applications were approved. The council told The Telegraph that some 445 homes had been brought back into use through separate schemes, and another 95 would follow after further approvals. </p><p>Some local authorities have earmarked the money raised by the second home council tax premiums to fund empty homes grants.</p><p>SNP-controlled Dumfries and Galloway confirmed last year that £50,000 of the £1m raised from the tax raid would be spent on hiring an empty homes officer. The council said it spent £200,000 across 10 grants last year, and the budget would be raised to £300,000 for 2026.</p><p>A spokesman said: “Independent data shows a direct correlation between dedicated staff resource and the number of homes returned to occupancy.</p><p>“The scheme continues to attract interest from property owners, and we will work with all those eligible to assist with the application process.”</p><p>Mr Cleverly said: “Labour is not only failing to deliver the new homes they promised, but also standing by as too many existing homes go unused.</p><p>“In fact, Labour is abolishing the New Homes Bonus, which rewards councils with extra funding for getting long-term empty homes back into use.”</p><p>In December, the Ministry of Housing announced that the New Homes Bonus, which pays councils for <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/26/building-homes-not-financially-viable-across-half-of-englan/\">increasing the number of homes in their area</a>, would be phased out by April 2026.</p><p>Mr Cleverly added: “With the council tax surcharge, councils will actually be incentivised to keep homes empty.”</p><p>In some areas, such as in Wirral, which has no overall majority party, the scheme seems to have been a success; however, it was closed to new applicants in April “due to efficiency savings across the council,” a spokesman said.</p><p>The council approved all 250 applications it received in the last five years, and spent £1.1m refurbishing dilapidated homes, yet official estimates suggest more than 1,700 long-term empty homes remain on its books.</p><p>A spokesman said: “We will continue to look at opportunities for bringing empty properties back into use and are keen to explore how this ambition could support the council’s homelessness strategy.”</p><p>Labour-run Brent Council, which offers up to 70pc of refurbishment costs for empty homes, has spent £3m on grants since 2020, the highest of any local authority surveyed – and approved 83 of 111 applications.</p><p>Councillor Fleur Donnelly-Jackson said grants were one of several reasons Brent has delivered the second-highest number of homes across all London boroughs in the last decade.</p><p>She added: “The council proactively contacts property owners, providing clear guidance and hands-on support to help bring empty homes back into use.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>However, the low success rate for applications in other local authorities raises questions about the grant’s accessibility. Tory-controlled Rochford has offered empty homes grants since 2022 and has so far approved none, FOI figures show. The council said the local authority “currently has 114 homes that have been empty for more than one year”, and that it “remains proactive in offering advice and assistance to help bring these properties back into use.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘I ended up funding the renovation with a loan’</h2><p>Abigail Jay, a first-time buyer, believed she was an ideal fit for the scheme when she bought a dilapidated cottage in Pembrokeshire, Wales, last June. The graduate structural engineer planned to live there for at least 10 years.</p><p>The local council offered a grant of up to £25,000 to restore the property. But Ms Jay said that, despite submitting all the relevant quotes to her council, “a complete lack of communication” meant she funded the renovation herself.</p><p>The 24-year-old, who has extensively documented her <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@abigail_jay_\">experience on TikTok</a>, told The Telegraph: “As the months went by with little response, it became clear the application would not be progressing and the funding wasn’t going to arrive anytime soon.</p><p>“I’d been in what I thought would be a temporary living situation for over a year, waiting for the grant, so I started lining up contractors to get the work moving. At that stage, I estimated the renovation would cost around £50,000.</p><p>“Now, with just three weeks to go, that figure is closer to £60,000 – £50,000 of which is covered by a loan. I’m not hopeful about the grant at this stage, as I will no longer be eligible for any payout, having already completed the renovation works.”</p><p>Rhondda Cynon Taff Council, which oversees the scheme, said they could “obviously understand the applicant’s frustrations”, but added that “the issue in this case stems from the local authority”.</p><p>A spokesman said: “We are wholly reliant on each local authority to engage with us and applicants (specifically where there are technical queries) and prepare their documentation for submission.”</p><p>Pembrokeshire County Council, which ultimately rejected Ms Jay’s application, acknowledged there had been “communication delays and administrative bottlenecks” in her case but added that Ms Jay was denied funding because a condition report recommended the building be demolished.</p><p>A spokesman added: “There are a number of steps that the applicants have to go through and the scheme is essentially administered by two local authorities, which can at times prolong the application process.”</p><p>Figures from the 30 councils that responded to The Telegraph’s FOI requests showed 1,532 <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/buying-selling/developers-padlock-new-builds-london-housebuilding-collapse/\">empty homes</a> grant applications have been made since 2020. Of these, 932 were approved – a success rate of 61pc.</p><p>Samantha Watkin, of the National Residential Landlords Association, said: “Local authorities are confronted with the challenge of continuously rising waiting lists for social housing, while there are vacant properties that could easily be utilised to accommodate those in need.</p><p>“It is imperative for local authorities to effectively employ their staff and funding to proactively restore these homes to use.</p><p>“Additionally, certain councils do not prioritise enforcement or the utilisation of available grants, thereby increasing the burden on landlords and owners of second homes.”</p><p>Tom Hunt, of the Local Government Association, which represents councils, said: “Tackling long-term empty homes in our communities is a major issue that councils are working to address.</p><p>“They represent a missed opportunity to provide housing for those in need.</p><p>“Councils share a collective ambition to tackle local housing challenges and bring properties back into use.</p><p>“Providing grants to owners of long-term empty homes is just one way in which councils can proactively address empty homes. However, local government must be sufficiently empowered and funded to carry out work on this area.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

Liverpool-based tinned tuna giant Princes Group is also preparing to list in a £1.2bn deal.</p><p>Marcelino Castrillo, Shawbrook’s chief executive, said he was “proud to be listing in London, our home market”.</p><p>It marks a return to the public markets for Shawbrook, which delisted in 2017 following a takeover by private equity firms BC Partners and Pollen Street Capital.</p><p>Its owners had tried to float Shawbrook earlier this year, but the plans were delayed after Donald Trump’s tariffs unleashed a wave of stock market volatility.</p><p>Mr Castrillo said: “We have built scale across diverse, attractive markets and, following significant investment under private ownership, are well placed to keep growing as we support UK businesses and households.</p><p>“As a listed company, we will continue to invest in our platform and people, deepen our presence in chosen markets and expand selectively where we see attractive demand.”</p><p>Shawbrook said it aims to raise £50m through the sale of new shares.</p><p>The lender’s loan book stood at £18.3bn at the end of September, up from £17bn on June 30. It wants to almost double this to about £30bn by the end of 2030.</p></div></div></div></div>",

We need to think about that speed and what truly is a concierge service.”</p><p>Speaking on the same panel, Lord Harrington – who led a review on investment under the last Tory government – said a lack of joined-up thinking was also stymieing growth.</p><p>He said: “There’s a room full of civil servants in the Department of Health whose job it is to basically kick the c--- out of pharmaceutical companies to get the price that the government pays for drugs as low as possible. They are not allowed to consider holistically the effect of those decisions on investment in a country, whereas a company clearly does.”</p><p>The decision by AstraZeneca, the UK’s largest listed company, means all of its £650m investment package announced in 2024 risks being shelved.</p><p>The Department of Health launched a review of so-called NHS rebates earlier this year under pressure from Donald Trump, the US president, who has demanded that pharmaceutical companies lower their <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/14/eli-lilly-bows-to-donald-trump-demands-weight-loss-jab/\">drug prices in the US</a> – where they are much higher than the UK and Europe.</p><p>A voluntary agreement currently places a cap on how much the NHS spends on branded medicines as part of efforts to keep costs down.</p><p>The total bill is allowed to rise by a certain percentage each year. If the NHS spends more than expected on branded medicines, it is able to claw some of that money back in rebates on drugs.</p><p>The Government raised the rate unexpectedly to almost 23pc for 2025 for newer medicines at the end of last year.</p><p>Pharmaceutical bosses have warned the scheme is preventing the launch of cutting-edge medicines in the UK. They have pressed the UK to cut the rate of rebates into single digits, a level seen elsewhere in Europe.</p><p>HS2 will almost double long-distance rail capacity between London and the West Midlands, the Government has said, and that this should in turn free up space on existing lines for more passenger and freight services.<br/><br/>It added that work is ongoing on possible changes to service pattern, infrastructure and rolling stock to eke out additional capacity, especially north of Birmingham, though there is no question of reversing the decision to cancel phase 2 of HS2</p><p>A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: “No decisions have been made on HS2’s future timetable, so any suggestion of reduced capacity is pure speculation.”</p><p>A Government spokesman said:<strong> </strong>“Through the Life Sciences Sector Plan, we are making the UK the destination of choice for business, investing up to £600 million in the Health Data Research Service with the Wellcome Trust, committing up to £520m to the Life Sciences Innovative Manufacturing Fund and welcoming billions of UK investment from companies like Moderna and BioNTech.</p><p>“We will always put patients and taxpayers first, encouraging investment and innovation whilst ensuring best value for money. </p><p>“Having made an unprecedented £1bn through the Voluntary Scheme on branded medicines to industry, we will continue to engage.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

There is no guarantee that the total £1.1bn will be allocated, meaning all of that cost may not fall on homeowners and businesses.</p><p>However, the maximum potential subsidy cost will heighten scrutiny of Mr Miliband’s net zero agenda, which critics have warned is piling a plethora of costs on to consumers through levies and network charges.</p><p>Labour’s broader energy policy is also under fire, particularly after the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/27/north-sea-giant-petrofac-files-for-administration/\">collapse of North Sea oil operator Petrofac</a> on Monday. Russell Borthwick, chief executive of Aberdeen &amp; Grampian Chamber of Commerce, warned more collapses were likely unless the Government scrapped its windfall tax on oil and gas profits.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The Energy Secretary has been under pressure not to overpay for green energy and to demonstrate progress on his pledge to lower household energy bills by £300.</p><p>However, on Monday, wind farm developers called on Mr Miliband to commit even bigger sums to subsidies as they warned the latest pot wasn’t big enough to meet Labour’s ambitious clean power targets.</p><p>The Government has vowed to switch the electricity system to mostly clean power sources by 2030, a goal that would require a tripling of today’s offshore wind capacity.</p><p>This year’s auction round is viewed as particularly important because it is one of Mr Miliband’s last chances to secure enough generation in time for his target. Experts said he still needed to add around 12 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity.</p><p>Monday’s figures implied he would be able to add just five gigawatts, according to industry body RenewableUK.</p><p>Ana Musat, the group’s head of policy, said: “The budget announced will not maximise investment in new offshore wind farms.</p><p>“We have a record amount of offshore wind capacity eligible for this auction – more than 20 gigawatts – and the current budget would only procure about a quarter of that.”</p><p>Aurora Energy Research said the AR7 budget appeared to be around a fifth smaller than last year’s auction and that it was likely to “fall short” of Mr Miliband’s clean power targets.</p><p>Energy suppliers cautiously welcomed the announcement, however, with one person at a major company saying the Government was “putting its foot down” on spiralling costs.</p><p>Another industry insider said: “It suggests they are trying to impose some cost control and are not willing to just pay any price.”</p><p>Up to this point, there had been warnings that the Government risked overpaying in its race to secure enough capacity to reach the clean power targets.</p><p>Last week, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, the former prime minister’s think tank, urged ministers to impose “<a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/29/tony-blair-starmer-net-zero-plans/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">strict value-for-money safeguards</a>” on the auction to ensure spending did not “sacrifice affordability for speed”.</p><p>However, a Whitehall source rejected suggestions that the Government would overpay, saying: “We will buy at the price we want to buy.”</p><p>Energy companies have warned that subsidies, along with green levies and network charges, threaten to push up costs in the coming years – derailing Labour’s election promise to reduce gas and electricity bills by £300.</p><p>Subsidies are awarded under mechanisms known as contracts for difference (CfDs), which are designed to give companies certainty about their revenues to encourage investment.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The contracts top up what generators are paid when the market price falls below their agreed level, with generators repaying the difference when the market price moves higher.</p><p>The amount paid out by CfDs depends on wholesale electricity prices, which are difficult to predict.</p><p>This year’s auction is offering 20-year contracts, up from 15 years previously, in an attempt to attract more investment as Mr Miliband races to hit Labour’s clean power targets.</p><p>At the same time, Mr Miliband recently reformed the process so that he can revisit the budget after the auction to buy more capacity if required.</p><p>Pranav Menon, of Aurora Energy Research, said: “While new powers mean that the Secretary of State can still amend the budget after seeing bids, the preliminary budget indicates that policymakers are focusing on minimising the impact on consumer bills over meeting targets.”</p><p>Michael Shanks, the energy minister, said: “This auction is another step towards delivering the clean power this country needs to end our reliance on volatile global gas prices, ensuring our energy security and bringing down bills for good.</p><p>“Our competitive new auction process will allow us to buy the right amount of clean power at the right price on behalf of the British people, so we can take back control of our energy.”</p><p>Claire Coutinho, the shadow energy secretary, said: “This is one of the highest budgets on record when prices are at their highest in a decade.</p><p>“It makes no sense to load the country’s energy bills up with 20-year contracts at these prices.”</p><p>The new budget<strong> </strong>include<strong>s</strong> £900m a year for fixed-bottom offshore turbines and another £180m for floating alternatives.</p></div></div></div></div>",

Comprising a 15th century hall house, combined in 1548 with a much larger Wealden hall house and a Georgian façade, which was added to the north side of the structure in the 1740s, it couldn’t be further from the villas that constitute the Ibiza-based designer’s typical projects.</p><p>Ali was asked to reimagine the house, which hadn’t been updated since the Eighties, by a professional couple with two children. The house had previously belonged to the wife’s parents, and the couple were keen to retain various well-loved pieces of family furniture. Likewise, they didn’t want the house to look new, or “done”; but otherwise, they left the brief open.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Early on, Ali decided to work with the existing layout, to avoid the costly and time-consuming process of making structural <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/how-renovate-listed-home-avoid-red-flags/\">alterations to a listed building</a>. As the family was living there during the work, the renovation was implemented in three parts, so that at each stage, part of the house could be made habitable.</p><p>As for the look: “The decoration had to be sympathetic to the house and its setting and practical for modern family life. But I also wanted it to be great fun,” she says.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Main guest room</h2><p>The original Tudor murals in the guest bedroom were sensitively restored by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://specialistdecorationlondon.co.uk\">Henry Van Der Vijver</a>, and Ali was mindful not to compete with their delicate beauty.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Instead, she has added textural interest with leather pendant Cone lights from <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.dykeanddean.com/\">Dyke &amp; Dean</a>, an African Juju hat and a bespoke bedspread made from Hacienda fabric by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://elitis.fr\">Elitis</a>. The curtains are made from Ozone from Christopher Farr Cloth, which features a rectangular motif that echoes the design of the murals.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">The kitchen</h2><p>The ground floor has an enfilade of rooms, with the kitchen leading onto the dining room, then the drawing room, and finally the sitting room.</p><p>In the absence of a central entrance hall, the grand Georgian front door opens into the drawing room, and for that reason it is never used. Instead, the family enters through the kitchen. As it’s the first room guests see, and an important space for socialising, Ali has given it impact. Timeless, shaker-style units from <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://tomhowley.co.uk\">Tom Howley</a> and a classic <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://lacanche.co.uk\">Lacanche</a> range cooker make an appropriate partner for the exposed beams, but are given a twist with an unconventional sage-green and dusty-pink colour scheme, and playful animal-print blinds in “Chatto” by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://gpjbaker.com\">GP&amp;J Baker</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>“I wanted each room to have its own personality, but for them to make sense as a collection, so there is a subliminal colour progression,” says Ali. “Each space picks up some colours from its predecessor, but also introduces new shades. By the time you have walked from beginning to end, the colours are completely different, but it has happened gradually.”</p><p>To soften the angles of the kitchen, Ali added built-in curved banquette seating, upholstered in leather (“so that it’s easier to slide in and out”) and a round table from <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://sohohome.com\">Soho Home</a>.</p><p>However, it was the alarming slope of the original flagstone floor that presented the greatest challenge: Ali installed a suspended oak floor, which protects the flagstones beneath.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">The dining room</h2><p>The pink curtains in the dining room, made from Palla fabric by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://pierrefrey.com\">Pierre Frey</a>, contrast with the dark wood and traditional look of the dining table and chairs, which the owners were keen to reuse.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>“Hanging the curtains was a headache because the floor in this room is also uneven. If every curtain was to sit flush to the ground, the poles had to be slanted, which was horribly distracting,” says Ali. The solution was to spray the curtain poles the same shade as the walls, so that they don’t draw the eye – an idea that came from the curtain-maker, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sallyanne_our_favourite_things/\">Sallyanne Jones</a>, who did all the curtains and upholstery in the house.</p><p>A bespoke rug by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://bowloom.co.uk\">Bowloom</a> disguises the quirks of the floor and improves the acoustics, while bold modern lights from Soho Home counter the formality of the furniture. A pair of copper disco balls adds a sense of fun and sparkle. “I try to include a disco ball somewhere in all of my projects,” says Ali.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">The drawing room</h2><p>“I wanted this to be a glamorous, richly decorated room, which would draw guests in,” says Ali. An inherited grand piano sets the scene, and a brass and glass Talia chandelier from <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://andrewmartin.co.uk\">Andrew Martin</a> gives the room a dramatic focal point.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The mirror and brass Garçon coffee table from <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://julianchichester.com/\">Julian Chichester</a> is a pleasing contrast to the moody diptych oil paintings by Jim Threapleton, sourced from <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://west-contemporary-editions.com\">West Contemporary Editions</a>.</p><p>The lozenge-shaped stools, made to Ali’s own design, are a clever way to add flexible, extra seating.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">The sitting room</h2><p>The family use this room as a place to relax and watch films (the mirror conceals a TV). It is filled with light from the large Georgian windows and has a fresh, contemporary scheme that balances the opulence of the drawing room.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Neutral walls and a pair of cream sofas are an excellent backdrop for the zingy colours and bold design of the curtains, made from Arbre De Vie by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://nobilis.fr\">Nobilis</a>, and a Raya rug from Soho Home. The hand-crocheted pendant light by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://naomipaul.co.uk\">Naomi Paul</a> is the perfect finishing touch.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Main bedroom and bathroom</h2><p>A statement headboard in Azteque by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://christopherfarrcloth.com\">Christopher Farr Cloth</a> gives the main bedroom a strong focal point that counters the heaviness of the exposed beams. Conventional wisdom says a low ceiling, particularly this example, which comes together in a slight “V” above the bed, is a poor partner for a headboard of these proportions, but Ali disagrees. “Rather than try to disguise this feature of the room, I decided to highlight it.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>In the bathroom are curtains and wallpaper in “Carnival” by Christopher Farr Cloth, and a freestanding cast-iron bath from <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://hurlinghambaths.co.uk\">Hurlingham Bath Company</a>.</p><p>The owners didn’t want harsh spotlights, so the room is lit by a delicate, bone china Oxford Double pendant light from <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://originalbtc.co.uk\">Original BTC</a> and a pair of vintage mother-of-pearl wall lights, either side of the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://gubi.com\">Gubi</a> mirrors.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Staircase hall</h2><p>Initially, Ali wanted to paint the panelling and handrail of the main staircase to make it less sombre, but as it is an original feature of the house, she decided to work with it instead, and lightened the mood with a leopard-print carpet from <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://houseofhackney.com\">House of Hackney</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>“It was the legendary French designer Madeleine Castaing who originally popularised the idea of leopard print as a neutral, and I have long adhered to her philosophy,” she says. “You don’t notice it at first, but when you do: wow!” Where a commanding, traditional painting once hung there is now an ethereal, paper sculpture by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://chloenatalia.art\">Chloë Natalia</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p><em>Nicola Snuggs of </em><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://penmaninteriors.co.uk\"><em>Penman Interiors</em></a><em> helped with the project</em></p></div></div></div></div>",

But it lands at an acutely fragile moment for the sector, one shaped by policy uncertainty, collapsing confidence and a tax regime that is driving investment overseas.</p><p>Just days ago, the Labour-led Scottish affairs committee published an informed and sober assessment of the North Sea’s future. It deserves real credit. This was a committee that took the time to listen to the workers, businesses and regions at the frontline of the energy transition.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Its conclusions echo what those of us in the North East have been saying for years: job creation in renewables is not keeping pace with the decline we are seeing in oil and gas – and that decline is being driven by policy, not geology.</p><p>The committee recognised there are compelling arguments for keeping domestic production levels high, warning that without urgent reform of the Energy Profits Levy – known as the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/01/windfall-tax-risks-killing-off-north-sea-oil-within-years/\">windfall tax</a> – and greater clarity on licensing, the North Sea will continue to contract.</p><p>As a consequence of the windfall tax and the current freeze on new exploration approvals, the industry is shrinking by around 11pc each year. At that rate, it doesn’t take long for there to be very little industry left.</p><p>The jeopardy is real, and the Chancellor must heed this call when she delivers her Budget next month. Removing or replacing the windfall tax is the only credible way to slow the decline, stabilise investment and keep the skills and supply chains that Britain needs.</p><p>In what is often a polarised debate, there is one fact that cannot be disputed, and that is that we still need oil and gas.</p><p>The independent Climate Change Committee says the UK will require between 13 billion and 15 billion barrels of it on our journey to net zero by 2050.</p><p>So, we face a simple choice. Do we produce that energy ourselves, protecting jobs, safeguarding our engineering base and generating billions in tax revenues for public services?</p><p>Or do we import more from the likes of the United States and Qatar – liquefied natural gas (LNG) that carries four times the emissions and delivers little benefit to the UK economy?</p><p>It should be a no-brainer.</p><p>Producing our own energy over imported LNG is better for the environment, better for the Exchequer and better for workers in places like Aberdeen, Teesside and Humberside.</p><p>Yet we find ourselves in the absurd position of taxing North Sea production at 78pc while holding it to the highest environmental standards, even as we import record volumes from abroad that pay no tax and emit more. That helps nobody.</p><p>Ultimately, we are in a bind because the UK is simply not creating renewable jobs fast enough. Some of these projects won’t deliver until the late 2030s. </p><p>In the meantime, we must do all we can to protect our existing workforce.</p><p>The Aberdeen &amp; Grampian Chamber of Commerce has long argued that we must manage our remaining North Sea reserves in a way that protects jobs, skills and energy security – not let them collapse faster than the industries meant to replace them. </p><p>One is a transition; the other is a cliff edge.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>And the political consequences of getting this wrong are starting to become clear. At the weekend, a new Survation poll put Reform UK ahead of Labour in Scotland, overtaking it as the main opposition to the SNP. Energy policy is one of the reasons.</p><p>There are people in the North East who feel their livelihoods are being sacrificed needlessly, and that must change before next year’s Scottish election.</p><p>Labour cannot credibly rebuild trust in Scotland while presiding over the managed decline of the very sector that sustains so many Scottish communities.</p><p>That is why the removal of the Energy Profits Levy is not a plea for special treatment. It is a pragmatic step towards creating the stability needed to deliver the energy transition at home, rather than outsourcing it overseas.</p><p>Labour’s Scottish affairs committee has shown it understands this. Now, the Government must act on its own backbenchers’ findings. <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/budget/what-will-be-budget-2025-labour-tax/\">The Budget next month</a> offers the chance to restore confidence, back Britain’s energy workers and set a credible path to net zero.</p><p>If ministers fail to grasp that opportunity, today’s news about Petrofac will not be the last of its kind. And when the next collapse comes, we will have nobody to blame but ourselves.</p><hr/><p><em>Russell Borthwick is chief executive of the Aberdeen &amp; Grampian Chamber of Commerce</em></p></div></div></div></div>",

Mr Koster, 54, is currently Virgin’s chief customer and operating officer and has <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/09/18/heathrow-dogfight-airlines-plans-double-airport-charges/\">worked at the company</a> in two stints spanning nine years.</p><p>He will take charge during a <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/12/11/how-a-break-up-could-catapult-heathrow-back-to-the-top/\">crucial period of negotiations with Heathrow</a>, Virgin’s London base. Ministers are likely to have chosen a design for a new runway by the time Mr Koster becomes chief executive. That will put fresh pressure on airlines including Virgin, which fear the plan will mean a jump in landing charges to pay for the work.</p><p>Heathrow’s preferred expansion plan, which includes <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/comment/heathrows-expansion-means-turbulent-times-britains-busiest-transport/\">moving the M25 motorway</a>, comes with a £49bn price tag, including new terminals.</p><p>When the plan was detailed in August, Virgin said it supported growth but <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/11/13/heathrow-greed-attack-rivals-british-airways-virgin-atlantic/\">criticised the current charging mechanism for Heathrow</a>, administered by the Civil Aviation Authority. It said the runway would be “ultimately paid for by consumers and airlines through higher charges.”</p><p>Virgin has argued that other major airports have delivered capacity improvements at a far lower cost, with Mr Weiss arguing that Heathrow should be broken up into competing terminals in order to bring down prices.</p><p>The CAA said in July it would review the suitability of the current charging model for funding Heathrow’s expansion and consider alternatives.</p><p>Mr Koster will also have to decide whether to re-establish a base for Virgin at Gatwick, which last month secured Labour backing to go ahead with plans to turn an emergency landing strip into a fully fledged runway, greatly increasing its capacity.</p><p>Virgin <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/virgin-atlantic-summer-flights-2021/\">pulled out of Gatwick during Covid</a> and never returned. Mr Weiss has been sceptical about the business case for doing so, though Sir Richard has made more positive noises.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Mr Weiss’s exit will coincide with the end of Virgin’s five-year strategy cycle. The airline said that he and Mr Koster had been working for months on a new plan, which will “not be a massive move away from what we have been doing”.</p><p>Part of that agenda was revealed in July when Virgin announced initiatives including the rollout of free Wi-Fi provided by Elon Musk’s Starlink, a completely new app and an AI-powered virtual concierge service that the airline says will outdo Amazon’s Alexa.</p><p>Mr Koster’s stints at Virgin have been separated by a period at minority shareholder Delta Air Lines, which jointly approved his appointment with Sir Richard.</p><p>The new chief’s contacts at Delta and reputation as a safe pair of hands at carriers that have also included KLM are understood to have been a factor in his selection.</p><p>Virgin insiders said he also grasped the importance of the quirkier aspects of the airline’s culture. It seeks to project itself as a rebel in contrast to the more buttoned up British Airways.</p><p>One close colleague said: “Corneel is a real mix of hardcore commercial and really strong operational experience. But he’s also got a lot of heart about him and gets that Virgin take on things, the slightly different style we have, and the warmth and all that stuff. He’s a great ambassador for that.”</p><p>The Dutchman demonstrated his willingness while standing in for Mr Weiss during a trip to Austin in 2022, leading cabin crew and local dignitaries in a country dance routine.</p><p>The colleague said: “He dressed up as a cowboy to lead the line-dancing. You knew then that he fully understood the DNA of the company. He’s got a great sense of humour and can be quite cheeky.”</p><p>Mr Weiss, 57, revealed he had been <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/06/05/shai-weiss-virgin-atlantic-chief-pulling-airline-back-brink/\">diagnosed with stage three colon cancer</a> in 2022. Virgin said that he initially planned to spend time with his family and travel, having been given the all-clear.</p><p>A spokesman said: “He’s not going to a new role. He’s going to genuinely take some very well deserved time off and do a bit of travelling. He wants to go to Japan, which he loves.”</p><p>Mr Weiss, a British citizen who was born and raised in Israel, joined Virgin Atlantic as chief financial officer in 2014 before serving as commercial chief and becoming chief executive in 2019. He helped the airline survive a brush with bankruptcy during Covid and earlier this year the business posted its first profit since 2016.</p></div></div></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"grid-col grid-col-12 tpl-article__layout tpl-article__layout--content\"><div class=\"\" data-js=\"article-body\" data-test=\"tpl-article-body-recipe\"><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Britain is not building homes quickly enough. <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/01/housebuilding-in-england-falls-to-near-decade-low-labour/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Housebuilding has fallen to the lowest level in almost a decade</a>, and the number of housing starts dropped by 26pc between July and September compared to the previous three-month period, according to industry analyst Glenigan.</p><p>The picture is especially dire in the capital. “It’s disastrous. The number of new starts in London has fallen by over 70pc in the past year. Only 4,170 homes were started during the last financial year,” says Ben Hopkinson, of the Centre for Policy Studies think tank. “A huge reason for that is the Building Safety Regulator.”</p><p>The BSR was established in 2022, in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster to raise safety standards across all buildings, setting out rules for their construction and design. The strictest rules apply to residential blocks over 18m or with seven or more storeys. These buildings must go through a new three-stage approval process overseen by the regulator before, during and after construction.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>While well-meaning, the BSR is holding back construction of essential new homes, as well as hampering development of existing ones.</p><p>Renovations and home improvements in such buildings can fall under the scope of the BSR. While simple repairs are exempt, more significant renovations in homes located in blocks over seven storeys or 18m, such as moving a fire door, altering plumbing or knocking down a wall, require the BSR’s approval before contractors can start work.</p><p>Between October 2023 and March 2025, over two thirds of pre-construction applications were rejected by the BSR. Of the 193 new-build high-risk building applications lodged since the foundation of the BSR, just 15 have successfully cleared the approval process.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The regulator has also become notorious within the industry for lengthy delays; the average approval waiting time on new-build projects has grown to 36 weeks, three times longer than the BSR’s original target.</p><p>“Literally tens of thousands of homes, as well as major commercial developments, are stuck in the quango, which is causing a chilling effect across the industry,” says Sam Bensted, of the British Property Federation (BPF). “Developers [are battling] wider viability issues and don’t want to risk being stuck in the system for up to year, instead of the supposed 12-week maximum.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘The BSR poses an existential threat’</h2><p>Constant delays and long approval times have had dire ramifications for the construction industry and property developers, which are struggling to plan projects and deliver them on time.</p><p>Dominic Curran, also of the BPF, says: “It’s among the top factors, if not the most significant, behind the lack of new homes. It’s being described by one of our members – a major developer – as existential to the survival of their business.”</p><p>The BSR’s rules not only affect new construction; renovations to homes in buildings that fall under the regulator’s criteria can also require approval.</p><p>Sarah, 55* – who does not want to use her real name as she is still dealing with the regulator – bought a flat with her partner last year in central London. Despite being an older building with no cladding, its height means that making renovations to the property inside must be approved by the BSR.</p><p>While Sarah is not knocking down any walls, the scale of the renovation of her kitchen and bathroom, which includes moving a fire door, means she requires approval from the regulator.</p><p>For Sarah and her family, what was meant to be a straightforward job has escalated into a Kafkaesque nightmare. Work was meant to start months ago, but a series of lengthy delays by the BSR has meant that it is still not under way.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>“The deadline comes and goes with no communication at all. The initial deadline was in May; they asked for an extension for four weeks. Then in June they asked for an extension for six more weeks.</p><p>“They say that if they don’t agree to the extension, your project is dropped and you’re denied permission. Then there’s no comeback unless you go to the Secretary of State.”</p><p>Sarah has had to pay almost £5,000 in application fees, and has been exasperated by the slow progress.</p><p>“Kitchen and bathroom suppliers, various contractors… everybody is just waiting. You can’t help but think about all the business that is just not happening because of this. There is no reason to buy a flat in a building over six storeys.</p><p>“When we submitted our application, people didn’t realise how big the delays would be, and the expense that can be added to buying one of these flats. When you think about the amount of housing stock you’re talking about across the country, it’s madness.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘No incentive to approve anything’</h2><p>The Government, aware of the problem posed by the BSR and the fact that it is blocking development, is set to introduce a fast-track process for new-build applications, as well as move the regulator from under the Health and Safety Executive to the Ministry for Housing and Local Government. But this will do little to fix the problem, warns Hopkinson.</p><p>“It’s a solution that has zero incentive to approve anything. In cases [such as Sarah’s], the BSR will continually ask for an extension with the implicit threat that if you don’t give it, they will just reject the application, while asking for more and more money. That sounds like an institution that won’t be suddenly and easily reformed to approve lots more homes and refurbishments.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Unless the Government acts, the country is unlikely to see the number of new homes it desperately needs to help more first-time buyers on to the property ladder. Hopkinson advocates for a stripping-back of the BSR’s purview to stimulate development and refurbishment.</p><p>“They could avoid flat refurbishment cases, and only focus on areas where cladding is a real issue. Or they could have a rule of ‘positive silence’ – if they don’t respond to you within an allotted time it’s assumed that they’ve approved it,” he says.</p><p>A BSR spokesman said: “This regulatory process is new and there are issues causing frustrations for both industry and the regulator. We are working together to resolve these. There should be no tension between building high volumes of homes and ensuring safety.”</p><p>A Ministry for Housing spokesman said: “We have brought new leadership to the Building Safety Regulator who have immediately focused on speeding up decision making on building control approval.</p><p>“We know more needs to be done which is why we are going further with a ‘building acceleration package’ to get Britain building, including overhauling the BSR’s performance.</p><p>“This will reduce unnecessary delays without compromising safety so we can build 1.5 million homes.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

I felt sick and ended up vomiting.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Elsewhere, the group named buses on routes 159, 345 and 55 as suffering infestations.</p><p>Kevin Mustafa, a London bus safety campaigner, said it was more than an “occasional nuisance”, with “many drivers describing infestations”.</p><p>He told the BBC on Monday: “The current state is untenable for drivers who already face demanding working conditions. London bus drivers are reporting persistent issues with cockroaches and unsanitary conditions onboard their vehicles.</p><p>“This is not a matter of occasional nuisance.

Penned like cattle into stiff plastic seats, stifled by delays and cancellations, bombarded by youths <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/08/22/punish-those-playing-music-out-loud-on-public-transport/\">playing music out loud</a> and preyed upon by conductors yearning to triple charge you for what you thought was the right ticket, the average railway journey is an express train into misery.</p><p>Yet amid this litany of woe, there is the worst offender. I’ve had some depressing meals in my time, from school dinner slop to peculiar post-club kebabs. But no culinary catastrophe comes close to the miserable pickings offered by your average rail buffet car. Remembering that half of what is mislabelled a menu is missing at any one time, one is usually offered a bleak selection of stale sandwiches, tepid bacon rolls, unimaginative <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/healthiest-crisps/\">crisps</a> and depressing paninis. Before boarding a long-distance train today, I always make a packed lunch.</p><p>I wasn’t always so dour. I was a train-mad tot, raised between Thomas the Tank Engine, toy tracks and weekend Tube trips. As I grew older, I wept over pictures of disused stations, put railway posters up with my Margaret Thatcher and Jenna Coleman portraits, and re-watched <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/3353156/Betjemans-metro-land-revisited.html\">John Betjeman’s Metro-Land </a>with a fanaticism that would put many a jihadi to shame. But the fantasy has died as my professional obligations have made train travel a daily dread.</p><p>It shouldn’t have to be like this. We did once know how to make the experience enjoyable. Travelling by rail through Britain should be joyous. Even if one has to stop off at a crime against architecture grotesquely mislabelled as a station, one yearns to see our country’s magnificence while hurtling between destinations in far greater comfort than a motorway slog. An obvious ground zero for rail restorationism is the dining car.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Anyone who has seen North by Northwest or From Russia with Love can attest to the inherent charm of an old-fashioned dining car. Who wouldn’t want a long-distance railway journey enhanced by tucking in to a three-course meal with a decent claret or three? Who wouldn’t rather enjoy a cocktail as the country passes by than a lukewarm lager or oddly frosty coffee? Luxury train journeys with dining experiences – like the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/activity-and-adventure/stylish-rail-journey-london-victoria-bournemouth-via-1930s/\">Northern Belle</a>, branded “Britain’s poshest train”, and available for booking for Christmas dinner – are doing great business. Why not bring this back to the masses?</p><p>There is a 150-odd year <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3310994/Its-the-only-way-to-travel.html\">tradition of doing so</a>. The <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/10263846/Pullman-dining-a-great-restaurant-journey.html\">Pullman dining car</a> is synonymous with luxury. Originally built by the Pullman Company for dining, sleeping and lounge use, the term still applies to a few remaining high-end train dining services. But the number of them has shrunk precipitously. When the railways were privatised in 1995 almost 250 trains a day offered a dining car. Within two decades, that had shrunk to only four. Privatisation saw passenger numbers double and investment increase nine-old, but at the cost of making journeys soulless.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>With Labour’s renationalisation push, there is a chance for a reset. Yet the first returns of renewed state-control are predictably unpromising, with <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/10/02/train-cancellations-surge-50-per-cent-after-being-national/\">delays and cancellations on South Western Railway rising by 50 per cent since nationalisation</a>. Labour’s technocrats lack the vision required to restore our railways. Which is why the cause of the dining car should be taken up by a politician with a far better appreciation of a long lunch’s merits: Nigel Farage.</p><p>The Reform leader may prefer private helicopter to rail. But with his <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/07/20/reform-nationalist-half-water-industry-nigel-farage/\">newfound penchant for nationalisation</a>, Farage is already fishing in this pool.
