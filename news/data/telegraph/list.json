We owe the term, for those still too young to know, to <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/07/12/labours-war-on-landlords-has-an-ignoble-and-rancid-pedigree/\">Peter Rachman</a>, the Polish-born Jewish Holocaust survivor who reinvented himself as a west London wheeler-dealer, and who for years was regarded as the epitome of everything rotten in post-war Britain.</p><p>In <em>Slumlord</em>,<em> </em>Neil Root successfully prises the human being out from under the epithet, and, in the process, re-opens the door on one of those small dark rooms in recent history that we would perhaps all rather forget. Root is certainly suited to the job. A long-time and prolific true-crime writer, he has written about all sorts of corrupt detectives, wrong’uns and dodgy dealers, skilfully placing them in their wider historical context. With <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://books.telegraph.co.uk/Product/Neil-Root/Slumlord--Peter-Rachman-and-the-Post-war-London-Underworld/31997074\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Slumlord</em></a>, he does the same again, describing in detail the scale of Rachman’s property empire, as well as setting his activities against the backdrop of the darker glamour of his age: <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/artists/can-help-find-christine-keeler-portrait/\">Christine Keeler</a> and Mandy Rice-Davies, Ronnie and Reggie Kray, and so on.</p><p>The bare bones of the story have been told before – in books, in documentaries and, perhaps most unexpectedly, in Caryl Phillips’s recent novel <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://books.telegraph.co.uk/Product/Caryl-Phillips/Another-Man-in-the-Street/31807361\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Another Man in the Street</em></a> (2025), which features a thinly fictionalised version of Rachman as Phillips’s <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/buy-to-let/rise-of-the-young-landlord/\">landlord character</a>, Feldman. Born Perec Rachman in Lwów in 1919, Rachman endured Nazi and then Soviet camps before fighting with the Polish forces alongside the Allies. After demobilisation in Britain, he drifted into the West London property market, beginning modestly as an estate agent’s assistant, and ending by the late 1950s with more than 100 decrepit mansion blocks and a Rolls-Royce.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The crucial move in Rachman’s rapid ascent was his exploitation of Britain’s convoluted rent-control regime. Protected, mostly white, working class tenants were bought off, bullied out, or concentrated into a smaller pool of properties; their places in formerly respectable terraces were taken by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/09/04/windrush-generation-are-the-true-losers-of-migration/\">recent West Indian migrants</a> who enjoyed almost no legal protection and could be charged extortionate rents for squalid little rooms. Rachman would rely on a ruthless “heavy crew”, a threatening bunch of pretty-boy wrestlers who liked to turn up with Alsatians in order to sort out any troublesome tenants.</p><p>The story, in Root’s telling, very much represents the shadow side of <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/news/predicted-swinging-london/\">Swinging London</a>. Rachman appears at the edge of the Profumo affair: he kept models (and lovers) Rice-Davies and Keeler at a Marylebone mews house which he owned, a convenient <em>pied-à-terre</em> where sex, politics and class briefly collided. (Sex for Rachman, Keeler said, “was like cleaning his teeth, and I was the toothpaste”.)</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>He did business with the Krays, handing them the Knightsbridge club Esmeralda’s Barn in lieu of allowing them to muscle in on his property holdings. And Michael de Freitas, later known as Michael X, the black revolutionary, was one of his rent collectors. The person that emerges from this milieu is a disturbingly contradictory figure: a Jewish refugee, rendered stateless, whose life circumstances hardened both into a predatory indifference to others’ needs, but who also afforded housing opportunities to other immigrants.</p><p>Root’s instinct is to distrust both hagiography and demonology and doggedly to follow the paper trail – perhaps, at times, a little too doggedly. There’s extensive quoting of archive material, interviews and much following of the fortunes of minor characters. Sometimes the reader might yearn for the narrative to slow down: “In the mid-to-late 1950s, Rachman was close friends with Denis Hamilton, the first husband of the film star Diana Dors, before she had a relationship with Rachman’s employee Tommy Yeardye.” Root weaves his way expertly, swiftly, through ledger books, shell companies, council reports, Hansard debates, court records and foggy memories from ex-tenants and ex-gangsters, often leaving the reader panting to catch up.</p><p>The book is at its most compelling when Root pauses for long enough to analyse Rachman’s behaviour. He portrays it as a kind of extreme expression of a system designed to further disadvantage those already disadvantaged by the chronic post-war housing shortage, the perverse incentives of rent control, and the political reluctance to act until scandal forced Parliament’s hand and the 1965 Rent Act finally strengthened <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/buy-to-let/renters-rights-bill-when-will-it-become-law-labour/\">tenant protections</a>. But then the book’s pace soon picks up again: Root is, after all, a true-crime writer, and readers looking for an extended engagement with housing theory, the history of race relations, or the economic history of post-war London will want to look elsewhere.</p><p>If Root succeeds, it is in showing how a single individual managed to exploit the faults and flaws in a rotten system. In an age when rogue landlords still fill the headlines, and <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/15/renters-need-to-earn-at-least-40000-to-afford-room-london/\">London’s rental market</a> remains cheerfully sadistic, “Rachmanism” clearly remains with us. <em>Slumlord</em> is not, therefore, just a lurid period piece or a glimpse of some dim, unpleasant past, but an unsettling mirror held up to the city’s present.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">★★★☆☆</h2><p><em>Slumlord is published by Icon at £20.

The Commons are deeply valued locally, and we are exploring whether community ownership could provide certainty for future generations.”</p><p>The crowdfunding campaign has already raised around half a million pounds in pledges, but FTWRC only has until March 26 to come up with the full amount needed to outbid other potential buyers.</p><p>John Barber, the former chairman of FTWRC, said: “As a community we feel this is a real opportunity to take the Commons into community ownership for the first time ever.</p><p>“I’d say more than 90 per cent of people are against any prospect of building on the Commons. Should permission be granted in this case, it risks opening the door to further development in future.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Mr Barber said the campaign would be happy to invite Ray Davies, who wrote The Village Green Preservation Society, to perform the song at one of their forthcoming campaign events “as long as he’s prepared to put his hand in his pocket to support our buy-out”.</p><p>“He could even write a song about our campaign. I’d have thought it was the kind of subject matter he might be interested in,” Mr Barber added.</p><p>Targetfollow, a Norwich-based asset acquisition group, describes the sale of the Commons as “a truly unique opportunity in the heart of Kent” in its brochure.</p><p>It states that with the necessary planning consent, the six-acre car park and adjacent woodland would provide a “prime redevelopment opportunity” and “a rare chance to transform a high-profile central site into an exceptional address”.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The brochure said applying for the land exchange “would unlock significant development potential, enabling a planning application for a scheme comparable to The Potteries”, and a residential development at its full capacity would have a projected gross development value of around £60m and a residual site value of approximately £10m.</p><p>Purchase of the Commons would also include the title of Lord of the Manor of Rusthall, an ancient feudal holding extending from London Road in Tunbridge Wells westward to Langton Green and northward to Speldhurst.</p><p>Targetfollow said it was looking for a buyer “who will act as a responsible long-term steward of this historic landscape and will respect the Commons’ protections and community value”.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Corin Thoday, the chief executive of Targetfollow, said in a statement announcing the sale last October: “The Commons are a cherished part of Tunbridge Wells.

The bank is BrewDog’s main lender.</p><p>The move came as it emerged that James Watt, Brewdog’s co-founder, is preparing to invest £10m of his own cash into a rescue bid for the group.</p><p>Mr Watt is assembling a consortium of investors to acquire the entire group, including its bars, brands and brewing facilities, Sky News reported. The identity of the backers is still unclear.</p><p>Security against the brewery gives HSBC greater protection in the event that a sale fails and the company falls into administration.</p><p>Recent filings show HSBC’s loans have been secured against BrewDog’s flagship brewery in Ellon, Aberdeenshire. The site, which also includes a distillery and bar, opened in 2012 and produces hundreds of millions of litres of beer annually, including best-selling brands such as Punk IPA and Hazy Jane.</p><p>Allan Leighton, the chairman of BrewDog, signed off on HSBC’s claim against the brewery earlier this month.</p><p>The additional security comes as <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/16/brewdog-is-the-author-of-its-own-demise/\">the craft beer pioneer</a> races to find a rescuer for its business. A second round of bidding is expected to begin in the coming days.</p><p>A break-up of the loss-making company is seen as likely, with the brewing operation separated from BrewDog’s dozens of bars.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Any sale will be complicated by an unusual arrangement between the company and its private equity backers TSG Consumer Partners.</p><p>TSG ploughed £213m into BrewDog in 2017 to secure a 21pc stake but this included a clause guaranteeing the fund an 18pc compounding rate of return on its investment.</p><p>The arrangement has saddled BrewDog with debts of more than £800m to TSG, meaning any sale must exceed that figure if other investors are to realise a return. The most recent crowdfunding valued the business at £2bn, although any sale is expected to be well below that price.</p><p>It is understood that the company’s brand and breweries are the most attractive assets for potential buyers. Its pubs and bars are less appealing in the wake of tax increases by Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, which piled pressure on the hospitality sector by driving up costs.</p><p>Potential suitors include drinks giants Carlsberg, Heineken and AB InBev, the brewing giant behind Stella Artois and Corona.</p><p>Company filings show that BrewDog currently has £92m in outstanding bank loans including £25m due for repayment in six months.</p><p>HSBC has backed BrewDog for more than a decade. Mr Watt claimed in 2015 that he had blagged his way to securing an early loan from the bank.</p><p>Mr Watt said at the time: “We said that our bank had offered us an amazing deal but that if you can match it we’ll switch and they went for it. You have got to do what you have to do.”</p><p>Mark Tate, formerly an executive at HSBC, said in 2013 that BrewDog “is exactly the sort of business we are well placed to serve”.</p><p>As well as bank loans, Mr Watt also raised £75m from an army of 200,000 “punk equity investors”. These smaller shareholders are now likely to be wiped out as part of any sale.</p><p>Mr Watt, who stepped down as chief executive in 2024 but retains a 22pc stake, is also believed to be rallying his own bid to regain control. However, he has yet to reveal his financial backers.</p><p>The scramble to restore BrewDog’s fortunes follows <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/14/brewdog-seeks-rescuer-as-losses-mount/\">years of losses</a>. The company lost £37m in 2024-25 on revenues of £357m.</p><p>Problems have been compounded by slowing sales growth, fuelled by a cost-of-living squeeze and young people drinking less.</p><p>Even Mr Watt has admitted to drinking less beer as part of a health kick, limiting himself to between six and eight units a week. One pint of BrewDog Punk IPA contains just above three units of alcohol.</p><p>HSBC and BrewDog declined to comment.</p></div></div></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"grid-col grid-col-12 tpl-article__layout tpl-article__layout--content\"><div class=\"\" data-js=\"article-body\" data-test=\"tpl-article-body-recipe\"><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The super-rich, we’re told, are <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/15/the-londoners-fleeing-labours-war-on-wealth-under-duress/\">leaving London</a>. Since Brexit, the arrival of Labour and the non-dom debacle, they’re buying into the sun-baked bling of Dubai, Monaco or Marbella, and they’re sampling the tax-friendly carrots being dangled in Italy.</p><p>There is a house in a Mayfair garden square, however, that might tempt an ultra-high-net-worth individual to stay. In St James’s Square, steps from the historic In &amp; Out Club, which counts royalty among its members, an eight-storey house spanning 30,000sq ft (a largish family house would be swallowed up by the 3,500sq ft master suite alone) has discreetly become available to buy.</p><p>‘I suspect its price will start with a two,’ states its casually dressed and well-connected 44-year-old developer, Dean Main, who wears two hats in the super-prime property sphere: he is founder of Henigman, a private investment and development company that undertook this lavish redevelopment project; he is also founder and CEO of Rhodium, which manages many of London’s most upmarket developments (The Bryanston, 60 Curzon, Lancer Square) – which will come in handy when whoever buys this gargantuan house needs a ready supply of butlers, cooks and security guards.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Main doesn’t need to say it, but following the ‘two’ he mentions are eight zeros, as this isn’t merely one of the biggest houses in London, it’s one of the most expensive, on- or off-market. Assuming this won’t be someone’s only residence, and that its eventual buyer is likely to be a non-UK resident (viewers so far have come from the US, Middle East and India), the stamp duty alone would be in the region of £38 million.</p><p>So what does £200 million get you in London these days? A fully furnished, dressed-to-the-nines townhouse, even the extensive art on the walls. And as the final touches are put in place (two men are laying a rich blue runner up the main staircase’s 170 steps, a 104ft drop from top to bottom that’s certainly not a job for vertigo sufferers), Main gives me the inaugural tour. He seems a little frantic and frazzled – which isn’t surprising, given this is the culmination of five intense years of redeveloping a Grade II listed freehold mansion, full of protected features such as every piece of wood, under the exacting eye of Historic England.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>That timespan pales, however, when you learn that the interior designer Martin Kemp has been on the project, under various owners, for 18 years. ‘It’s sort of sad that it’s finished,’ says Kemp, who has joined us on the tour. His mind is no doubt whirring as he recalls the hundreds of specialist artisans he has encountered along the way. Or the gargantuan challenge of illuminating this house: as well as 137 wall lights, 80 floor lamps, and large numbers of lamps and picture lights, there are 34 ceiling ‘installations’ – lights that aren’t just lights, but exquisite one-off works of art. In the formal dining room, a 200kg chandelier by the Venetian glassworks Rocco Borghese required 1,736 precision-cut crystal prisms to be hand-assembled on site, then hauled into place by 10 men.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Main, meanwhile, shows off the sultry walk-in humidor (the perfect man cave) and powder rooms decorated with his favourite de Gournay hand-painted silk wall­paper – both inspired by the cheekily decadent décor of the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2026/02/12/annabels-once-london-exclusive-club-now-naff/\">private members’ club Annabel’s</a> – before reflecting that it’s been a ‘super-turbulent’ five years in which to develop a Grade II listed mansion. ‘I’d never do anything like this again,’ he says. ‘Inflation has been running at 10 per cent. There have been tough geo-political tailwinds. We’ve had contractors go bust and a two-year delay. A new build is far less challenging.’</p><p>The pressure was on from the start. The previous owner, from whom Main and his long-term investor, CPI Property Group, bought the house in 2019 for £45.25 million, insisted on exchange and completion within five days, after tiring of her own renovation project.</p><p>They have since spent many tens of millions of pounds (Main won’t confirm how many, but we can assume it’s exceeded his original estimate of around £50 million) on turning this townhouse, built in the 1670s, and remodelled by the revered English architect Edwin Lutyens in 1911, into a palatial residence that preserves its heritage while providing what uncompromising billionaires want from a home these days.</p><p>One prospective buyer explained that he had just 17 minutes to look around as he was in a hurry to get to the state banquet with King Charles and Donald Trump. But you could easily spend a couple of hours exploring every room and still barely touch the surface.</p><p>Where prospective buyers emit their most exuberant ‘wows’ as they tour the floors will be down to taste – but there are many. For some, it’ll be the 3,000sq ft basement spa that wins them over, with its long lap pool framed by mosaic-tiled columns, and amenities – gym, sauna, steam room, massage room – that are better than those of most five-star hotels.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Others will be seduced by the Hermès boutique-inspired dressing room, part of the master suite occupying the entire third floor, with joinery by cabinet makers who have worked on Buckingham Palace and the Vatican, Main informs me. There are seven further bedroom suites, ‘like five-star Parisian hotel suites’, he adds, as we gaze at snowy white carpets too perfect to tread on.<br/>Kemp has gone to town on huge ‘his and hers’ bathrooms too – hers, a bright, ornate room with a gleaming brass and glass tardis of a shower (‘it’s a boudoir, the detailing is classical and the result is palatial’); his, a moodily dark sanctuary, with a centrepiece stone bathtub alongside a fireplace, chandelier and disguised TV screen.</p><p>Alongside all the opulence, there are rooms that hint that this might be a family home of sorts. The subterranean cinema, for example – where UHNW sprogs will keep themselves entertained, but so will their parents. Main draws back curtains to reveal a picture window that overlooks the 10-car basement garage. ‘I loved <em>Tron</em> when I was young,’ Kemp says of the inspiration behind the electric-blue ribbons of light that weave around the garage floor. ‘It could double up as an amazing nightclub,’ he adds.</p><p>The garage is accessed via an unassuming back alley, which you’d never know leads to the house. You can drive your car through two sets of security gates and directly into another of this property’s rare features: the large courtyard garden. Appealing to the likely buyer’s need for privacy, the garden is framed by the entirely windowless walls of neighbouring office buildings.</p><p>For some with a couple of hundred million to spend, though, the cachet will lie in having a house that overflows with quintessentially English heritage. ‘If the buyer is a big tech guy from the US, they will have their ultra-modern house in the hills but they want history, sophistication and the highest level of finishes. It’s a trophy,’ says Main. They, then, will love the double-height, oak-panelled library, which will feed fantasies of a Bodleian-style reading room. Much has been restored to how Lutyens envisaged it, including an original clock.</p><p>Just as the world has changed since this renovation began, the lifestyles and tastes of the super-rich have shifted too, certainly in the nearly two decades since Kemp came up with the original CGIs. But, much of his original vision remains. The result is opulent, certainly, but not bling. ‘This was about bringing back heritage. Modern dates, but I don’t think this will,’ Kemp says.<br/>‘Timeless’ is a word he often uses. And while there is smart Crestron tech throughout, it can be the simple things that catch the eye of the world’s wealthiest house-hunters – such as simple old-school light switches. ‘Everyone comments on them and says they want them for their house,’ he says, as if they were the wackiest invention ever.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>And to complete the picture, whoever lives here will want a full coterie of staff – but in true <em>Upstairs, Downstairs</em> fashion, they will ideally be invisible. For that, Main has designed a ‘skin’ around the living areas – a system of separate corridors, entrances and staff accommodation, so they can come and go without intruding upon the family’s living spaces. There are small back kitchens on every floor, too, so food prepared in the catering kitchen in the basement can be delivered by dumb waiter to every area of the house.</p><p>Main is dealing personally with all viewings – and only with the buyer, no intermediaries, ‘to avoid time-wasters’, he says. Agents who have taken a peek in recent months, however, are impressed. ‘I’d put it in the category of “Show me another one”, because you can’t,’ says Stuart Bailey, Knight Frank’s head of super-prime sales. ‘It’s a fabulous address, a wide house with high ceilings, outdoor space and secure parking. It’s what the market is looking for. A statement asset like this puts a flag in the sand – it says, “I’ve arrived, I’m serious.” It’s a collector’s item.’</p><p>Becky Fatemi, executive partner at UK Sotheby’s International Realty, is dealing with ‘a roster of billionaires’ looking for a place in London, she says, and this house is ‘really sensational’. She’s had offers on a couple of off-market properties costing around £200 million, she says, ‘so this price isn’t crazy. An asset like this sets its own price because it’s being sold turnkey [so you can move straight in]. You’d never be able to recreate this if you did it yourself, as the cost of work has become prohibitive. And it’s the only one like it.’</p><p>As for Main, he is in no hurry to sell. After five years of blood, sweat and tears, he’s happy to admire the finished result for a while, and to use it for events and as a showcase of what he can do. Just don’t ask him to show you another one.</p></div></div></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"grid-col grid-col-12 tpl-article__layout tpl-article__layout--content\"><div class=\"\" data-js=\"article-body\" data-test=\"tpl-article-body-recipe\"><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>With housing costs now the single <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/house-prices/average-house-price-tops-300k-first-time/\">biggest strain</a> on finances, workers are hunting for a radical solution. And some are finding it through a hidden gem in the employment market – the “tied accommodation” role.</p><p>From chefs and gardeners to teachers and animal carers, professionals are increasingly seeking positions that offer refuge from the relentless climb of housing costs.</p><p>The figures are stark. The average weekly mortgage payment has soared to £242, according to the Government’s latest English Housing Survey, up from £182 just five years ago. For renters, the outlook is even more grim, with Zoopla reporting average monthly rents of £1,320, outstripping typical mortgage payments.</p><p>In this landscape, a job that includes a home is not a mere perk – it’s a life-changing financial reprieve.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘Job with a house’</h2><p>Vicki Alford, 47, horse unit manager at Blue Cross rehoming centre in Burford, agrees. For two decades, her role caring for over 60 rescued horses on-site – and overseeing nearly 500 more at properties nationwide – has come with a home.</p><p>She started in a flat and later moved to a three-bedroom bungalow with a large garden to accommodate her growing family. Managing a 120-acre site where horses often arrive in desperate need of veterinary and behavioural care is a round-the-clock labour of love. “Every month, around 20 to 30 need retraining,” she explains.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Alford’s need for an on-site house was proven one memorable night when 15 mares foaled simultaneously. “I was the only one on duty, so I helped with the births until the vet arrived,” she says.</p><p>Her family has also benefitted from the lifestyle that comes with the job. Alford’s two children grew up surrounded by horses, and freedom from a mortgage or rent has allowed her to save substantially.</p><p>While her part-time salary might be modest – the full-time equivalent is paid up to £35,436 – having a cost-free home has paid off. The arrangement has enabled her to <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/buying-selling/how-much-deposit-need-buy-house/\">save for a house</a>, which she now rents out, securing her financial future.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘I do pay rent, but it’s subsidised’</h2><p>It’s a similar story for Louise Ellis, head gardener at English Heritage’s Audley End House and Gardens in Saffron Walden.</p><p>“I’ve lived and worked here for 17 years. I started out as a trainee gardener on the minimum wage after a career change from social care and gained my horticultural qualification,” she explains.</p><p>Now in charge of 13 paid staff and around 65 volunteers, Ellis oversees the landscaped parkland and the Victorian kitchen garden, which includes a vinery dating back to the 1820s. What she particularly loves about her role is that, while she has climbed to a managerial position, she still does much of the hands-on gardening.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>She lives in Orchard Cottage, which is one of the original Victorian staff houses. The one-storey, two-bedroom home has character features including a vaulted ceiling, along with a modern extension containing the bedrooms and a bathroom. Ellis lives alone as her partner is based in Norfolk.</p><p>“It’s very well-maintained and sits within the unrestored parts of the walled garden. I also have my own private garden with fruit trees,” she says. Ironically, there is a large, detached red-brick home called the Head Gardener’s House, but that is now let out to paying holiday guests.</p><p>There are four staff members who live on site, including the stable manager and other gardeners. “The provision of housing is an allowance for our out-of-hours responsibilities. We must respond quickly if there is an emergency, which requires us to live on site,” she says.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>“I do pay rent, but it’s subsidised. It has enabled me to save a quarter of my salary every month, something I’ve been very focused on now that I am 55 and <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/pensions/things-to-do-before-retirement-state-pension-investment/\">retirement is on the horizon</a>. I’ll need to work until I reach the state pension age, but my job keeps me physically fit, so that’s a benefit,” she says.</p><p>She is aware that she lives in an expensive market town, where a two-bedroom home costs on average £1,359 per month. “I wouldn’t be able to live here on my salary if I had to rent privately. I’d probably need to move further out towards Suffolk to afford a similar home,” she says.</p><p>“English Heritage is a great landlord. It deals with repairs promptly and is progressive – we have oil central heating, but it is looking at air-source heat pumps and alternative fuel sources,” she says. </p><p>Ellis doesn’t own a property elsewhere and knows that when she retires from Audley End, she will be back to paying for a home in the private rental sector.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘It’s idyllic’</h2><p>Hospitality, with its long and sometimes anti-social hours, is another industry that frequently offers staff accommodation – particularly in remotely located hotels.</p><p>Billy McKechnie, 45, is general manager of the Royal Marine Hotel in Brora, located an hour’s drive from Inverness along the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/scotland/north-coast-500-a-decade-on/\">North Coast 500</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>He has been in the role for three and a half years. Part of his daily duties include playing the bagpipes to welcome guests to breakfast. Along with his wife Minette and their three children, he is provided with accommodation.</p><p>“Our children play in the hills or at the beach, visit neighbouring castles and play golf in their free time – it’s idyllic,” says McKechnie.</p><p>Lifestyle aside, the perk of staff accommodation is a definite help for the family’s purse strings. “The hotel contributes towards the rent on our house, which is £1,200 per month. We chose the house ourselves. It’s five minutes by car from the hotel.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>In an area that is losing residents to nearby cities, providing hotel staff with subsidised housing is a key incentive for securing their commitment.</p><p>“We have a house in Inverness that we rent out. We wouldn’t have moved from there if the hotel didn’t provide us with a home,” he says. Plus, if the family had sold their main home to buy closer to McKechnie’s workplace, they would have faced both seller’s fees and stamp duty costs.</p><p>For younger workers, having accommodation provided allows them to go where the jobs are.</p><p>James Greenwood-Penny, 24, is the sous chef at The Cottage in the Wood in Malvern. “I was born and grew up in Cornwall – a long way from Malvern,” he says.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>He notes that without the housing perk, rent alone would have consumed three quarters of his pay – and that’s before bills. By saving his entire salary, he is building up funds for a future down payment on a house – a dream made possible only by having a job that comes with a home.</p></div></div></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"grid-col grid-col-12 tpl-article__layout tpl-article__layout--content\"><div class=\"\" data-js=\"article-body\" data-test=\"tpl-article-body-recipe\"><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Mallika Basu was looking forward to a good 2026. The 48-year-old food writer was gearing up for a book launch – her first “actual, proper book”.</p><p>It took just a two-hour phone call to bring her hopes for the year crashing down. The mother-of-two from south London <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/jobs/career-advice/the-scam-epidemic-taking-hold-among-britains-job-hunters/\">was scammed</a> out of more than £5,700.</p><p>A couple of days earlier she had received a text which she thought was from her phone company, telling her to claim reward points she was owed. Basu clicked on the link and entered her card details as requested.</p><p>Worried she had done the wrong thing, she told NatWest that she thought her card might be compromised.</p><p>Then, on Jan 10, she received a strange text. The message asked her to approve a transaction of nearly £400 to eBay, which she knew nothing about. When she declined, she received a phone call.</p><p>It was the NatWest fraud team – or so she was told – and her account had been compromised.</p><p>“The first question I asked – because I’ve never been scammed in my life – was, ‘How do I know you’re calling from NatWest?’</p><p>“They said, ‘We are calling from NatWest, we would never ask for your pin and we would never ask for your password’. So they were mimicking what would normally happen,” she says.</p><p>The fraudsters convinced her that her money was unsafe and that it could be syphoned off to Pakistan, where it would be unrecoverable. Then they applied pressure – telling Basu that they couldn’t guarantee the safety of her money.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>“They kept putting me on hold and saying, ‘We’re speaking to the security team. Because your account has been compromised online, we need to make sure that they can’t go in and apply for an overdraft or apply for a loan’,” she says.</p><p>She tried to move money out of her account – but the real NatWest<strong> </strong>recognised that she was being coerced quickly and blocked the attempted transactions. The fraudsters changed tack. If one account had been compromised then her other bank accounts could be too.</p><p>“Where else do you bank?” they asked.</p><p>Basu had personal and business accounts with <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/banking/current-accounts/revolut-monzo-starling-which-best-online-bank/\">online bank Starling</a>: “They said: ‘Okay, well, NatWest has bought Starling and we have access. If you’re compromised on NatWest, you’re compromised on Starling too’.”</p><p>The food writer hadn’t heard of a takeover but she was convinced to move her money from Starling: “They got me on the basis of that to transfer my money urgently.</p><p>“Of course, now looking back, clearly they were following the path of least resistance,” she says.</p><p>The fraudsters would tell her whatever she needed to hear to trust them.</p><p>In three transactions, Basu moved more than £5,770 from her Starling business account. The first payment, through Western Union, was for £3,500. She was told that the money was going into a new, safe Starling account.</p><p>Basu claims that she did not give the fraudsters her Starling bank card details but the scammers were able to trigger card payments on her account, which came up as notifications for approval in her app. It is unclear how the scammers got this information.</p><p>“I did not set up the transactions. The transactions were generated. I was sent transactions to approve,” Basu says.</p><p>Starling says that Basu was shown 10 fraud warnings during the call, including ones which said that she was not on the phone to the bank. Basu says she has no recollection of the alerts.</p><p>She says: “If they’ve sent me in-app warnings, I am already lulled into a state where I am thinking, ‘Oh, it doesn’t matter, they’re protecting me’. So they’re essentially neutralising these warnings. I just don’t think it’s a very effective safeguard.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Fraud has been rising, fuelled by AI and fake social media adverts with politicians, police forces and City regulators at a loss for how to tackle it. Britons lost more than £1bn to scams every year between 2020 and 2024, according to UK Finance. Another £630m was lost in the first half of last year.</p><p>Breaking the spell created by the emotional manipulation at the core of the scammers’ playbook is very difficult.</p><p>A three-year national fraud strategy – spearheaded by Lord Hanson of Flint, the fraud minister – is set to be published by the Home Office this spring. It comes after the launch of Report Fraud, which replaced the much-maligned Action Fraud.</p><p>Since October 2024, victims of authorised push payment (APP) fraud have been due <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/banking/fraud-payouts-capped-85k-backlash-banks/\">reimbursement from their bank</a> under a mandatory scheme overseen by the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR).</p><p>The latest figures showed that £173m was paid out by banks in the first year that the rules applied – or 83pc of the reported losses.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>David Geale, the head of the PSR, told MPs at a Treasury select committee hearing earlier this month that the rules had been a “huge incentive” for banks to improve their fraud controls.</p><p>But the transactions that Basu had approved on her Starling app were card payments. This meant that she was not covered by the mandatory reimbursement rules, which only apply to Faster Payments or CHAPS – so, she has been left £3,500 out of pocket.</p><p>In letters seen by the Telegraph in response to her complaint, Starling said that it could have done more to stop the later transactions made by Basu, including another £2,160 which was sent just seven minutes later. It refunded around 40pc of the money she lost.</p><p>Basu questioned why Starling allowed any of the payments through at all, especially when NatWest had not.</p><p>The food writer says she was under a lot of stress because she was about to launch her book, <em>In Good Taste</em>. The scam emptied her business account.</p><p>She explains: “I was due to launch my first book which wasn’t a cookbook – the first time I’ve written an actual, proper book – in a week’s time. It was high stress.</p><p>“The pressure was immense and I was terrified that all my money would go [as the scammers told her].</p><p>“Of course it did. They got me. They took absolutely everything, I was left penniless basically.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>A spokesman for Starling said: “We understand how devastating this must be for the customer. Scams are a scourge and we make every effort to protect our customers from them.</p><p>“The customer was provided with 10 different warnings by our systems over the course of her transactions with the scammer. Six of these warnings required acknowledgement, which the customer gave before proceeding with the transactions.</p><p>“In this case, our transaction controls should have automatically blocked the second payment, even though the customer acknowledged the scam risks and wanted to proceed.</p><p>“While this scam is not covered by the PSR’s mandatory reimbursement rules, we have refunded the customer the second payment of £2,160 to Western Union as an acknowledgement that this payment could have been blocked by our systems.”</p><p>A spokesman for NatWest said: “We are glad we have been able to prevent Ms Basu from having her money stolen through a bank impersonation scam. At NatWest, we are using the latest tools and technology to catch and detect scams.</p><p>“We will never ask any customer to move money from their account to another account ‘to keep it safe’; this is one of the most common signs of a scam.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

Instead, ministers suggested the cliff would be monitored for signs of movement. </p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2026/01/24/storm-ingrid-washes-away-part-of-victorian-pier/\">Storm Ingrid</a>, which battered Devon two weeks ago, also saw waves destroy sections of a sea wall protecting the tracks at Dawlish, closing the line for two days.<br/><br/>Rebecca Smith, Tory MP for South West Devon, said the damage had stoked concerns that spending cuts had left the lifeline route exposed to potential disaster.<br/><br/>She said: “With all the tightening of the budget by the Chancellor, she has taken away contingency funding. So if there were something that needed an emergency reaction, the implication is that the money isn’t actually there.</p><p>“If you get the right kind of freakish storm, who knows what could happen. The question for me is, should this not be something that is in capital funding on a year-on-year basis?”</p><p>After Ms Smith asked in the Commons whether funding could be guaranteed for unplanned resilience work, James Murray, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said that budgets allow ministers to respond to emergencies.<br/><br/>He said: “All individual departments must recognise that unexpected pressures will come along; they need to prepare for them and make sure they have robust plans to respond.”<br/><br/>Ms Smith, a member of the transport select committee, said the Government’s reluctance to fund work on the cliff stood in contrast to its <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/01/14/labour-races-to-begin-45bn-northern-rail-upgrade-before-ele/\">backing for the £45bn Northern Powerhouse Rail project</a>, for which Ms Reeves last month announced £1bn of preparatory funding.<br/><br/>She said: “Why do they want to take a gamble when they are investing billions in other parts of the country? Why do we need a marginally faster rail system in the North when in the Southwest, if this went again, we’d be cut off for, I don’t know how long?”<br/><br/>Ms Smith also raised doubts about the level of monitoring that Network Rail is carrying out on the cliff, which is protected by the railway from the sea but prone to becoming sodden with surface water.<br/><br/>She said: “Are they monitoring it or just draining things? We need answers if they are not prepared to put the investment in to fix it.”<br/><br/>Martin Wrigley, Liberal Democrat MP for Newton Abbot, which includes Dawlish, said that had Storm Ingrid hit when seas were higher, the damage could have been much more severe.<br/><br/>He said the Department for Transport (DfT) should grant Network Rail money to undertake a study into a long-term solution for the cliff.<br/><br/>He said: “Monitoring is no good because the last collapse was a single, catastrophic failure, almost a tectonic shift of part of the cliff which came down on to the railway.”<br/><br/>Mr Wrigley said the damage to the Dawlish sea wall was also concerning, having affected areas on either side of a new section installed after the 2014 collapse.</p><p>The DfT said work carried out after the 2014 events held up well in the recent storms, with damage limited to a low wall between the coastal path and the railway. <br/><br/>It said funding had been provided for a drainage trial and a range of advanced monitoring equipment, including tilt sensors that would provide a quick response if triggered.<br/><br/>Work will continue with Network Rail to assess the investment needed to ensure the line’s resilience and to develop any longer-term solutions.</p></div></div></div></div>",

It was a beautiful day, and summer was just around the corner. My twin sister had given birth to a baby boy, and my 65-year-old mother, Elizabeth, had come to stay with me in Mortlake, south London. We planned to go to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital to visit the new baby.</p><p>My husband walked my two eldest children, Barnaby and Sapphire – who were six and four at the time – to school and then hopped on a train to work. My mother, my two-year-old daughter, Pollyanna, and <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/relationships/how-boris-johnson-got-me-back-on-a-bus/\">I set off to catch the bus</a> to the hospital.</p><p>My mother, who lived in rural Shropshire, loved London buses and much preferred them to the train.</p><p>We walked, with Pollyanna in her pram, the short distance from our house to the local bus depot. As we approached, Pollyanna climbed out of her buggy and held my mother’s hand.</p><p>This was when my life changed irreversibly. I turned around, and all I could see was a monstrous, red Metroline bus approaching at a ferocious speed. Instead of turning into the depot, it drove on to the pavement, aiming straight for us. It happened so fast – almost like a bomb going off.</p><p>My legs were trapped under the bus, and I was like the jam in the middle of a horrid sandwich – bus, me, wall. Blood was everywhere. I slipped in and out of consciousness. Out of one eye, I saw my darling, precious, beautiful mother slipping away. She did not survive.</p><p>Out of my other eye, I saw my little daughter about 20<strong> </strong>ft away. She had been flung through the air, and her right leg was hanging off. I was trapped and could not help her. I shouted for my mother so loudly. I wanted her to answer me, but she did not. She could not.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The crash quickly flooded the news as my husband – <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/c/cf-cj/christopher-hope/\">The Telegraph’s Christopher Hope</a> – received a call at work to tell him what had happened.</p><p>As he <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/christopher-hope-relives-bus-crash-devastated-family/\">made the terrible journey</a> from his office in Victoria to Mortlake, he did not even know if we were alive or not. Four surgeons spent seven hours trying to save <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/lost-leg-when-two-now-18-going-dance-school/\">Pollyanna’s leg, but they could not, and she had it amputated</a>.</p><p>I suffered severe degloving in my leg (where skin and soft tissue is torn from the muscle or bone underneath), among other injuries. However, knowing that I would never see my mother again was the most unbearable wound.</p><p>The bus driver who hit us was found guilty of one count of death by dangerous driving and two counts of grievous bodily harm. He was sentenced to four years in prison, which is simply not long enough. Often, only aggravating factors like being under the influence of drink or drugs result in a longer sentence, but it is rare that criminal drivers get more than 12 years behind bars.</p><p>On average, four people die every day on UK roads, and<strong> </strong>many dozens more suffer life-changing injuries. It is no wonder that victims of road crime – like me – feel utterly let down by the UK’s criminal justice system.</p><p>Metroline would not speak to me when I rang up their head office. I felt upset, hopeless and angry. So, in February 2014, I set out on a mission – for road crime to be treated as real crime, and for victims and their families to be treated with kindness and compassion in navigating the criminal justice system.</p><p>I met Boris Johnson, who was the mayor of London at the time. He said he was very sorry for what had happened to my family. He asked me whether <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/transport-for-london\">Transport for London (TfL)</a> had apologised, and I said no.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>He told me that must change. A few weeks later, my husband and I met with TfL and Metroline. They said they were very sorry. I said that “sorry” must hold meaning, and things began to change from then on.</p><p>The Sarah Hope Line was launched in February 2016. It is an incident line that offers confidential support to people involved in, or affected by, life-changing incidents on the TfL network. We have provided to more than 500 families what TfL did not give to us: trauma counselling, assistance with funeral costs and arrangements, and short-term accommodation for family members. Next Monday will mark our 10-year anniversary.</p><p>While the line supports families of the bereaved, we still have not yet changed the attitude within government that road crashes are “just one of those things”. This Government should spend much more on policing our roads, so that <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/08/14/ban-britains-most-dangerous-drivers-for-life-say-tories/\">criminal drivers</a> can be caught. We need to issue immediate fines and driving bans so motorists are deterred from driving dangerously.</p><p><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/18/operation-snap-vigilante-help-film-dangerous-drivers-police/\">Road crime</a> and the damage it causes cost the taxpayer billions of pounds every year – it strains the NHS, criminal justice system and our emergency services. Fatalities, alone, cost the NHS billions every year. That money should be spent on policing our roads and preventing such devastation.</p><p>Perpetrators think they can get away with causing death by dangerous driving because sentences do not reflect the severity of the crime. Change must start now. We must no longer be the forgotten victims.</p><p><em>The Sarah Hope Line is on 0343 222 5678, Monday to Friday, 8am-6pm.

But yes, people are in the wrong place.</p><p>“Problem is that all the British people keep to the left and normally Europeans keep to the right. And they do that in both directions.

The news coincides, oddly, with the dramatic arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor (“Very Westeros,” Evans quips).</p><p>Have the two artistic directors of the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-shakespeare-company/\">Royal Shakespeare Company</a> hit on the holy grail – the next <em>Stranger Things: First Shadow</em>, perhaps or<em> </em><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/tickets/london/harry-potter-cursed-child/\"><em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</em></a>? “That thinking is dangerous,” Evans, 52, counters. “The minute you think like that, you can jinx it.</p><p>“The reason we’re passionate about this is because it reads like a Shakespeare history play. It concerns leadership, succession, power, internecine fighting. George RR Martin is obsessed with Shakespeare.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The globally successful HBO series (2011-19) was notorious for its scenes of sex and violence – it carried an 18 certificate in Britain. The prequel centres on the fabled Great Tourney [jousting tournament] at Harrenhal castle, and the tyrant king Aerys II Targaryen. “It’s going to be total theatre,” promises Evans of the production, which will be directed by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/theatre-director-dominic-cooke-left-think-better-everyone-else/\">Dominic Cooke</a> (<em>Hello, Dolly!</em>). “There will be a content advisory, but we’re expecting it to be something the whole family can enjoy.”</p><p>The pair also tell me about the next wave of RSC programming for the autumn and winter which is announced today. This includes an all-male production of <em>As You Like It </em>(directed by Evans), <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/11/08/harriet-walter-interview/\">Harriet Walter</a> reprising her star turn as Brutus in a 90-minute version of Phyllida Lloyd’s acclaimed all-female <em>Julius Caesar</em>, plus a two-part adaptation of <em>Middlemarch </em>from Nina Raine. The year looks set to end on a swashbuckling high with <em>The Three Musketeers</em>, in which Dumas’s musketeers will be – gasp! – female.</p><p>Evans and Harvey, are a seamless and courteous double act. Having both enjoyed success running regional theatres (him: Sheffield and Chichester; her: Theatr Clwyd in Wales), they bonded during the stresses of the pandemic, and applied for one of the biggest jobs in British theatre on a joint ticket in 2022, succeeding Erica Whyman, who was briefly promoted from deputy after 10 years of Gregory Doran at the helm. Their tenure began properly in 2024. It’s full-on stuff, with Harvey, 48, talking about days that run from dawn to midnight, with her family commitments as a mother of two interspersed: “We often wish we could clone ourselves.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>In a departure from longstanding RSC man Doran’s methodical march through the canon, they have modified the approach so that it’s now more about bringing in diverse artistic talents with fresh, exciting ideas about what to stage, and how to stage it. As Harvey explains: “For us, there’s no point in putting on <em>King John</em> just because it hasn’t been done for a few years.”</p><p>The new rule is that there is no rule – anything could, conceivably, be an RSC show. While that approach might alarm traditionalists, it has reaped dividends in terms of ticket sales. More than 352,000 people attended productions in Stratford in their first year and <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/the-bfg-rsc-review/\"><em>The BFG </em>last Christmas</a> was the highest-grossing play in the history of the RSC. Rupert Goold’s <em>Hamlet </em>also played to 90 per cent capacity, while <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/kenneth-branagh-rsc/\">Kenneth Branagh’s imminent return to the RSC for the first time in more than 30 years</a> in <em>The Tempest </em>has already sold out, just as <em>Macbeth</em>, starring <em>Outlander</em>’s Sam Heughan, did. <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em>, starring Adrian Lester, is transferring to the West End this summer on the back of rave reviews.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>A recent hit,<em> </em><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/measure-for-measure-royal-shakespeare-company/\"><em>Measure for Measure </em>at Stratford</a>, played fast and loose with the text – what do they think is acceptable in terms of tweaking texts many regard as sacrosanct? Evans tells me: “It’s OK to rewrite Shakespeare, but it’s not a free-for-all. Give us your rationale. The rule is that we’re not opposed to it. We’re not purists.” Harvey chips in with thoughts fresh from her rehearsals on <em>Henry V</em>, which she is about to bring to the Stratford main stage, with Alfred Enoch in the lead. “You can pick up any Arden edition and the footnotes read like a food fight between different editors,” she says. In her staging, too, she’s feminising some parts: “I didn’t want it to be a world where we assumed that almost everyone is male other than Katharine and Queen Isabel.”</p><p>One could easily spend an hour talking about <em>Henry V</em> (Harvey is, shockingly, the first woman to direct the play in the RSC’s history), but there are other serious matters to discuss.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2026/02/12/trevor-nunn-interview-imogen-stubbs-broke-my-heart/\">Trevor Nunn</a>, the former RSC chief, stated that the RSC needed a London home; its purpose-built abode, the Barbican, is now one of a number of venues taking RSC work. “We are working out what London means for us,” says Harvey.</p><p>The more pressing task is transport to Stratford, which can seem Elizabethan in its remoteness. “To be frank,” Evans says, “a direct and better train service from London would be transformational. There used to be a direct train to Stratford [until 2023]. There no longer is. And we suffer because of it. When you look at theatre programmes from the 1960s, they used to have the last train time.” Could transport failure scupper their mission? “It might, because if we can’t get people to Stratford, how on earth are we meant to put on plays?”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>That sounds quite existential, and behind the upbeat news there are clearly pressing challenges. Dividends reaped from ticket sales have not been substantial enough to mitigate the financial strain on the organisation, which is looking to reduce its workforce to achieve annual savings of £2.8m. In the autumn, the RSC announced that 420 of its 835 employees were eligible for voluntary redundancy – that consultation period is almost complete. The accounts for 2024-25 highlight the deficit problem: total income was £82m, substantially down on the previous year, with total expenditure running over £84m. Since then, annual repayments of the £20m Culture Recovery Fund loan taken out during Covid have kicked in, too. The drop in income partly reflects previous bumper takings at the box office – the 2022 <em>Matilda </em>film helped boost audiences for the stage show. But a cluster of factors are making life tougher.</p><p>“If you talk to most theatre leaders up and down the country, this is the case for them too,” Evans says. “Audiences have less money to spend because of the cost of living crisis. Costs have gone up exponentially. And there has long been a stand-still in <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/12/16/arts-council-neglecting-arts-to-change-society-says-review/\">Arts Council funding</a> [currently approx £15m], which means a real-terms cut.”</p><p>There are no magic wands. Shows such as <em>Les Misérables</em> – which bankrolled the RSC for decades – are, he says, “like gold-dust – you’d be a fool to rely on them and part of the work we’re doing [in cutting back expenditure] is insulating the RSC from that reliance”. The desirability of any given corporate sponsor aside (and the RSC <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/02/royal-shakespeare-company-ends-partnership-bp-concerns-climate/\">withdrew from a BP sponsorship deal</a> in 2019 following protests), those options have dwindled, too: “There’s less money. Wherever the money comes from, there’s a deeper issue about relying on corporate sponsorship now.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>One option would be to scale back on productions, but that isn’t in their game plan, Harvey argues. “We have to find different ways of working but a sure-fire way to oblivion would be to reduce our artistic ambition and do less because then there’d be no point in our existing. You can cut back or you can be ever more ambitious and find different ways of making work and we’re going that route.”</p><p>There have been rumblings of discontent, particularly over plans to close the music department, with its in-house musicians. An online petition – attracting almost 7,000 signatures – has called for a rethink. If enough people complain, will they change their position? Harvey is swift to justify the proposed changes: “It’s about ensuring that music is more fully integrated into how we make work and giving composers the opportunity to work with freelance musicians. Some music will be created electronically, some will be recorded, some of it will be live.”</p><p>Upheavals notwithstanding, they’re looking to the future, with Evans (also an actor who left drama school early in order to join the RSC in the 1990s), hinting at repertory ensemble models. “We want to keep surprising audiences,” says Harvey.</p><p>As the actors bound back into the spacious Ashcroft room to resume rehearsals for<em> Henry V,</em> she leaves me with a final thought. Whenever the weight of responsibility presses hard, she confides, “I love to remember that this place exists because in the 1870s a local brewer and his son thought there should be a theatre in Stratford. The town and the theatre industry told them that they were mad but they understood that these plays survive because they’re performed. I love to remember that right at the root of this is a local brewer who had a radical idea, and the passion to see it through.”</p><p><em>Priority booking for all newly announced productions opens March 2 at 10am, with public booking opening March 18 at 10am. Priority booking for Game of Thrones: The Mad King opens April 14 with public booking from April 24.

The prior year, 32pc of incidents of violence and abuse were reported to police.</p><p>The BRC said the decline was driven by changes in how retailers were reporting crimes. High street giants including Tesco and John Lewis, for example, have been part of a programme where they share CCTV and incident reports with police to identify gangs in their stores. Other retailers have bulked up their own security teams.</p><p>Attendance by officers to reports was higher than the prior year, when police responded to 10pc of reported incidents of retail violence and abuse. But the BRC said it still remained too low at 31pc.</p><p>It said the current “lack of attendance” of police when they were called by shop workers could “discourage reporting and embolden offenders”.</p><p>The BRC said: “Police should attend all reported retail crime incidents, particularly those involving violence or where a suspect is being detained.”</p><p>Yvette Cooper <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/07/04/high-street-stores-to-ban-serial-shoplifters/\">deployed extra officers on the streets of 500 towns last summer</a> to crack down on shoplifting and anti-social behaviour by “thugs and thieves”. It comes as part of a clampdown by the Government on retail crime, with new laws coming in that will make it a specific offence to assault shop workers.</p><p>The head of Britain’s biggest police force recently said officers had stepped up to demands from retailers to help them curb crime.</p><p><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/12/12/copy-of-met-chief-rowley-shops-must-do-more-stop-shoplifting/\">Speaking to The Telegraph in December</a>, Sir Mark Rowley, the Met commissioner, said forces had responded to demands from retail chiefs for police to do more to tackle rocketing crime levels.</p><p>He said the Met was “making a lot of progress” and that the retail sector “need to do better”, such as providing CCTV footage in more case.</p><p>Many high street stores have been spending heavily on technology to tackle crime, including installing new cameras and exit gates to stop attacks.</p><p>Retailers, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/09/02/sainsburys-facial-recognition-cameras-shoplifters/\">including Sainsbury’s</a> and Sports Direct, have deployed facial recognition cameras that alert staff when known shoplifters have entered their stores.</p><p>Shop staff faced 118 incidents of physical violence every day in the year to Aug 31, according to the BRC.</p><p>It meant there were a total of 43,000 physically violent attacks across the high street last year, slightly down on the previous year’s 45,000. A weapon was involved in 13,000 of the attacks.</p><p>Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said the figures proved that “violence remains endemic”, adding: “No one should go to work fearing for their safety and we must redouble our efforts to bring these numbers much further down once and for all.”</p><p>Including abuse where perpetrators were not violent, the total number of attacks against retail workers slipped from 737,000 to 590,000, or 1,600 per day.</p><p>Shoplifting cost retailers almost £400m last year, when there were 5.5 million detected incidents of customer theft. The BRC did not track the same metric the prior year.</p><p>Ms Dickinson said there was an “increasingly concerning link to organised criminal gangs, who continue to systematically target one store after another, stealing tens of thousands of pounds worth of goods in one go”.</p><p>Sarah Jones, the crime and policing minister, said: “Shop theft is unacceptable, as is any form of abuse or violence against someone simply going about their day-to-day work.</p><p>“We are determined to tackle retail crime and are already making real progress. Shop theft charges have gone up by 21pc. But we know we need to go further. That’s why we are giving police the powers they need to crack down on perpetrators, including making it a specific offence to assault retail workers and scrapping the £200 rule that lets too many offenders off the hook.</p><p>“An additional 3,000 neighbourhood officers will be in place by spring. We will also deliver major policing reforms which will see a National Police Service take on national responsibilities, so local forces can focus on local crime.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

The best we can do is have another member of staff working”.</p><p>While organised gang members account for a significant proportion of theft crimes, shop workers said that they regularly experienced people who appeared inconspicuous walking out with unpaid-for products.</p><p>Mr Chemban recounted a recent occasion when a woman entered the shop with her baby and began pulling items off the shelves, claiming they belonged to her baby when he confronted her.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The BRC hopes that new government legislation to remove the £200 threshold for “low level” theft will send a “strong message to offenders”, with Ms Whing adding that it would: “indicate that no matter what kind, theft will not be tolerated.</p><p>Ms Whing said that the new security systems that separate customers from their shopping are likely to become the new norm as retailers ramp up their efforts to reduce losses.</p><p>“Hopefully, if we carry on in that direction then there can be a transition back.

The Los Angeles-headquartered company had previously offered $30 per share, valuing Warner Bros at $108.4bn (£80.3bn).</p><p>The improved bid represents a late effort by Paramount to derail an <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/16/netflix-promises-cheaper-streaming-hollywood-takeover-fight/\">$83bn takeover agreed between Warner Bros and Netflix</a> last year.</p><p>The board of Warner Bros has repeatedly rebuffed Paramount’s advances, insisting that the Netflix deal offers superior value. A shareholder vote on the deal is scheduled for March 20.</p><p>But the company, which is behind major film franchises including the Harry Potter series, had agreed to give Paramount a week to submit its best offer or walk away.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Heated bidding war</h2><p>Under the terms of its takeover deal, Netflix has the right to match any improved rival offer, raising the prospect of a heated bidding war.</p><p>Netflix has agreed to pay $27.75 per share for Warner Bros’s studio business and the HBO Max streaming service. By contrast, Paramount’s offer also includes the group’s traditional cable channels, including the CNN news network.</p><p>Paramount has previously sweetened its bid by offering to pay a so-called “ticking fee” of $0.25 per share to investors every quarter should its deal fail to close by the end of the year.</p><p>It also agreed to cover the $2.8bn termination fee Warner Bros would have to pay Netflix if it abandons their agreed deal, as well as $1.5bn in fees linked to Warner Bros’ debt refinancing.</p><p>The rival suitors have been locked in an escalating war of words, with Paramount seeking to highlight the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the Netflix takeover.</p><p>The US department of justice (DOJ) has launched a review into the deal amid concerns that combining two major streaming services – Netflix and HBO Max – would hand the company too much power.</p><p>Netflix has shrugged off concerns, saying the deal would lead to lower overall streaming costs for consumers. However, it has acknowledged that the regulatory process could take up to 18 months.</p><p>Paramount, which would also face regulatory scrutiny, last week said it had cleared a key hurdle with the DOJ.</p><p>Netflix has also faced criticism from the cinema industry amid fears the streaming giant could release fewer films on the big screen. James Cameron, the director of Avatar and Titanic, branded the deal “disastrous” in a letter this month.</p><p>Netflix has insisted it is committed to theatrical releases while Ted Sarandos, the co-chief executive, branded Mr Cameron’s comments “disingenuous”.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Foreign state ownership</h2><p>Meanwhile, Mr Sarandos has hit out at Paramount over significant levels of Middle Eastern funding in its bid and claimed that <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/23/foreign-ownership-media-companies-netflix-boss/\">foreign state ownership of media companies</a> is a “bad idea”.</p><p>The Netflix chief criticised the involvement of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar in Paramount’s bid, highlighting restrictions on free speech in the Gulf states.</p><p>Speaking to the BBC, he said: “I think it’s a bad idea typically to have several sovereign wealth funds in that Paramount deal. Again, a part of the world that is not very big on the First Amendment.”</p><p>The sovereign wealth funds of the three Gulf states are contributing $24bn to Paramount’s bid – twice the amount committed by the Ellison family. RedBird Capital, the US private equity fund that was the minority partner in a failed takeover bid for the Telegraph, is also funding the bid.</p><p>Paramount has insisted that the sovereign wealth funds will forgo any governance rights, including board seats.</p><p>But Mr Sarandos dismissed claims that the Middle Eastern states would have no influence over editorial output.</p><p>He said: “It seems very odd to me with the level of investment that we’re talking about that they’d have no influence or editorial control over media in another country.</p><p>Alongside regulatory concerns, both Netflix and Paramount must also contend with Donald Trump’s interventions in the deal.</p><p>The US president this week called on Netflix to sack Susan Rice, formerly a senior official in Barack Obama’s administration, from its board or “pay the consequences”.</p><p>Mr Sarandos played down concerns about political interference, saying: “This is a business deal, it’s not a political deal.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

They’re the ones that are investing the most into this.</p><p>“I do worry about having the nation’s intellect effectively outsourced. It’s not just that, either. It’s the productivity gains.</p><p>“If for every hour of cognitive work that you do there’s a machine doing what would take you 50 hours, how do you as a nation compete with that?</p><p>“Electricity multiplied the power of muscles and AI can do the same with brains in certain scenarios. But it’s almost like you, as Britain and Europe are outsourcing national IQ to US and Chinese tech companies.</p><p>“So you’re left trying to regulate something you don’t own. And I do worry about that. I think of it as cognitive border control.”</p><p>Mulvany is better placed than most to sound the alarm. An eerily youthful 57 who betrays his Hawaiian roots with a surf-ready hairdo, he is an entrepreneur who has seen <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/16/the-endless-iou-powering-silicon-valleys-latest-tech-boom/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tech boom and bust</a> more than once.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>In a world increasingly haunted by visions of an AI apocalypse that would make the dotcom crash look like a minor market setback, Mulvany and Benevolent have already been tested to near-destruction.</p><p>The <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/09/17/woodford-patient-capital-takes-writedown-benevolent-ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">technology excited investors</a> – including the star fund manager Neil Woodford long before his self-inflicted implosion – enough to snag a £1.5bn valuation way back in 2018.</p><p>This was long before the likes of Sam Altman of OpenAI and Dario Amodei of Anthropic emerged to seek thrones as the next generation of tech plutocrats.</p><p>Benevolent sought to help researchers to quickly design new drugs with computer assistance, using machine learning techniques to scour a treasure trove of science information for possibilities at an unprecedented clip. Expansion into defence and energy markets promised new horizons and riches.</p><p>It seemed to work. Benevolent burst onto the public markets long before the current AI frontrunners had attracted the attention of everyday investors, too. With the world still in the grip of the pandemic and having discovered an anti-inflammatory that was proving useful on pandemic wards, the start-up made a splashy debut.</p><p>“I wasn’t really part of it at that time,” Mulvany recalls ruefully. Having seemingly set up Benevolent for enormous success, he was already easing into semi-retirement.</p><p>As it secured a lucrative listing in Amsterdam, Benevolent won endorsement and investment from some of the pharmaceutical industry’s biggest names. AstraZeneca backed Benevolent as part of a transaction that raised hundreds of millions.</p><p>Alas, Mulvany’s big payday and exit did not set the scene for a sustainable company. A starry board and big executive hires steered Benevolent off a cliff.</p><p>The company lost almost all its value within two years, prompting Mulvany to abandon his early retirement and mount a boardroom coup to take back control last year. He had become frustrated that Benevolent had shifted from his concept of a technology company to a drug developer in its own right, with all the risk and costs associated with it.</p><p>“They brought in some luminaries,” Mulvany recalls. “Some really heavy hitters from pharma. And Benevolent morphed from a tech company to a pharma company. For me as an investor, and for some of my fellow investors, we didn’t have the appetite for that. We were technology investors.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>“You had a technology shareholder base and a management and board doing biotech. All of its revenue was from its technology but it was spending a ton of money developing drugs.</p><p>“The technology cost was very low relative to drug development. So I became more of an activist shareholder at that point because it wasn’t going the way I wanted it to go and the markets reflected that too. It lost 95pc of its value.”</p><p>It’s a tale of hype meeting with financial and scientific reality that now seems to be playing out on an extreme scale as OpenAI and its rivals test the limits of pre-profit funding and investor patience. Altman alone has committed to spending more than $1tn (£750bn).</p><p>Having abandoned his retirement to mount his successful coup, Mulvany is now rebuilding Benevolent as an enterprise software company. Its new software and services are focused sharply on helping drug developers, rather than developing drugs. It’s a more commercial proposition, with a closer eye on returns for Benevolent and its big pharma customers.</p><p>“We help on the science side of things, reviewing the literature, but also how you make business decisions as a drug developer, how you expand into a particular market, how you design trials and all of that.</p><p>“People in the industry are making decisions with a fraction of the information they need.”</p><p>These are still the early days of Benevolent’s attempted comeback and Mulvany’s unexpected return from early retirement, which he had intended to spend skiing. His hopes of using the company’s targeted AI technology beyond drug discovery in fields such as defence and energy have been revived.</p><p>Benevolent, without revenue, now has the cash and investor support to pursue its new business into 2027, according to Mulvany.</p><p>Despite the mounting fears of an AI bust, he remains a believer in the technology. After a deep cull of staff, Benevolent’s coders are 50 times faster with the help of computer intelligence, for instance. But Mulvany, now an AI survivor, admits a shake-out lies ahead for those with grandiose visions.</p><p>“I saw this in the dotcom. I was there right at the bubble. But whether it’s railroads, or electricity or the internet there has always been over-investment and hype.</p><p>“So there’s going to be losers in this but the infrastructure is being put in place. So yeah, you’re seeing an AI bubble, but I’ve seen it before.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

The Prime Minister hailed the financing as a deal that would help to support British jobs back home.</p><p>But the announcement follows a <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/06/astrazeneca-threatens-to-stop-investing-in-britain/\">period of frosty relations</a> between the Government and AstraZeneca which has seen the drugmaker threaten to halt investment in Britain in a row over NHS pricing.</p><p>The pharmaceutical giant, which is <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/29/astrazeneca-strengthens-ties-to-america-in-listing-shake-up/\">Britain’s biggest listed company</a>, has abandoned plans for a £200m expansion of its Cambridge research site and £450m overhaul of its Liverpool vaccine factory.</p><p>The deal may also raise eyebrows given that five of AstraZeneca’s staff were detained by authorities in China in 2024 amid claims of potential illegal activity. The president of its China division was subsequently placed under investigation by local police, with no further details provided.</p><p>Astra is the largest drugs company in China, which is the company’s second-biggest market after the US.</p><p>Separately, AstraZeneca also announced on Friday that it had struck a deal worth as much as $18.2bn with China’s CSPC Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Under the tie-up, AstraZeneca will have the global rights to sell CSPC’s obesity drugs outside China.</p><p>CSPC is currently developing once-monthly weight-loss jabs.

It will be focused on sites in Bejing, Shanghai, Wuxi, Taizhou and Qingdao.</p><p>Sir Keir said: “Unlocking opportunities for British businesses across the globe and delivering for working people back home is always the driving force behind my international engagements.</p><p>“AstraZeneca’s expansion and leadership in China will help the British manufacturer continue to grow – supporting thousands of UK jobs.”</p><p>Astra has been <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/11/06/britain-losing-access-worlds-best-drugs-warns-astrazeneca/\">at loggerheads with the Government</a> over how much the NHS pays for medicines.</p><p>The company and its rivals have argued that the way the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) evaluates “value for money” on medicines is flawed and deprives patients of potential breakthrough treatments.</p><p>For instance, Nice previously rejected Enhertu, Astra’s breast cancer drug.</p><p>Wes Streeting, the Health Secretary, walked away from talks with drugmakers last summer after failing to strike an agreement.</p><p>But in December, ministers announced a new deal with the US that saw Nice agree to pay up to 25pc more for treatments, a move aimed at protecting the UK life sciences industry.</p></div></div></div></div>",

More high-profile casualties are expected in the coming weeks.</p><p>Amid the continued hollowing out of town centres, one high street stalwart remains: Boots.</p><p>Outposts of the lipstick-to-prescriptions business can still be found across the country, but many are in a sad state. After its exit from the stock market in 2007, Boots has spent the last two decades being starved of investment.</p><p>With serial dealmaker <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/30/boots-biggest-problem-is-now-its-billionaire-owner/\">Stefano Pessina leading the charge, Boots has been allowed to dwindle</a> – first under the ownership of private equity’s original Barbarians at the Gate, KKR, then as a forgotten overseas outpost of American pharmacy giant Walgreens.</p><p>Now Boots is in the hands of another private equity house, Sycamore Partners, after the New York-based outfit took Walgreens off the public markets last summer. Employees must fear yet more decline.</p><p>However, a shake-up at the very top of the company may signal a revival for one of Britain’s best-loved and most important retailers.</p><p>After leading the pharmacy giant for almost a decade, Boots chief executive Ornella Barra is stepping down to become chair. She replaces Pessina, who is also her business partner and husband, and is believed to still own half of the business at the ripe age of 84.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>At the same time, managing director Anthony Hemmerdinger is being handed a much bigger role running Boots, including oversight of the No7 beauty brand – long regarded as one of several jewels in the stable.</p><p>The management reshuffle is viewed internally, and in the City, as another major step towards setting Boots free from its ownership purgatory and returning it to the UK stock market.</p><p>City sources said a float is still the main long-term ambition of the owners, and more likely to occur next year than in 2026.</p><p>A former executive said a spin-off of Boots “was always the plan” and the boardroom changes were “a step towards that”. The break-up of Walgreens into five standalone entities – Boots among them – shortly after its <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/03/07/boots-bought-by-us-private-equity-in-10bn-deal/\">£8bn takeover last year</a> was seen as the first real step.</p><p>The prospect of Boots being groomed for a spectacular public markets comeback under new leadership will raise hopes of a long overdue makeover of its unloved shops. Shoppers will be hoping that it also means a halt to any further closures.</p><p>The sale to Sycamore came after Boots axed 300 stores across the UK, drastically reducing its footprint from 2,200 to around 1,900 branches. <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/07/10/ailing-boots-searches-way-back-health/\">Boots also shut 48 opticians in 2020</a>, and had kickstarted a store closure plan the previous year that ended with more than 200 outlets being given the chop.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The status of Boots as more than just your typical bog-standard retailer means its future garners more attention than others.</p><p>Armed with Britain’s best-selling skincare brand No 7, the chain believes it can continue to compete in the booming beauty market despite the excitement surrounding the arrival of <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/events/went-shopping-uks-first-branch-sephora-does-live-hype/\">LVMH-backed French phenomenon Sephora in Britain</a>, as well as other upstarts.</p><p>Amid the glamour of expensive lipstick and eyelash-thickening mascara, it is easy to forget that Boots is an integral part of the country’s healthcare system. Without its sprawling network of pharmacists, thousands of people would struggle to get their vital medicines and daily pills.</p><p>Its last round of store closures was accompanied by an apologetic statement explaining that the decision was “not taken lightly” and that in all cases there was an alternative store less than three miles away.</p><p>Yet that didn’t prevent an outcry in some affected towns, with locals complaining about being forced to endure long queues at other pharmacies, which in some cases had led to delays in getting their prescriptions.</p><p>Boots bosses have long rejected the portrayal of a business stuck in retreat as lazy and outdated.</p><p>“The Boots Group is in great shape, both financially and operationally, with Boots UK having grown market share for 19 consecutive quarters,” Barra said as she stepped aside.</p><p>But that fact masks the two-speed nature of the business. A former executive said there are around 500 Boots shops that are “the powerhouse of the business” – the vast majority of which have already been revamped.</p><p>However, the rest are much smaller shops, which are vital to the surrounding communities but cost “between £50,000 and £100,000” to refurbish with no resulting “uplift” in turnover, making it hard to justify the outlay.</p><p>“Pharmacies are really difficult to make money in now, because of what the Government pays per prescription,” another ex-director said. In November, the Department of Health and Social Care announced that NHS prescription charges would be frozen for the second year running.</p><p> Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, adds: “There has been immense profiling of a small number of new and modernised stores, gaining lots of capital expenditure and senior management attention, to show the newfound vitality of Boots.</p><p>“But the reality is that many Boots are drab, under-invested, and needing of an injection of elevated execution that British shoppers will notice across the board.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Those who know the business well say Boots branches need to become even bigger healthcare hubs, so that they can alleviate pressure on local GPs by providing more of the services that you would usually go to your doctor for.</p><p>The chain already does private online doctor consultations, vaccinations and blood pressure checks, as well as specialised treatments for skin and hair loss. However, it is eyeing a larger role in diagnostics with “at-home” testing kits for conditions such as high cholesterol, vitamin deficiencies and food intolerances. These will be offered under the mantra of standing “shoulder to shoulder with the NHS”.</p><p>If the move is successful, it would justify spending more capital on its smaller stores, many of which struggle to turn a profit.</p><p>The former executive says: “The mantra…was always ‘We’re going to have a great Boots in every major town, and none that we’re ashamed of.’ I think that will continue.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

Diageo also makes Smirnoff and Johnnie Walker.</p><p>A decline in drinking will add to pressure on Britain’s pubs, as they also grapple with tax raids and changing attitudes towards alcohol among young people.</p><p>Sir Dave Lewis, the new boss of Diageo, said: “These fewer serves per occasion point to a pressure in the economics that our consumer groups are facing.”</p><p>He added: “What you see is a very significant squeeze on disposable income.”</p><p>Sir Dave, the former boss of Tesco who was hired at the start of this year, said reinvigorating Diageo’s relationships with pubs and bars was one of his key priorities to turn around the struggling drinks maker.</p><p>He said the “on-trade” segment of its business – meaning sales into bars, restaurants, hotels and pubs – had been “dismantled understandably during Covid” but warned its “buildback has been slow and patchy”.</p><p>He was speaking as Diageo slashed its dividend in half, with Sir Dave adding there remained “significant work ahead” after he was forced to cut the company’s sales forecast.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Diageo reported a 2.8pc drop in underlying operating profits to $3.3bn (£2.4bn) in its half-year results as underlying sales also fell 2.8pc.</p><p>Sir Dave made the “difficult decision” to cut the dividend from 40.5 cents per share last year to 20 cents and ramped up cost savings to boost its flagging performance.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The prompt action helped the seasoned executive live up to his nickname “Drastic Dave”, earned during his three decades at consumer goods giant Unilever where he oversaw a programme of brutal but effective cost cuts.</p><p>However, the cost-saving plan and the weak sales wiped more than £5bn off Diageo’s market valuation on the London Stock Exchange, as shares fell by 13pc on their worst day ever.</p><p>The drinks giant also downgraded its full-year guidance for the second time in three months, with sales now expected to fall by between 2pc and 3pc because of ongoing troubles in the US. Profits are predicted to be flat or to rise by low single digits.</p><p>Sir Dave, who led a turnaround at Tesco from 2014 to 2020, said he was working on an updated strategy for Diageo, which he said he will unveil in the summer.</p><p>He was appointed at Diageo after a lengthy search for a successor to Debra Crew, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/07/16/even-the-guinness-craze-could-not-save-the-boss/\">who left in July following a rocky period of slipping sales</a> and struggles to communicate a vision to both the board and market.</p><p>After performing strongly amid the rise of home drinking during the pandemic, Diageo has faced a cocktail of pressures in recent years. The company pivoted towards higher-end spirits and has battled shifting attitudes towards drinking.</p><p>More than a third of young people aged between 16 and 24 are shunning alcohol, the Health Survey for England revealed this year.</p><p>However, Guinness has attracted many new drinkers from Gen Z – driven by social media trends and <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/01/30/guinness-sales-surge-young-women-drink/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">growing popularity among young women</a>.</p><p>On TikTok, trends such as “splitting the G”, where Guinness drinkers seek to down enough of their pint so the head of the beer bisects the company’s logo, have helped the brand go viral.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The Princess of Wales and Kim Kardashian are fans, and the company was forced to deny reports last year that it could capitalise on its popularity with a sale.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘Significant opportunities ahead’</h2><p>Sir Dave said: “Only several weeks in I can already see significant opportunities for Diageo to act more decisively to enhance its competitiveness and broaden the portfolio offering leading to higher growth.</p><p>“To deliver on these opportunities, we need to create more financial flexibility.</p><p>“Accordingly, the board has taken the difficult decision to reduce the dividend to a more appropriate level which will accelerate the strengthening of our balance sheet.</p><p>“We are confident that this is the right action which will ensure that Diageo can reinforce its position as the leading international spirits business and drive stronger shareholder value over the coming years.”</p><p>John Moore, of wealth manager RBC Brewin Dolphin, said Diageo’s results “reflect a company navigating near-term headwinds while positioning for longer-term recovery”.</p><p>“The headline might feel cautious this morning, but the real story will be in how Sir David Lewis articulates the path forward.”</p><p>Simon Hales, a Citi analyst, said the decision to more than half the dividend had “taken the shine off” the results, which could have “been seen as the clearing event for the stock to rally”.</p></div></div></div></div>",

Netflix will then have four business days to make its own counter offer.</p><p>It raises the prospect of a potentially intense takeover battle for Warner Bros, following a months-long pursuit of the studio by both bidders.</p><p>Paramount’s stock rose just more than 1pc in after-hours trading. Netflix shares also rose 1.2pc. Warner Bros Discovery shares edged down 0.8pc on the added uncertainty about any deal.</p><p>A shareholder vote on the deal is set for March 20.</p><p>Netflix has agreed to pay $27.75 per share for Warner Bros’s studio business – which is behind hits such as Harry Potter, and the HBO Max streaming service, known for Succession. Paramount’s bid also includes the studio’s traditional cable channels, such as CNN.</p><p>Paramount has stressed the regulatory risks of Netflix’s bid. The US department of justice has launched a review of the deal amid concerns that combining two major streaming services – Netflix and HBO Max – would hand the company too much power.</p><p>Netflix has downplayed concerns, though it acknowledged that the review could drag for a year and a half.</p><p>For its part, Netflix has <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/23/foreign-ownership-media-companies-netflix-boss/\">criticised the involvement</a> of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar in Paramount’s bid, highlighting restrictions on free speech in the Gulf states.

The overall pool of bonuses also increased by 10pc to $3.9bn, the highest in at least a decade.</p><p><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/12/11/new-hsbc-boss-slash-2bn-costs-under-radical-overhaul/\">Georges Elhedery</a>, HSBC’s chief executive, said: “We are building a high-performance culture. It’s a culture where talent succeeds. It’s a culture where talent and performance are better rewarded and differentiated in the way we reward them.”</p><p>At the same time, HSBC reportedly intends to withhold bonuses entirely from its poorer performing staff, as it moves towards an “eat-what-you-kill” stance similar to its competitors in the US. Awarding bankers a dreaded “doughnut” – zero bonus – is seen in the industry as a humiliation.</p><p>In an attempt to improve performance and shake up the culture at the 160-year-old bank, Mr Elhedery has been swinging the axe.</p><p>The banking giant said it had cut the ranks of managing directors by 15pc over the last year, helping it meet a £1.1bn cost-cutting programme half a year early.</p><p>Many of <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/03/13/hsbc-puts-bankers-on-gig-economy-contracts-amid-scramble/\">the job losses</a> have come from the combination of HSBC’s commercial banking, global banking and markets businesses last year. The merger led to a number of duplicated roles being axed.</p><p>Mr Elhedery, who was handed £6.62m in 2025, up from £5.58m last year, announced cost-cutting plans last year that included an 8pc reduction in payroll costs.</p><p>In total, HSBC’s employee numbers fell from 221,000 to just over 218,000 over the last year. However, pay and benefits rose from $20.2bn to $21.5bn over the same period.</p><p>The bank’s full-year results showed a pre-tax profit of $29.9bn for the year. That analysts’ estimate of $28.9bn was down 7pc compared to the prior year.</p><p>Shares in the bank rose more than 5pc on the FTSE 100.</p><p>Since taking over as chief executive, Mr Elhedery has led a radical restructuring of the bank. Along with cutting staff numbers and merging divisions, he has also <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/01/28/hsbc-slashes-investment-bank-to-focus-on-china/\">doubled down on his predecessors’ focus on Asia</a>.</p><p>The bank has shuttered some of its banking divisions in the US, the UK and Continental Europe and has taken private its troubled Hong Kong subsidiary Hang Seng Bank, as it looks to benefit from growth in the Asian financial hub.</p><p>Its business in Hong Kong saw revenue rise by 6pc to $15.9bn, while its UK division saw revenue rise by 5pc to $12.9bn.</p></div></div></div></div>",

Yet the comically late arrival of Britain’s regulator is the equivalent of sending in Dad’s Army.</p><p>Responsibility for the fiasco that has unfolded ultimately resides with South East Water’s equally inept, overpaid chief executive Dave Hinton and the board of nodding dog directors who have somehow seen fit to allow him to remain in post.</p><p>But for an enforced and humiliating appearance in front of a parliamentary committee of senior MPs, Hinton has been completely missing in action throughout this debacle.</p><p>Nor is this catalogue of failures a one-off. Under its current boss, South East Water has a thoroughly woeful track record of failing in its basic duty to keep the taps running for 2.3 million customers in Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire and Berkshire.</p><p>This is the second officially-declared major incident in South East Water territory in as many months, with customers in Tunbridge Wells, Kent still facing disruption after weeks. Thousands of households were also hit by shortages in 2022 and 2023.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>As my colleague Patrick Galbraith and I point out in a separate piece <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/01/15/the-towns-where-the-taps-ran-dry/\">for The Telegraph</a>, South East Water is well on its way to claiming the crown of Britain’s worst utility from industry basket case Thames Water, which really does take some doing given its current sorry state.</p><p>Mr Hinton should have been shown the door long ago, but he’s being kept in post by the company’s unforgivably meek independent directors, led by equally absentee chairman Chris Train, who knows a thing or two about companies that fall short.</p><p>Train is also the chairman of Sellafield, which was fined for serious cybersecurity failings in 2024. The following year, the Commons Public Accounts Committee (Pac) criticised the nuclear power plant for “failure, cost-overruns and continuing safety concerns.”</p><p>Yet, the idea that Ofwat’s intervention will make much of a difference really is the stuff of fantasy.</p><p>Britain is awash with dire regulators who are meant to protect consumers from cowboy firms. The Financial Conduct Authority was branded “incompetent at best, dishonest at worst”, by MPs and peers in 2024.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pac found in 2022 that failures at Ofgem had come “at a considerable cost to billpayers” after the collapse of a staggering 29 energy suppliers in less than 18 months.</p><p>The only regulator that has shown some bite is the Competition and Markets Authority. And its reward for standing up for consumers? A thorough defanging at the hands of ministers who claimed it had become an impediment to economic growth.</p><p>Otherwise, in a crowded field, Ofwat must be a contender for the most ineffective industry policeman of all time. It is a watchdog that has repeatedly demonstrated little, if any, willingness to properly hold the industry to account, as South East knows only too well from considerable experience.</p><p>The vast bulk of Britain’s waterways have become a public health emergency, and water shortages are now commonplace – the result of extreme underinvestment in the country’s decrepit pipes and sewers by an industry that has routinely prioritised generous executive pay and investor dividends.</p><p>On every conceivable measure and metric, companies have been failing consumers on a grand scale for years.</p><p>Ultimately, the buck stops with greedy, irresponsible suppliers and shareholders. Yet, years of regulatory apathy have allowed something as basic and fundamental as the provision of drinking water to be turned into a giant and lucrative experiment in financial engineering at the expense of customers.</p><p>On the occasions when Ofwat does act, it’s like watching a snail wake up from a coma.</p><p>South East Water is already the subject of a regulatory investigation – one dating back to 2023 that still hasn’t been resolved – so what chance of a quick verdict?</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>As <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/01/14/major-south-east-water-shareholder-extremely-concerned/\">Mike Martin</a>, the MP for Tunbridge Wells, points out: “It’s obvious that South East Water has breached the terms of the license.”</p><p>In the face of Ofwat’s impotence, is it any wonder the company has been getting away with it for ages?</p><p>Four major outages have been racked up on Hinton’s watch, and South East Water has ranked in the bottom three companies for disruptions every year since he took over.</p><p>2023 was particularly shocking, with the company recording the most interruptions and outages of any supplier in England and Wales.</p><p>Meanwhile, South East has failed to meet more than 40pc of its targets every year for the last three years. Last year, just 13 of its 38 annual targets were hit. Unsurprisingly, Ofwat penalties of a few million pounds here and there have had little effect.</p><p>Financially, it is a mess, too. Total losses since 2022 stand at £130m, the result of profits being consistently wiped out by the cost of servicing £1.3bn of borrowings. </p><p>At times, debt interest and dividends have eclipsed the money that has been spent mending leaky pipes and other vital infrastructure.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Hinton, meanwhile, has earned nearly £2.3m since taking charge in 2020 and is in line for a 30pc pay rise, plus a £400,000 long-term “service bonus” regardless of performance. Talk about reward for failure.</p><p>It is an untenable situation that has long been crying out for a supervisor with real mettle.</p><p>Lynn Parker, senior director for enforcement at Ofwat, is right to say that “the last six weeks have been miserable for businesses and households across Kent and Sussex” – but why did it take so long for Ofwat to do anything?</p><p>Even now, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that Ofwat only acted because Emma Reynolds, the Environment Secretary, had called publicly for it to step in.</p><p>While the regulator has dithered, senior MPs, together with Martin, have done a brilliant job of holding Hinton and colleagues to account.</p><p>Ofwat, on the other hand, is hard to take seriously. The threat of penalties, including the annulment of South East’s licence, is somewhat hollow to say the least, given the Government’s plans to abolish Ofwat, the Drinking Water Inspectorate and the Environment Agency, and replace it with a single water regulator responsible for the entire water system.</p><p>It is a welcomed move. Long-suffering customers deserve better and the disbanding of the current abject regime is a rare opportunity to create a watchdog with genuine clout. Labour cannot afford to get it wrong.</p></div></div></div></div>",

This is far lower than 200,000 tonnes brought ashore annually by the UK fleet, with much of Britain’s mackerel exported to France and Spain.</p><p>The UK also currently allows foreign vessels, such as Norwegian boats, to catch mackerel in British waters, which contributes to overfishing.</p><p>Almost all of Waitrose’s mackerel is sourced from Scotland.</p><p>While sales of fresh fish have stagnated in recent years, demand for tinned fish is rising. Brands such as Ortiz and Sea Sisters have proved popular with Gen Z and millennials thanks to their retro packaging and striking logos.</p><p><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2026/01/01/waitrose-withdraws-bottled-water-may-contain-glass/\">Waitrose said it would promote</a> smoked herring, smoked peppered herring and smoked sea bass as mackerel alternatives.</p><p>The supermarket will also introduce frozen sardines in May as a sustainable replacement for frozen mackerel.</p></div></div></div></div>",

It stars Marisa Abela, Kit Harington and Myha’la.</p><p>The complaint relates to an episode in the latest series that depicts two characters – Sweetpea Golightly and Harper Stern – pretending to be ONS officials to gain access to a house in Sunderland where they believe someone is inadvertently committing fraud on behalf of a major payments company.</p><p>The ONS conducts regular surveys using a team of thousands of field interviewers who visit homes to gather data for the public body.</p><p>Tina Thomas, an ONS official, said in a blog post accompanying the letter that interviewers gave advance notice of their visits and carried official ID.</p><p>She added that while staff were allowed to choose their own work attire, it was “unlikely they’ll turn up on your doorstep ... looking like a flight attendant”.</p><p>The backlash comes as the ONS <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/08/troubled-ons-reveals-2bn-borrowing-blunder/\">faces scrutiny</a> over the reliability of its data.</p><p>The statistics body has faced repeated criticism, including from the Bank of England, over mistakes including miscalculating inflation and overstating government borrowing by £2bn. It has also come under fire over how it collects population data, especially in areas such as gender identity and migration.</p><p>A government review last summer concluded that “deep-seated” issues had to be addressed before the statistics agency could rebuild its reputation. The review found that the blunders were in part a result of statisticians working from home.</p><p>The ONS acknowledged that there had been a sharp decline in survey response rates in recent years, which it blamed in part on fears of fraud such as the kind depicted in Industry.</p><p>Ms Thomas insisted that survey collection for the ONS had “no overlap with the backstabbing and high-pressure world of Industry”, but she added: “That’s not to say field interviewing doesn’t have its exciting moments.”</p><p>The BBC was contacted for comment.</p></div></div></div></div>",

The framework comprises 30 members.</p><p>The decision to stop customers cashing in cheques at Post Office counters comes despite the lender announcing 95 more bank branch closures, in addition to 49 already earmarked to shut this year.

Please be assured of my determination, and that of my teams, to support you over the long term. I would like to thank you once again for your trust.”</p><p>Sources claimed the climate was “extremely tense” inside the bank, which managed around 184bn Swiss francs (£175bn) between its private banking and asset management arms in 2024.</p><p>One client said: “If the bank is affected legally or financially, that puts me at risk. If management accepted or overlooked this type of association, how can integrity be guaranteed?”</p><p>In her letter, Baroness de Rothschild, who has a personal fortune estimated at €5.3bn (£4.62bn), insisted that her private exchanges with Epstein were “made public without context or chronology,” adding that the release included “elements that are clearly false or altered”.</p><p>She explained that the pair were introduced in 2013 by Terje Rod Larsen, a Norwegian former deputy prime minister, who she said was “internationally recognised at the time for his role in the Oslo Accords”.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Referring to Epstein, Baroness de Rothschild added: “This introduction took place in a context when he was regarded as an influential businessman among senior international decision-makers and officials.”</p><p>The files released by the US justice department have shed light on the international and powerful web of influence the financier had established in his lifetime, ranging from top politicians to the global glitterati.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The latest release of three million documents in late January showed Baroness de Rothschild <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2026/02/06/epstein-helped-end-feud-between-warring-rothschild-cousins/\">consulting Epstein repeatedly and on a range of topics</a>, including asking his advice to help navigate a private legal battle with other members of her family as well as to allegedly complain about her late husband, Benjamin.</p><p>She became a member of one of Europe’s most prominent banking dynasties after her marriage in 1999, and took over as sole manager of the family business <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/12/17/secret-art-gallery-centre-rothschild-family-feud-geneva/\">following de Rothschild’s death in 2021</a>, aged 57, from a heart attack.</p><p>One email exchange between her and Epstein, dated the day after Britain voted to leave the European Union, she remarked: “We both know why we so dislike the Brits ! What a mess ! At least, we’ll keep trading volatility for a while.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘Bring the girls’</h2><p>Another in 2017 showed Epstein asking the mother-of-four whether her daughters had the “HPV [Human Papillomavirus] shots,” saying he has “all the assitants [sic] get a full health check”, to which she responded that they did.</p><p>In another, he urged her to “bring the girls” – likely a reference to her four daughters – <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2025/12/03/epstein-island-photos-released-little-st-james/\">to his Little Saint James island</a>, and informed her about a trip to Cuba, which he said he was organising for November 2017. They frequently coordinated diaries and timings for potential meet-ups around the globe and conversations over the phone.</p><p>In the letter to clients, she added that she and her daughters had been “deeply hurt and shocked by the scandalous accusations directed at us, particularly on social media”.</p><p>She went on: “The violence of certain shortcuts and unfounded accusations contributes to a climate one might have thought belonged to another time.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The banker explained that Epstein facilitated introductions for her and that she “discovered the reality and extent of the crimes committed by J.

Epstein.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Being in the files is no indication of wrongdoing and the private bank has previously stated that Epstein was a business acquaintance of Baroness de Rothschild from 2013-2019.</p><p>An Edmond de Rothschild spokesman told The Telegraph: “Inflows have remained particularly strong since the beginning of the year.</p><p>“This will be clear when we announce our results in March. The bank will announce results that will confirm its growth momentum and its financial strength.</p><p>“Regarding the letter that has been sent to you, it was part of a transparent, natural and proactive communication with our clients, given the legitimate questions they might have had following the publication of various articles and content on social media mentioning the professional relationship between J.

The loan guarantee was personally endorsed by Tim Reid, the chief executive of UK Export Finance Agency (UKEF), who said he was “proud” to support Hive.</p><p>It is the second such loan offered to Hive Energy, following a similar guarantee for a £19m loan from Santander taken out in 2024.</p><p>This week Hive issued a “notice of intention to appoint administrators” with law firm DLA Piper as its legal advisors. The move suggests the company – which has 200 renewables projects in its global pipeline, 15 of which are in the UK – is at risk of collapse.</p><p>It also raises the threat that taxpayers could be on the hook for loan repayments, and questions about the quality of UKEF’s vetting of Hive before approving the latest loan.</p><p>When asked by The Telegraph if taxpayer money was at risk, the UKEF and Mr Reid declined to comment.</p><p>HSBC and Santander banks also both declined to comment.</p><p>Hive Energy, which was founded by city entrepreneur and ocean racing yachtsman Giles Redpath, confirmed that it was suffering problems with creditors linked to its subsidiary Ethical Power, which constructs and operates <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/energy/solarpower/10136576/Push-for-solar-power-that-could-cover-a-hundred-Olympic-parks.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">solar and other renewables sites</a> across the UK, Spain, Italy, Greece and New Zealand.</p><p>A spokesman said: “This process does not mean that the business has entered administration or that it will enter administration, but rather provides time and stability to explore strategic options in an orderly manner.</p><p>“This is not a decision to cease trading, and it does not change our day-to-day operations or the ongoing development of our projects.”</p><p>Hampshire-based Hive Energy was founded by Mr Redpath, a former telecoms entrepreneur, in 2010 to exploit the surging interest in solar and other renewable energy.</p><p>The latest accounts, covering the year to March 2024, describe Hive as operating in 20 different countries through 180 subsidiary companies – most of which are linked to particular renewables projects.</p><p>Its UK projects include the Cleve Hill solar park, the UK’s largest operational solar and battery storage facility on marshes on Kent’s north coast prized by locals as a wildlife refuge.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Mr Redpath is also the driving force behind the $5.8bn (£4.2bn) Hive Hydrogen project in South Africa, as well as similar large-scale hubs in Spain and Chile. These projects aim to produce green ammonia for the global shipping and fertiliser industries.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Piling losses and loans</h2><p>Company accounts from 2024, the last published, show Hive has two directors but that Mr Redpath has a majority shareholding.</p><p>The company made an operating loss of £29m in that year, but sold off assets worth £37m, paying the resulting dividends of about £7.4m to “a director, their wife and children”.</p><p>The same accounts state that Hive’s “directors and shareholders” had borrowed a further £7.2m from the company.</p><p>Outside the boardroom Mr Redpath is a renowned racing yachtsman, well-known for competing in races around the British Isles and across the Atlantic. In 2023, he commissioned a £5m racing multihull called Jack.</p><p>UKEF said last November it had guaranteed the £60m bank loan to Hive to help it scale up solar power projects across Europe, North America, the Caribbean, South America and Africa.</p><p>At the time, Mr Reid said: “We’re proud to continue supporting British businesses like Hive Energy, which reinforce the UK’s position as a leader in the global transition to clean energy.”</p><p>A Hive spokesman said: “Hive Energy is a long-term investor in the Ethical Power group of companies. That group has been undertaking a significant restructuring process.</p><p>“During this period, Hive (which has supported Ethical through both funding and guarantees) has experienced some creditor pressure in relation to several Ethical construction projects, creating a risk of enforcement action.”</p><p>The spokesman added: “In light of this, the Board of Hive has filed a Notice of Intention to appoint administrators to … provide a short period of statutory protection and stability.”</p><p>“Hive is a long-standing and fundamentally strong business and … continues to trade under the control of its existing Board and management team, as do all companies within the Hive Group.”</p><p>Ethical Power said: “Ethical Power is not affected by these actions as Hive Energy is a shareholder and not a parent/holding company. Ethical Power continues its operations, delivering projects and receiving payments from clients.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

But on Thursday, the region will plumb new depths in the quest to harness Britain’s natural resources.</p><p>For the first time, the United Downs deep geothermal power plant will start generating 24/7 electricity at a site near Redruth.</p><p>With an output of around three megawatts, enough to power roughly 10,000 homes, the plant cannot exactly be described as game-changing.</p><p>Yet experts believe it will help pave the way for similar projects across Britain aimed at tapping into the vast thermal resources below our feet.</p><p>The United Downs project, developed by Geothermal Engineering Ltd (GEL), will draw water at temperatures of around 190C from underground reservoirs that sit approximately five kilometres beneath the surface.</p><p>It takes advantage of a natural fault line using two wells, one that draws water up and one that pumps it back into the granite rock formations. Water that is brought above ground is run through a heat exchanger which uses another liquid with a lower boiling point to make steam and drive a turbine.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The result is power that <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/06/20/can-deep-geothermal-energy-help-to-solve-britains-net-zero/\">is nearly always on</a> – whatever the weather – save for short maintenance periods, says Ryan Law, the chief executive of GEL.</p><p>“Once you have done your drilling and the rest of it, the plant then runs 24/7 for about 96pc of the year,” he says.</p><p>In renewable energy, these kinds of numbers are virtually unheard of. Utility-scale solar tends to only push 25pc of the year while wind farms tend to land somewhere between 20pc and 40pc.</p><p>Meanwhile, thanks to modern breakthroughs in drilling technologies made by oil and gas fracking companies in the US, geothermal projects are also becoming cheaper to develop.</p><p>“There have been some quite big leaps forward,” says Law. “What has come from the last 10 years of developments in the US has very much enabled geothermal drilling to be performed faster and more precisely, while there’s much greater availability of rigs as well.</p><p>“That combination has helped to reduce the costs and it has made our sort of project, which is drilling down five kilometres into granite – pretty hard rock – much more feasible.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Like fracking, however, this kind of drilling can cause unnerving mini-earthquakes.</p><p>In Britain, ministers effectively outlawed fracking for oil and gas when they limited operations that create tremors of more than a 0.5 magnitude.</p><p>There are no such rules for geothermal, even though it has caused mini-tremors that were three times more powerful than this, with the industry instead regulated based on its surface vibrations. Law argues that this is more sensible because it measures the actual effects above ground.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Nevertheless, the results can still be scary. For two days in 2020, GEL induced 15 mini-quakes of magnitudes up to 1.5 as it was carrying out drilling at United Downs. Residents reported their windows rattled while some likened it to heavy thunderstorms.</p><p>To soothe concerns from nearby residents, GEL gave little “Raspberry Shake” seismographs – powered by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/21/ai-nerds-think-british-company-massively-undervalued/\">Raspberry Pi computers</a> – to local schools so that children and their families could learn about the project for themselves. Most have since accepted that the effects are harmless, Law claims.</p><p>“Because we’re the first one, not many people knew what on earth we were doing,” he says.</p><p>“Some people thought we were secretly drilling for oil and gas. Some thought we were secretly dumping nuclear waste. So we had to do an education programme about what seismicity is.”</p><p>United Downs is blazing a trail by generating power, but most experts think geothermal’s biggest potential is in heating and cooling.</p><p>The technology already provides the basis for domestic ground-source heat pumps.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Advocates believe it could be used on a much grander scale to heat entire city districts by tapping into underground reservoirs or even abandoned mine shafts that have been left filled with water.</p><p>The areas of biggest potential include Cornwall – where huge amounts of radioactive granite underground provide a massive, humming source of heat – as well as the North West of England, Scotland and Yorkshire.</p><p>“It varies across the UK by depth and by location, depending on the geology, but there is huge theoretical potential,” says Dr Alison Monaghan, the head of geothermal at the British Geological Survey (BGS).</p><p>The BGS has estimated the UK has about 200 exajoules of “accessible” geothermal heat – enough to meet the entire country’s heating demand for 100 years.</p><p>In some places, such as the Cheshire and Wessex basins, it is possible to extract heat by dredging up water trapped underground in spongy layers of sandstone and limestone and stripping out the heat before returning it.</p><p>Elsewhere, there is even more heat to be had from areas sitting atop granite such as Cornwall.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>“I’ve been doing this for about seven or eight years and there’s definitely been a huge increase in interest in geothermal energy recently,” says Monaghan.</p><p>“It’s driven by a number of factors, from the decarbonisation of heat to energy security.</p><p>“Geothermal is very decentralised – you don’t need a huge power station in one place. Instead, you can have different scales of geothermal energy in different places and so you’re kind of distributing your energy system.”</p><p>At United Downs, there is another more material attraction as well: The site is pioneering the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/03/10/the-uk-can-become-a-critical-minerals-superpower-if-we-dare/\">mining of lithium</a> – the metal known as “white gold”, which is used in batteries – through a new form of extraction from briny water.</p><p>The brine from the site boasts a lithium concentration of about 360 parts per million, among the highest rates in Europe.</p><p>This combination of power and mineral extraction has helped to make the scheme economically attractive – and also meant GEL was able to tap £1.8m in government support for critical mineral supply chains, along with a £119-per-megawatt-hour contract for difference.</p><p>The company is planning two other similar lithium and power projects nearby and expects them to have a combined output of almost 20,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate by 2030.</p><p>That is about one quarter of the upper demand estimate for the various battery gigafactories that have been announced around the country, including plants expected to serve carmakers Nissan and Jaguar Land Rover.</p><p>There are also hopes that rare earths could be produced there one day.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Fortunately for residents, though, Law says there will be no open pits or vast mine sites. The company’s only footprint is a low-lying production plant on an industrial estate.</p><p>“We don’t have to do any mining, we don’t have to do any digging, we don’t have to excavate,” he says. “The water is just full of lithium – and we’re just bringing bucket loads of the stuff to the surface every second.”</p><p>For this reason, along with the power being generated on site, he believes the project can remain price-competitive with foreign lithium producers.</p><p>Meanwhile, Octopus Energy, Britain’s biggest household electricity supplier, has already agreed to purchase power from the project.</p><p>If all of this was not already appealing enough for Ed Miliband, the Energy Secretary, Law says that geothermal has another potential bonus.</p><p>It relies heavily on the same expertise as Britain’s North Sea oil and gas industry, which critics have accused Mr Miliband of <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/24/miliband-north-sea-denmark-drill/\">hastening to an early grave</a>.</p><p>“Everything we have done subsurface used skill-sets, materials, steel and pumps from Aberdeen,” Law adds.</p><p>“So for us, it’s been a major advantage to have one of the best [oil and gas service] centres in the world within the UK because we have access to all of that.</p><p>“We obviously don’t want to see that industry go and we’d like to give people as many jobs as we can in our sector.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

In 2024, the UK exported around £6.6bn in pharmaceutical and medical products to the US.</p><p>The agreement includes a pledge for the NHS to increase the net price it pays for new medicines by 25pc, which will add around £3bn to the taxpayer’s £12bn annual medical spending bill. This will be phased in.</p><p>It follows weeks of uncertainty over the future of the industry. In August, the US president threatened to impose tariffs of up to 250pc on all pharmaceutical imports – including the UK.</p><p>In September, he said there would be 100pc tariffs on “any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product” coming into the US from October 1. At the time, he said companies could get an exemption if they had started building factories in the US.</p><p>While the White House has agreed to a spate of country-specific trade deals over the past year, pharma tariffs are expected to fall outside the scope of these agreements.</p><p>Under the new agreement, the NHS has also committed to slashing rebates that drug companies have to pay on sales of newer medicines to the health service.</p><p>The so-called Voluntary Scheme for Branded Medicines Pricing, Access and Growth (VPAG) is designed to cap the overall NHS drug bill but pharmaceutical companies have complained it has failed to keep pace with inflation.</p><p>Additionally, the deal means the UK will cut the rebate rate from 22.9pc to 15pc in 2026.</p><p>It is also understood that the Government will increase the threshold that determines which treatments are available on the NHS, boosting the spending cap on certain medicines and paving the way for more cutting-edge treatments to be introduced.</p><p>Drug giants have long complained over the decades-old formula used to determine whether medicines are deemed value for money, claiming this does not allow them to get the best new drugs into the NHS.</p><p>Jamieson Greer, the US trade representative, said: “For too long, American patients have been forced to subsidise prescription drugs and biologics in other developed countries by paying a significant premium for the same products in ours.</p><p>“Today, the United States and the United Kingdom announce this negotiated outcome pricing for innovative pharmaceuticals, which will help drive investment and innovation in both countries.”</p><p>He added: “The Trump Administration is reviewing the pharmaceutical pricing practices of many other US trading partners and hopes that they will follow suit with constructive negotiations.”</p><p>Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, said the deal would bring new jobs to America.</p><p>Mr Lutnick said: “This deal doesn’t just deepen our economic partnership with the United Kingdom – it ensures that the breakthroughs of tomorrow will be built, tested and produced on American soil.”</p><p>The White House has previously made clear its frustration over the lack of spending on innovative medicines in Britain. Currently, the UK spends just 0.28pc of its GDP on new medicines, roughly a third of what America does.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Britain previously pledged to <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/10/ministers-bow-to-trump-by-offering-to-pay-more-for-us-drugs/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">review the health service’s drug pricing</a> to take into account “the concerns of the president” under the UK-US trade deal struck in May.</p><p>Mr Trump has called for an end to overseas countries “freeloading” on American innovation, singling out Britain for a place where medicine prices are unfairly low compared to the US.</p><p>The US ambassador last month said Britain needed to change how it priced medicines or risk more global drug companies scrapping investments in the UK.</p><p>Merck, one of America’s largest drug companies, this year ditched plans to open a £1bn research centre in London, while AstraZeneca has paused £200m spending on its Cambridge research facility.</p><p>Liz Kendall, the Science and Technology Secretary, said the deal would “enable and incentivise life sciences companies to continue to invest and innovate right here in the UK”.</p><p>Chris Boerner, chief executive of Bristol Myers Squibb, said the trade agreement meant the pharmaceutical company will invest “upwards of $500m (£378m)” over the next five years.</p><p>Mr Boerner said: “This investment will come across multiple areas of the business including research, development and manufacturing.

What we are seeing instead is a decline on fast-forward. In a world of rising energy demand, tighter public finances and intense geopolitical competition, Britain cannot afford to treat oil and gas as a moral litmus test rather than a pragmatic bridge to net zero.</p><p>Instead of extracting maximum value from our remaining resources, we are turning a home-grown strategic asset into a political symbol. Closing it down is presented as <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/15/labour-net-zero-strategy-ripping-heart-out-britain/\">proof of seriousness on net zero</a>. Yet we will still rely on oil and gas for decades.</p><p>We require realism about the energy system and about the fuels already embedded within it. The real question is simple: do we produce what we need at home, supporting British jobs, revenues and energy security? Or do we import more from abroad?</p><p>In today’s volatile world, that choice matters more than ever. Energy is once again a source of national power.</p><p>The US is using <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/12/19/the-marvellous-prospect-of-cheap-energy-again/\">cheap domestic energy</a> to attract industry. Norway continues to develop its oil and gas while remaining a climate leader. Meanwhile, Britain is debating whether to shrink its own production faster than demand declines.</p><p>We should be accelerating electrification as fast as possible. Transport, heating and industry must move on to clean power. And the electricity system must expand rapidly to support that shift. That is the only credible route to net zero and energy security.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>But accelerating electrification does not mean pretending oil and gas will disappear overnight.</p><p>Start with the facts. Even under the Climate Change Committee’s most ambitious pathway, the UK will require 13 to 15 billion barrels of oil and gas between now and 2050. That would account for around 14pc of our energy supply.</p><p>Yet Britain is choosing dependency. We already import roughly half our oil and gas. Without fresh investment, that could rise to 80pc by 2030. By 2050, domestic production will meet only a fraction of what we still consume.</p><p>Even if we extracted every remaining viable barrel from the UK Continental Shelf – an estimated nine to 10 billion barrels – it would not meet projected demand. At best, we could cover around half our needs domestically. The rest would still be imported.</p><p>And imports themselves are not necessarily better. Gas shipped halfway around the world often has a higher carbon footprint than gas produced in UK waters.</p><p>The basin has been subjected to repeated short-term fiscal interventions – sudden tax rises, temporary levies and shifting allowances. The <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/30/labour-prepared-to-scrap-north-sea-windfall-tax-in-dash-for/\">windfall tax</a> has pushed headline rates to punishing levels, with some operators facing effective tax rates of more than 90pc.</p><p>The consequences are visible. Industry estimates suggest that £50bn of investment has been rejected or deferred under current conditions. Around 1,000 jobs are being lost every month across the sector. Capital is flowing elsewhere.</p><p>Yes, the levy raises revenue in the short term. But you cannot tax what is no longer produced. Accelerate decline and you shrink the future tax base, while bringing forward vast clean-up costs.</p><p>The UK faces between £40bn and £60bn in offshore decommissioning costs in the coming decades. Between £20bn and £30bn of that will ultimately fall to taxpayers through tax relief. Faster decline brings those bills forward while shrinking the revenue available to offset them.</p><p>Decline may be inevitable, but that doesn’t mean we should accelerate it. What the North Sea needs isn’t subsidy, but stability. A predictable fiscal framework would allow companies to invest, extend viable fields and manage decline responsibly.</p><p>That strengthens energy security, preserves skilled jobs and generates revenues to fund the transition.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>There is still significant value left. Industry estimates suggest billions of additional barrels could be unlocked under stable conditions, potentially adding more than £100bn in economic value. That supports communities, strengthens the balance of payments and helps finance the clean technologies of the future.</p><p>None of this weakens Britain’s commitment to net zero. The 2050 target must stand. Climate change is real and dangerous. But cutting domestic production faster than demand falls does not reduce global emissions. It simply shifts supply elsewhere.</p><p>Even under <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/17/miliband-miss-net-zero-targets-unless-spends-extra-75bn/\">Clean Power 2030</a>, substantial gas capacity will remain in the system to keep the lights on when the wind does not blow. Gas does not disappear because it’s politically inconvenient.</p><p>Using domestic resources pragmatically, while building nuclear and other firm low-carbon power, isn’t a retreat. It’s realism.</p><p>An energy strategy built on climate theatre will not endure. If electricity remains expensive, if industry relocates and if public consent fractures, climate policy will falter.</p><p>The North Sea isn’t a relic. It’s a strategic asset in managed decline. Used wisely, it can strengthen energy security, support jobs and generate revenues while we build the low-carbon system of the future.</p><p>Wind it down prematurely and we don’t eliminate demand. We export it.</p><hr/><p><em>Tone Langengen is senior energy policy adviser at the Tony Blair Institute</em></p></div></div></div></div>",

The extra expenses are mainly due to problems with electromechanical work: the wiring and plumbing needed around the reactors, which are now in place.</p><p>If that work hits further snags, project costs will rise by at least another £1bn, EDF has warned. Given inflation will push all these prices up, Hinkley’s final cost is now all but certain to exceed £50bn.</p><p>When first planned a decade ago, Hinkley C was predicted to cost £18bn and to start operations around 2025.</p><p>However, the project’s expenses has ballooned since then, as the delivery timeline has slipped.</p><p>EDF said the project would cost between £25bn and £26bn in 2024 and be delivered in 2027. The developer then warned that costs had risen again in 2024, and said that a four-year delay would not see the first reactor operating until at least 2029.</p><p>EDF now says the first reactor will not start generating until 2030 at the earliest.</p><p>The project has proven controversial for France’s state-owned generator as successive delays and cost overruns caused its debt to balloon.</p><p>The state-owned utility’s difficulties at Hinkley threaten to increase its financing needs as the company prepares to begin construction on six new reactors in France, while continuing to fund UK projects.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Added costs</h2><p>EDF is on the hook for the construction costs at Hinkley Point C, but the power it produces will be some of the UK’s most expensive at a predicted price of £150 per megawatt hour – well over double the market price.</p><p>The costs would have been higher still, but EDF was able to charge £1.6bn to the parallel <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/07/27/emotional-cost-clean-energy-sizewell-c-net-zero-suffolk/\">Sizewell C nuclear power project</a> for “Hinkley C project expertise”, meaning the transfer of lessons learnt at Hinkley to avoid similar costs and delays.</p><p>EDF is also involved in constructing the Sizewell C nuclear station, which is at a much earlier stage and is predicted to cost about £40bn. However, EDF has reduced its stake in that project to just 12.5pc, with the UK Government holding 44.9pc and most of the risk.</p><p>EDF runs the UK’s remaining fleet of five nuclear power stations, each with two reactors. Its accounts reveal that a fall in prices and a prolonged outage at one of its nuclear power stations dragged on UK profits last year.</p><p>The company said nuclear output from its five active power stations decreased by 12pc last year. Its Sizewell B facility in Suffolk and Torness in Scotland had a strong performance, but was hit by an extended outage at the Hartlepool power station in Durham.</p><p>The station, in Teesside, North East England, began generating power 43 years ago and provides enough electricity to power around two million homes. It was given a further one-year extension to generate electricity until March 2028, one year later than previously expected.</p><p>But outages affecting one of its two reactor systems were the main driver of EDF’s overall drop in nuclear output last year. The group’s net income fell to €8.4bn (£6.9bn)<strong> </strong>last year from €11.4bn in 2024.</p></div></div></div></div>",

It is starting to look a lot like the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. This time around, neither central banks nor governments may be able to contain the fallout.</p><p>It is never a good sign when a fund halts redemptions.</p><p>It typically means liquidity has dried up, and no one wants to buy their assets.</p><p>Blue Owl scrapped plans to allow investors to take cash from its $1.7bn (£1.3bn) fund, saying it would repay them in quarterly instalments instead.</p><p>Its shares fell sharply on the news, and so did those of the other big players in the industry.</p><p>Of course, loans run into trouble all the time. It does not always mean the world is about to end.</p><p>And yet this is hardly the first sign that cracks are starting to appear in the booming private credit industry.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Last year, the collapse of First Brands and Tricolor in the US sent shockwaves throughout the sector, triggering fears of widespread losses.</p><p>This led to Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/14/uk-unemployment-ons-trump-china-ftse-100-us-wall-street/\">warning of “cockroaches”</a> emerging across the market.</p><p>Likewise, in the wake of the Blue Owl update, Mohamed El Erian, an economist, pondered whether this was a “canary in the coalmine moment, similar to August 2007”.</p><p>The question is certainly worth asking.</p><p>In 2007, it was the move by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/03/05/city-lawyer-called-colleague-jabba-the-hutt-ordered-pay-30k/\">BNP Paribas</a> to suspend redemptions on three of its funds that exposed the rot in subprime lending, triggering the financial crash of the next year.</p><p>Could private credit go the same way? There are plenty of reasons to worry that it might.</p><p>Over the last decade, the private equity and asset management firms have pushed aggressively into what is effectively “shadow banking”.</p><p>They are taking the space once occupied by traditional banks, offering big loans to companies.</p><p>According to an analysis by Morgan Stanley, private credit has grown into a $3tn industry, with $1tn of that added in the last five years alone.</p><p>It is often very profitable, which explains why the industry has grown so dramatically over the last few years.</p><p>Interest rates are often 10pc or more, with another couple of percentage points in “arrangement fees”.</p><p>It is not hard to make money on that if the cost of capital is only 3pc or 4pc. The trouble is, it increasingly ticks all the boxes that identify a classic financial bubble.</p><p>The size of the exposure is often unknown.</p><p>The industry is lightly regulated, unlike traditional banking, which, in the aftermath of the 2008 crash, has had to stick to <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/15/labour-wont-resist-fresh-raid-bank-profits/\">far higher standards</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>No one knows how much has been lent to whom and on what terms.</p><p>Even worse, many of the loans may well be of low quality.</p><p>We saw that with the demise of First Brands, and we may see many more examples over the next few months and years.</p><p>It is hardly encouraging that Blue Owl was involved in the sale and <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/11/20/asda-sells-off-supermarkets-almost-600m/\">leaseback of a series of Asda stores</a>, a company that has been struggling to maintain market share in the brutally competitive British grocery market. Is that a safe investment?</p><p>Perhaps, but, to put it politely, you would hardly want to bet your last tenner on every last penny owed being paid in full.</p><p>The blunt truth is this. The US economy, where the bulk of the private credit loans have been made, is in robust health, and while European economies such as the UK are stagnant, they are not in recession.</p><p>When there is a serious downturn, as there surely will be one day, a lot of loans will turn sour. That is the way it always works.</p><p>In reality, investors are completely right to feel nervous about the private credit industry. Sure, it is far too early to say whether it is about to turn into a full-blown crash.</p><p>The credit management systems may have worked perfectly. Whatever losses are suffered may easily be paid for out of the profits on the loans that are perfectly good. Plus, sophisticated investors may well be patient enough to ride through any market turbulence and wait for their funds to open up again.</p><p>Likewise, the funds are run by smart people, and they may be clever enough to rein in the lending before it runs out of control. We will find out soon enough.</p><p>And yet if the private credit markets crack, and if Blue Owl turns out to be just one of many funds that have to halt redemptions, then the global economy will be in big trouble.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>In 2008, the central banks still had plenty of scope to cut interest rates to zero and to crank up the printing presses to keep the banking system liquid.</p><p>Governments had plenty of scope to take on more debt to rescue the banks that got into trouble.</p><p>None of that is true this time around. We have no idea whether rescuing Wall Street is part of the Maga playbook, nor would we have much confidence in Rachel Reeves “saving the world”, as Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling claimed they did 17 years ago.</p><p>The Blue Owl tremors may have subsided by the end of the month. But if they haven’t, then there will be big trouble ahead and it may well be impossible to stage a rescue.</p></div></div></div></div>",

The extra costs will be added to energy bills.</p><p>The disclosure was made in a review of the business case for Sizewell C published by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.</p><p>It is understood to be the first time Sizewell C’s power output has been costed. It refers to the so-called “strike price”, which is likely to be awarded to the nuclear power station under the contracts for difference system.</p><p>This is where generators get a guaranteed minimum price for electricity, whatever the market value.</p><p>The cost is then covered by a levy on consumer bills, meaning it effectively acts as an energy subsidy.</p><p>The new estimate of Sizewell C’s electricity prices will add to questions over the project, which is under construction on the Suffolk coast and which will be one of the UK’s largest and most expensive power stations. It is set to have an output of about 3.2 gigawatts with generation expected to start in about 13 years.</p><p>Nuclear supporters, including Ed Miliband, the Energy Secretary, have argued that <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/16/british-company-build-floating-nuclear-power-plant-pentagon/\">nuclear power</a> is worth the extra money because it acts as a secure energy source for decades – potentially a century in the case of Sizewell C.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>However, critics have raised concerns that prices for nuclear will continue to rise, arguing that early estimates for constructing power stations are always significant underestimates.</p><p>They have pointed to Sizewell C’s predecessor, Hinkley Point C, where original costs of £18bn have soared to £50bn – a figure <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/20/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-costs-rise-to-48bn/\">announced last week</a> – with start-up delayed from 2026 to 2031.</p><p>The Government report for Sizewell C said estimates assumed no escalation in costs, which would be a first for UK nuclear construction projects.</p><p>The report also warned that consumers were likely to be charged more than the £120 per MWh rate because the strike price was calculated net of all the tax, business rates and other payments to the Government.</p><p>Mr Miliband previously claimed the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/12/09/activists-nuclear-power-station-threat-rare-bird/\">Sizewell C project</a> would help to cut customers’ energy bills.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>When he approved the project last July, he said: “This Government is making the investment needed to deliver a new golden age of nuclear so we can end delays and free us from the ravages of the global fossil fuel markets to bring bills down for good.”</p><p>The report said <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/11/24/nuclear-power-boom-forced-through-environmental-red-tape/\">new nuclear capacity</a> was necessary “for a low cost, net zero-compliant energy system that can meet future demand for electricity”.</p><p>It said costs would also be lower than Hinkley Point C as “Sizewell will be a replica of the Hinkley design”.</p><p>“Many costs are avoided through replication, with minimal deviations from the design, products, intellectual property and expertise from the Hinkley project.</p><p>“Lessons learned from Hinkley will be applied and Sizewell will also benefit from supply chain experience at Hinkley. These efficiencies should significantly reduce the risk of cost and schedule overruns.”</p><p>However, some experts have rejected the claims, calling for clarity on how the Government report came up with its estimates.</p><p>Prof Stephen Thomas, the editor-in-chief of Energy Policy, an academic journal, said: “Sizewell is an appalling waste of electricity consumers’ and taxpayers’ money. If you want to justify a premium price for nuclear, you have to estimate the costs of achieving the same factors – energy security and reliability.</p><p>“Of course, nuclear power plants aren’t always reliable and the most insecure power source is the one that isn’t built yet. Without the assumptions behind these cost guesses [of £120 per MWh], they are worthless and far from transparent.”</p><p>Alison Downes, of Stop Sizewell C, a local campaign group, said: “Hinkley’s cost has soared to £50bn with completion dates slipping and five years still to go. Sizewell C’s costs will rise higher still when it inevitably overruns its £40bn construction budget.”</p><p>A spokesman for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “Sizewell C will deliver cheaper clean electricity for generations for at least six decades.</p><p>“For the first time, the British people will be co-owners of a nuclear power plant alongside experienced private sector partners – with consumers to benefit from the Government’s investment.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

It can lead to a full-blown liquidation of a company or reorganisation of its finances.</p><p>Frog Bikes said the move was a “precautionary measure” to allow the company to keep trading while it explores “potential funding and restructuring solutions”.</p><p>Mr Lawson blamed the predicament on a “series of significant and well-documented challenges” – including higher employee taxes, Brexit, and low consumer confidence.</p><p>He added, “At the same time, tighter financial markets and reduced access to funding made it increasingly difficult for growing <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/manufacturing-industry/\">manufacturing businesses</a> to secure the requisite working capital required to navigate these challenges.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘Continuing friction’ from Brexit</h2><p>The Wales-based group has gained a cult following and won a dream endorsement when the Princess of Wales published a <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2021/04/22/prince-louis-turns-three-does-compare-royals-age/\">photo of her son</a> riding one of the company’s products on his third birthday.</p><p>The business makes child-specific bikes after the founders said they struggled to find suitable ones for their own children.</p><p>Its lightweight aluminium bikes are made in Pontypool, Wales, where Mr and Mrs Lawson opened a 120,000-square-foot manufacturing facility.</p><p>After its success in the UK, it quickly became a market leader for affordable children’s bikes and rapidly expanded to more than 50 countries – including the US and Hong Kong.</p><p>However, Frog Bikes has recently warned that cumbersome export taxes were eating into profits.</p><p>In 2023, it lost £530,000 after blaming “continuing friction” from Brexit, which had made it harder to compete with European rivals.</p><p>However, in its most recent accounts for the year to February 2024, auditors said the group would continue as a going concern.</p><p>The report added that despite inflation falling at the time, consumers were still cautious in their spending on “big ticket purchases”, adding that there was competition from new entrants to the lightweight children’s bike market.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Bike market in turmoil</h2><p>Cycling businesses have faced a difficult time as enthusiasm for the activity starts to wane.</p><p>A <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/2024/11/06/how-the-great-cycling-boom-collapsed-lockdown/\">pandemic boom</a> led many companies to expand rapidly, but after the interest faded, firms complained that the sudden drop in interest had left manufacturers with excess inventory.</p><p>Companies like <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/01/27/brompton-bicycle-puts-100m-factory-as-bosses-blame-economy/\">Brompton Bicycles</a> saw profits fall by more than 99pc in the year to March 2024. The following year, it reported pre-tax losses of £2m. At the time, the company described the bike market as being “in turmoil”.</p><p>Raleigh, another British brand, reported a loss of £30m in 2023, citing overstocked inventory following the pandemic.</p><p>Frog Bikes confirmed in a statement that the search for a new investor would continue.</p><p>Mr Lawson said: “All parties are committed to securing a positive outcome for the business, its employees and wider stakeholders.</p><p>“Frog Bikes’ priority remains supporting its employees, customers, suppliers, and retail partners while working with its advisers to determine the best possible outcome for all stakeholders.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

But now the historic site may be revived thanks to an unlikely benefactor: Donald Trump.</p><p>The US president’s administration last week said it was willing to loan up to $225m (£165m) to developer Cornish Metals to support the mine’s reopening – so long as it agrees to send some of the output across the Atlantic.</p><p>Just two days earlier, and more than 4,600 miles away, a Washington-backed investment fund had announced a deal to acquire a 40pc share in a <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/03/trump-administration-9bn-copper-deal-challenge-china/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">copper and cobalt mine run by Glencore</a> in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>And in Western Australia, the US government has emerged as one of the backers of a scheme to build a new refinery that will produce gallium, a rare metal.</p><p>The investments follow a spate of dealmaking by the Trump administration at home in the past year – which has seen it take stakes in a magnet producer, a lithium mine and rare earth refineries – among other things.</p><p>According to experts, they are all examples of the new, more muscular approach Washington is taking to securing critical minerals abroad as it seeks to break China’s stranglehold over global supplies.</p><p>Tin, copper, cobalt and gallium are all commonly used in electronics, while lithium – known as “white gold” – is the main ingredient in batteries that power the modern world.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Rare earth magnets, meanwhile, are found in the spinning parts of wind turbines, electric motors and <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/12/24/the-tiny-british-company-that-outsmarted-xi-jinping/\">even fighter plane wing flaps</a>.</p><p>Without them, and a plethora of other metals, factory production lines across America would grind to a halt.</p><p>That briefly became a real prospect last year, when the US was locked in a trade standoff with China.</p><p>“One of the challenges we’ve had in the last 20 years in the United States is our mineral security efforts have largely been contained to handshake diplomacy,” says Gracelin Baskaran, a critical minerals expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).</p><p>“But handshake diplomacy doesn’t bring projects online. And it doesn’t yield minerals that can meet critical security interests.</p><p>“It’s the start, but what is the support that we need to get projects into production? It’s financing, it’s trade agreements, it’s off-take agreements [where a customer agrees to buy raw material before it is produced]. That is how we increase access to minerals.</p><p>“We’re going from paper agreements to deploying capital.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">US trailing China</h2><p>This is the thinking behind the dizzying series of deals announced by American officials in recent months.</p><p>Efforts to start directly nurturing alternative supplies began under Joe Biden but have accelerated under Trump, with investments made through several arms of the state – including the department of war, the department of energy, the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Exim) and the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC).</p><p>The DFC was the investor that supported Glencore’s copper and cobalt operations, while Exim has extended the offer of loans and financing to the tin project being developed by Cornish Metals.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Yet the Trump administration is still playing catch-up.</p><p>Chinese companies have been steadily building their control over key mining and refining operations for decades, giving Beijing the ability to turn off supplies to the rest of the world at will.</p><p>Take just one example: copper, the world’s most important industrial metal, used in electrical wiring, circuit boards and plumbing. Analysts predict the world is headed for a supply crunch in the coming years – and China is far better placed to weather it.</p><p>The Middle Kingdom’s companies control around 16pc of global copper production compared to 6pc owned by American firms, according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, and there have been calls in China to boost domestic stockpiles.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>“China has been doing this for a while, so this isn’t new for them,” says Albert Mackenzie, an analyst at Benchmark.</p><p>“The US may have looked at how they have built up their copper assets overseas, and is now trying to replicate that or not get left behind.</p><p>“There’s a big desire for more copper at the moment – you can point at AI, or to the energy transition, but actually it’s in basically everything we use because it’s such a good conductor.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Minerals monopoly</h2><p>While China has a grip on supply, its dominance of critical minerals is really about processing, with its share standing at over 50pc for a whole host of metals and exceeding 90pc for certain products.</p><p>This means that even though such metals may be mined in the US, Australia or elsewhere, they are still sent to China for refining.</p><p>Some 91pc of rare earth magnet metal refining and 94pc of global magnet production is concentrated in China, according to the International Energy Agency.</p><p>These are the magnets used in critical parts of the US military’s <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/21/the-tiny-magnets-threatening-americas-deadliest-jets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">F-35 stealth fighter</a>, as well as Tomahawk cruise missiles, navy destroyers and submarines, the Stinger portable missile and the M1 Abrams tank.</p><p>This leverage was brought into painful focus for Mr Trump last year, when he was forced to walk back his threats of trade tariffs after Beijing imposed export restrictions on heavy rare earths.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Ahead of his visit to China in April, the US president has now approved the creation of a $12bn critical mineral reserve, known as Project Vault, that will seek to guard US manufacturers against similar threats in future.</p><p>The initiative has been backed by captains of industry including the bosses of GE Vernova and Boeing.</p><p>“We don’t want to ever go through what we went through a year ago,” Mr Trump told reporters last week.</p><p>“Just as we have long had a strategic petroleum reserve and a stockpile of critical minerals for national defence, we’re now creating this reserve for American industry, so we don’t have any problems.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Security and stability</h2><p>The US administration has also been seeking to rally allies around an international network for developing critical mineral supplies outside of China.</p><p>Last week, vice-president JD Vance and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, hosted a critical minerals summit in Washington aimed at drumming up support for the initiative.</p><p>In a speech, Mr Rubio pointed out that the Chinese grip over supplies posed the same danger to all of America’s allies and urged them to work together.</p><p>“No country in the world has every critical mineral that’s valuable,” he said. “So it will rely on international cooperation.</p><p>“Right now, you have 90-something per cent of some of these elements controlled by one nation, one place. And that’s just not healthy for the global economy and it’s certainly not healthy for security and stability.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Along with the deals that have been announced, the White House has also vowed to back minerals producers with grants, loans and even “price floors” that will ensure they get paid a minimum amount for their minerals.</p><p>This is seen as vital because China’s producers receive large amounts of state support and can otherwise undercut competition from private Western firms.</p><p>Dominic Raab, the former Conservative deputy prime minister who now works with minerals investor Appian Capital Advisory, was in the room and says this change in mindset is key.</p><p>“There’s a recognition that it’s not a free market, it’s a broken market,” he says. “So they’re going to have to engage at a state level, but they also want to unlock private sector investment, and that’s important for de-risking those investments and unlocking more capital.”</p><p>Sophia Gaston, a geopolitics researcher at King’s College London, says the showdown with Beijing last year left Washington officials chastened by America’s “profound vulnerabilities on these supply chains”.</p><p>“China called the Trump administration’s bluff, and that forced America back to the negotiation table, and I think they felt extremely exposed by that, and wanted to move quickly to try and prevent that kind of situation happening again,” she says.</p><p>“There’s been a very intense flurry of activity, because Donald Trump is pencilled in for a visit to Beijing in April. So I think he wants to feel he’s going into that conversation with the maximum leverage.</p><p>“Until that critical minerals and rare earths diversification strategy starts to come into view, that’s going to be difficult – because there will always be a feeling that China can turn off the tap.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

This will require Anthropic to waive its terms that prevent its AI being unleashed in weapons without human oversight or used for mass surveillance.</p><p>If Amodei refuses to agree by 5pm on Friday, Anthropic could be declared a “supply chain risk”, meaning all department of defense contractors must stop using the AI, a senior Pentagon official confirmed.</p><p>The government could also use emergency rules under the defense production act to force Anthropic to comply.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>An Anthropic spokesman told Axios: “We continued good-faith conversations about our usage policy to ensure Anthropic can continue to support the government’s national security mission in line with what our models can reliably and responsibly do.”</p><p>Amodei has repeatedly described autonomous weapons as a “red line” that neither he nor the company he founded is willing to cross.</p><p>The 43-year-old is often portrayed as an AI safety obsessive. He has repeatedly warned about potential doomsday scenarios for the technology. Amodei originally left OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, in 2021 over concerns about safety.</p><p>Since launching its Claude AI bot, Anthropic’s technology has enjoyed rapid success.</p><p>Until this week, it was the only major AI model that had been cleared to undertake classified military work for the US government. Last year, it secured a $200m deal to work with the Pentagon.</p><p>Its tools were used by government officials to prepare for the lightning US raid on Caracas to capture Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president.</p><p>Last month, as Amodei was finishing his 20,000-word essay, Hegseth had new orders for America’s AI labs.</p><p>In a memo on an “AI-first warfighting force”, the secretary of defense demanded that labs dispense with “utopian idealism”. He insisted the department of defense would no longer work with companies with policies that “limit lawful military applications”.</p><p>It is not clear exactly what “lawful military applications” the US armed forces have in mind for Anthropic’s Claude.</p><p>A senior Pentagon official said the dispute with Anthropic was unrelated to the use of its technology for autonomous weapons or surveillance.</p><p>One source told technology news site the Verge that the row was more a “matter of principle” over who should have the final say over the use of AI on the battlefield. An official told The Telegraph that the Pentagon was ultimately responsible for using its technology lawfully.</p><p>Yet Hegseth’s memo detailed future goals for developing a “swarm forge” of AI drones and using agents for “kill chain execution” in battle. Days after Hegseth’s memo, the Pentagon also published footage of its first experimental drone swarm hitting dummy tanks with explosives.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The department of defense has guidelines for how it might use autonomous weapons. One directive states that AI weapons require “commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force”.</p><p>But Vivek Chilukuri, a senior fellow at the Centre for a New American Security, notes the rule “doesn’t actually require humans to remain in the loop”.</p><p>“It’s likely why Anthropic is concerned that this administration would stretch the policy to enable largely if not fully autonomous lethal systems,” he adds.</p><p>“Anthropic is concerned, with good reason, that frontier AI models are not yet ready for this level of autonomy.”</p><p>Lukasz Olejnik, at the department of war studies at King’s College London, agrees that the US has “no binding prohibition on lethal autonomous weapon systems”.</p><p>He says AI-powered weapons such as mass drone swarms and loitering munitions that would only require a human in an observer role are close to reality. A future human commander may merely be required for “performative actions – such as mindlessly clicking ‘accept cookie’” to execute a mission.</p><p>“So the question is whether the next killer app from AI vendors will be lethal autonomous weapons systems,” he says.</p><p>Historically, Silicon Valley workers have been hesitant to deploy their tools for military means. In 2018, thousands of Google workers protested a drone contract with the US government, called Project Maven, until the company relented.</p><p>However, Elon Musk’s xAI, Google and OpenAI have reportedly agreed to alter their contracts with the US government in response to Hegseth’s demands.</p><p>The Telegraph understands that the US government signed off Musk’s rival Grok AI for use in its classified network this week.</p><p>Emil Michael, the department of defense’s technology chief and a former Uber executive, made the government’s demands plain last week.</p><p>“I believe and hope that they will cross the Rubicon,” he said, according to DefenseScoop. He said giving the military ultimate control over autonomous weapons was crucial for security when humans are unable to respond fast enough.</p><p>“When the hypersonic missile launches from China, you have 90 seconds to take it down – how are you going to?”</p><p>He also expressed frustration about a Silicon Valley company attempting to re-write the rulebook for the US army.</p><p>“We’re not going to ... let any one company dictate a new set of policies,” he said.</p><p>Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren, warned on Wednesday that Donald Trump and Hegseth appeared to be using the emergency powers under the defense production act to “extort American companies that refuse to help the Pentagon to surveil Americans or build killer robots”.</p><p>Neither Hegseth nor Amodei has signalled they will back down.</p><p>One US defence source told Axios: “We need them and we need them now.”</p><p>In a speech at SpaceX last month, Hegseth said: “We will not <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/16/markets-fooled-believe-ai-magic/\">employ AI models</a> that won’t allow you to fight wars.</p><p>“Department of war AI will not be woke. It will work for us.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

We’ve gone from flickering black-and-white boxes that took a good 30 seconds to warm up and served up just one channel, to widescreen <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/tech/best-oled-tvs/\">OLED smart devices</a> that stream thousands of choices of “content” (though, ironically, they still often take a good 30 seconds to start up).</p><p>But the actual shows? Although they look very different, the genres of TV drama have stayed remarkably steady over all that time. Flick through the TV listings from any year over the decades, and you will find crime shows, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/the-pitt-hbo-max-sky-noah-wyle-uk-release/\">medical shows</a>, soaps, sci-fi, costume drama, historical series, and so on. There’s not all that great a gap between <em>Emergency Ward 10</em> and <em>Casualty</em>. There’s only one kind of drama series that you will find in a 1966 edition of <em>TV Times</em> that you won’t see while scrolling through your EPG in 2026 (excluding westerns, which were obviously never a British concern anyway). I’m talking about business TV.</p><p>There used to be many of these series: <em>The Brothers</em>, <em>The Power Game,</em> <em>The Plane Makers</em>, <em>Mogul</em>, <em>The Troubleshooters</em>. These were gripping stories of men (and it was overwhelmingly men) striding into each others’ offices, pouring whiskies, sparking up cigars, and obsessing over boards, stocks and shares, new products and processes. Women did feature, but until the Eighties they were the wives and secretaries that orbited like satellites around the boardrooms and factory floors where the main events played out.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Now, I will hear you object that boardroom business drama survives – <em>Succession</em> or <em>Industry</em>, for example. The big difference between these modern shows and their forebears is that they aren’t really concerned with the actual business of the business, except where it directly affects the drama between the characters.</p><p><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/succession\"><em>Succession</em></a> didn’t have a storyline about the design of a product – you can’t imagine scenes with Shiv or Roman unfurling plans across a big teak table, or lengthy discussions about the pros and cons of the fuel injection nozzle or whatever. No, <em>Succession</em> is more the inheritor of the <em>Dallas</em> model, the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/succession-owes-depravity-ancient-rome/\">high-glamour soap</a> in which the actual work in hand is merely the convenient backdrop.</p><p>The true business TV drama of old portrayed the actual business as dramatic in itself. The heyday of the form was 1963’s <em>The Plane Maker</em>s, the story of an aviation design firm which after three series reinvented itself in 1965 as <em>The Power Game</em>, shifting its anti-hero John Wilder (Patrick Wymark) to a merchant bank. The tensions of manufacture, negotiations and industrial relations were depicted in detail that seems baffling today.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>There is a sense of great public interest in business in other shows of the time. Early <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2020/04/06/honor-blackman-avengers-james-bond-star-obituary/\">Honor Blackman</a> episodes of <em>The Avengers</em> feature Steed and Mrs Gale investigating chicanery at works making pottery and optical lenses, and trying to expose export licences for counterfeit packaging. It’s all very unusual to 21st-century eyes.</p><p>The Wymark model – the tycoon stomping about, all blood and thunder, in his executive suite – became such an established part of TV that <em>Fry and Laurie </em>would spoof it in their John and Peter sketches: “Damn it to damnation, triple blast, John, I want to know what the hell is going on!”</p><p>The sometimes strained and phoney scene-setting dialogue of the genre – as we pick up the characters before the meat of the scene – was also brilliantly lampooned by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/victoria-wood/\">Victoria Wood</a>, who opens a visit to Acorn Antiques with Miss Babs pointing at blank sheets of paper and telling Miss Berta, “Yes, that’s much better – if we deliver these antiques on Friday morning, we can take delivery of these antiques in the afternoon.”</p><p>By the Seventies, the genre had become so established that it started generating oddities of its own. <em>Hine</em>, from 1971, is a fascinatingly weird one-off, created by <em>Power Game</em> writer Wilfred Greatorex (what a fantastic “Dammit, Marjorie!” name that is).</p><p><em>Hine </em>starred the personable Barrie Ingham as the titular hero, who is a freelance international arms dealer. Viewers were baffled – were we really meant to be rooting for this charming chap in his attempts to sell British weapons to dictatorships in the Middle East? – and the show flopped. It stands now as a fascinatingly amoral glimpse into a hidden world.</p><p>The episode “The Old School Noose” by Arden Winch (another great moniker and nothing to do with the workwear firm of the same name), in which Hine is caught in an elaborate web involving his childhood best friend who is now a Labour MP, is one of those exquisite pieces of dramatic writing and acting that occasionally startles you in a vintage “hack-for-hire” series.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>So what became of the “pure” business drama? The last British example I can think of that still retained elements of it was Eighties super-soap <em>Howards’ Way</em>, the BBC’s <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/return-of-80s-workwear-fashion/\">answer to <em>Dynasty</em></a>. Much of the action in its initial stages revolved around the design and production of a new racing boat, and the dilemma between using hand-crafted or machine-made mouldings. Try pitching that to <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/04/10/mps-call-for-netflix-tax-to-protect-british-tv/\">Netflix</a>. But fairly soon this faded into the background, swallowed up by the ins and outs of Relton Marine, Leisurecruise, the House of Howard, and which character owned what percentage of them.</p><p>In fact, in the Nineties, business started infecting our less glam soaps. When I worked as a writer on <em>Coronation Street</em>, Fiona Middleton – aged 21! – owned the salon, while <em>Brookside</em>’s teenage entrepreneur Jacqui Dixon had fingers in investment pies everywhere, and in<em> EastEnders</em> Sharon Watts became Walford’s answer to Howard Hughes. These may have been intended as inspiring messages of female empowerment, but they were both highly unlikely and difficult for viewers to identify with.</p><p>The simple answer to the mystery of business TV’s decline is that Britain stopped manufacturing things. There are currently politicians on all sides mooting the return of long-defunct industries to our land. In the unlikely event that they succeed, perhaps once again viewers will see people slamming down tumblers of Scotch and bellowing at their secretaries, damn it!</p></div></div></div></div>",

It took rescuers another 18 hours to find their bodies, and for Igor to identify them.</p><p>What ripped the Khudyo family apart on April 24, 2025, was a KN-23 ballistic missile. And, at the heart of that tragedy, helping power the missile, there may have been a British microchip.</p><p>Fired by Russia, it struck a residential block in Kyiv’s Sviatoshynskyi district, murdering twelve Ukrainians as they slept.</p><p>After the attack, Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, said the weapon responsible for orphaning Yana contained 116 Western-made components.</p><p>Little additional detail was given.</p><p>The type of North Korean missile used in the strike has been found to contain British-made converters, according to Ukrainian investigators. </p><div></div><p>It is one of thousands of Russian weapons that use Western – including British – dual-use military-grade components. Dual-use devices have both military and civilian use, meaning they can be used as easily in a computer as in a missile.</p><p>When Igor arrived at the site of the devastation, about 20 minutes after the strike, he saw his childhood home in smithereens.  </p><p>“I started desperately calling out to my mother, my father, to Daniel and to Yana,” he said from his apartment just outside Kyiv. </p><p>“The mobile phones of the dead were ringing, but no one was picking up,” he continued as we sat in darkness caused by Russian air strikes.</p><p>“I tried to call Yana and when I heard her pick up the phone I knew she was alive. But there was no sound.</p><p>“She sent me a text which said ‘I am under rubble, I am dying’ and her rough location.</p><div></div><p>“I started frantically searching, despite Shahed drones circling overhead, until finally I heard her calling out to me from beneath the destruction.”</p><p>Yana had been thrown from her bed and trapped under a cupboard. </p><p>She was operated on twice. “I found out my parents had died on Instagram while I was in the hospital,” she said.</p><p>“The psychologist was meant to tell me, but it was all over social media by the time I woke up from my surgeries.”</p><p>The impact of this experience on her is clear.</p><p>“I want to join the military [when I am 18],” she said proudly.</p><p>“This is the only future I see for myself because I want to be part of the people fighting for their land and their parents. I want to become a hero for Ukraine.”</p><p>With 16,000 international trading restrictions in place in Russia, how could British-made parts have found their way into Russia’s deadly arsenal, and why are sanctions not working?</p><div></div><p>The Telegraph and the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation (CFHK), a human rights watchdog, are exposing how middlemen in Hong Kong have shipped thousands of dual-use components worth millions of dollars from Western Europe to Russia.</p><p>Campaigners want the Government to open an urgent “investigation” into how British parts reportedly ended up in weapons used against Ukraine, and to “close any loopholes” around pre-existing laws.</p><p>On Sept 7, 2024, a North Korean KN-23/24 ballistic missile with the serial number 312518759 was shot down in the villages of Myrne and Bilyky, Poltava Oblast, Ukraine.</p><p>It was one of 60 KN-23 or Hwasong 11A missiles supplied to Putin by Kim Jong-un and launched that year.</p><p>Buried among the rubble and shrapnel, investigators said they found two products labeled as coming from the British company XP Power: a DC/DC converter and a power converter.</p><p>Converters transfer direct currents from one voltage level to another and are commonly used to stabilise, boost, or lower a voltage within a machine.</p><div></div><p>XP Power, which has headquarters in Reading, Berks, said converters allegedly found in Russian weapons were either counterfeit or “sold before the invasion”. The firm has not provided any additional detail or evidence to support these assertations.</p><p>Both chips recovered in the rubble were allegedly manufactured in 2023, a year after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine, and after XP Power said it had ceased trading with Russia.  </p><p>Russian customs data from 2022-2024, obtained by CFHK and reviewed by The Telegraph, found that 799 XP Power-labelled cargoes valued at around $2.5m (£1.8m) had been imported by Russia. It is not clear how XP Power-labelled devices ended up in North Korea. </p><p>It is unknown where exactly the missiles containing the XP Power-branded converters were made in North Korea. The country expanded its missile production capactity in 2024. The Ryongsong Machine Complex in the Hamhung region is a key factory where these weapons are built.</p><div></div><p>The CFHK figures, which come from tracking the sale and shipments of high-risk goods to sanctioned countries, suggest almost half were sent via Hong Kong to electronic supply companies Woeroon Electronic Sourcing Limited, SSP LTS and Imaxchip. None of these companies responded to requests for comment.</p><p>It is not clear if these companies were seeking to breach sanctions, or if they were aware these shipments might be used by the Russian military.</p><p>XP Power disputed CFHK's findings, stating that “all orders from customers and shipments to customers are thoroughly checked for sanctioned countries and companies”.</p><p>The company said it had “never traded” directly with Woeroon, SSP LTS, Imaxchip or any of the companies named in the shipment data.</p><div></div><p>There is no suggestion that XP had any knowledge of where its components would end up, and no evidence the company was complicit in sending parts to Ukraine.</p><p>But it is common for middleman businesses committing sanctions evasion to pass dual-use stock from company to company.</p><p>“Naturally, we have less visibility of sales that might pass through a number of hands in the supply chain,” a spokesman for XP Power accepted.</p><p>She added: “We have stringent export controls in place and take our responsibilities under the various sanction regimes very seriously – after the invasion in February 2022, we immediately stopped all shipments to Russia.  </p><p>“We take our obligations in this area very seriously and we will continue to work with others in the supply chain to ensure their controls are as tight as ours.</p><p>“All of our sales contracts now include clauses to specifically prohibit onward sale or re-exporting to Russia.”</p><div></div><p>It is not just the KN-23 missile that has been found to contain British-made hardware.</p><p>British components have also been found in deadly Shahed drones, First-Person View drones, guided missiles and scores of other weapons launched by the Russian military into Ukraine.</p><p>In total, Ukrainian investigators have found 41 British-made components on the battlefield since the start of the war in 2022.  </p><div></div><p>On Dec 1 last year, the Ukrainian military downed a newly modified Geran-2 or Shahed attack drone carrying an R-60 infrared guided AAM (Air-to-Air Missile) on a top-mounted rail launcher.</p><p>On Jan 12 2026, Ukraine brought down a Geran-2 or Shahed UAV with Verba MPADS (man-portable air defence system).</p><p>In both cases, investigators said they found a British-made Raspberry Pi microcomputer in the drone.</p><p>When contacted, Raspberry Pi said it was aware that its products had been “diverted through third-party supply chains” and used in Russian drones.</p><p>The tech firm said that “diversion can occur via complex and opaque chains of onward sale in jurisdictions where visibility is limited”.</p><div></div><p>A spokesman for the company added: “Raspberry Pi complies fully with all applicable UK, EU and international sanctions regimes and operates controls designed to track and prevent diversion to Russia or the Russian defence sector.</p><p>“The company does not disclose the detailed mechanics of its anti-diversion processes.”</p><p>Campaigners said this was not good enough.</p><p>Samuel Bickett, a former political prisoner in Hong Kong and co-author of CFHK’s report, said: “British manufacturers of components used in Russian weapons are not doing enough to control the flow of these goods across the world.</p><p>TT Electronics in Woking, Surrey, looks like any other grey, industrial manufacturing business.</p><div></div><p>According to its website, it makes advanced electronics for “aerospace, defence, healthcare, automation and electrification”.</p><p>It has 19 manufacturing sites across Britain, China, North America and Thailand.</p><p>Ukrainian investigators say they have found 11 transistors manufactured by TT Electronics in automated radio jammers and transmitter interference devices used by the Russians on the battlefield.</p><p>Between 2022 and 2024, documents reviewed by CFHK suggest that Russia received 59 imports of TT Electronics-labelled components with a declared value of $1.2m. Around 40 per cent of these shipments, worth $700,000, went via Hong Kong.</p><p>Hong Kong has become an increasingly important hub for sanctions evasion used by foreign governments seeking to dodge Western embargoes. </p><div></div><p>The TT Electronics shipments were imported by four Hong Kong-based traders and logistics firms, including companies associated with the electronics supplier Woeroon. </p><p>Woeroon, which made 25,707 shipments to Russia between 2022 and 2024, is a collective of several unrelated companies. </p><p>Sir Iain Duncan Smith, co-chairman of the Interparliamentary Alliance on China, said: “This Government is turning out to be a lapdog to China.</p><p>“It is China and the CCP-controlled Hong Kong that is allowing dual-use components into Russia.</p><p>“Sanction evasion has been going on for a while and it is absolutely wrong for the government to turn a blind eye to it.</p><p>“The British Government doesn’t seem to care when the sanctions we are meant to be imposing are not being enforced at all. It is an absolute disgrace.</p><p>“And the result is that Russia can continue fighting its brutal war of invasion.”</p><p>Golledge Electronics, headquartered in Basingstoke, also has products which appear to have been used by Russia.</p><p>The company’s “frequency control products” are said by investigators to have been repeatedly discovered inside sophisticated Russian weaponry, including the Tornado C guided missile, the 9M727 cruise missile and the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missile.</p><p>Since Putin’s invasion in 2022, Ukrainian government investigators say they have discovered eight Golledge-labelled components in Russian weapons. Most recently, a Quartz oscillator was found in a cruise missile on Oct 25 2025.</p><div></div><p>Between 2022 and 2024, Russia received 114 Golledge Electronics-labelled shipments, 30 of which came via six Hong Kong-based companies, including Woeroon and Asialink Shanghai International Logistics Co Ltd, according to analysis by CFHK.</p><p>Asialink, a cargo transportation service which has an official partnership with Russia’s national airline Aeroflot, supplied 3,700 high-risk goods worth $6.3m to Russia from March 2022 to January 2024, according to CFHK. It even used Russian as the default language for its website in 2023. </p><p>While the US has already sanctioned Asialink for continued shipments to businesses in Russia, the EU and UK have not.</p><p>TT Electronics and Golledge Electronics were contacted for comment.</p><p>There is no suggestion that any of the British companies named are deliberately selling their products to Russia.</p><div></div><p>Bill Browder – the American-born businessman, author and head of the Global Magnitsky Justice campaign – said: “It’s outrageous that British components would have found their way into Russian weapons. </p><p>“This is exactly what the UK sanctions were supposed to prevent. </p><p>“I hope that we figure out how these components found their way into these weapons so sanctions can be tightened.</p><div></div><p>“Innocent people in Ukraine have died because of these weapons being used on them and we need to get to the bottom of this.”</p><p>Chloe Cheung, a Hong Kong dissident who has a China-issued 1,000,000 HK dollar (£100,000) bounty on her head, co-wrote the CFHK report. She said: “It’s shocking that the city I grew up in is now linked to illegal weapons trade rather than to the values of integrity and accountability that once defined it.</p><p>“Hong Kong is funnelling components into Russia’s war machine. Our city is indirectly contributing to the killing of Ukrainians. This is the result of Chinese Communist Party control.</p><p>“A city once known for rule of law and clean governance, which claims to be an international financial hub, has instead become a haven for dirty money and illegal traders, barely recognisable as the place I once called home.”</p><p>Lord Austin, vice-chairman of the Magnitsky Sanctions and Reparation all-party parliamentary group, said: “It would be completely unacceptable if British components are fuelling Russia’s war machine.</p><p>“Ministers must take immediate steps to close any sanctions loopholes.”</p><p>Mr Bickett, the CFHK report's co-author, added: “It is critical that Britain work with allies to create a genuine multilateral authority with the power to institute sanctions quickly and broadly against all Russian and non-Russian parties involved in evading export controls.”</p><p>Responding to our findings, a government spokesman said: “We take reports of goods from UK companies being found in Russian weaponry incredibly seriously.</p><p>“We have banned the export of thousands of goods to Russia, including every battlefield item Ukraine has brought to our attention, and together with our international partners have implemented the most severe package of sanctions ever imposed on a major economy.</p><div></div><p>“Non-compliance with sanctions is a serious offence punishable through large financial penalties or criminal prosecution.”</p><p>Konstantin Bychek, 36, was standing by his kitchen window when a North Korean KN-23 struck the neighbouring apartment block on April 24, 2025.</p><p>“The shock wave threw me against the wall,” he said while standing in the remains of his old home, almost a year after the deadly strike.</p><div></div><p>“My face and neck were shredded by shards of glass, and I was drenched in blood.</p><p>“I shut my eyes, but behind my eyelids I could see a blinding orange flash [from] when the explosion happened.”</p><p>Natalia, his wife, who also survived the explosion, said Europe should crack down on sanctions evasion. “We would like all possible supplies to Russia to be cut off,” she said.</p><div></div><p>“I don't understand how this can happen, given that Russia is under sanctions.”</p><p>Igor, who is now his sister Yana’s legal guardian, warned: “Western Europe should not forget what is going on in Ukraine.</p><p>“If Europe doesn't help us now, you will see the same in your countries.”</p><p>As we approach the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we must ask ourselves: why is Europe still shooting itself?</p><div></div></div></div></div>",

But the defence barrister said they had yet to clarify “where the alleged overspill begins”.</p><p>“Over the last half a decade, my clients have repeatedly and exhaustively sought to understand the claimants’ case.

In Britain, the then prime minister Boris Johnson announced a <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/environment/2020/11/17/sales-new-petrol-diesel-cars-banned-2030/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ban on the sale of new petrol cars by 2030</a>; in America, Joe Biden proposed a $174bn stimulus package for EVs.</p><p>Tesla, the electric carmaker founded by Elon Musk, was also being eyed enviously by its more traditional rivals – as sales of its Model 3 and Model Y cars grew rapidly.</p><p>EV sales were being supported by a sharp rise in petrol prices that followed the outbreak of the Ukraine war, which made EVs look cheaper relative to internal combustion engine (ICE) cars.</p><p>Against this backdrop, things only seemed to be heading in one direction.</p><p>In response, many car companies announced ambitious plans to electrify their line-ups.</p><p>Jaguar Land Rover announced that Jaguar would become <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/02/15/land-rover-goes-electric-new-boss-reshapes-jaguar/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">an “all-electric” brand by 2025</a>.

This is despite predictions that falling battery prices would lead to similar price drops for cars.</p><p>As a result, European sales of EVs have so far struggled to break past the 20pc mark.</p><p>By comparison, EVs in China have reached parity in cost with ICE cars – at about €22,000 on average – and now account for around 50pc of all new car sales. This has been achieved in no small part thanks to generous subsidies from Beijing.</p><p>Andy Palmer, a veteran car industry executive known as the “Godfather” of EVs for his role in developing Nissan’s popular Leaf model, blames Western manufacturers for failing to invest in affordable models.</p><p>In the US and Europe, too many brands have focused on pricier – and more profitable – SUV models rather than cheaper city cars, he says.</p><p>“I think the fundamental issue is that the cars are too expensive and they are being compensated by subsidies, and that ultimately doesn’t work,” he says.</p><p>“You’ve got to get parity of cost with ICE cars. And EVs have got to offer more than simply they’re clean.</p><p>“They’ve got to offer basically good value for money, they’ve got to offer something different in terms of the user experience, rather than simply being a copy of ICE cars.</p><p>“That’s where the Chinese have got it right. The Chinese have pitched their EV prices at parity, if not cheaper, and they are adopting at rates that give huge economies of scale.”</p><p>With EV sales failing to take off in the way that was hoped, even the watered-down electric car mandates in Europe are starting to look challenging for manufacturers.</p><p>In the UK, for example, the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate required 28pc of new car sales to be electric last year compared with the 23.9pc actually achieved by the industry.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The target rises again to 33pc this year and gradually ratchets up to 80pc by 2030, when sales of new pure petrol and diesel car sales will be banned outright. By 2035, hybrids are likely to go the same way.</p><p>Car companies, led by the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), are urging a rethink, arguing that they are having to withdraw petrol cars from sale and discount their EVs heavily just to avoid punishing fines already.</p><p>Xavier Martinet, the president of Hyundai’s European business, recently said the Government needed a “reality check”, or risk some carmakers pulling out of the UK altogether.</p><p>“If you don’t sell EVs, you might not even do the ICE sales,” <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/06/britains-ev-targets-risk-creating-severe-disruption-hyundai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he told The Telegraph</a> this month. “So what will customers buy, at the end of the day? That’s a major question.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Range anxiety</h2><p>In the UK, there’s another barrier to adoption: infrastructure.</p><p>For many drivers, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/hybrid-electric-cars/poll-of-the-week-electric-cars-inferior/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">range anxiety remains a worry</a> despite the growing mileage of newer electric cars. This is why the Government has set out targets to boost the number of chargers nationally to more than 300,000 by 2030.</p><p>But the charger rollout has been criticised repeatedly for being patchy and too focused on London and the South East, with a House of Lords report in 2024 warning that ministers needed to “turbocharge” the rollout.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Instead, charging companies complain that they have still faced a menagerie of problems that were avoidable and are slowing down the rollout.</p><p>Securing planning permission on many sites remains too time-consuming, according to industry body ChargeUK, while funding through local authority-run schemes has been hit by delays.</p><p>Most significantly, charging providers have been hit by by high network costs. These are fees charged to businesses to fund the maintenance and expansion of the electricity grid – and they have been rising rapidly in recent years.</p><p>The network charges depend on the capacity of a site, or how many chargers it has, meaning that companies are effectively punished for doing what the Government wants and building bigger charging stations.</p><p>In one case, a national provider told The Telegraph that its network charges for a single site had rocketed from about £80 a year in 2020 to nearly £40,000 per year today.</p><p>This is pushing up the cost of public charging, which is already far more expensive than home charging – increasing the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/01/01/britains-driveway-divide-killing-case-for-electric-cars/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“driveway divide”</a> between households who have their own charger and those that don’t.</p><p>According to Zapmap, the cost of charging at home is as little as 8.5 pence per kilowatt hour compared with 54 pence at public chargers.</p><p>Some charging companies are responding by cutting investment or building batteries on their sites to reduce reliance on the grid. The Telegraph revealed that the annual number of charger installations <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/12/31/electric-car-charger-installations-fall-for-first-time/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fell for the first time in 2025</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Signs of financial pressure are also emerging.</p><p>A string of deals was announced last week to combine various EV charging providers, including a merger of Mer with Octopus Energy-backed Be.EV.</p><p>That follows takeovers of Trojan Energy and SureCharge by larger providers Connected Kerb and Shell-Unitricity respectively. Industry executives think more such deals are on the way.</p><p>The strain on the sector is why charging companies have been urging ministers not to relax the ZEV mandate – even as car manufacturers say the targets are punishing high.</p><p>Jarrod Birch, of industry body ChargeUK, says: “Charging businesses have committed £6bn in private investment underpinned by the certainty and confidence offered by the ZEV mandate.</p><p>“Weakening or delaying the mandate – reviewed and adjusted less than 12 months ago – would undermine that confidence and the UK’s general ability to attract investment and deliver growth.</p><p>“Investors need to know that binding targets will remain binding, not shift in the wind.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Chinese carmakers race to dominance</h2><p>All these headwinds are bad enough on their own. But what could have been a significant headache for Western carmakers is fast becoming a full-blown crisis as new <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/11/ford-overtaken-byd-boost-chinese-car-ambitions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese competitors are rapidly expanding</a> in the market.</p><p>Brands such as BYD, SAIC, Chery, Geely, XPeng, NIO and Leapmotor have had their research, development and production backed by the state – allowing them to take greater risks and put their foot on the accelerator.</p><p>Beijing has also supported a rapid rollout of charging infrastructure, and until recently was lavishing subsidies on consumers at home to buy electric cars.</p><p>From an almost standing start, the Chinese carmakers have raced to dominance.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>In 2020, Chinese drivers bought 900,000 battery-electric cars and 200,000 plug-in hybrids. In 2024, sales were 6.4 million and 4.9 million, respectively.</p><p>EVs now account for more than half of all car sales, and almost every EV sold is a Chinese brand.</p><p>Western carmakers haven’t been able to keep up in this race, and it is starting to show. Geely last year became the second Chinese carmaker after BYD to overtake Volkswagen in the Chinese market.</p><p>The German carmaker’s joint ventures with state-owned FAW and SAIC had a combined market share of 11pc last year, about half its former peak.</p><p>As Chinese buyers become more patriotic – Porsche sales have nosedived there – VW will work with its partner to make China-friendly models.</p><p>The likes of General Motors and Toyota are also losing ground in the world’s biggest market. They are either failing to launch EVs quickly enough, or not pricing them cheaply enough.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Boom years are over</h2><p>It is not just Western brands hurting in China, however. The domestic boom has started to turn sour for local manufacturers too.</p><p>Subsidies ensure that the factory lines keep churning, but the queue of buyers is getting shorter. The market’s low-hanging fruit has been picked, just as weak labour and property markets have sapped consumer confidence.</p><p>With a glut of unsold cars and a dearth of buyers, the industry has resorted to steep discounting to keep shifting stock.</p><p>The China Automobile Dealers Association estimates that this price war wiped more than 471bn yuan (£50bn) from the carmakers’ revenue in the past three years.</p><p>The strategy is barely working: BYD’s sales in January were half those a year ago, and previous high-flyer Xpeng reported a third decline.</p><p>In February, investors began shedding their holdings in the listed companies, fearing the boom years might be over.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Beijing sat up and took notice. For more than a year, the Chinese authorities used public statements and meetings with executives to criticise the carmakers for their “race to the bottom”, known in China as “involution”.</p><p>But their words went unheeded, and last week the state administration for market regulation banned the industry from selling vehicles below production cost.</p><p>Cosimo Ries, of analysis firm Trivium China, isn’t convinced that even this will stop the price war. And as losses mount, he says, the smaller players will fight back, and they’ll be backed by local and regional governments who don’t want to see their champion fail.</p><p>He Xiaopeng, the boss of XPeng, agrees: “The competition in the auto market in 2026 will be even more brutal and bloody,” he said recently.</p><p>The Chinese carmakers’ domestic struggles are not good news for their Western rivals.</p><p>With unsold stocks piling up, BYD and its brethren are turning to a familiar option for glut-stricken Chinese firms: pump and dump offshore.</p><p>BYD said last week it was planning to boost exports by 25pc this year. In January alone, BYD’s German sales surged more than tenfold, with Dolphin hatchbacks outselling Teslas by two to one.</p><p>Britain is fertile ground, as it hasn’t thrown up a tariff wall. BYD quadrupled its sales last year and entered the top 20 brands last year, outselling Mini, Mazda and Tesla.</p><p>Greece and Italy are also proving to be attractive markets. One in every seven EVs sold in Europe last year was a Chinese import, when cars made in China by Western companies are included.</p><p>“The speed at which the European consumer has adopted Chinese cars is much faster than our adoption of Japanese or Korean cars. That is a bit worrying from the perspective of a Western automotive company,” says Niklas Brundin, a partner at consulting firm Arthur D Little.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>One industry veteran says that since the UK and Europe are mature car markets, companies tend to grow only by taking market share from somebody else.</p><p>“A few years ago there were about 40 major car brands in the UK, and by the end of the decade there’ll be something like 75. There isn’t enough growth in the market to support that,” he says.</p><p>“Those extra 35 brands are going to have to take the share from somebody, and that’s going to result in a lot higher competitive intensity. And none of the Chinese companies are coming here to be a player with a 1pc market share.”</p><p>In other words, a fight to the death has begun.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Europe fights back</h2><p>Faced with an onslaught from agile, cutting-edge Chinese companies backed by state subsidies, the initial response from Europe has been to shelter behind a <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/09/13/eu-pushback-china-flood-cheap-electric-cars/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Brussels tariff wall</a>. But its defences look weak.</p><p>Chinese companies have responded by switching to selling more hybrid vehicles and setting up factories within Europe.</p><p>Matthias Schmidt, an automotive expert, reckons a fightback is coming. In the next year, he predicts the incumbent Western brands will start bringing cheaper models to market, using the cheaper lithium iron phosphate battery technology that powers the Chinese brands.</p><p>“We’re expecting to see prices for consumers fall and price parity be met,” he says.</p><p>Because the EVs will then be more commercially viable, “it will be in the manufacturers’ interests to push those vehicles, not just to meet regulatory guidelines but because eventually they will become more profitable”.</p><p>But for this strategy to fly, the EV market has to reawaken. And here, industry reckons the Government must work harder – or at least smarter.</p><p>The EU and the British Government are trying to force the industry to go all-electric by the mid-2030s. But it is becoming clear that not enough motorists are on board with EVs to keep this target on track.</p><p>Governments have had differing responses to this dawning reality.</p><p>The Trump administration has executed a volte-face, forcing American carmakers to wear heavy losses on their EV investments.</p><p>Brussels is poised to <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/12/07/labour-urged-to-delay-petrol-car-ban-as-eu-pushes-ev-target/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">water down its targets and standards</a>. But a reform package outlined late last year was criticised by industry as complex, incomplete and insufficient – and not enough to fend off the Chinese.</p><p>Britain is undertaking a lengthy review of its targets that require carmakers to shift an increasing proportion of their sales to EVs. Often, carmakers can only meet these targets by selling unwanted EVs at a loss.</p><p>“The regulatory trajectories are really steep. It’s so much ahead of that underlying demand that it’s putting huge financial pressure on the industry,” says Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.</p><p>“We’re not denying the aspiration, the ambition – but it’s making sure it’s deliverable in a timescale that’s affordable for consumers and affordable for businesses.”</p><p>Rather than make it more affordable, Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, has announced a new tax of 3p a mile for EVs from 2028, or 1.5p for plug-in hybrid drivers.</p><p>On the other side of the ledger, the Government introduced a grant for EV buyers, but only about a quarter of models will qualify.</p><p>“For the industry and especially for the consumer, it’s mixed messages,” Hawes says. “At a time when you need to be pulling every lever to try and bolster that consumer demand, instead it’s two steps forward, one step back.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘Model T moment’</h2><p>The EV bubble that inflated in the first half of this decade has well and truly burst. But the technology is not going away.</p><p>Even Ford, despite its huge losses, remains committed to electric cars. Jim Farley, the company’s boss, has said its back-to-basics “Universal Electric Vehicle” platform – built by engineers from the ground up – is the most important product he has ever worked on.</p><p>It will be the basis of a new effort to crack the mass market, with Ford reportedly aiming for cars that can sell in the consumer sweet spot of $30,000 to $35,000.</p><p>Andrew Bergbaum, an automotive expert at AlixPartners, says this kind of ground-up overhaul is ultimately needed to bring down the cost of Western-made EVs.</p><p>Farley has claimed that cracking EVs could deliver a modern “Model T moment” – a reference to the best-selling car that made the company’s name in the early 1900s.</p><p>“This is us going back to our roots,” he told Auto Car in January. “As Wolfgang Puck said, ‘A lot of people could run a four or five-star restaurant; not many people can do a good buffet in Las Vegas.’</p><p>“We learned so much being an early mover in EVs and a full-line manufacturer. We learned a lot about where we need to put our capital.”</p><p>To critics, it looks like an extremely expensive lesson.</p></div></div></div></div>",

That would average £15 for every HGV, van and car.</p><p>The Chamber said an initial 50pc deduction to match the carbon charges on voyages between Britain and Republic of Ireland will provide little relief.<br/><br/>That is because exporters in Northern Ireland compete mostly with firms in Britain rather than the province’s southern neighbour, to which they will be at a structural disadvantage.</p><p>UK firms have already spent millions on some of the most sustainably designed ferries, including methanol and rotor sail propulsion, leaving no financially viable way forward, it claimed.</p><p>The Chamber said: “The sector supports the UK’s climate goals, but cannot deliver meaningful emissions reduction without the necessary fuels, infrastructure, and clear guidance in place.<br/><br/>“Premature implementation risks higher costs for passengers and freight, with limited environmental gain. However, the Government is pressing ahead, leaving industry in an untenable position.”<br/><br/>The trade group urged ministers to delay introduction of the scheme while further assessments are carried out and said the revenue raised should be ring-fenced for investment in clean fuels and quayside power connections.</p><p>The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said that it is for ship operators to decide how much of the expense of the ETS scheme to pass on, and that consumers should not see significant costs.</p><p>A spokesman said: “Pricing emissions is a cost-effective way to cut carbon emissions and encourage greener travel.

Jerome Mayhew, the shadow rail minister, claimed that Network Rail was being forced to step in after the Chancellor’s “astronomical” business rates increase drove out Eurotunnel.</p><p>He said: “When business leaders and rail operators warned that these punitive increases would have real-world consequences, this is exactly what they meant.</p><p>“Labour’s own tax decisions have driven away investment and forced taxpayers to underwrite infrastructure that should have been delivered commercially.”</p><p>The DfT argued that the plan for the Barking terminal would revive the cross-Channel rail freight market and boost trade links with Europe, helping to stimulate the economy and reducing road congestion and emissions.</p><p>It said the key to the redevelopment would be to allow full-size European container trains restricted to the High Speed 1 route to reach London.</p><p>That would enable food markets to receive fruit and vegetables direct from overseas growers and open up the possibility of Scotch whisky and British consumer items being exported by rail.</p><p>Network Rail said it envisaged three trains a day running into the terminal from the Continent, connecting with services to Scotland via central England and the North West and removing 140,000 HGVs from the roads each year.</p><p>Maggie Simpson, the director general of the Rail Freight Group, said the Government’s intervention was necessary to “keep the dream of Channel Tunnel cargo alive” and safeguard a site whose loss would have prevented container trains from ever using the link.</p><p>However, she said that factors including unfair cost advantages that favour the trucking industry would need to be addressed if significant volumes of freight were to use the tunnel.</p><p>Ms Simpson said ministers were also compelled to step in because of the Barking yard’s importance to containerised defence-related shipments at a time of heightening international tension.</p><p>She said: “If you look at Britain’s strategic resilience it is a vital national asset for whatever you want to transport to and from Europe, and that includes defence shipments”.</p><p>The Barking site, originally developed by Deutsche Bahn’s DB Cargo for automotive shipments, received the first direct freight train from China to the UK in 2017, when a rake of 34 containers arrived there after an 18-day journey.</p></div></div></div></div>",

It added that the bid is fully funded.</p><p>Other backers are understood to include David Smith, the broadcasting tycoon and Baltimore Sun owner, and Jeremy Hosking, the hedge fund boss who funds Lawrence Fox’s Reclaim political party, as well as another unnamed British individual.</p><p>The consortium said: “We believe our proposal is in the best interests of the seller, The Telegraph, its staff, readers and the wider British public. Our commitment to securing the best possible outcome for all parties in this long and winding saga has never wavered.”</p><p>A spokesman for Axel Springer confirmed the company’s participation in the bid, which was outlined in a letter to RedBird IMI, the UAE-backed vehicle that is selling The Telegraph after being blocked from taking control of the newspaper following a cross-party outcry over press freedom.</p><p>Mr Efune, a British-born publisher who previously led Jewish newspaper the Algemeiner, has been <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/05/17/publisher-new-york-sun-launches-effort-buy-the-telegraph/\">a long-running suitor of The Telegraph</a>. He was awarded exclusivity in an auction by RedBird IMI in late 2024 but was unable to secure finance before it lapsed.</p><p>Axel Springer, which also owns Politico and Business Insider, expressed an interest in buying The Telegraph in<strong> </strong>2023. It was also in the running to buy the newspaper in 2004 but pulled out of the auction, which was ultimately won by the Barclay brothers.</p><p>The German group is controlled by billionaire Mathias Döpfner, a former music critic turned media mogul who faced scrutiny over reports he encouraged Elon Musk to pen an article in the Welt in support of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Axel Springer denies that Mr Döpfner was involved in the publication of the opinion piece.</p><p>Mr Döpfner has long stressed his focus on digital journalism over print and is a vocal supporter of artificial intelligence (AI), telling staff last year that they were now obliged to use the technology in their reporting and that his new mantra was “embrace AI or die”.</p><p>The tycoon said last year that he was on the hunt for digital media acquisitions, particularly in the US, but had failed to find any suitable targets.</p><p>News of Mr Efune’s latest financing partner was first reported <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7da3da34-e93c-40ad-9beb-7f6e504fb585\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">by the Financial Times</a>, hours after Lisa Nandy, the Culture Secretary, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/19/lisa-nandy-paves-the-way-for-telegraph-sale/\">approved a crucial step toward ownership</a> of the Telegraph for DMGT.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>She <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/19/lisa-nandy-paves-the-way-for-telegraph-sale/\">gave permission for RedBird IMI to sell security</a> over the newspaper to Lord Rothermere’s holding company, a move which had previously been restricted.</p><p>Transfer of the option to DMGT will make the deal binding. However, it would remain at risk of being blocked over plurality concerns identified by the Culture Secretary. In that scenario, Lord Rothermere, not RedBird IMI, would become the seller.</p><p>Mr Efune has previously sought financing from parties including the family office of Leon Black, the Wall Street tycoon brought down by his status as one of Jeffrey Epstein’s biggest clients.</p><p>Nadhim Zahawi, the former MP and Conservative Cabinet minister who recently defected to Reform, has also been linked to Mr Efune’s long pursuit of The Telegraph.</p><p>DMGT declined to comment.
