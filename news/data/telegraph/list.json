It also said it would raise up to €3bn equity through an accelerated book building.</p><p>The deal will mean that the power networks of London and the South East will be controlled by France, which <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/20/britain-more-reliant-than-ever-foreign-electricity-imports/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">already owns a significant portion</a> of Britain’s nuclear power infrastructure.</p><p>All five nuclear power stations in the UK are operated by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/20/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-costs-rise-to-48bn/\">France’s EDF</a> – which together provide around 12pc of the country’s total electricity.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>EDF is fully owned by the French state after the government vowed to renationalise the electricity company in 2023 to help secure the country’s nuclear future.

The UK Government is due to retain a stake of just under 45pc.</p><p>In January, think tank Citepa reported that France was successful in <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/01/19/pious-europeans-fall-short-net-zero/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reducing its greenhouse gas emissions</a> by 1.6pc last year, down from 1.8pc in 2024 and 6.8pc in 2023.</p><p>Politicians have urged the country to go quicker, with Monique Barbut, the French environment minister, having said recent efforts were “not enough”.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Fear of Chinese influence</h2><p>Sir Ka-shing’s CK Infrastructure Holdings bought UK Power Networks in 2010 for £5.5bn.</p><p>The bid to purchase the power company reportedly arose from a last-minute offer of a higher price because the group decided that Britain’s high inflation had lifted the value of UK Power Networks.</p><p>The company is also owned by sister business CK Power Assets, both of which hold a 40pc stake. The last 20pc of the group is owned by CK Asset.</p><p>The sale of the business by Mr Ka-shing follows <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/04/15/labour-cosying-up-to-china-leaves-steel-industry-vulnerable/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">concerns over Chinese influence</a> across crucial infrastructure in Britain.</p><p>Mr Ka-shing has previously been accused of political “collaboration” with the Chinese state.

It was the height of the pandemic and with John Lewis in the grip of a financial crisis, Dame Sharon White, then the boss – just months into the job – was under immense pressure to dream up new revenue streams.</p><p>Profits had crashed, leaving the sacred staff bonus at its lowest for nearly 70 years. At the same time, 1,300 jobs were being axed, debt had ballooned to £2.4bn and Dame Sharon had warned that it could take five years for the illustrious organisation to recover.</p><p>Diversifying away from traditional retail and utilising John Lewis’s existing property assets made great sense – at least in principle – as Dame Sharon sought to generate 40pc of annual profits from non-retail ventures by 2030.</p><p>What’s more, here was one of the country’s pre-eminent ethically led organisations proposing to help solve the housing crisis with thousands of genuinely high-quality homes. In many ways, it was an inspired idea.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Yet less than five years later, the great John Lewis housebuilding dream is dead – crushed by a lethal combination of <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/06/britains-planning-system-is-doomed-to-decades-of-stagnation/\">planning red tape</a> and spiralling costs.</p><p>It has been greeted in some quarters as a welcome and overdue development; some understandably saw the plans as a distraction at a time when the partnership’s department stores and Waitrose shops have been crying out for further investment.</p><p>But that in itself is something of a sideshow. A much bigger question is what this means for attempts to tackle the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/04/sadiq-khans-failure-on-housing-has-become-a-labour-crisis/\">country’s long-term housing crisis</a> – not that John Lewis was on the cusp of single-handedly solving the problem, of course.</p><p>The company was planning to build 10,000 homes, which isn’t to be sniffed at, but in the context of a severe housing shortage estimated at between 4.3 million and 6.5 million homes, such numbers would have barely scratched the surface.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Government should ask itself this: if John Lewis can’t build houses, then isn’t Britain’s broken property market all but doomed? What’s more, how much of a factor was a planning system that has become more onerous – not less – despite repeated pledges from the Treasury to reduce red tape?</p><p>After all, it was only in October that the Chancellor promised to scrap “needless form-filling” in an attempt to boost growth. But try telling business leaders, including those leading John Lewis’s housebuilding ambitions, that the infuriating burden of endless regulation, box-ticking and compliance has eased.</p><p>John Lewis’s retreat should set off alarm bells among complacent, out-of-touch ministers. It’s not so much that the retailer was uniquely qualified to enter an industry dominated by giants such as Taylor Wimpey, Barratt, Redrow and Persimmon, but more that an organisation of its size and stature has failed because of external forces, including heavy-handed state interference.</p><p>As Brendan Geraghty, the chief executive of the Association for Rental Living, puts it, John Lewis “brought something genuinely different to the rental living sector – a trusted consumer brand, a service-first culture and a long-term commitment to quality that institutional investors and residents alike responded to”. On paper, it should have been a winning combination.</p><p>Clearly, not all of the obstacles it has faced can be pinned entirely on this Government’s incompetence.</p><p>As John Lewis points out, its entry into housebuilding occurred during “a very different financial environment”. Not least “lower borrowing costs” and although <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/15/britain-scarred-by-high-prices-warns-bank-of-england-policy/\">interest rates are cooling</a>, they still stand at 3.75pc today compared with 0.1pc at the end of 2021. At current levels, borrowing costs are around 8pc to 9pc higher than they were four years ago, according to Capital Economics.</p><p>At the same time, inflation has soared from 0.2pc to 3pc. At 4.4pc as of October 2025, construction cost inflation outstrips the general price increase by a sizeable margin and is projected to rise a further 15pc by the end of the decade.</p><p>However, much can be blamed on the dead hand of bureaucracy, including a raft of new safety laws introduced after the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2026/02/25/dont-demolish-haunting-grenfell-wall-bereaved-families-call/\">Grenfell Tower tragedy</a> that killed 72 people in west London in 2017.</p><p>The new framework has led to huge delays. Inquiries by the Building Safety Regulator (BSR), established to regulate buildings of seven or more storeys, have added between 12 and 18 months to project timescales.</p><p>Separately, 77pc of new-build applications for these so-called “higher-risk buildings” tabled between late 2023 and early 2025 were rejected, deemed invalid or withdrawn, the BSR’s own data show. That is an astonishing failure rate in a country that built just 139,000 of the 300,000 homes – equivalent to 46pc – it needs to build annually to hit <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/03/10/minister-fails-to-guarantee-rayners-housebuilding-target-wi/\">Labour’s target of 1.5 million by 2029</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Industry sources also bemoan a raft of new legislation that has made landlordship less attractive, with the Renters’ Rights Act singled out as particularly burdensome.</p><p>Landlords warn that the regulations, scheduled to come into force in May this year, will make it harder to raise capital for new schemes and more difficult to value existing ones.</p><p>In December, the House of Lords industry and regulators committee warned: “The scale of the delays caused by the BSR has stretched far beyond the regulator’s statutory timelines for building control decisions.”</p><p>Baroness Taylor, the chairman of the committee, called the hold-ups “unacceptable”.</p><p>The Renters’ Rights Act is expected to act as an even bigger brake on development.</p><p>The new rules are designed to give tenants stronger rights but measures such as the abolition of “no-fault” evictions, limiting rent increases to once per year, the right to challenge any rent rise deemed unreasonable at a tribunal and even the right to keep a pet threaten to tip the scales far too heavily in the other direction.</p><p>Landlords understandably fear that the regulation, scheduled to come into force in May this year, will make it more difficult to raise capital for new schemes and harder to value existing ones. Many have reportedly already given up and exited the market.</p><p>As Richard Tice, the Reform deputy leader, neatly puts it, it is an example of “well-intentioned legislation that is having the opposite effect”. In other words, classic Labour under Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves.</p><p>Few would argue that the quality of high-rises, in particular, did not need drastic <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/07/10/grenfell-families-accuse-ministers-of-shameless-betrayal/\">improvement following Grenfell</a>. There are clearly also some rogue landlords out there, from whom vulnerable tenants need protection. But there’s little point in making housing safer if there is nowhere for people to live.</p></div></div></div></div>",

company’s plans.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Deal ‘in UK’s interests’</h2><p>On Friday, a spokesman for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero said Mr Miliband had published the deal to address “inaccurate claims and misinformation”.</p><p>The spokesman added: “The 2025 agreement provides a platform to share research and ideas between both countries, and, unlike the 2015 agreement, explicitly excludes co-operation on solar.</p><p>“As we have always said, it is in the UK’s interest to engage with the world’s largest emitter and one of our biggest trading partners to tackle the climate crisis and protect the British people.”</p><p>Last year, a report by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) argued that relying on China to hit Britain’s net zero targets <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/30/net-zero-reliance-on-china-poses-national-security-risk-lab/\">would pose a risk to

war.</p></div></div></div></div>",

Enquiries by the watchdog added between 12 and 18 months to project timescales last year.</p><p>Separately, 77pc of new-build applications for so-called “higher-risk buildings” – those over seven storeys high – tabled between late 2023 and early 2025 were rejected, deemed invalid or withdrawn, the BSR’s own data shows.</p><p>Industry sources also bemoan a raft of new legislation that has made it less attractive to be a landlord, with the Renters’ Rights Act singled out as particularly burdensome.</p><p>The new rules, designed to give tenants stronger rights, include the abolition of “no-fault” evictions, limiting rent increases to once per year, and the right to challenge any rent rise deemed unreasonable at a tribunal.</p><p>Landlords warn that the regulations, scheduled to come into force in May this year, will make it harder to raise capital for new schemes and more difficult to to value existing ones.</p><p>John Lewis’s decision to exit the housing business marks the latest move to roll back a strategy to diversify its business away from high street retail, championed by Dame Sharon White, its former chairman.</p><p>Dame Sharon set a target to make 40pc of profit from areas outside retail, including housing and financial services, by 2030, after she took over as chairman of the John Lewis Partnership in 2020.</p><p>However, by March 2024, John Lewis had scrapped that target following years of ballooning losses. At the time, it said it would turn around its business by pursuing a “relentless focus on retail”.</p><p>Dame Sharon stepped down as chairman of the partnership in September 2024 and was replaced by Tesco veteran Jason Tarry. He has been spending heavily on revamping tired John Lewis department stores and opening new Waitrose supermarkets, with the company investing £1.8m in stores.</p><p>Clive Black, a Shore Capital analyst, said: “John Lewis’s decision to enter the residential property market was noteworthy, not least because at the time the firm was notably <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/03/13/john-lewis-fights-to-win-back-middle-classes-lost-to-ms/\">struggling as a retailer</a>.</p><p>“Under Jason Tarry, sanity is now prevailing, so better and necessary focus upon the core, uplifting what is a premium retail business after all. Encouragingly, Waitrose is <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/08/waitrose-outperforms-rivals-for-fourth-month-running/\">showing good signs of progress</a> whilst there is renewed energy around John Lewis, which partners will be hoping augurs well.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Project setbacks</h2><p>The partnership had been developing three housing projects, one in Reading and two in London.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>In October, John Lewis received planning <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/09/john-lewis-build-reading-tower-block-nhs-opposition/\">approval for its rental home scheme in Reading</a>, following earlier approval in West Ealing, in west London, and Bromley, in south-east London.</p><p>The projects were part of its £500m, multi-decade joint venture with investment company Aberdeen, aimed at delivering around 1,000 new homes across the three locations.</p><p>Abedeen had initially said it would secure £500m from institutional investors for the projects, although that funding was never raised due to the tougher macro-economic conditions.</p><p>All three of the schemes faced setbacks, including local opposition to the level of affordable housing in the tower blocks and concerns from NHS officials about the capacity of nearby GP surgeries.</p><p>Previous analysis for the rental home schemes, seen by The Telegraph, suggested John Lewis risked spending more on constructing the flats than they would be worth. In 2023, The Telegraph revealed that its West Ealing project was set to deliver a negative return of £57m.</p><p>John Lewis argued at the time that it was able to take “a longer-term view”, saying that it wanted to “create as many affordable homes as we can for key workers such as nurses, teachers, the police and care providers”.</p><p>John Lewis always maintained that it wanted to “create hundreds of homes at a time; there’s a desperate need for more housing and local investment to support economic growth”.</p><p>The retailer is understood to be in talks with local authorities over the change to the schemes. It still needs to finalise consents before it can look at its options for the projects.</p><p>John Lewis is also withdrawing from its management of other rental homes. In its build-to-rent business, it manages a number of properties owned by Aberdeen. It said it would fulfil its existing management contracts before handing over to another manager.</p></div></div></div></div>",

You create up to 40,000 jobs, and 80pc of what we do is actually exported.”</p><p>The chief executive added: “So you increase exports, you improve economic growth significantly, and our estimation is actually this programme alone will create a gross value of more than £100bn.</p><p>“This is actually very good for the UK in terms of job creation and economic growth, and the company – the country – actually needs it.”</p><p>His remarks came as Rolls posted a 40pc rise in profits and announced it would return between £7bn and £9bn to shareholders from 2026 to 2028.</p><p>Shares initially jumped more than 8pc in early trading, although this later eased to around 4.9pc.</p><p>That followed an announcement that the company had exceeded previous turnaround targets set by Mr Erginbilgic, who took over in 2023 and has since led a significant recovery at the British engineering giant.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Rolls-Royce said profits last year leapt from £2.3bn to £3.4bn, after sales rose from £17.8bn to £20.1bn.</p><p>The company, which in aviation makes money from the number of “flying hours” its engines operate, is benefiting from the recovery of air travel as well as other major trends such as Western rearmament and the boom in demand for data centres.</p><p>Its business spans commercial jet engines, diesel generators and propulsion systems, defence systems (such as fighter jet engines), nuclear submarine reactors and nascent nuclear small modular reactors.</p><p>However, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/02/27/rolls-royce-hits-turnaround-targets-targets-two-years-early/\">Mr Erginbilgic’s turnaround</a> – which came after he warned the company was standing on a “burning platform” in the wake of the pandemic – has involved laying off some 2,500 workers and renegotiating loss-making contracts with airlines.</p><p>He said: “We are consistently achieving outcomes that were not possible before our transformation.</p><p>“With our new capabilities and mindset, we have navigated challenges from supply chain to tariffs and delivered a strong performance in 2025, all while we built the foundations for significant growth for years to come.”</p><p>On Mr Erginbilgic’s bid for support, he added: “This is a programme that the industrial strategy of the UK already identified as the most important programme.

But now the historic site may be revived thanks to an unlikely benefactor: Donald Trump.</p><p>The US president’s administration last week said it was willing to loan up to $225m (£165m) to developer Cornish Metals to support the mine’s reopening – so long as it agrees to send some of the output across the Atlantic.</p><p>Just two days earlier, and more than 4,600 miles away, a Washington-backed investment fund had announced a deal to acquire a 40pc share in a <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/03/trump-administration-9bn-copper-deal-challenge-china/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">copper and cobalt mine run by Glencore</a> in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>And in Western Australia, the US government has emerged as one of the backers of a scheme to build a new refinery that will produce gallium, a rare metal.</p><p>The investments follow a spate of dealmaking by the Trump administration at home in the past year – which has seen it take stakes in a magnet producer, a lithium mine and rare earth refineries – among other things.</p><p>According to experts, they are all examples of the new, more muscular approach Washington is taking to securing critical minerals abroad as it seeks to break China’s stranglehold over global supplies.</p><p>Tin, copper, cobalt and gallium are all commonly used in electronics, while lithium – known as “white gold” – is the main ingredient in batteries that power the modern world.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Rare earth magnets, meanwhile, are found in the spinning parts of wind turbines, electric motors and <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/12/24/the-tiny-british-company-that-outsmarted-xi-jinping/\">even fighter plane wing flaps</a>.</p><p>Without them, and a plethora of other metals, factory production lines across America would grind to a halt.</p><p>That briefly became a real prospect last year, when the US was locked in a trade standoff with China.</p><p>“One of the challenges we’ve had in the last 20 years in the United States is our mineral security efforts have largely been contained to handshake diplomacy,” says Gracelin Baskaran, a critical minerals expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).</p><p>“But handshake diplomacy doesn’t bring projects online. And it doesn’t yield minerals that can meet critical security interests.</p><p>“It’s the start, but what is the support that we need to get projects into production? It’s financing, it’s trade agreements, it’s off-take agreements [where a customer agrees to buy raw material before it is produced]. That is how we increase access to minerals.</p><p>“We’re going from paper agreements to deploying capital.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">US trailing China</h2><p>This is the thinking behind the dizzying series of deals announced by American officials in recent months.</p><p>Efforts to start directly nurturing alternative supplies began under Joe Biden but have accelerated under Trump, with investments made through several arms of the state – including the department of war, the department of energy, the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Exim) and the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC).</p><p>The DFC was the investor that supported Glencore’s copper and cobalt operations, while Exim has extended the offer of loans and financing to the tin project being developed by Cornish Metals.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Yet the Trump administration is still playing catch-up.</p><p>Chinese companies have been steadily building their control over key mining and refining operations for decades, giving Beijing the ability to turn off supplies to the rest of the world at will.</p><p>Take just one example: copper, the world’s most important industrial metal, used in electrical wiring, circuit boards and plumbing. Analysts predict the world is headed for a supply crunch in the coming years – and China is far better placed to weather it.</p><p>The Middle Kingdom’s companies control around 16pc of global copper production compared to 6pc owned by American firms, according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, and there have been calls in China to boost domestic stockpiles.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>“China has been doing this for a while, so this isn’t new for them,” says Albert Mackenzie, an analyst at Benchmark.</p><p>“The US may have looked at how they have built up their copper assets overseas, and is now trying to replicate that or not get left behind.</p><p>“There’s a big desire for more copper at the moment – you can point at AI, or to the energy transition, but actually it’s in basically everything we use because it’s such a good conductor.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Minerals monopoly</h2><p>While China has a grip on supply, its dominance of critical minerals is really about processing, with its share standing at over 50pc for a whole host of metals and exceeding 90pc for certain products.</p><p>This means that even though such metals may be mined in the US, Australia or elsewhere, they are still sent to China for refining.</p><p>Some 91pc of rare earth magnet metal refining and 94pc of global magnet production is concentrated in China, according to the International Energy Agency.</p><p>These are the magnets used in critical parts of the US military’s <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/21/the-tiny-magnets-threatening-americas-deadliest-jets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">F-35 stealth fighter</a>, as well as Tomahawk cruise missiles, navy destroyers and submarines, the Stinger portable missile and the M1 Abrams tank.</p><p>This leverage was brought into painful focus for Mr Trump last year, when he was forced to walk back his threats of trade tariffs after Beijing imposed export restrictions on heavy rare earths.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Ahead of his visit to China in April, the US president has now approved the creation of a $12bn critical mineral reserve, known as Project Vault, that will seek to guard US manufacturers against similar threats in future.</p><p>The initiative has been backed by captains of industry including the bosses of GE Vernova and Boeing.</p><p>“We don’t want to ever go through what we went through a year ago,” Mr Trump told reporters last week.</p><p>“Just as we have long had a strategic petroleum reserve and a stockpile of critical minerals for national defence, we’re now creating this reserve for American industry, so we don’t have any problems.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Security and stability</h2><p>The US administration has also been seeking to rally allies around an international network for developing critical mineral supplies outside of China.</p><p>Last week, vice-president JD Vance and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, hosted a critical minerals summit in Washington aimed at drumming up support for the initiative.</p><p>In a speech, Mr Rubio pointed out that the Chinese grip over supplies posed the same danger to all of America’s allies and urged them to work together.</p><p>“No country in the world has every critical mineral that’s valuable,” he said. “So it will rely on international cooperation.</p><p>“Right now, you have 90-something per cent of some of these elements controlled by one nation, one place. And that’s just not healthy for the global economy and it’s certainly not healthy for security and stability.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Along with the deals that have been announced, the White House has also vowed to back minerals producers with grants, loans and even “price floors” that will ensure they get paid a minimum amount for their minerals.</p><p>This is seen as vital because China’s producers receive large amounts of state support and can otherwise undercut competition from private Western firms.</p><p>Dominic Raab, the former Conservative deputy prime minister who now works with minerals investor Appian Capital Advisory, was in the room and says this change in mindset is key.</p><p>“There’s a recognition that it’s not a free market, it’s a broken market,” he says. “So they’re going to have to engage at a state level, but they also want to unlock private sector investment, and that’s important for de-risking those investments and unlocking more capital.”</p><p>Sophia Gaston, a geopolitics researcher at King’s College London, says the showdown with Beijing last year left Washington officials chastened by America’s “profound vulnerabilities on these supply chains”.</p><p>“China called the Trump administration’s bluff, and that forced America back to the negotiation table, and I think they felt extremely exposed by that, and wanted to move quickly to try and prevent that kind of situation happening again,” she says.</p><p>“There’s been a very intense flurry of activity, because Donald Trump is pencilled in for a visit to Beijing in April. So I think he wants to feel he’s going into that conversation with the maximum leverage.</p><p>“Until that critical minerals and rare earths diversification strategy starts to come into view, that’s going to be difficult – because there will always be a feeling that China can turn off the tap.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

We’ve gone from flickering black-and-white boxes that took a good 30 seconds to warm up and served up just one channel, to widescreen <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/tech/best-oled-tvs/\">OLED smart devices</a> that stream thousands of choices of “content” (though, ironically, they still often take a good 30 seconds to start up).</p><p>But the actual shows? Although they look very different, the genres of TV drama have stayed remarkably steady over all that time. Flick through the TV listings from any year over the decades, and you will find crime shows, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/the-pitt-hbo-max-sky-noah-wyle-uk-release/\">medical shows</a>, soaps, sci-fi, costume drama, historical series, and so on. There’s not all that great a gap between <em>Emergency Ward 10</em> and <em>Casualty</em>. There’s only one kind of drama series that you will find in a 1966 edition of <em>TV Times</em> that you won’t see while scrolling through your EPG in 2026 (excluding westerns, which were obviously never a British concern anyway). I’m talking about business TV.</p><p>There used to be many of these series: <em>The Brothers</em>, <em>The Power Game,</em> <em>The Plane Makers</em>, <em>Mogul</em>, <em>The Troubleshooters</em>. These were gripping stories of men (and it was overwhelmingly men) striding into each others’ offices, pouring whiskies, sparking up cigars, and obsessing over boards, stocks and shares, new products and processes. Women did feature, but until the Eighties they were the wives and secretaries that orbited like satellites around the boardrooms and factory floors where the main events played out.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Now, I will hear you object that boardroom business drama survives – <em>Succession</em> or <em>Industry</em>, for example. The big difference between these modern shows and their forebears is that they aren’t really concerned with the actual business of the business, except where it directly affects the drama between the characters.</p><p><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/succession\"><em>Succession</em></a> didn’t have a storyline about the design of a product – you can’t imagine scenes with Shiv or Roman unfurling plans across a big teak table, or lengthy discussions about the pros and cons of the fuel injection nozzle or whatever. No, <em>Succession</em> is more the inheritor of the <em>Dallas</em> model, the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/succession-owes-depravity-ancient-rome/\">high-glamour soap</a> in which the actual work in hand is merely the convenient backdrop.</p><p>The true business TV drama of old portrayed the actual business as dramatic in itself. The heyday of the form was 1963’s <em>The Plane Maker</em>s, the story of an aviation design firm which after three series reinvented itself in 1965 as <em>The Power Game</em>, shifting its anti-hero John Wilder (Patrick Wymark) to a merchant bank. The tensions of manufacture, negotiations and industrial relations were depicted in detail that seems baffling today.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>There is a sense of great public interest in business in other shows of the time. Early <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2020/04/06/honor-blackman-avengers-james-bond-star-obituary/\">Honor Blackman</a> episodes of <em>The Avengers</em> feature Steed and Mrs Gale investigating chicanery at works making pottery and optical lenses, and trying to expose export licences for counterfeit packaging. It’s all very unusual to 21st-century eyes.</p><p>The Wymark model – the tycoon stomping about, all blood and thunder, in his executive suite – became such an established part of TV that <em>Fry and Laurie </em>would spoof it in their John and Peter sketches: “Damn it to damnation, triple blast, John, I want to know what the hell is going on!”</p><p>The sometimes strained and phoney scene-setting dialogue of the genre – as we pick up the characters before the meat of the scene – was also brilliantly lampooned by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/victoria-wood/\">Victoria Wood</a>, who opens a visit to Acorn Antiques with Miss Babs pointing at blank sheets of paper and telling Miss Berta, “Yes, that’s much better – if we deliver these antiques on Friday morning, we can take delivery of these antiques in the afternoon.”</p><p>By the Seventies, the genre had become so established that it started generating oddities of its own. <em>Hine</em>, from 1971, is a fascinatingly weird one-off, created by <em>Power Game</em> writer Wilfred Greatorex (what a fantastic “Dammit, Marjorie!” name that is).</p><p><em>Hine </em>starred the personable Barrie Ingham as the titular hero, who is a freelance international arms dealer. Viewers were baffled – were we really meant to be rooting for this charming chap in his attempts to sell British weapons to dictatorships in the Middle East? – and the show flopped. It stands now as a fascinatingly amoral glimpse into a hidden world.</p><p>The episode “The Old School Noose” by Arden Winch (another great moniker and nothing to do with the workwear firm of the same name), in which Hine is caught in an elaborate web involving his childhood best friend who is now a Labour MP, is one of those exquisite pieces of dramatic writing and acting that occasionally startles you in a vintage “hack-for-hire” series.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>So what became of the “pure” business drama? The last British example I can think of that still retained elements of it was Eighties super-soap <em>Howards’ Way</em>, the BBC’s <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/return-of-80s-workwear-fashion/\">answer to <em>Dynasty</em></a>. Much of the action in its initial stages revolved around the design and production of a new racing boat, and the dilemma between using hand-crafted or machine-made mouldings. Try pitching that to <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/04/10/mps-call-for-netflix-tax-to-protect-british-tv/\">Netflix</a>. But fairly soon this faded into the background, swallowed up by the ins and outs of Relton Marine, Leisurecruise, the House of Howard, and which character owned what percentage of them.</p><p>In fact, in the Nineties, business started infecting our less glam soaps. When I worked as a writer on <em>Coronation Street</em>, Fiona Middleton – aged 21! – owned the salon, while <em>Brookside</em>’s teenage entrepreneur Jacqui Dixon had fingers in investment pies everywhere, and in<em> EastEnders</em> Sharon Watts became Walford’s answer to Howard Hughes. These may have been intended as inspiring messages of female empowerment, but they were both highly unlikely and difficult for viewers to identify with.</p><p>The simple answer to the mystery of business TV’s decline is that Britain stopped manufacturing things. There are currently politicians on all sides mooting the return of long-defunct industries to our land. In the unlikely event that they succeed, perhaps once again viewers will see people slamming down tumblers of Scotch and bellowing at their secretaries, damn it!</p></div></div></div></div>",

It took rescuers another 18 hours to find their bodies, and for Igor to identify them.</p><p>What ripped the Khudyo family apart on April 24, 2025, was a KN-23 ballistic missile. And, at the heart of that tragedy, helping power the missile, there may have been a British microchip.</p><p>Fired by Russia, it struck a residential block in Kyiv’s Sviatoshynskyi district, murdering twelve Ukrainians as they slept.</p><p>After the attack, Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, said the weapon responsible for orphaning Yana contained 116 Western-made components.</p><p>Little additional detail was given.</p><p>The type of North Korean missile used in the strike has been found to contain British-made converters, according to Ukrainian investigators. </p><div></div><p>It is one of thousands of Russian weapons that use Western – including British – dual-use military-grade components. Dual-use devices have both military and civilian use, meaning they can be used as easily in a computer as in a missile.</p><p>When Igor arrived at the site of the devastation, about 20 minutes after the strike, he saw his childhood home in smithereens.  </p><p>“I started desperately calling out to my mother, my father, to Daniel and to Yana,” he said from his apartment just outside Kyiv. </p><p>“The mobile phones of the dead were ringing, but no one was picking up,” he continued as we sat in darkness caused by Russian air strikes.</p><p>“I tried to call Yana and when I heard her pick up the phone I knew she was alive. But there was no sound.</p><p>“She sent me a text which said ‘I am under rubble, I am dying’ and her rough location.</p><div></div><p>“I started frantically searching, despite Shahed drones circling overhead, until finally I heard her calling out to me from beneath the destruction.”</p><p>Yana had been thrown from her bed and trapped under a cupboard. </p><p>She was operated on twice. “I found out my parents had died on Instagram while I was in the hospital,” she said.</p><p>“The psychologist was meant to tell me, but it was all over social media by the time I woke up from my surgeries.”</p><p>The impact of this experience on her is clear.</p><p>“I want to join the military [when I am 18],” she said proudly.</p><p>“This is the only future I see for myself because I want to be part of the people fighting for their land and their parents. I want to become a hero for Ukraine.”</p><p>With 16,000 international trading restrictions in place in Russia, how could British-made parts have found their way into Russia’s deadly arsenal, and why are sanctions not working?</p><div></div><p>The Telegraph and the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation (CFHK), a human rights watchdog, are exposing how middlemen in Hong Kong have shipped thousands of dual-use components worth millions of dollars from Western Europe to Russia.</p><p>Campaigners want the Government to open an urgent “investigation” into how British parts reportedly ended up in weapons used against Ukraine, and to “close any loopholes” around pre-existing laws.</p><p>On Sept 7, 2024, a North Korean KN-23/24 ballistic missile with the serial number 312518759 was shot down in the villages of Myrne and Bilyky, Poltava Oblast, Ukraine.</p><p>It was one of 60 KN-23 or Hwasong 11A missiles supplied to Putin by Kim Jong-un and launched that year.</p><p>Buried among the rubble and shrapnel, investigators said they found two products labeled as coming from the British company XP Power: a DC/DC converter and a power converter.</p><p>Converters transfer direct currents from one voltage level to another and are commonly used to stabilise, boost, or lower a voltage within a machine.</p><div></div><p>XP Power, which has headquarters in Reading, Berks, said converters allegedly found in Russian weapons were either counterfeit or “sold before the invasion”. The firm has not provided any additional detail or evidence to support these assertations.</p><p>Both chips recovered in the rubble were allegedly manufactured in 2023, a year after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine, and after XP Power said it had ceased trading with Russia.  </p><p>Russian customs data from 2022-2024, obtained by CFHK and reviewed by The Telegraph, found that 799 XP Power-labelled cargoes valued at around $2.5m (£1.8m) had been imported by Russia. It is not clear how XP Power-labelled devices ended up in North Korea. </p><p>It is unknown where exactly the missiles containing the XP Power-branded converters were made in North Korea. The country expanded its missile production capactity in 2024. The Ryongsong Machine Complex in the Hamhung region is a key factory where these weapons are built.</p><div></div><p>The CFHK figures, which come from tracking the sale and shipments of high-risk goods to sanctioned countries, suggest almost half were sent via Hong Kong to electronic supply companies Woeroon Electronic Sourcing Limited, SSP LTS and Imaxchip. None of these companies responded to requests for comment.</p><p>It is not clear if these companies were seeking to breach sanctions, or if they were aware these shipments might be used by the Russian military.</p><p>XP Power disputed CFHK's findings, stating that “all orders from customers and shipments to customers are thoroughly checked for sanctioned countries and companies”.</p><p>The company said it had “never traded” directly with Woeroon, SSP LTS, Imaxchip or any of the companies named in the shipment data.</p><div></div><p>There is no suggestion that XP had any knowledge of where its components would end up, and no evidence the company was complicit in sending parts to Ukraine.</p><p>But it is common for middleman businesses committing sanctions evasion to pass dual-use stock from company to company.</p><p>“Naturally, we have less visibility of sales that might pass through a number of hands in the supply chain,” a spokesman for XP Power accepted.</p><p>She added: “We have stringent export controls in place and take our responsibilities under the various sanction regimes very seriously – after the invasion in February 2022, we immediately stopped all shipments to Russia.  </p><p>“We take our obligations in this area very seriously and we will continue to work with others in the supply chain to ensure their controls are as tight as ours.</p><p>“All of our sales contracts now include clauses to specifically prohibit onward sale or re-exporting to Russia.”</p><div></div><p>It is not just the KN-23 missile that has been found to contain British-made hardware.</p><p>British components have also been found in deadly Shahed drones, First-Person View drones, guided missiles and scores of other weapons launched by the Russian military into Ukraine.</p><p>In total, Ukrainian investigators have found 41 British-made components on the battlefield since the start of the war in 2022.  </p><div></div><p>On Dec 1 last year, the Ukrainian military downed a newly modified Geran-2 or Shahed attack drone carrying an R-60 infrared guided AAM (Air-to-Air Missile) on a top-mounted rail launcher.</p><p>On Jan 12 2026, Ukraine brought down a Geran-2 or Shahed UAV with Verba MPADS (man-portable air defence system).</p><p>In both cases, investigators said they found a British-made Raspberry Pi microcomputer in the drone.</p><p>When contacted, Raspberry Pi said it was aware that its products had been “diverted through third-party supply chains” and used in Russian drones.</p><p>The tech firm said that “diversion can occur via complex and opaque chains of onward sale in jurisdictions where visibility is limited”.</p><div></div><p>A spokesman for the company added: “Raspberry Pi complies fully with all applicable UK, EU and international sanctions regimes and operates controls designed to track and prevent diversion to Russia or the Russian defence sector.</p><p>“The company does not disclose the detailed mechanics of its anti-diversion processes.”</p><p>Campaigners said this was not good enough.</p><p>Samuel Bickett, a former political prisoner in Hong Kong and co-author of CFHK’s report, said: “British manufacturers of components used in Russian weapons are not doing enough to control the flow of these goods across the world.</p><p>TT Electronics in Woking, Surrey, looks like any other grey, industrial manufacturing business.</p><div></div><p>According to its website, it makes advanced electronics for “aerospace, defence, healthcare, automation and electrification”.</p><p>It has 19 manufacturing sites across Britain, China, North America and Thailand.</p><p>Ukrainian investigators say they have found 11 transistors manufactured by TT Electronics in automated radio jammers and transmitter interference devices used by the Russians on the battlefield.</p><p>Between 2022 and 2024, documents reviewed by CFHK suggest that Russia received 59 imports of TT Electronics-labelled components with a declared value of $1.2m. Around 40 per cent of these shipments, worth $700,000, went via Hong Kong.</p><p>Hong Kong has become an increasingly important hub for sanctions evasion used by foreign governments seeking to dodge Western embargoes. </p><div></div><p>The TT Electronics shipments were imported by four Hong Kong-based traders and logistics firms, including companies associated with the electronics supplier Woeroon. </p><p>Woeroon, which made 25,707 shipments to Russia between 2022 and 2024, is a collective of several unrelated companies. </p><p>Sir Iain Duncan Smith, co-chairman of the Interparliamentary Alliance on China, said: “This Government is turning out to be a lapdog to China.</p><p>“It is China and the CCP-controlled Hong Kong that is allowing dual-use components into Russia.</p><p>“Sanction evasion has been going on for a while and it is absolutely wrong for the government to turn a blind eye to it.</p><p>“The British Government doesn’t seem to care when the sanctions we are meant to be imposing are not being enforced at all.

But a rapid shift to electric that both carmakers and politicians had hoped for has failed to materialise. “Many drivers are still not comfortable making the shift,” says Muñoz.</p><p>At the same time, net zero regulations are beginning to bite in the UK and Europe – with companies facing fines if they cannot meet <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/06/britains-ev-targets-risk-creating-severe-disruption-hyundai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">increasingly stretching targets</a> – just as low-price competitors from China have arrived to undercut them.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Many of those Chinese manufacturers are themselves trying to outrun a crisis, as<a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/06/18/chinas-electric-car-revolution-is-eating-itself/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> sales at home grind to a halt</a>.</p><p>All across the world, a grim reality for carmakers is setting in: drivers simply don’t want EVs in the volume they hoped.</p><p>“The plans they set out were too ambitious – and what we’re seeing now is the reality,” says Munoz.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Covid-era subsidies</h2><p>Much of today’s mess can be traced back to the heady days of the pandemic, when strange things were happening in the car market.</p><p>As the spreading coronavirus shut down factories around the world and governments panicked, subsidies were lavished on electric cars to try to support the flagging automotive industry.</p><p>This also came as central banks across Europe were slashing interest rates to boost their flagging economies, which made borrowing cheaper.</p><p>At one stage, it was so cheap to buy an electric car in Germany that models such as the Renault Zoe or even the Mercedes-Benz EQC crossover could be leased for less than the price of a mobile phone contract.</p><p>At the same time, governments were strengthening net zero policies. In Britain, the then prime minister Boris Johnson announced a <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/environment/2020/11/17/sales-new-petrol-diesel-cars-banned-2030/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ban on the sale of new petrol cars by 2030</a>; in America, Joe Biden proposed a $174bn stimulus package for EVs.</p><p>Tesla, the electric carmaker founded by Elon Musk, was also being eyed enviously by its more traditional rivals – as sales of its Model 3 and Model Y cars grew rapidly.</p><p>EV sales were being supported by a sharp rise in petrol prices that followed the outbreak of the Ukraine war, which made EVs look cheaper relative to internal combustion engine (ICE) cars.</p><p>Against this backdrop, things only seemed to be heading in one direction.</p><p>In response, many car companies announced ambitious plans to electrify their line-ups.</p><p>Jaguar Land Rover announced that Jaguar would become <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/02/15/land-rover-goes-electric-new-boss-reshapes-jaguar/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">an “all-electric” brand by 2025</a>. Ford pledged to completely electrify by 2030, while VW doubled its end-of-decade target for EV sales from 35pc to 70pc.</p><p>But in the years since those announcements, EV sales have slowed as many of the temporary factors that boosted the market have receded.</p><p><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/04/23/petrol-price-above-150p-first-time-five-months/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Petrol prices</a> have fallen from their peaks, interest rates have climbed and governments have reduced grants available to drivers.</p><p>In the US, meanwhile, Donald Trump has removed the generous Biden-era subsidies, dismissing the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/07/18/bp-abandons-us-wind-farms-trump-shuns-green-energy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">green energy transition is a “scam”</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>It has forced manufacturers to walk back or delay most of their pledges – and to announce costly write-downs.</p><p>Ben Nelmes, of the New Automotive consultancy, says: “One of the big things that drives car companies is what all their competitors are doing.</p><p>“So when Tesla was really taking off in those years, there was this big rush to try and recreate its success.</p><p>“But a lot of those targets and [government] regulations have since been either watered down or rolled back.</p><p>“The car industry was also really hoping that sales volumes globally would go back to where they were pre-pandemic – and in most cases, that just hasn’t really happened.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">EVs are not ‘good value for money’</h2><p>Perhaps the biggest reason sales of EVs haven’t been as strong as hoped is price.</p><p>In Europe, the EV cost nearly €63,000 in 2024 compared with around €51,000 for an internal combustion engine car, according to analysis by Jato Dynamics. This is despite predictions that falling battery prices would lead to similar price drops for cars.</p><p>As a result, European sales of EVs have so far struggled to break past the 20pc mark.</p><p>By comparison, EVs in China have reached parity in cost with ICE cars – at about €22,000 on average – and now account for around 50pc of all new car sales. This has been achieved in no small part thanks to generous subsidies from Beijing.</p><p>Andy Palmer, a veteran car industry executive known as the “Godfather” of EVs for his role in developing Nissan’s popular Leaf model, blames Western manufacturers for failing to invest in affordable models.</p><p>In the US and Europe, too many brands have focused on pricier – and more profitable – SUV models rather than cheaper city cars, he says.</p><p>“I think the fundamental issue is that the cars are too expensive and they are being compensated by subsidies, and that ultimately doesn’t work,” he says.</p><p>“You’ve got to get parity of cost with ICE cars. And EVs have got to offer more than simply they’re clean.</p><p>“They’ve got to offer basically good value for money, they’ve got to offer something different in terms of the user experience, rather than simply being a copy of ICE cars.</p><p>“That’s where the Chinese have got it right. The Chinese have pitched their EV prices at parity, if not cheaper, and they are adopting at rates that give huge economies of scale.”</p><p>With EV sales failing to take off in the way that was hoped, even the watered-down electric car mandates in Europe are starting to look challenging for manufacturers.</p><p>In the UK, for example, the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate required 28pc of new car sales to be electric last year compared with the 23.9pc actually achieved by the industry.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The target rises again to 33pc this year and gradually ratchets up to 80pc by 2030, when sales of new pure petrol and diesel car sales will be banned outright. By 2035, hybrids are likely to go the same way.</p><p>Car companies, led by the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), are urging a rethink, arguing that they are having to withdraw petrol cars from sale and discount their EVs heavily just to avoid punishing fines already.</p><p>Xavier Martinet, the president of Hyundai’s European business, recently said the Government needed a “reality check”, or risk some carmakers pulling out of the UK altogether.</p><p>“If you don’t sell EVs, you might not even do the ICE sales,” <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/06/britains-ev-targets-risk-creating-severe-disruption-hyundai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he told The Telegraph</a> this month. “So what will customers buy, at the end of the day? That’s a major question.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Range anxiety</h2><p>In the UK, there’s another barrier to adoption: infrastructure.</p><p>For many drivers, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/hybrid-electric-cars/poll-of-the-week-electric-cars-inferior/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">range anxiety remains a worry</a> despite the growing mileage of newer electric cars. This is why the Government has set out targets to boost the number of chargers nationally to more than 300,000 by 2030.</p><p>But the charger rollout has been criticised repeatedly for being patchy and too focused on London and the South East, with a House of Lords report in 2024 warning that ministers needed to “turbocharge” the rollout.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Instead, charging companies complain that they have still faced a menagerie of problems that were avoidable and are slowing down the rollout.</p><p>Securing planning permission on many sites remains too time-consuming, according to industry body ChargeUK, while funding through local authority-run schemes has been hit by delays.</p><p>Most significantly, charging providers have been hit by by high network costs. These are fees charged to businesses to fund the maintenance and expansion of the electricity grid – and they have been rising rapidly in recent years.</p><p>The network charges depend on the capacity of a site, or how many chargers it has, meaning that companies are effectively punished for doing what the Government wants and building bigger charging stations.</p><p>In one case, a national provider told The Telegraph that its network charges for a single site had rocketed from about £80 a year in 2020 to nearly £40,000 per year today.</p><p>This is pushing up the cost of public charging, which is already far more expensive than home charging – increasing the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/01/01/britains-driveway-divide-killing-case-for-electric-cars/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“driveway divide”</a> between households who have their own charger and those that don’t.</p><p>According to Zapmap, the cost of charging at home is as little as 8.5 pence per kilowatt hour compared with 54 pence at public chargers.</p><p>Some charging companies are responding by cutting investment or building batteries on their sites to reduce reliance on the grid. The Telegraph revealed that the annual number of charger installations <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/12/31/electric-car-charger-installations-fall-for-first-time/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fell for the first time in 2025</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Signs of financial pressure are also emerging.</p><p>A string of deals was announced last week to combine various EV charging providers, including a merger of Mer with Octopus Energy-backed Be.EV.</p><p>That follows takeovers of Trojan Energy and SureCharge by larger providers Connected Kerb and Shell-Unitricity respectively. Industry executives think more such deals are on the way.</p><p>The strain on the sector is why charging companies have been urging ministers not to relax the ZEV mandate – even as car manufacturers say the targets are punishing high.</p><p>Jarrod Birch, of industry body ChargeUK, says: “Charging businesses have committed £6bn in private investment underpinned by the certainty and confidence offered by the ZEV mandate.</p><p>“Weakening or delaying the mandate – reviewed and adjusted less than 12 months ago – would undermine that confidence and the UK’s general ability to attract investment and deliver growth.</p><p>“Investors need to know that binding targets will remain binding, not shift in the wind.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Chinese carmakers race to dominance</h2><p>All these headwinds are bad enough on their own. But what could have been a significant headache for Western carmakers is fast becoming a full-blown crisis as new <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/11/ford-overtaken-byd-boost-chinese-car-ambitions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese competitors are rapidly expanding</a> in the market.</p><p>Brands such as BYD, SAIC, Chery, Geely, XPeng, NIO and Leapmotor have had their research, development and production backed by the state – allowing them to take greater risks and put their foot on the accelerator.</p><p>Beijing has also supported a rapid rollout of charging infrastructure, and until recently was lavishing subsidies on consumers at home to buy electric cars.</p><p>From an almost standing start, the Chinese carmakers have raced to dominance.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>In 2020, Chinese drivers bought 900,000 battery-electric cars and 200,000 plug-in hybrids. In 2024, sales were 6.4 million and 4.9 million, respectively.</p><p>EVs now account for more than half of all car sales, and almost every EV sold is a Chinese brand.</p><p>Western carmakers haven’t been able to keep up in this race, and it is starting to show. Geely last year became the second Chinese carmaker after BYD to overtake Volkswagen in the Chinese market.</p><p>The German carmaker’s joint ventures with state-owned FAW and SAIC had a combined market share of 11pc last year, about half its former peak.</p><p>As Chinese buyers become more patriotic – Porsche sales have nosedived there – VW will work with its partner to make China-friendly models.</p><p>The likes of General Motors and Toyota are also losing ground in the world’s biggest market. They are either failing to launch EVs quickly enough, or not pricing them cheaply enough.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Boom years are over</h2><p>It is not just Western brands hurting in China, however. The domestic boom has started to turn sour for local manufacturers too.</p><p>Subsidies ensure that the factory lines keep churning, but the queue of buyers is getting shorter. The market’s low-hanging fruit has been picked, just as weak labour and property markets have sapped consumer confidence.</p><p>With a glut of unsold cars and a dearth of buyers, the industry has resorted to steep discounting to keep shifting stock.</p><p>The China Automobile Dealers Association estimates that this price war wiped more than 471bn yuan (£50bn) from the carmakers’ revenue in the past three years.</p><p>The strategy is barely working: BYD’s sales in January were half those a year ago, and previous high-flyer Xpeng reported a third decline.</p><p>In February, investors began shedding their holdings in the listed companies, fearing the boom years might be over.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Beijing sat up and took notice. For more than a year, the Chinese authorities used public statements and meetings with executives to criticise the carmakers for their “race to the bottom”, known in China as “involution”.</p><p>But their words went unheeded, and last week the state administration for market regulation banned the industry from selling vehicles below production cost.</p><p>Cosimo Ries, of analysis firm Trivium China, isn’t convinced that even this will stop the price war. And as losses mount, he says, the smaller players will fight back, and they’ll be backed by local and regional governments who don’t want to see their champion fail.</p><p>He Xiaopeng, the boss of XPeng, agrees: “The competition in the auto market in 2026 will be even more brutal and bloody,” he said recently.</p><p>The Chinese carmakers’ domestic struggles are not good news for their Western rivals.</p><p>With unsold stocks piling up, BYD and its brethren are turning to a familiar option for glut-stricken Chinese firms: pump and dump offshore.</p><p>BYD said last week it was planning to boost exports by 25pc this year. In January alone, BYD’s German sales surged more than tenfold, with Dolphin hatchbacks outselling Teslas by two to one.</p><p>Britain is fertile ground, as it hasn’t thrown up a tariff wall. BYD quadrupled its sales last year and entered the top 20 brands last year, outselling Mini, Mazda and Tesla.</p><p>Greece and Italy are also proving to be attractive markets. One in every seven EVs sold in Europe last year was a Chinese import, when cars made in China by Western companies are included.</p><p>“The speed at which the European consumer has adopted Chinese cars is much faster than our adoption of Japanese or Korean cars. That is a bit worrying from the perspective of a Western automotive company,” says Niklas Brundin, a partner at consulting firm Arthur D Little.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>One industry veteran says that since the UK and Europe are mature car markets, companies tend to grow only by taking market share from somebody else.</p><p>“A few years ago there were about 40 major car brands in the UK, and by the end of the decade there’ll be something like 75. There isn’t enough growth in the market to support that,” he says.</p><p>“Those extra 35 brands are going to have to take the share from somebody, and that’s going to result in a lot higher competitive intensity. And none of the Chinese companies are coming here to be a player with a 1pc market share.”</p><p>In other words, a fight to the death has begun.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Europe fights back</h2><p>Faced with an onslaught from agile, cutting-edge Chinese companies backed by state subsidies, the initial response from Europe has been to shelter behind a <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/09/13/eu-pushback-china-flood-cheap-electric-cars/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Brussels tariff wall</a>. But its defences look weak.</p><p>Chinese companies have responded by switching to selling more hybrid vehicles and setting up factories within Europe.</p><p>Matthias Schmidt, an automotive expert, reckons a fightback is coming. In the next year, he predicts the incumbent Western brands will start bringing cheaper models to market, using the cheaper lithium iron phosphate battery technology that powers the Chinese brands.</p><p>“We’re expecting to see prices for consumers fall and price parity be met,” he says.</p><p>Because the EVs will then be more commercially viable, “it will be in the manufacturers’ interests to push those vehicles, not just to meet regulatory guidelines but because eventually they will become more profitable”.</p><p>But for this strategy to fly, the EV market has to reawaken. And here, industry reckons the Government must work harder – or at least smarter.</p><p>The EU and the British Government are trying to force the industry to go all-electric by the mid-2030s. But it is becoming clear that not enough motorists are on board with EVs to keep this target on track.</p><p>Governments have had differing responses to this dawning reality.</p><p>The Trump administration has executed a volte-face, forcing American carmakers to wear heavy losses on their EV investments.</p><p>Brussels is poised to <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/12/07/labour-urged-to-delay-petrol-car-ban-as-eu-pushes-ev-target/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">water down its targets and standards</a>. But a reform package outlined late last year was criticised by industry as complex, incomplete and insufficient – and not enough to fend off the Chinese.</p><p>Britain is undertaking a lengthy review of its targets that require carmakers to shift an increasing proportion of their sales to EVs. Often, carmakers can only meet these targets by selling unwanted EVs at a loss.</p><p>“The regulatory trajectories are really steep. It’s so much ahead of that underlying demand that it’s putting huge financial pressure on the industry,” says Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.</p><p>“We’re not denying the aspiration, the ambition – but it’s making sure it’s deliverable in a timescale that’s affordable for consumers and affordable for businesses.”</p><p>Rather than make it more affordable, Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, has announced a new tax of 3p a mile for EVs from 2028, or 1.5p for plug-in hybrid drivers.</p><p>On the other side of the ledger, the Government introduced a grant for EV buyers, but only about a quarter of models will qualify.</p><p>“For the industry and especially for the consumer, it’s mixed messages,” Hawes says. “At a time when you need to be pulling every lever to try and bolster that consumer demand, instead it’s two steps forward, one step back.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘Model T moment’</h2><p>The EV bubble that inflated in the first half of this decade has well and truly burst. But the technology is not going away.</p><p>Even Ford, despite its huge losses, remains committed to electric cars. Jim Farley, the company’s boss, has said its back-to-basics “Universal Electric Vehicle” platform – built by engineers from the ground up – is the most important product he has ever worked on.</p><p>It will be the basis of a new effort to crack the mass market, with Ford reportedly aiming for cars that can sell in the consumer sweet spot of $30,000 to $35,000.</p><p>Andrew Bergbaum, an automotive expert at AlixPartners, says this kind of ground-up overhaul is ultimately needed to bring down the cost of Western-made EVs.</p><p>Farley has claimed that cracking EVs could deliver a modern “Model T moment” – a reference to the best-selling car that made the company’s name in the early 1900s.</p><p>“This is us going back to our roots,” he told Auto Car in January. “As Wolfgang Puck said, ‘A lot of people could run a four or five-star restaurant; not many people can do a good buffet in Las Vegas.’</p><p>“We learned so much being an early mover in EVs and a full-line manufacturer. We learned a lot about where we need to put our capital.”</p><p>To critics, it looks like an extremely expensive lesson.</p></div></div></div></div>",

S&amp;P had previously given both the divisions BB- ratings.</p><p>The ratings agency forecast a drop in Ineos’s earnings, warning of even lower credit ratings to come if the company is unable to get the ratio of its £18bn debt pile below six and a half times the level of its underlying profits.</p><p>S&amp;P said Ineos was facing turmoil from “challenging trading conditions” around the world for the petrochemical sector, which is vital for oil and gas production.</p><p>“The petrochemical industry is currently grappling with significant overcapacity, primarily driven by aggressive capacity expansions in China outpacing weak global demand,” the rating agency told investors.</p><p>The downgrade adds to the mounting problems for the Manchester United co-owner, who has faced criticism this month for <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/12/farage-backs-ratcliffe-over-claims-uk-colonised-by-immigran/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">his comments on immigration</a>.</p><p>Sir Jim, a resident of Monaco and worth an estimated £17bn, said he was sorry for offending “some people” after he said Britain was being “colonised by immigrants”.

It took losses in the last two years to more than £1bn.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Around £5bn of Ineos’s debt burden was trading at, or close to, distressed levels on Thursday.</p><p>S&amp;P reduced its forecasts for underlying profits at two subsidiaries of Ineos, adding that it expected any improvements to be driven by savings and lower costs from restructuring the business.</p><p>Around £2.5bn of loans issued by Ineos’s US finance vehicle were trading around 82 cents on the dollar on Thursday, while a further £2bn attached to its Quattro division was slightly above 70 cents – the level at which the market believes there is a considerable risk of a default.</p><p>S&amp;P said: “Despite projected improvements in 2026, we believe that leverage will remain high, which we now view as commensurate with the current rating.”</p><p>The update from S&amp;P marks the latest in a <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/16/sir-jim-ratcliffes-chemicals-empire-suffers-debt-downgrade/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">series of downgrades by debt ratings agencies</a> that risk compounding Ineos’s financial strain by making it more expensive to borrow.</p><p>Moody’s has lowered its rating on Ineos twice since September. The most recent downgrade in December followed publication of the company’s financial results.</p><p>Moody’s said there had been “continued and greater than expected deterioration” in Ineos’s operating performance. Revenues declined 20pc and pre-tax earnings plunged 55pc.</p><p>Ineos was contacted for comment.</p></div></div></div></div>",

It primarily describes services like Google (a shadow of its former useful self) and Royal Mail (now trying to shirk its Saturday rounds like an idle paper boy), but it applies just as much to products – such as the rapidly worsening Microsoft Windows, throwaway domestic appliances and, yes, food.</p><p>I only need to type the words “Dairy Milk” or “Creme Egg” for you to know what I mean. Cadbury is probably ensh-ttification’s most notorious victim, its products having steadily worsened since being bought out by US giant Kraft (now Mondelēz International) in 2010. But flip over any of your favourite packets (likely smaller anyway thanks to “<a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/06/18/drinkflation-brewers-weak-beer-inflation-cost-cutting/\">shrinkflation</a>”) and you’ll notice similar patterns on the label – cost-cutting tweaks to established recipes, substitution of quality ingredients for cheaper ones and, often, outsourcing of production to foreign factories.</p><p><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/03/26/controversial-ingredient-putin-putting-back-plate/\">Palm oil</a> – the cheapest edible fat manufacturers can use – is everywhere. Cocoa content is falling, as is the percentage of olive oil in vegetable spreads. Pesto manufacturers are using cashews instead of more expensive pine nuts, and other hard cheeses in place of Parmesan. Ribena has a little less blackcurrant in it, Blue Riband is technically no longer a chocolate bar and Yeo Valley’s spreadable butter has just a little bit less actual butter in it. Across the board, guacamole delivers less avocado, sausages contain less pork and ready meals from almost all supermarkets are having their meat content slowly but noticeably reduced, to be replaced with cheaper filler.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>It’s been described as a race to the bottom. Regulatory factors such as the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/09/06/sugar-tax-drinks-rachel-reeves-autumn-budget-labour/\">sugar tax</a> contribute to this phenomenon in some circumstances, as do environmental pressures, ingredient shortages and operational considerations, but – as with all other types of ensh-ttification – this is mostly about money. Selling less of a cheaper product for a higher retail price means much better returns than leaving recipes unchanged.</p><p>Kudos, then, to these so-far-untouched favourites. Let us know your go-to British foods in the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"#with-sweets\">comments section below</a>.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Bird’s Custard Powder</h2></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Developed by Alfred Bird in Birmingham, because his wife was allergic to eggs, Bird’s custard powder retains its straightforward, vegan ingredient list of cornflour, salt, natural flavouring and annatto (the plant-derived food colouring) after almost two full centuries. It isn’t identical to the 1830s prototypes but it isn’t far off, and, unlike almost every other product in the pudding aisle, it doesn’t contain palm or shea oil, sweeteners or alphabet-soup emulsifiers.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Lyle’s Golden Syrup</h2></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Owner Tate &amp; Lyle might have given the 140-year-old dead lion logo a forgettably millennial-flavoured – sorry, “fresh and contemporary” – redesign in 2024, but the product inside (an amber-coloured form of inverted sugar syrup) remains fundamentally unchanged. Fans of the original (and frankly a bit weird) Biblical reference can still find it on the metal tins, while the squeezy plastic bottles have the stylised, cheerier (dare I say ensh-ttified) version.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Lea &amp; Perrins</h2></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Despite not being able to pronounce “Worcestershire”, the Americans managed to acquire Lea &amp; Perrins a decade ago and produce a bastardised, sweetened version for their domestic market. However, Brits still get a plausibly authentic reflection of the historic recipe, including relatively expensive malt vinegar, which often gets swapped out for cheaper spirit vinegar in ensh-ttified condiments.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Kendal Mint Cake</h2></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Water, glucose, sugar and peppermint oil are still the only ingredients in most popular versions of this hiking snack. While other high-energy bars are about as processed and messed-around-with as possible, Kendal Mint Cake from multi-generational manufacturers like Romney’s, Wilson’s and Quiggins’ is pretty much the same as it’s always been.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Gentleman’s Relish</h2></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Lurking unchanged in the nation’s fridge door is this mixture of anchovies, butter and spice that delivers a sophisticated but powerful umami honk to buttery toast across Britain every morning. Poland now manufactures it, and it tends to come in plastic pots rather than ceramic dishes, but it still follows the original 1820s recipe.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Walker’s Shortbread</h2></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Flour, sugar and butter in a 3:2:1 ratio, with a pinch of salt, is all you should find on the ingredients list of a tin of shortbread, and Walker’s is one of the brands that has been quietly meeting this expectation for over a century. Lesser manufacturers have managed to shoehorn other fats into the recipe, sometimes in the name of veganism.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Fisherman’s Friends</h2></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>A favourite of both Margaret Thatcher and Emmanuel Macron, the Fisherman’s Friend lozenge – developed and popularised by the late Doreen Lofthouse, and still manufactured in the billions by the family firm of the same name in Lancashire – contains pretty much the same eucalyptus, liquorice, sugar and an old-timey thickener called tragacanth. More than 90 per cent of Fisherman’s Friend production is exported, with over four billion individual lozenges consumed abroad each year.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Uncle Joe’s Mint Balls</h2></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Uncle Joe’s three-ingredient Mint Balls are still produced in Wigan to the original recipe involving cream of tartar, peppermint and cane sugar, as they were in 1898.

But the defence barrister said they had yet to clarify “where the alleged overspill begins”.</p><p>“Over the last half a decade, my clients have repeatedly and exhaustively sought to understand the claimants’ case. However, what is now finally clear is that the claimants do not know what their own case is,” the barrister told Judge Nicholas Parfitt.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Mr O’Connor and Ms Haleema say they discovered the overspill after commissioning their own basement dig in 2020, although they later abandoned the project.</p><p>Their barrister, Mr Jones, disputed any lack of clarity in his clients’ case and argued that “whatever the extent of the permitted works, the defendants hugely exceeded it and encroached significantly onto the claimants’ land causing damage to the claimants”.</p><p>The case reached court for a pre-trial clash between the neighbours as Ms McKeown and Mr Dalton urged Judge Parfitt to “strike out” the allegedly “hopeless” claim based on lack of clarity and inconsistency.</p><p>However, after several hours of dense argument, the judge declined to dismiss the case, ruling that he would allow Mr O’Connor and Ms Haleema a final chance to prepare definitive “particulars of claim” mapping out the detail of their claim.</p><p>The case is set to return to court at a later date.</p></div></div></div></div>",

The city has become unaffordable for almost everyone because it has essentially stopped building.</p><p>Just 4,550 homes a year are expected to be completed in 2027 and 2028, according to <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.moliorlondon.com/media/molior-report-media-2025/02/molior_residential_development_in_london_q2_2025_v2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Molior data</a>. That is about 5pc of the 90,000 homes London needs annually, according to <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/housing-and-economic-development-needs-assessments\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">government targets</a>. Some boroughs are projected to complete zero homes over the next two years. London is building less than any other global city.</p><p>And the reasons are not mysterious. They are political and bureaucratic, rules stacked on top of rules until nothing can get through the planning system. At the national level, the Building Safety Regulator has made approval for buildings higher than 18 metres slow, uncertain and in practice <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/buying-selling/safety-quango-blocking-thousands-new-homes/\">close to impossible</a>. In a city where height is often the only way to build at scale, that is catastrophic.</p><p>Sadiq Khan’s London Plan imposes <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/15/sadiq-khans-london-is-an-investment-no-go-zone/\">a thicket of requirements</a> that do not exist elsewhere in the country, such as rules on “dual aspect” homes, which are intended to improve cooling and ventilation even while London bans air conditioning for the vast majority of residential developments. The result is fewer, more expensive homes. That’s before London councils pile their own rules on top.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Islington is a prime example of this. It is meant to deliver about 2,400 of London’s annual target of 90,000 new homes. In practice, it is projected to build about 100 each year in 2027 and 2028, according to <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.moliorlondon.com/media/molior-report-media-2025/02/molior_residential_development_in_london_q2_2025_v2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Molior</a>.</p><p>All councils face organised opposition from local <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/nimby-guide-take-on-developers-block-construction-planning/\">“Nimby” campaigns</a>. But Islington council, confronted with relatively modest resistance, chose to retreat rather than lead.</p><p>The council proposed building 18 new homes on a slab of concrete it owned in Morton Road Park. To counteract the loss of open space, it proposed expanding the green bit and extending the park. The result would have been a small reduction in “open space” on paper, but an increase in actual green space on the ground.</p><p>The proposed development itself would have been four to five storeys, in keeping with the surrounding buildings. It sat around the corner from Essex Road station and about a 15-minute walk from the Tube. Even by Islington’s standards, Canonbury is expensive. If there is anywhere in London where a small infill scheme makes sense, it is here. It is hard to imagine a lower-impact development in a dense inner London neighbourhood.</p><p>But it never even reached the planning application stage. Instead, a campaign took off: signs appeared declaring “Save Morton Road Park”, as if the entire park were under threat. The concrete slab earmarked for housing was described as a “football pitch”.</p><p>On a recent visit, the playground and grass were full of children. The hardstanding was empty. While a football could technically be kicked around on it, calling it a football pitch is generous.</p><p>Campaign materials did not mention the additional green space that would have been created. They did not mention that the bit being built on was, in essence, a car park-like concrete pad.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>There were other objections, including claims that removing the hardstanding would increase knife crime. Some nearby flats complained they might lose their view of the New Year’s Eve fireworks on the Thames, which is a few miles away.</p><p>But many were more straightforward. People opposed the development because it was happening near them.</p><p>In the end, the council caved, citing a petition signed by less than 3pc of residents.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>According to the council’s own website, there are now zero housing developments under way in Canonbury. And unlike private schemes, there is no appeal route here. This was the council proposing homes on its own land. It could have built these 18 homes under the current planning system, but it chose not to.</p><p>These 18 homes would not have solved the housing crisis. But when even 18 modest homes on a patch of concrete are too much, it becomes much easier to understand why the crisis continues.</p><p>The rules and regulations on building in London are undeniably onerous. But the deeper truth is this: even where councils can build, many Labour councils in the heart of London are unwilling to contribute to the Government’s housing targets if it causes them any difficulty whatsoever.</p><p>Even if you don’t live in and have no plans to move to Islington, this affects you. Whether or not London builds, people will still want to live in places that can access London’s high-paying jobs. London’s housing crisis gets <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/07/09/khan-is-killing-the-commuter-belt/\">exported to the suburbs</a> and rural areas.</p><p>If we don’t build in London, we will have to concrete over the countryside. Wouldn’t it be better to concrete over concrete?</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p><em>Michael Hill is a policy researcher at Britain Remade, a campaign to grow Britain’s economy by building the power, homes and transport that we need</em></p></div></div></div></div>",

That would average £15 for every HGV, van and car.</p><p>The Chamber said an initial 50pc deduction to match the carbon charges on voyages between Britain and Republic of Ireland will provide little relief.<br/><br/>That is because exporters in Northern Ireland compete mostly with firms in Britain rather than the province’s southern neighbour, to which they will be at a structural disadvantage.</p><p>UK firms have already spent millions on some of the most sustainably designed ferries, including methanol and rotor sail propulsion, leaving no financially viable way forward, it claimed.</p><p>The Chamber said: “The sector supports the UK’s climate goals, but cannot deliver meaningful emissions reduction without the necessary fuels, infrastructure, and clear guidance in place.<br/><br/>“Premature implementation risks higher costs for passengers and freight, with limited environmental gain. However, the Government is pressing ahead, leaving industry in an untenable position.”<br/><br/>The trade group urged ministers to delay introduction of the scheme while further assessments are carried out and said the revenue raised should be ring-fenced for investment in clean fuels and quayside power connections.</p><p>The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said that it is for ship operators to decide how much of the expense of the ETS scheme to pass on, and that consumers should not see significant costs.</p><p>A spokesman said: “Pricing emissions is a cost-effective way to cut carbon emissions and encourage greener travel. We are working closely with industry on implementation.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

This was designed to tackle the growing number of entrepreneurs moving their companies overseas in search of growth.</p><p>Ms Reeves has tasked Treasury officials with reviewing the scale of investors leaving Britain. She has also launched an assessment of her decision to abolish the non-dom regime.</p><p>To tackle the wealth exodus, Mark Goddard, the UK chief executive of Lombard Odier, urged the Treasury to try and unlock £350bn in funds from cash Isas. </p><p>He said savers could be encouraged to direct some of this cash towards early-stage start-ups. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Financial literacy</h2><p>He also called for a dedicated investor visa contingent on investing in UK venture capital and private businesses. Mr Goddard said the Government should also focus on improving financial literacy to boost investment.</p><p>He added: “There needs to be a stronger promotion in the education system of financial literacy, investing and entrepreneurship, to support the next wave of businesses in the UK.”</p><p>However, the Chancellor’s Spring Statement on Tuesday is not expected to include any tax breaks for business owners. The Chancellor aims to keep it <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/18/reeves-little-as-possible-spring-statement-pressure-spend/\">as uneventful as possible</a> in an attempt to restore confidence.</p><p>Based in Switzerland, Lombard Odier launched in London more than 50 years ago and has built a business on managing money for start-up founders. It manages £215bn of client money globally.</p><p>Mr Goddard was invited to the Treasury for talks on the wealth exodus in February. To help inform the bank’s recent letter to the Chancellor, Mr Goddard hosted a dinner with a group of eight entrepreneurs.</p><p>Six of them said they would consider leaving the UK, Mr Goddard said.</p><p>“We are seeing a quiet but determined exodus,” Mr Goddard said.</p><p>“When these individuals leave, they don’t just take their bank balance. They take their expertise, their future tax contributions and their appetite to mentor and fund the next generation of British start-ups.”</p><p>Herman Narula, the 37-year-old technology entrepreneur who is worth more than £700m, said last year that he was <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/11/11/britains-richest-young-entrepreneur-prepares-to-quit-uk/\">preparing to quit Britain for Dubai</a>, blaming the Government’s policy.</p><p>Lakshmi Mittal, the billionaire steel magnate, was reported in November to have moved his tax residence from the UK to Switzerland, with most of his time spent in Dubai.</p><p>In its letter to the Treasury, Lombard Odier warned of a “massive problem with scaling in the UK and Europe more widely”.</p><p>The bank highlighted how investors encountered problems accessing state funding in the UK, with one entrepreneur being forced to raise $70m (£52m) abroad after his business was assessed as too risky.</p><p>Lombard Odier said a consistent concern among clients was inconsistency in tax policy.</p><p>“Sentiment is that actions speak louder than words,” it added.</p><p>A Treasury spokesman said: “In an increasingly unstable world, Britain stands out: stable, open for business and governed by the rule of law.</p><p>“With £10tn of capital and a globally competitive tax regime – including the lowest main rate of capital gains tax in the European G7 and the doubling of tax reliefs for entrepreneurs – the UK remains an attractive place for talented individuals to live, invest and run a business.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

Jerome Mayhew, the shadow rail minister, claimed that Network Rail was being forced to step in after the Chancellor’s “astronomical” business rates increase drove out Eurotunnel.</p><p>He said: “When business leaders and rail operators warned that these punitive increases would have real-world consequences, this is exactly what they meant.</p><p>“Labour’s own tax decisions have driven away investment and forced taxpayers to underwrite infrastructure that should have been delivered commercially.”</p><p>The DfT argued that the plan for the Barking terminal would revive the cross-Channel rail freight market and boost trade links with Europe, helping to stimulate the economy and reducing road congestion and emissions.</p><p>It said the key to the redevelopment would be to allow full-size European container trains restricted to the High Speed 1 route to reach London.</p><p>That would enable food markets to receive fruit and vegetables direct from overseas growers and open up the possibility of Scotch whisky and British consumer items being exported by rail.</p><p>Network Rail said it envisaged three trains a day running into the terminal from the Continent, connecting with services to Scotland via central England and the North West and removing 140,000 HGVs from the roads each year.</p><p>Maggie Simpson, the director general of the Rail Freight Group, said the Government’s intervention was necessary to “keep the dream of Channel Tunnel cargo alive” and safeguard a site whose loss would have prevented container trains from ever using the link.</p><p>However, she said that factors including unfair cost advantages that favour the trucking industry would need to be addressed if significant volumes of freight were to use the tunnel.</p><p>Ms Simpson said ministers were also compelled to step in because of the Barking yard’s importance to containerised defence-related shipments at a time of heightening international tension.</p><p>She said: “If you look at Britain’s strategic resilience it is a vital national asset for whatever you want to transport to and from Europe, and that includes defence shipments”.</p><p>The Barking site, originally developed by Deutsche Bahn’s DB Cargo for automotive shipments, received the first direct freight train from China to the UK in 2017, when a rake of 34 containers arrived there after an 18-day journey.</p></div></div></div></div>",

and passengers via landing charges.</p><p>Mr Budzier said: “Design ambition alone does not explain the persistence of Heathrow’s cost premium, which appears driven by broader features of project planning and delivery.”</p><p>The runway cost estimates did not take into account the expense of diverting the M25 into a tunnel so that the new strip could cross over it.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘Protect passengers from these economic risks’</h2><p>Oxford Global said it benchmarked Heathrow’s costs against construction expenses for 52 other terminals, 15 runways, 21 car parks and eight baggage systems.</p><p>Holly Boyd-Boland, at Virgin, said the study had found “clear, independent evidence that Heathrow’s infrastructure costs are consistently higher than comparable airports and have been for many years”.</p><p>Jonathan Sullivan, at International Airlines Group, said it showed that the Government and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) needed to cap Heathrow charges “where they are today as the only way to protect passengers from these economic risks”.</p><p>The CAA, Britain’s aviation regulator, is working on a new model for airport charges and is expected to report by May.</p><p>Oxford Global said that studies cited by the airport to justify its capital costs used flawed methodologies “that systematically bias results in Heathrow’s favour”.</p><p>Heathrow was contacted for comment.</p><p>Thomas Woldbye, its chief executive, said last week that landing charges would need to rise to persuade the airport’s investors to back the runway project.</p><p>However, he rejected airlines’ claims that fares would jump by £60, claiming fees would need to rise by £15 per passenger and adding that the bill for Heathrow’s expansion could be reduced by making it less attractive for passengers if airlines preferred.</p><p>Heathrow said it had a strong track record of delivering infrastructure projects on time and on budget and would continue to work with the Government and airlines to cut the expense of the runway.</p><p>It said a study by KPMG had concluded that its costs were average when benchmarked against other airports.</p><p>A spokesman said: “The numbers in this so called ‘independent analysis’ simply do not reflect our plans. Heathrow expansion is a £33bn privately financed project with not a penny of taxpayers’ money needed.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

Investors have worried that LSEG could be vulnerable to new, powerful AI models that could offer similar insights.</p><p>The company’s share price has fallen by more than a third in the last year amid broad-based fears about the growing power of AI tools.</p><p>“This is not just about LSEG,” Mr Schwimmer said. “This is about whole swaths of the market and whole sectors. There is a lot of uncertainty and a lot of lack of clarity amongst investors as to what this technology will do.”</p><p>Mr Schwimmer pointed out that the exchange operator had partnered with a number of providers, including OpenAI and Anthropic, and said it was seeing traction from these deals.</p><p>The company reported a 5pc growth in revenues for its data and analytics business last year to almost £4bn.</p><p>Revenue in its markets business increased by 8.9pc to £3.5bn, despite a dearth of listings in London.</p><p>LSEG also unveiled a record £3bn share buyback alongside its full-year results, to be completed by February next year, following pressure from activist investor <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/11/wall-street-predator-targets-london-stock-exchange/\">Elliott Investment Management</a> to pay out more to shareholders.</p><p>Elliott had reportedly been pushing for a buyback of £5bn.</p><p>Alongside the new share buyback, LSEG also increased its final dividend by 15.7pc to 103p a share. Its share price was up 6.3pc by mid-morning on Thursday in the wake of the announcement.</p><p>Wall Street raider Elliott is also said to have pressed LSEG to do more to explain how it could benefit from AI and to consider selling off some parts of its business, though the company is said to have ruled out spinning out the stock exchange itself.</p><p>Mr Schwimmer said LSEG did not have any plans to conduct disposals at the moment.</p><p>He added: “Over the past seven or eight years, we have had plenty of discussions with shareholders whom I would describe as active. This is a healthy part of the capital markets.”</p><p>LSEG attracted the attention of Elliott after years of struggles for its stock exchange. In the first two weeks of 2026, more money was raised from listings in Hong Kong than was raised in London across the whole of 2025.</p><p>Hong Kong’s stock exchange operator reported on Thursday a 32pc rise in its core business revenues. Hong Kong was the second most active destination for IPOs last year, behind only the US.</p></div></div></div></div>",

It also exposed displeasure within the Conservative Party about Margaret Thatcher’s leadership style, sowing the seeds of her eventual downfall in 1990.</p><p>Senior bosses from the company had travelled in secret to Yeovil on Thursday for an expected announcement of the deal by John Healey, the Defence Secretary, only to be told at short notice that the visit was off.</p><p>The Treasury’s decision to block the contract award was initially understood to be linked to <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/01/starmer-risks-diplomatic-row-uk-dithering-delays-fighter/\">the delayed defence investment plan (DIP)</a>, a blueprint that is supposed to set out what equipment the military will purchase over the next decade.</p><p>Ministers previously promised to publish the document before the end of last year but it has yet to emerge amid reports of a £28bn funding shortfall.</p><p>The Telegraph revealed earlier this month that Ms Reeves, the Chancellor, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2026/02/17/reeves-blocking-spending-boost-for-defence/\">was refusing to sign off more money</a> and had told the MoD that it must stick within spending plans agreed last year.</p><p>The MoD said it was “working flat out” to finalise the DIP, which would “deliver the best kit and technology into the hands of our frontline forces at speed, while investing in and growing the UK economy”.</p><p>The NMH tender process has already dragged on for years and Italy’s Leonardo is the sole remaining bidder after rivals dropped out.</p><p>That had led to increasingly stark warnings from Leonardo executives about the stakes if the company did not secure the work.</p><p>On top of some 3,000 jobs at Yeovil they have warned that the total number of workers reliant on the plant is around 10,000 when supply chains are included.</p><p>In a letter first reported by The Telegraph, Leonardo group boss Roberto Cingolani warned Mr Healey that the Italian giant <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/12/21/defence-giant-threatens-to-scrap-all-uk-investment-in-row/\">could scrap all investment in Britain</a> if the deal didn’t go ahead.</p><p>Luke Pollard, the defence procurement minister, vowed earlier this month that the Government would not let the company’s offer “time out” on Sunday.</p><p>But defence industry sources were warning earlier on Friday that it looked as though the deal would fall through.</p><p>That would have piled more pressure on Ms Reeves.</p><p>James Cartlidge, the shadow defence secretary, said: “If Labour scraps the New Medium Helicopter programme, it will be a disaster for the factory at Yeovil and the UK’s sovereign military rotary capability.</p><p>“Above all, it would be a disaster for thousands of skilled workers in the South West and right across the UK, the supply chain, whose jobs rely on the site.</p><p>“Rachel Reeves has banged on about how defence is an ‘engine for growth’, but in reality her total failure to put money into defence is destroying a once-great industry.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Union pressure</h2><p>Sharon Graham, general secretary of the Unite union, a major Labour donor, had said that the Chancellor should step aside if she was not prepared to approve the NMH deal.</p><p>She said on Friday: “The Leonardo contract is a tremendous victory for Unite members in Yeovil and across the aerospace sector. </p><p>“Without their commitment, hard work and dedication, it would not be being signed today.<br/> <br/>“Of course, we are pleased that the Rachel Reeves has now listened to Unite on this issue. </p><p>“However, it took way too long to get this done, and we still have to question why workers were left in the dark until the 11th hour.”</p><p>The Treasury did not respond directly to requests for comment, with a spokesman referring The Telegraph to the MoD.</p><p>The last major contract awarded to Leonardo’s Yeovil site was for the construction of around 60 Wildcat helicopters for the Army and the Royal Navy in 2006.</p><p>Since then Yeovil has secured various export orders to countries including South Korea, Japan and Oman, which helped to sustain the plant’s workforce, but this work is about to end.</p><p>Executives have been counting on the new NMH contract to provide further work as well as the impetus for fresh investment into the historic site, where Spitfires were once produced during the Second World War.</p><p>The NMH programme was meant to provide a replacement for the Royal Air Force’s ageing Puma battlefield helicopters, a workforce fleet used for a range of duties, which were retired earlier this year.</p><p>A 2022 contract advertised by the MoD said up to 44 new aircraft would be sought but that number has since been slashed to 25.</p></div></div></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"grid-col grid-col-12 tpl-article__layout tpl-article__layout--content\"><div class=\"\" data-js=\"article-body\" data-test=\"tpl-article-body-recipe\"><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>With housing costs now the single <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/house-prices/average-house-price-tops-300k-first-time/\">biggest strain</a> on finances, workers are hunting for a radical solution. And some are finding it through a hidden gem in the employment market – the “tied accommodation” role.</p><p>From chefs and gardeners to teachers and animal carers, professionals are increasingly seeking positions that offer refuge from the relentless climb of housing costs.</p><p>The figures are stark. The average weekly mortgage payment has soared to £242, according to the Government’s latest English Housing Survey, up from £182 just five years ago. For renters, the outlook is even more grim, with Zoopla reporting average monthly rents of £1,320, outstripping typical mortgage payments.</p><p>In this landscape, a job that includes a home is not a mere perk – it’s a life-changing financial reprieve.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘Job with a house’</h2><p>Vicki Alford, 47, horse unit manager at Blue Cross rehoming centre in Burford, agrees. For two decades, her role caring for over 60 rescued horses on-site – and overseeing nearly 500 more at properties nationwide – has come with a home.</p><p>She started in a flat and later moved to a three-bedroom bungalow with a large garden to accommodate her growing family. Managing a 120-acre site where horses often arrive in desperate need of veterinary and behavioural care is a round-the-clock labour of love. “Every month, around 20 to 30 need retraining,” she explains.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Alford’s need for an on-site house was proven one memorable night when 15 mares foaled simultaneously. “I was the only one on duty, so I helped with the births until the vet arrived,” she says.</p><p>Her family has also benefitted from the lifestyle that comes with the job. Alford’s two children grew up surrounded by horses, and freedom from a mortgage or rent has allowed her to save substantially.</p><p>While her part-time salary might be modest – the full-time equivalent is paid up to £35,436 – having a cost-free home has paid off. The arrangement has enabled her to <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/buying-selling/how-much-deposit-need-buy-house/\">save for a house</a>, which she now rents out, securing her financial future.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘I do pay rent, but it’s subsidised’</h2><p>It’s a similar story for Louise Ellis, head gardener at English Heritage’s Audley End House and Gardens in Saffron Walden.</p><p>“I’ve lived and worked here for 17 years. I started out as a trainee gardener on the minimum wage after a career change from social care and gained my horticultural qualification,” she explains.</p><p>Now in charge of 13 paid staff and around 65 volunteers, Ellis oversees the landscaped parkland and the Victorian kitchen garden, which includes a vinery dating back to the 1820s. What she particularly loves about her role is that, while she has climbed to a managerial position, she still does much of the hands-on gardening.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>She lives in Orchard Cottage, which is one of the original Victorian staff houses. The one-storey, two-bedroom home has character features including a vaulted ceiling, along with a modern extension containing the bedrooms and a bathroom. Ellis lives alone as her partner is based in Norfolk.</p><p>“It’s very well-maintained and sits within the unrestored parts of the walled garden. I also have my own private garden with fruit trees,” she says. Ironically, there is a large, detached red-brick home called the Head Gardener’s House, but that is now let out to paying holiday guests.</p><p>There are four staff members who live on site, including the stable manager and other gardeners. “The provision of housing is an allowance for our out-of-hours responsibilities. We must respond quickly if there is an emergency, which requires us to live on site,” she says.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>“I do pay rent, but it’s subsidised. It has enabled me to save a quarter of my salary every month, something I’ve been very focused on now that I am 55 and <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/pensions/things-to-do-before-retirement-state-pension-investment/\">retirement is on the horizon</a>. I’ll need to work until I reach the state pension age, but my job keeps me physically fit, so that’s a benefit,” she says.</p><p>She is aware that she lives in an expensive market town, where a two-bedroom home costs on average £1,359 per month. “I wouldn’t be able to live here on my salary if I had to rent privately. I’d probably need to move further out towards Suffolk to afford a similar home,” she says.</p><p>“English Heritage is a great landlord. It deals with repairs promptly and is progressive – we have oil central heating, but it is looking at air-source heat pumps and alternative fuel sources,” she says. </p><p>Ellis doesn’t own a property elsewhere and knows that when she retires from Audley End, she will be back to paying for a home in the private rental sector.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘It’s idyllic’</h2><p>Hospitality, with its long and sometimes anti-social hours, is another industry that frequently offers staff accommodation – particularly in remotely located hotels.</p><p>Billy McKechnie, 45, is general manager of the Royal Marine Hotel in Brora, located an hour’s drive from Inverness along the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/scotland/north-coast-500-a-decade-on/\">North Coast 500</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>He has been in the role for three and a half years. Part of his daily duties include playing the bagpipes to welcome guests to breakfast. Along with his wife Minette and their three children, he is provided with accommodation.</p><p>“Our children play in the hills or at the beach, visit neighbouring castles and play golf in their free time – it’s idyllic,” says McKechnie.</p><p>Lifestyle aside, the perk of staff accommodation is a definite help for the family’s purse strings. “The hotel contributes towards the rent on our house, which is £1,200 per month. We chose the house ourselves. It’s five minutes by car from the hotel.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>In an area that is losing residents to nearby cities, providing hotel staff with subsidised housing is a key incentive for securing their commitment.</p><p>“We have a house in Inverness that we rent out. We wouldn’t have moved from there if the hotel didn’t provide us with a home,” he says. Plus, if the family had sold their main home to buy closer to McKechnie’s workplace, they would have faced both seller’s fees and stamp duty costs.</p><p>For younger workers, having accommodation provided allows them to go where the jobs are.</p><p>James Greenwood-Penny, 24, is the sous chef at The Cottage in the Wood in Malvern. “I was born and grew up in Cornwall – a long way from Malvern,” he says.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>He notes that without the housing perk, rent alone would have consumed three quarters of his pay – and that’s before bills. By saving his entire salary, he is building up funds for a future down payment on a house – a dream made possible only by having a job that comes with a home.</p></div></div></div></div>",

In other words, fewer and fewer people are moving out of their rental property when it no longer meets their housing needs,” said Mr Fuest.</p><p>“The existing regulations protect tenants who have an apartment and no reason to move. This is at the expense of landlords and all prospective tenants looking for a rental apartment.”</p><p>Since 2013 rents in existing tenancies have risen by around 18pc amid tight restrictions on how much and how often landlords can raise the bill, the Ifo found. By contrast rates for new tenancies, which face fewer restrictions, are up by around 50pc.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>In Berlin, the rent on new tenancies is capped at 10pc more than a local reference rate, though looser rules apply to short-term furnished lets, a segment of the market that has grown as a result.</p><p>The result is that the number of people moving dropped sharply between 2010 and 2020, the year for which the latest data is available.</p><p>During that decade – which included significant new restrictions on rents in major cities – the number of moves in urban centres fell from more than 85 per 1,000 inhabitants to around 66.</p><p>Mr Fuest said this <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/26/thousands-more-young-people-out-of-work-surge-job-hunting/\">threatened young adults’ job prospects</a> and undermined growth in the wider economy.</p><p>“Young people in particular, who have found a job in another city and want to move, are increasingly reporting that they have failed to find accommodation,” he said.</p><p>“This is not only frustrating for those affected but also damages overall economic development. Economic growth only works if people can take up new jobs and move to do so.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The Government in Berlin plans to extend and tighten rules capping rents in an effort to make monthly bills more affordable for tenants.</p><p>Mr Fuest urged the Government to focus on building more homes instead.</p><p>“The housing shortage in Germany can only be overcome if more housing is built and the existing housing stock is better utilised,” he said.</p><p>It is a similar problem to that in Britain, where annual rises in rents peaked at more than 9pc in 2024. In the past 12 months, the average rent increased by 3.5pc, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p><p>Despite the Government’s goal to build 1.5 million new properties in this Parliament, construction rates have been in decline.</p><p><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/17/housebuilding-collapses-to-12-year-low-in-blow-to-labour/\">Housebuilding in England fell to a 12-year low</a> excluding the pandemic in the three months to September, with 30,880 homes completed.</p><p>Only 175,290 homes have been completed since the general election, well below the average 300,000 per year needed to meet the Government’s target.</p><p>London’s construction sector is particularly struggling to build more homes amid new regulatory requirements in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster.</p><p>A spokesman for the Mayor said he “has consistently called for the devolution of rent controls, which would enable us to develop a system that works for London and the unique challenges facing the capital”.   </p></div></div></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"grid-col grid-col-12 tpl-article__layout tpl-article__layout--content\"><div class=\"\" data-js=\"article-body\" data-test=\"tpl-article-body-recipe\"><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Asked by Asian Voice to name his idols, Paresh Raja picked the villain from Oliver Stone’s 1987 film Wall Street and a mob boss from The Godfather.</p><p>“I can appreciate some of the drive behind Gordon Gekko and Vito Corleone, setting aside what it’s used for,” Raja told the publication in 2023.</p><p>It is a comment that he may now regret. Raja’s company, Market Financial Solutions (MFS), tipped into administration earlier this week amid allegations of fraud. Court documents seen by Bloomberg show a £930m black hole on its balance sheet.</p><p>The sudden implosion of the Mayfair-based private lender, or “shadow bank”, has sent shock waves through Wall Street and the City of London as lenders that backed the business scramble to work out how much they stand to lose. Bankers are already on edge following the high-profile collapse of two other private credit lenders.</p><p>The case has also resurfaced the lender’s links to the Bangladeshi elite. MFS was a significant backer of property deals struck by Saifuzzaman Chowdhury, Bangladesh’s former land minister. His property empire is now the subject of an investigation by the National Crime Agency (NCA). Authorities have not accused Raja or MFS of wrongdoing.</p><p>Raja, 58, founded MFS with his wife, Tiba, in 2006. The lender provided what it called “complex, property-backed lending”. The company’s main products included buy-to-let mortgages and bridging loans – short-term debt that borrowers could use for various kinds of investments in real assets.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>MFS’s website stated that Raja was “committed to supporting property investors who encounter difficulties with – or are simply not suitable for – the high street banks”.</p><p>“We find ourselves regularly supporting borrowers who have been turned away on the high street,” <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.asian-voice.com/Volumes/2023/17-June-2023/Interview-with-Paresh-Raja,-Founder,-and-CEO-of-Market-Financial-Solutions-MFS\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Raja told Asian Voice</a>. “We’re always happy to hear from those who may have missed payments on their record, who are based overseas, or who are looking to invest in less common property types.”</p><p>An important client of MFS during its rise was Chowdhury, Bangladesh’s former land minister. Companies linked to Chowdhury built up an impressive portfolio of properties in the UK during his five-year tenure in power before he and the government he was a part of <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/08/05/bangladesh-pm-flees-riots/\">were ousted in August 2024</a>.</p><p>According to the Financial Times, Chowdhury-linked businesses took out hundreds of secured loans from lenders linked to MFS following his appointment as land minister in 2019.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>After the fall of prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s regime in 2024, it appears that nearly all of the MFS-linked mortgages were repaid.</p><p>However, the property empire has become the subject of a National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation in the UK. In June, the NCA froze UK property worth £170m belonging to the former minister. Authorities have not accused Raja or MFS of wrongdoing.</p><p>At the time, lawyers for Raja said that MFS had “a large underwriting team who scrutinise every loan and carry out detailed and thorough anti-money laundering and other checks”. They emphasised that Raja “has no connection to Bangladesh or the Hasina government”.</p><p>MFS differed in important ways from mainstream banks. It was a <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/19/shadow-banking-giant-blocks-investors-from-withdrawing-cash/\">shadow bank</a>, meaning it offered loans but did not take deposits. As a result, it was not subject to the strict regulations that high street lenders must adhere to.</p><p>Before its collapse, the business appeared to be going from strength to strength. As of last March, it said it had secured an additional £1bn in capital from institutional investors, boasting a loan book of nearly £2.5bn.</p><p>Just 11 months before MFS tipped into administration, Raja said it was targeting a loan book of £3.5bn over the next year.</p><p>A sports lover who “regularly carves out time in his busy schedule to attend important sporting events”, MFS’s website said Raja travelled the world to watch football, cricket, Formula 1 and tennis.</p><p>He also spoke frequently to specialist finance media, tweeting as recently as December about his various appearances in the press.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘Serious irregularities’</h2><p>However, insolvency practitioners from Alix Partners were appointed this week after two companies linked to Market Financial Solutions, Amber Bridging and Zircon Bridging, alleged that there were “serious irregularities” in its finances.</p><p>According to Bloomberg, the pair accused MFS of using the same assets to back multiple loans, which may have led to an “unaccounted-for deficiency” of more than 80pc on £1.2bn of debts.</p><p>Approving the administration application this week, Justice Briggs said: “The allegations of fraud are very serious.”</p><p>“Mr Raja has failed to comply with the court order to appoint administrators and there is a need to protect assets available for creditors quickly,” the judge said, according to a report by debt industry publication <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.9fin.com/insights/uk-court-market-financial-solutions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">9fin</a>.</p><p>At the time of the administration, Raja said the process did “not reflect a failure of the underlying business or the quality of our assets, but rather a technical and procedural impasse that has temporarily limited our access to everyday banking facilities”.</p><p>He added that it was “an extremely difficult moment for everyone connected with Market Financial Solutions”.</p><p>As AlixPartners sifts through the wreckage, analysts are already debating the scale of the losses that some of the biggest banks might face.</p><p>A cast of high profile banks including Santander, Wells Fargo, Jefferies and Barclays are understood to have funded MFS’s loans. Barclays, which has exposure of roughly £600m, had opened bank accounts for the company, but froze them in recent weeks.</p><p>Wall Street bank Jefferies is understood to have around £100m tied up in MFS, while Atlas, the structured-credit arm of Apollo Global Management, had £400m of exposure.</p><p>After MFS slipped into administration, shares of Jefferies slumped as much as 9.8pc, while Barclays fell by as much as 3.8pc and Apollo’s stock slid as much as 4.7pc.</p><p>Commentary from Citi suggested that losses for Barclays at least could be smaller than the initial figure of £600m, while BMO Markets noted that most of Jefferies’ loans weren’t processed by MFS itself, meaning losses could be lower.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Private credit fears</h2><p>However, the crisis has shaken confidence at a time when the world of high finance is already on edge.</p><p>The allegations of fraud are reminiscent of <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/12/04/bank-of-england-hunts-for-cockroaches-in-11-trillion-shadow/\">two major collapses that rattled the private credit sector</a> last year: US auto lender Tricolor Holdings and auto parts supplier First Brands Group.</p><p>Barclays has already booked losses on its loans to Tricolor, while Jefferies and Santander were both stung by the collapse of First Brands Group.</p><p>Credit markets have become increasingly spooked by a growing number of what Jamie Dimon, the boss of JP Morgan, described as “cockroaches”.</p><p>Dimon said earlier this week that he saw parallels between today’s markets and the era before the financial crisis.</p><p>“Unfortunately, we did see this in ’05, ’06 and ’07, almost the same thing – the rising tide was lifting all boats, everyone was making a lot of money,” he said. “I see a couple people doing some dumb things.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the fallout from property deals linked to Hasina’s Bangladesh government continues.</p><p>Authorities in Bangladesh are also looking into Chowdhury’s affairs amid a broader investigation into flats and houses bought by former allies and family members of the prime minister.</p><p>In Britain, Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, Hasina’s niece, resigned as Treasury minister in January last year amid growing pressure over the anti-corruption scandal in Bangladesh. Siddiq faces a corruption trial in Bangladesh over claims that she illegally received a plot of land from her aunt’s government. She denies the allegations.</p><p>Raja did not respond to a request for comment. The Telegraph was unable to reach Chowdhury for comment.</p></div></div></div></div>",

Documents such as a basement impact assessment are required to support these types of planning applications.</p><p>“But the cost of those documents – including a heritage statement – is for the applicant to negotiate and is completely unrelated to the council.”</p><p>The need for a heritage statement particularly irked Sarah. In order to install lightwells into the basement of their house, which is in a <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/buying-selling/conservation-area-planning-permission-nightmare/\">conservation area</a>,<strong> </strong>they had to produce a 43-page document on the property and the local area’s history. </p><p>“The thing is, you can’t see the lightwells from the street at all,” she adds. “They are down the side access, and no one can see them.”</p><p>Sarah is American and was living in New York when she met Matthew, a British lawyer, in 2015. Two years later, she moved to London and into Matthew’s flat in Maze Hill, south-east London, and the couple married. </p><p>They both loved the neighbourhood, close to Greenwich Park and the River Thames, but by 2018, they wanted more space and decided to upsize locally to a house.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>In November 2019, they paid £1.08m for their four-bedroom terrace. Although perfectly liveable, the couple was unimpressed by the kitchen. </p><p>One wall was blocked by a large chimney breast, which meant all the cabinets were crowded into the other side of the room. By removing the chimney, they could rearrange the kitchen layout and add an island. They also set out to turn the former coal cellar into a basement utility room.</p><p>In April 2021, they hired LOUD Architects to help draw up plans for the house. During this period, they learnt that converting the coal cellar was going to be a complex task, involving digging out substantial amounts of earth and underpinning. </p><p>“We started to think that it would only really be worthwhile if we dug out the full width of the house and did something bigger,” says Sarah.</p><p>They had their plans redrawn, this time with a full basement level with a utility room, shower room, spare room/gym and a wine cellar.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The immense preparation involved in getting all the necessary reports and licences together meant that work did not actually start on the house until December 2023. By then, Sarah had quit her day job to get the build started and project manage the work.</p><p>Early on, the contractor hired to dig out the cellar failed to turn up to work. Further investigation revealed the company had gone bust, still holding a £30,000 deposit from the Hopes. </p><p>Matthew, now a partner at a US law firm, was able to put a strong case to the defunct firm’s legal representative, which resulted in 90pc of the money being repaid.</p><p>But Sarah is keenly aware that not everyone has a free lawyer on tap and must take a huge risk when paying large deposits out to firms with no guarantee of the quality of their work or even stay solvent long enough to carry it out. </p><p>“We were very lucky,” she says.</p><p>There were other issues, such as an air conditioning unit being installed incorrectly. They were able to get their money back from the original workman, but to solve the problem, they had to pay a specialist firm to come in and assess it (£1,200) and then get it removed, repaired and reinstalled (£5,600).</p><p>In all, they lost £10,000 to vanishing building firms and snagging costs.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Sarah, Matthew and Copper, their fox red labrador, moved back into the house at the end of 2024. </p><p>In the final analysis, the project – which increased floor space from 1,400 to just over 2,000sq ft – cost Sarah and Matthew £675,000, including more than £70,000 on <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/buying-selling/safety-quango-blocking-thousands-new-homes/\">red tape and remediation</a>.</p><p>The bill was also high because building costs have spiralled since the pandemic. The cost of basics like bricks and plaster has increased by 20pc to 25pc, while the price of steel has doubled, according to Amit Patel of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Labour costs have also doubled.</p><p>This means the Hopes’ total investment in their home, including the purchase, came to £1.76m. When remortgaging last year, the property was valued at £1.4m, although Sarah believes it would fetch more like £1.6m if it were to be sold. </p><p>If she is correct, then it is the money they spent on preparation and resolving builder problems that has pushed them into the red.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>“If you add up what we paid for the house and what we spent, yes, we have lost money,” says Sarah. “We intend to stay for at least five years, so it doesn’t really matter, but for a lot of people, it would make it impossible to modernise their homes.</p><p>“The UK has some of the oldest housing stock in Europe; our house is almost 150 years old, and it needs work to make liveable family homes. It was just a bit frustrating.”</p><p>A potential paper loss aside, Sarah, who now runs her own consultancy firm, is thoroughly enjoying the house. But, given her experience of getting a renovation project over the line, is it something she would ever do again?</p><p>After a long pause, the answer is a not-terribly-confident yes. </p><p>“I need time, but maybe in five years, if we moved out of London, I would do another,” she says. “I probably would not do a lot of structural work again, but I do enjoy designing a space.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

Instead, ministers suggested the cliff would be monitored for signs of movement. </p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2026/01/24/storm-ingrid-washes-away-part-of-victorian-pier/\">Storm Ingrid</a>, which battered Devon two weeks ago, also saw waves destroy sections of a sea wall protecting the tracks at Dawlish, closing the line for two days.<br/><br/>Rebecca Smith, Tory MP for South West Devon, said the damage had stoked concerns that spending cuts had left the lifeline route exposed to potential disaster.<br/><br/>She said: “With all the tightening of the budget by the Chancellor, she has taken away contingency funding. So if there were something that needed an emergency reaction, the implication is that the money isn’t actually there.</p><p>“If you get the right kind of freakish storm, who knows what could happen. The question for me is, should this not be something that is in capital funding on a year-on-year basis?”</p><p>After Ms Smith asked in the Commons whether funding could be guaranteed for unplanned resilience work, James Murray, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said that budgets allow ministers to respond to emergencies.<br/><br/>He said: “All individual departments must recognise that unexpected pressures will come along; they need to prepare for them and make sure they have robust plans to respond.”<br/><br/>Ms Smith, a member of the transport select committee, said the Government’s reluctance to fund work on the cliff stood in contrast to its <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/01/14/labour-races-to-begin-45bn-northern-rail-upgrade-before-ele/\">backing for the £45bn Northern Powerhouse Rail project</a>, for which Ms Reeves last month announced £1bn of preparatory funding.<br/><br/>She said: “Why do they want to take a gamble when they are investing billions in other parts of the country? Why do we need a marginally faster rail system in the North when in the Southwest, if this went again, we’d be cut off for, I don’t know how long?”<br/><br/>Ms Smith also raised doubts about the level of monitoring that Network Rail is carrying out on the cliff, which is protected by the railway from the sea but prone to becoming sodden with surface water.<br/><br/>She said: “Are they monitoring it or just draining things? We need answers if they are not prepared to put the investment in to fix it.”<br/><br/>Martin Wrigley, Liberal Democrat MP for Newton Abbot, which includes Dawlish, said that had Storm Ingrid hit when seas were higher, the damage could have been much more severe.<br/><br/>He said the Department for Transport (DfT) should grant Network Rail money to undertake a study into a long-term solution for the cliff.<br/><br/>He said: “Monitoring is no good because the last collapse was a single, catastrophic failure, almost a tectonic shift of part of the cliff which came down on to the railway.”<br/><br/>Mr Wrigley said the damage to the Dawlish sea wall was also concerning, having affected areas on either side of a new section installed after the 2014 collapse.</p><p>The DfT said work carried out after the 2014 events held up well in the recent storms, with damage limited to a low wall between the coastal path and the railway. <br/><br/>It said funding had been provided for a drainage trial and a range of advanced monitoring equipment, including tilt sensors that would provide a quick response if triggered.<br/><br/>Work will continue with Network Rail to assess the investment needed to ensure the line’s resilience and to develop any longer-term solutions.</p></div></div></div></div>",

The 48-year-old food writer was gearing up for a book launch – her first “actual, proper book”.</p><p>It took just a two-hour phone call to bring her hopes for the year crashing down. The mother-of-two from south London <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/jobs/career-advice/the-scam-epidemic-taking-hold-among-britains-job-hunters/\">was scammed</a> out of more than £5,700.</p><p>A couple of days earlier she had received a text which she thought was from her phone company, telling her to claim reward points she was owed. Basu clicked on the link and entered her card details as requested.</p><p>Worried she had done the wrong thing, she told NatWest that she thought her card might be compromised.</p><p>Then, on Jan 10, she received a strange text. The message asked her to approve a transaction of nearly £400 to eBay, which she knew nothing about. When she declined, she received a phone call.</p><p>It was the NatWest fraud team – or so she was told – and her account had been compromised.</p><p>“The first question I asked – because I’ve never been scammed in my life – was, ‘How do I know you’re calling from NatWest?’</p><p>“They said, ‘We are calling from NatWest, we would never ask for your pin and we would never ask for your password’. So they were mimicking what would normally happen,” she says.</p><p>The fraudsters convinced her that her money was unsafe and that it could be syphoned off to Pakistan, where it would be unrecoverable. Then they applied pressure – telling Basu that they couldn’t guarantee the safety of her money.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>“They kept putting me on hold and saying, ‘We’re speaking to the security team. Because your account has been compromised online, we need to make sure that they can’t go in and apply for an overdraft or apply for a loan’,” she says.</p><p>She tried to move money out of her account – but the real NatWest<strong> </strong>recognised that she was being coerced quickly and blocked the attempted transactions. The fraudsters changed tack. If one account had been compromised then her other bank accounts could be too.</p><p>“Where else do you bank?” they asked.</p><p>Basu had personal and business accounts with <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/banking/current-accounts/revolut-monzo-starling-which-best-online-bank/\">online bank Starling</a>: “They said: ‘Okay, well, NatWest has bought Starling and we have access. If you’re compromised on NatWest, you’re compromised on Starling too’.”</p><p>The food writer hadn’t heard of a takeover but she was convinced to move her money from Starling: “They got me on the basis of that to transfer my money urgently.</p><p>“Of course, now looking back, clearly they were following the path of least resistance,” she says.</p><p>The fraudsters would tell her whatever she needed to hear to trust them.</p><p>In three transactions, Basu moved more than £5,770 from her Starling business account. The first payment, through Western Union, was for £3,500. She was told that the money was going into a new, safe Starling account.</p><p>Basu claims that she did not give the fraudsters her Starling bank card details but the scammers were able to trigger card payments on her account, which came up as notifications for approval in her app. It is unclear how the scammers got this information.</p><p>“I did not set up the transactions. The transactions were generated. I was sent transactions to approve,” Basu says.</p><p>Starling says that Basu was shown 10 fraud warnings during the call, including ones which said that she was not on the phone to the bank. Basu says she has no recollection of the alerts.</p><p>She says: “If they’ve sent me in-app warnings, I am already lulled into a state where I am thinking, ‘Oh, it doesn’t matter, they’re protecting me’. So they’re essentially neutralising these warnings. I just don’t think it’s a very effective safeguard.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Fraud has been rising, fuelled by AI and fake social media adverts with politicians, police forces and City regulators at a loss for how to tackle it. Britons lost more than £1bn to scams every year between 2020 and 2024, according to UK Finance. Another £630m was lost in the first half of last year.</p><p>Breaking the spell created by the emotional manipulation at the core of the scammers’ playbook is very difficult.</p><p>A three-year national fraud strategy – spearheaded by Lord Hanson of Flint, the fraud minister – is set to be published by the Home Office this spring. It comes after the launch of Report Fraud, which replaced the much-maligned Action Fraud.</p><p>Since October 2024, victims of authorised push payment (APP) fraud have been due <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/banking/fraud-payouts-capped-85k-backlash-banks/\">reimbursement from their bank</a> under a mandatory scheme overseen by the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR).</p><p>The latest figures showed that £173m was paid out by banks in the first year that the rules applied – or 83pc of the reported losses.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>David Geale, the head of the PSR, told MPs at a Treasury select committee hearing earlier this month that the rules had been a “huge incentive” for banks to improve their fraud controls.</p><p>But the transactions that Basu had approved on her Starling app were card payments. This meant that she was not covered by the mandatory reimbursement rules, which only apply to Faster Payments or CHAPS – so, she has been left £3,500 out of pocket.</p><p>In letters seen by the Telegraph in response to her complaint, Starling said that it could have done more to stop the later transactions made by Basu, including another £2,160 which was sent just seven minutes later. It refunded around 40pc of the money she lost.</p><p>Basu questioned why Starling allowed any of the payments through at all, especially when NatWest had not.</p><p>The food writer says she was under a lot of stress because she was about to launch her book, <em>In Good Taste</em>. The scam emptied her business account.</p><p>She explains: “I was due to launch my first book which wasn’t a cookbook – the first time I’ve written an actual, proper book – in a week’s time. It was high stress.</p><p>“The pressure was immense and I was terrified that all my money would go [as the scammers told her].</p><p>“Of course it did. They got me. They took absolutely everything, I was left penniless basically.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>A spokesman for Starling said: “We understand how devastating this must be for the customer. Scams are a scourge and we make every effort to protect our customers from them.</p><p>“The customer was provided with 10 different warnings by our systems over the course of her transactions with the scammer. Six of these warnings required acknowledgement, which the customer gave before proceeding with the transactions.</p><p>“In this case, our transaction controls should have automatically blocked the second payment, even though the customer acknowledged the scam risks and wanted to proceed.</p><p>“While this scam is not covered by the PSR’s mandatory reimbursement rules, we have refunded the customer the second payment of £2,160 to Western Union as an acknowledgement that this payment could have been blocked by our systems.”</p><p>A spokesman for NatWest said: “We are glad we have been able to prevent Ms Basu from having her money stolen through a bank impersonation scam. At NatWest, we are using the latest tools and technology to catch and detect scams.</p><p>“We will never ask any customer to move money from their account to another account ‘to keep it safe’; this is one of the most common signs of a scam.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

It was a beautiful day, and summer was just around the corner. My twin sister had given birth to a baby boy, and my 65-year-old mother, Elizabeth, had come to stay with me in Mortlake, south London. We planned to go to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital to visit the new baby.</p><p>My husband walked my two eldest children, Barnaby and Sapphire – who were six and four at the time – to school and then hopped on a train to work. My mother, my two-year-old daughter, Pollyanna, and <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/relationships/how-boris-johnson-got-me-back-on-a-bus/\">I set off to catch the bus</a> to the hospital.</p><p>My mother, who lived in rural Shropshire, loved London buses and much preferred them to the train.</p><p>We walked, with Pollyanna in her pram, the short distance from our house to the local bus depot. As we approached, Pollyanna climbed out of her buggy and held my mother’s hand.</p><p>This was when my life changed irreversibly. I turned around, and all I could see was a monstrous, red Metroline bus approaching at a ferocious speed. Instead of turning into the depot, it drove on to the pavement, aiming straight for us. It happened so fast – almost like a bomb going off.</p><p>My legs were trapped under the bus, and I was like the jam in the middle of a horrid sandwich – bus, me, wall. Blood was everywhere. I slipped in and out of consciousness. Out of one eye, I saw my darling, precious, beautiful mother slipping away. She did not survive.</p><p>Out of my other eye, I saw my little daughter about 20<strong> </strong>ft away. She had been flung through the air, and her right leg was hanging off. I was trapped and could not help her. I shouted for my mother so loudly. I wanted her to answer me, but she did not. She could not.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The crash quickly flooded the news as my husband – <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/c/cf-cj/christopher-hope/\">The Telegraph’s Christopher Hope</a> – received a call at work to tell him what had happened.</p><p>As he <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/christopher-hope-relives-bus-crash-devastated-family/\">made the terrible journey</a> from his office in Victoria to Mortlake, he did not even know if we were alive or not. Four surgeons spent seven hours trying to save <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/lost-leg-when-two-now-18-going-dance-school/\">Pollyanna’s leg, but they could not, and she had it amputated</a>.</p><p>I suffered severe degloving in my leg (where skin and soft tissue is torn from the muscle or bone underneath), among other injuries. However, knowing that I would never see my mother again was the most unbearable wound.</p><p>The bus driver who hit us was found guilty of one count of death by dangerous driving and two counts of grievous bodily harm. He was sentenced to four years in prison, which is simply not long enough. Often, only aggravating factors like being under the influence of drink or drugs result in a longer sentence, but it is rare that criminal drivers get more than 12 years behind bars.</p><p>On average, four people die every day on UK roads, and<strong> </strong>many dozens more suffer life-changing injuries. It is no wonder that victims of road crime – like me – feel utterly let down by the UK’s criminal justice system.</p><p>Metroline would not speak to me when I rang up their head office. I felt upset, hopeless and angry. So, in February 2014, I set out on a mission – for road crime to be treated as real crime, and for victims and their families to be treated with kindness and compassion in navigating the criminal justice system.</p><p>I met Boris Johnson, who was the mayor of London at the time. He said he was very sorry for what had happened to my family. He asked me whether <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/transport-for-london\">Transport for London (TfL)</a> had apologised, and I said no.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>He told me that must change. A few weeks later, my husband and I met with TfL and Metroline. They said they were very sorry. I said that “sorry” must hold meaning, and things began to change from then on.</p><p>The Sarah Hope Line was launched in February 2016. It is an incident line that offers confidential support to people involved in, or affected by, life-changing incidents on the TfL network. We have provided to more than 500 families what TfL did not give to us: trauma counselling, assistance with funeral costs and arrangements, and short-term accommodation for family members. Next Monday will mark our 10-year anniversary.</p><p>While the line supports families of the bereaved, we still have not yet changed the attitude within government that road crashes are “just one of those things”. This Government should spend much more on policing our roads, so that <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/08/14/ban-britains-most-dangerous-drivers-for-life-say-tories/\">criminal drivers</a> can be caught.

Fatalities, alone, cost the NHS billions every year. That money should be spent on policing our roads and preventing such devastation.</p><p>Perpetrators think they can get away with causing death by dangerous driving because sentences do not reflect the severity of the crime.

But yes, people are in the wrong place.</p><p>“Problem is that all the British people keep to the left and normally Europeans keep to the right. And they do that in both directions. So we can be crashing into each other and I see that from personal experience.</p><p>“We just [need to] make sure that everybody going this way keeps going left, and [those] going this way keep to the right,” he added, gesturing with his hands to illustrate the different directions.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The humorous aside came after the Danish-born airport boss warned earlier this week that Heathrow could lose its coveted spot as Europe’s busiest airport to rivals such as Amsterdam or Paris unless a third runway is approved for construction.</p><p>Mr Woldbye said on Tuesday: “We remain Europe’s largest airport but latest figures show we may lose that position in 2026 and we cannot keep driving growth for the UK economy without more capacity.”</p><p>When asked what he thought of the Government’s position on the third runway, he said it was broadly supportive. But he added: “We don’t have long-term regulation, which is clear in terms of us building a business case.”</p><p>Last year, Heidi Alexander, the Transport Secretary, gave the go-ahead to <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/02/10/top-airlines-attack-heathrow-expansion-plans-in-blow-reeves/\">Heathrow’s preferred plan</a> to build a third runway over the top of the M25 motorway, a scheme likely to generate controversy over its cost and complexity.</p><p>The third runway scheme, which will see a 3,500-metre strip built to the north-west of Heathrow’s existing site, is currently estimated to cost around £49bn.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Included in the controversial plans are a scheme to build a 66,000-space car park at a cost of £2.6bn, as revealed by the City AM financial newspaper last summer.</p><p>The airport boss was also criticised on Thursday for <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/12/06/heathrow-taxing-motorists-to-meet-net-zero-targets/\">raising drop-off fees</a> paid by drivers to £7 – and threatening an £80 fine for motorists spending longer than 10 minutes saying goodbye to their loved ones.</p><p>He said in response to the criticism: “So when we make profits on all parts of the business, rather than just running the airport, that actually goes to reducing the charge [applied to passengers’ tickets].</p><p>“Whenever we make less money ... passengers are actually paying [for] that,” he added.</p><p>“We have an incentive to make as much money as we can, on the side, from anything that actually reduces the charge for passengers.”</p><p>Heathrow’s charges are regulated by the Government. The airport pays for its infrastructure by imposing a <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/07/11/heathrow-increase-passenger-charges/\">charge on airline passengers’ tickets</a>.</p><p>Airlines, including Virgin Atlantic and British Airways, have set up a pressure group called Heathrow Reimagined, which calls for “urgent and fundamental reform” of this funding system.</p></div></div></div></div>",

Just as Sarandos was sitting down for meetings with Trump’s officials, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/warner-bros-pictures/\">Warner Bros</a> announced that it considered a rival $111bn (£82bn) offer from Paramount to be superior.</p><p>Having been usurped at the 11th hour, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/26/paramount-wins-bidding-war-warner-bros-netflix/\">Netflix quickly folded</a>, paving the way for a dramatic denouement to a saga that has gripped Tinseltown for months.</p><p>For <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/26/paramount-wins-bidding-war-warner-bros-netflix/\">Paramount</a>, which is controlled by Larry Ellison, the Oracle billionaire, it signals the biggest victory to date in an ambitious plan to seize control of US media. Looming over everything, however, is the role played by Ellison’s “good friend” Trump.</p><p>As far as Hollywood takeovers go, the battle for Warner Bros has been nothing short of a blockbuster.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Skydance, the company led by Larry Ellison’s son David, sealed an <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/06/03/paramount-agrees-8bn-merger-deal-with-david-ellison/\">$8bn (£6bn) takeover of Paramount last summer</a> before quickly turning its attention to the real target: Warner Bros.</p><p>Paramount, which owns television channels such as Comedy Central and Channel 5, as well as the Paramount+ streaming service and its film studios, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/11/paramount-poised-to-bid-for-warner-bros-in-media-merger/\">fired the starting gun</a> by tabling an all-cash bid for Warner Bros in September. The move prompted David Zaslav, the Warner Bros chief executive, to put his company on the block.</p><p>In December, Warner Bros, which is behind franchises such as Harry Potter and Batman and also owns the HBO Max streaming service, home to hits such as Succession and The White Lotus, agreed to an<a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/12/05/netflix-land-harry-potter-franchise-warner-bros-merger/\"> $83bn takeover by Netflix</a>.</p><p>Paramount refused to give up. The media group mounted an aggressive charm-offensive, preaching the advantages of its bid to politicians and regulators while highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the Netflix deal. It also threatened to mount a proxy fight on the Warner Bros board.</p><p>Warner Bros repeatedly rebuffed Paramount’s advances. Ultimately, however, the persistence paid off.</p><p>Warner Bros said this month it would give Paramount a week to submit its “best and final” offer, leading the suitor to increase its bid to $31 per share. Paramount also agreed to pay a so-called “ticking fee” of $0.25 per share for every quarter the deal does not close, a $7bn termination fee if the transaction does not gain regulatory approval and a $2.8bn break fee owed to Netflix.</p><p>On Thursday night, the board of Warner Bros threw its weight behind this $111bn offer. Netflix was given four working days to match the bid, but declined the opportunity. Co-chief executives Sarandos and Greg Peters said the deal was “no longer financially attractive”, insisting: “This transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Politics heavily at play</h2><p>Behind the eye-watering sums of money, politics has been heavily at play. While Trump ostensibly does not have a direct role in the deal, his interventions and sway over regulators are impossible to ignore.</p><p>Netflix had long acknowledged that its path to regulatory approval would be a tricky one, warning investors that it could take 18 months to get the deal cleared.</p><p>Trump’s department of justice had already launched a review into the takeover amid concerns that combining two of the largest US streaming platforms – Netflix and HBO Max – would harm competition.</p><p>Netflix also faced a fierce backlash from cinema operators and high-profile Hollywood figures such as James Cameron, the director of hit films such as Avatar and Titanic, who feared that the streaming giant would reduce the number of films released on the big screen. Netflix always rebuffed such claims.</p><p>Paramount, by contrast, has sought to downplay the regulatory risks of its offer, even as its swoop would reduce the number of Hollywood studios from five to four.</p><p>Here, politics has never been far below the surface – with Ellison’s links to Trump garnering much attention as the tycoon tightens his grip on US media.</p><p>Already, Paramount has snapped up The Free Press, an online media outlet founded by the high-profile “anti-woke” <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/06/bari-weiss-anti-woke-superstar-shaking-american-jouralis/\">journalist Bari Weiss</a>, and installed her as the head of CBS, which is now facing accusations of an aggressive shift to the Right. Ellison is also the linchpin of a conglomerate that bought up TikTok’s US assets. Trump has described the billionaire as a “good friend”.</p><p>News will play a crucial role in the merger. Unlike Netflix’s deal, Paramount is bidding for the entirety of the Warner Bros Discovery group, including its traditional networks. As a result, Ellison will control the news networks CNN and CBS.</p><p>Mark Thompson, the former BBC director-general <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/08/30/former-bbc-boss-take-charge-cnn-us-election/\">who now leads CNN</a>, urged staff not to “jump to conclusions” after Paramount emerged as the winning suitor.</p><p>Still, even without the news element, Trump had been particularly disparaging of the Netflix tie-up. Shortly after the deal was announced in December, he said the streaming giant had a “big market share” and that the combined company’s size “<a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/12/08/trump-netflixs-83bn-warner-bros-deal-problem/\">could be a problem</a>”.</p><p>The row hit a fever pitch last weekend when Susan Rice, a former Obama adviser who sits on Netflix’s board, warned that Democrats would punish companies that “take a knee” to the president. Trump demanded that Netflix sack Rice or “pay the consequences”.</p><p>While navigating this tough landscape, Sarandos had sought to play down Trump’s influence. He <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20jn073gj4o\" rel=\"nofollow\">told the BBC</a>: “This is a business deal. It’s not a political deal.” He acknowledged, however, that the president “likes to do a lot of things on social media”.</p><p>Mike Proulx, an analyst at Forrester, said: “Politics are playing an outsized role in this deal, and they’ve been on Paramount’s side from the get-go.</p><p>“Even if Netflix hadn’t walked away, it was unlikely their deal would’ve made it through a politically charged regulatory process.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘Not a done deal’</h2><p>While Warner Bros is now Paramount’s to lose – with the regulatory process likely to be smoother – the saga is yet to come to a conclusion. Rob Bonta, California’s attorney general, said on Thursday night that the takeover was “not a done deal” as he vowed to carry out a “vigorous” review.</p><p>Key to this will be the impact on the Hollywood economy. Paramount has said it will cut $6bn of costs, triggering concerns about heavy job losses. Sarandos has argued this will be followed by even deeper cuts as Paramount seeks to pay down heavy debt levels from its bid.</p><p>On Thursday, Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator who has called for a bribery investigation into Trump’s role in the Ellison takeover of Paramount, branded the company’s swoop on Warner Bros an “antitrust disaster”.</p><p>She said: “A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want. With the cloud of corruption looming over Trump’s department of justice, it’ll be up to the American people to speak up and state attorneys general to enforce the law.”</p><p>Meanwhile, concerns have also been raised over the vast sums of Gulf money bankrolling the Paramount deal. Sarandos branded foreign state ownership of media companies a “bad idea” this week.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Gulf ownership of media assets has been thrust into the spotlight in recent years after Abu Dhabi-backed fund RedBird IMI mounted an unsuccessful takeover bid for The Telegraph.</p><p>RedBird Capital, the US private equity fund that was the minority partner in the failed Telegraph takeover, is now helping to fund Paramount’s Warner Bros bid.</p><p>David Ellison could be forced to face up to these questions if he is called to a scheduled Senate antitrust hearing next week.</p><p>Netflix’s investors appear to have welcomed the streaming giant’s decision to back out of the complex and politically fraught deal. Shares jumped almost 9pc in post-market trading.</p><p>For now, the biggest winner of the saga is undoubtedly Warner Bros’s Zaslav, who is in line to pocket hundreds of millions of dollars from the sale.</p><p>The Warner Bros Discovery group, which was itself <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/05/17/discovery-att-join-forces-form-new-streaming-giant/\">formed through a $43bn mega-merger</a> in 2022, has seen its share price languish amid concerns about heavy debt and a decline in its traditional television business. On Thursday night, Zaslav hailed the deal as one which would create “tremendous” value for shareholders, adding that he could not wait to work with Paramount.</p><p>The Ellisons will probably be celebrating their biggest coup in an audacious empire-building spree across the US media. Yet the billionaires would be wise not to claim their victory too early.</p><p>With an unpredictable force in the White House, the Warner Bros saga could yet hold one final twist.</p></div></div></div></div>",

Its first-mover success with Wegovy and Ozempic turned it into Europe’s largest company, with the $100bn (£74bn) weight-loss drugs market at its feet.</p><p>The tide has since turned. This week, Novo admitted that its newest drugs were showing less promise in trials than those of its American rival Eli Lilly. It has also yielded to Donald Trump’s demand for <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/18/drugmaker-halves-price-of-ozempic-for-americans-trump/\">hefty price cuts</a> in the hitherto lucrative US market.</p><p>Novo is now in a metaphorical weight-loss programme of its own. It has shed its long-serving chief executive, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/10/ozempic-maker-to-cut-9000-jobs/\">cut 11pc of its workforce</a> and lost hordes of foreign shareholders.</p><p>This is not a typical tale of corporate tumult. Novo is such a colossus in Denmark that its ructions can shake the country’s whole economy.</p><p>Yet Mette Frederiksen, the country’s Left-wing prime minister, chose this moment to take the country to an early election, set for March 24.</p><p>Since taking office in 2019, Frederiksen has steered Denmark through the turbulence of the pandemic, the Ukraine war and Trump’s threats to seize Greenland.</p><p>She will be hoping that <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/21/ozempic-maker-suffers-boardroom-exodus-row-shareholder/\">Novo’s travails</a> do not derail her bid for a third straight election victory.</p><p>It is something of a gamble. Novo’s fate is inextricably linked to that of the economy and thus to her own political prospects.</p><p>The company sold 309bn krone (£36bn) of drugs last year, which is more than 10pc of Denmark’s annual $430bn GDP. It employs one in every 100 Danes.</p><p>As Novo’s crisis deepened, Denmark’s economy – which was one of the fastest-growing in Europe – slowed dramatically at the end of last year. The country recorded 2.2pc growth in the third quarter, falling to just 0.2pc in the fourth.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Per Hansen, an economist at bank Nordnet, says: “One of the engines that has been driving the Danish economy over the past two to three years has been Novo Nordisk and the pharma industry.”</p><p>Las Olsen, the chief economist at Danske Bank, says that if you remove the pharmaceuticals sector, Denmark’s growth rate would be more like 1pc or 1.5pc.</p><p>“Which is fine, of course – but not the stellar growth rate that we have seen in the headline numbers,” he says. “I think we will grow more in line with European economies, perhaps a little less.”</p><p>These aren’t views that will cheer up <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/21/danes-gloomy-about-future-as-ozempic-maker-slumps/\">the gloomy Danes</a>.</p><p>Measures of Danish consumer confidence have languished in deeply negative territory ever since Russia invaded Ukraine.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>“It’s a conundrum,” says Helge Pedersen, the chief economist at Nordea Bank. “House prices are at a record high, there’s almost no unemployment – everything is good but consumers are depressed.”</p><p>He says ordinary Danes are still preoccupied with inflation, even though the official rate is just 0.8pc.</p><p>“People are still worried about inflation, in particular food prices. We all discuss meat prices, they’re so high, coffee prices, chocolate prices. But that’s perceived inflation, which is higher than reality.”</p><p>Frederiksen and her centre-Left coalition partners have already started delving into the public coffers to soothe voters’ disgruntlement.</p><p>The Danish government recently cut the tax on electricity bills to almost zero. It also increased spending on childcare and welfare support and removed taxes on coffee, chocolate and sugar.</p><p>It has plenty of fiscal firepower. It was running a budget surplus estimated at more than 2pc of GDP in 2025 and its debt-to-GDP ratio was 30pc last year, one third that of Britain.</p><p>That allowed Denmark to ramp up defence spending last year by more than $4bn, which – along with higher healthcare expenditure – may prop the economy through any pharma slowdown.</p><p>The defence spending is a response to the Russia threat and also to <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/01/07/trump-squeezes-defence-industry-in-new-arms-race/\">pressure from Trump</a>. He has called for Europe to fund its own defence and he is looking to wrestle at least de facto control over the Danish territory of Greenland.</p><p>Hansen says the Greenland issue may also have cast a pall over consumer confidence.</p><p>“Danish people are afraid that the new world order that is initiated by Mr Trump is something we have not dealt with since World War Two. That is really what is scaring the Danes,” he says.</p><p>Paradoxically, though, it may be helping the tough-talking and experienced Frederiksen. Since Trump’s Greenland manoeuvring became more explicit and tangible, her Social Democratic Party’s previously fading popularity has rebounded.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Geopolitical uncertainty and cost of living pressures are common across Europe. But in Denmark, there could be another more idiosyncratic source of economic anxiety.</p><p>Around 10pc of Danes hold shares in Novo. Many more will be exposed to its precipitous share-price decline via their private pensions.</p><p>Hansen, though, says Danish investors have been strangely patriotic: as foreigners have fled, Danes have been buying up the stock.</p><p>“The number of Danish private clients with us that hold one or more Novo Nordisk shares keeps climbing,” he says. “People still think there is a difference between what Novo Nordisk will achieve longer term and its current valuation in the stock market.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Denmark’s economists, like its investors, also seem relatively sanguine about their country’s economic champion. Olsen says he was more worried during Novo’s breakneck growth phase than he is now.</p><p>“The fear was that it might erode the competitiveness of the rest of the economy. The large amount of hiring at Novo Nordisk could have led to very high base growth, that would then leave the rest of the economy uncompetitive if something was to go wrong,” he says.</p><p>“But what we have seen so far is that manufacturing wages growth in Denmark has, if anything, been lower over the last four or five years than we see in competitor countries. There is a competitive economy outside of Novo Nordisk.”</p><p>Pedersen agrees that the Danish economy is diversified enough to weather the Novo storm: “But of course you should keep an eye on it because the numbers are still so big on the macro level.</p><p>“Politicians do need to be aware that we have two Denmarks – one with and one without the pharmaceutical industry.”</p><p>Right now, the politician with the most riding on the Danish pharmaceuticals industry is Frederiksen.</p><p>As she called the election, she talked mostly about Greenland and wealth taxes.</p><p>Novo Nordisk’s decline might have garnered global attention with the company no longer deemed Denmark’s greatest success story.</p><p>Yet for Frederiksen, the hope is that this will simply be background noise as she bids for a third straight election victory – instead of a shot in the arm for her political rivals.</p></div></div></div></div>",

The news coincides, oddly, with the dramatic arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor (“Very Westeros,” Evans quips).</p><p>Have the two artistic directors of the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-shakespeare-company/\">Royal Shakespeare Company</a> hit on the holy grail – the next <em>Stranger Things: First Shadow</em>, perhaps or<em> </em><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/tickets/london/harry-potter-cursed-child/\"><em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</em></a>? “That thinking is dangerous,” Evans, 52, counters. “The minute you think like that, you can jinx it.</p><p>“The reason we’re passionate about this is because it reads like a Shakespeare history play. It concerns leadership, succession, power, internecine fighting. George RR Martin is obsessed with Shakespeare.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The globally successful HBO series (2011-19) was notorious for its scenes of sex and violence – it carried an 18 certificate in Britain. The prequel centres on the fabled Great Tourney [jousting tournament] at Harrenhal castle, and the tyrant king Aerys II Targaryen. “It’s going to be total theatre,” promises Evans of the production, which will be directed by <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/theatre-director-dominic-cooke-left-think-better-everyone-else/\">Dominic Cooke</a> (<em>Hello, Dolly!</em>). “There will be a content advisory, but we’re expecting it to be something the whole family can enjoy.”</p><p>The pair also tell me about the next wave of RSC programming for the autumn and winter which is announced today. This includes an all-male production of <em>As You Like It </em>(directed by Evans), <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/11/08/harriet-walter-interview/\">Harriet Walter</a> reprising her star turn as Brutus in a 90-minute version of Phyllida Lloyd’s acclaimed all-female <em>Julius Caesar</em>, plus a two-part adaptation of <em>Middlemarch </em>from Nina Raine. The year looks set to end on a swashbuckling high with <em>The Three Musketeers</em>, in which Dumas’s musketeers will be – gasp! – female.</p><p>Evans and Harvey, are a seamless and courteous double act. Having both enjoyed success running regional theatres (him: Sheffield and Chichester; her: Theatr Clwyd in Wales), they bonded during the stresses of the pandemic, and applied for one of the biggest jobs in British theatre on a joint ticket in 2022, succeeding Erica Whyman, who was briefly promoted from deputy after 10 years of Gregory Doran at the helm. Their tenure began properly in 2024. It’s full-on stuff, with Harvey, 48, talking about days that run from dawn to midnight, with her family commitments as a mother of two interspersed: “We often wish we could clone ourselves.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>In a departure from longstanding RSC man Doran’s methodical march through the canon, they have modified the approach so that it’s now more about bringing in diverse artistic talents with fresh, exciting ideas about what to stage, and how to stage it. As Harvey explains: “For us, there’s no point in putting on <em>King John</em> just because it hasn’t been done for a few years.”</p><p>The new rule is that there is no rule – anything could, conceivably, be an RSC show. While that approach might alarm traditionalists, it has reaped dividends in terms of ticket sales. More than 352,000 people attended productions in Stratford in their first year and <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/the-bfg-rsc-review/\"><em>The BFG </em>last Christmas</a> was the highest-grossing play in the history of the RSC. Rupert Goold’s <em>Hamlet </em>also played to 90 per cent capacity, while <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/kenneth-branagh-rsc/\">Kenneth Branagh’s imminent return to the RSC for the first time in more than 30 years</a> in <em>The Tempest </em>has already sold out, just as <em>Macbeth</em>, starring <em>Outlander</em>’s Sam Heughan, did. <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em>, starring Adrian Lester, is transferring to the West End this summer on the back of rave reviews.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>A recent hit,<em> </em><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/measure-for-measure-royal-shakespeare-company/\"><em>Measure for Measure </em>at Stratford</a>, played fast and loose with the text – what do they think is acceptable in terms of tweaking texts many regard as sacrosanct? Evans tells me: “It’s OK to rewrite Shakespeare, but it’s not a free-for-all. Give us your rationale. The rule is that we’re not opposed to it. We’re not purists.” Harvey chips in with thoughts fresh from her rehearsals on <em>Henry V</em>, which she is about to bring to the Stratford main stage, with Alfred Enoch in the lead. “You can pick up any Arden edition and the footnotes read like a food fight between different editors,” she says. In her staging, too, she’s feminising some parts: “I didn’t want it to be a world where we assumed that almost everyone is male other than Katharine and Queen Isabel.”</p><p>One could easily spend an hour talking about <em>Henry V</em> (Harvey is, shockingly, the first woman to direct the play in the RSC’s history), but there are other serious matters to discuss.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2026/02/12/trevor-nunn-interview-imogen-stubbs-broke-my-heart/\">Trevor Nunn</a>, the former RSC chief, stated that the RSC needed a London home; its purpose-built abode, the Barbican, is now one of a number of venues taking RSC work. “We are working out what London means for us,” says Harvey.</p><p>The more pressing task is transport to Stratford, which can seem Elizabethan in its remoteness. “To be frank,” Evans says, “a direct and better train service from London would be transformational. There used to be a direct train to Stratford [until 2023]. There no longer is. And we suffer because of it. When you look at theatre programmes from the 1960s, they used to have the last train time.” Could transport failure scupper their mission? “It might, because if we can’t get people to Stratford, how on earth are we meant to put on plays?”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>That sounds quite existential, and behind the upbeat news there are clearly pressing challenges. Dividends reaped from ticket sales have not been substantial enough to mitigate the financial strain on the organisation, which is looking to reduce its workforce to achieve annual savings of £2.8m. In the autumn, the RSC announced that 420 of its 835 employees were eligible for voluntary redundancy – that consultation period is almost complete. The accounts for 2024-25 highlight the deficit problem: total income was £82m, substantially down on the previous year, with total expenditure running over £84m. Since then, annual repayments of the £20m Culture Recovery Fund loan taken out during Covid have kicked in, too. The drop in income partly reflects previous bumper takings at the box office – the 2022 <em>Matilda </em>film helped boost audiences for the stage show. But a cluster of factors are making life tougher.</p><p>“If you talk to most theatre leaders up and down the country, this is the case for them too,” Evans says. “Audiences have less money to spend because of the cost of living crisis. Costs have gone up exponentially. And there has long been a stand-still in <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/12/16/arts-council-neglecting-arts-to-change-society-says-review/\">Arts Council funding</a> [currently approx £15m], which means a real-terms cut.”</p><p>There are no magic wands. Shows such as <em>Les Misérables</em> – which bankrolled the RSC for decades – are, he says, “like gold-dust – you’d be a fool to rely on them and part of the work we’re doing [in cutting back expenditure] is insulating the RSC from that reliance”. The desirability of any given corporate sponsor aside (and the RSC <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/02/royal-shakespeare-company-ends-partnership-bp-concerns-climate/\">withdrew from a BP sponsorship deal</a> in 2019 following protests), those options have dwindled, too: “There’s less money. Wherever the money comes from, there’s a deeper issue about relying on corporate sponsorship now.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>One option would be to scale back on productions, but that isn’t in their game plan, Harvey argues. “We have to find different ways of working but a sure-fire way to oblivion would be to reduce our artistic ambition and do less because then there’d be no point in our existing. You can cut back or you can be ever more ambitious and find different ways of making work and we’re going that route.”</p><p>There have been rumblings of discontent, particularly over plans to close the music department, with its in-house musicians. An online petition – attracting almost 7,000 signatures – has called for a rethink. If enough people complain, will they change their position? Harvey is swift to justify the proposed changes: “It’s about ensuring that music is more fully integrated into how we make work and giving composers the opportunity to work with freelance musicians. Some music will be created electronically, some will be recorded, some of it will be live.”</p><p>Upheavals notwithstanding, they’re looking to the future, with Evans (also an actor who left drama school early in order to join the RSC in the 1990s), hinting at repertory ensemble models. “We want to keep surprising audiences,” says Harvey.</p><p>As the actors bound back into the spacious Ashcroft room to resume rehearsals for<em> Henry V,</em> she leaves me with a final thought. Whenever the weight of responsibility presses hard, she confides, “I love to remember that this place exists because in the 1870s a local brewer and his son thought there should be a theatre in Stratford. The town and the theatre industry told them that they were mad but they understood that these plays survive because they’re performed. I love to remember that right at the root of this is a local brewer who had a radical idea, and the passion to see it through.”</p><p><em>Priority booking for all newly announced productions opens March 2 at 10am, with public booking opening March 18 at 10am. Priority booking for Game of Thrones: The Mad King opens April 14 with public booking from April 24.

They’re the ones that are investing the most into this.</p><p>“I do worry about having the nation’s intellect effectively outsourced. It’s not just that, either. It’s the productivity gains.</p><p>“If for every hour of cognitive work that you do there’s a machine doing what would take you 50 hours, how do you as a nation compete with that?</p><p>“Electricity multiplied the power of muscles and AI can do the same with brains in certain scenarios. But it’s almost like you, as Britain and Europe are outsourcing national IQ to US and Chinese tech companies.</p><p>“So you’re left trying to regulate something you don’t own. And I do worry about that. I think of it as cognitive border control.”</p><p>Mulvany is better placed than most to sound the alarm. An eerily youthful 57 who betrays his Hawaiian roots with a surf-ready hairdo, he is an entrepreneur who has seen <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/16/the-endless-iou-powering-silicon-valleys-latest-tech-boom/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tech boom and bust</a> more than once.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>In a world increasingly haunted by visions of an AI apocalypse that would make the dotcom crash look like a minor market setback, Mulvany and Benevolent have already been tested to near-destruction.</p><p>The <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/09/17/woodford-patient-capital-takes-writedown-benevolent-ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">technology excited investors</a> – including the star fund manager Neil Woodford long before his self-inflicted implosion – enough to snag a £1.5bn valuation way back in 2018.</p><p>This was long before the likes of Sam Altman of OpenAI and Dario Amodei of Anthropic emerged to seek thrones as the next generation of tech plutocrats.</p><p>Benevolent sought to help researchers to quickly design new drugs with computer assistance, using machine learning techniques to scour a treasure trove of science information for possibilities at an unprecedented clip. Expansion into defence and energy markets promised new horizons and riches.</p><p>It seemed to work. Benevolent burst onto the public markets long before the current AI frontrunners had attracted the attention of everyday investors, too. With the world still in the grip of the pandemic and having discovered an anti-inflammatory that was proving useful on pandemic wards, the start-up made a splashy debut.</p><p>“I wasn’t really part of it at that time,” Mulvany recalls ruefully. Having seemingly set up Benevolent for enormous success, he was already easing into semi-retirement.</p><p>As it secured a lucrative listing in Amsterdam, Benevolent won endorsement and investment from some of the pharmaceutical industry’s biggest names. AstraZeneca backed Benevolent as part of a transaction that raised hundreds of millions.</p><p>Alas, Mulvany’s big payday and exit did not set the scene for a sustainable company. A starry board and big executive hires steered Benevolent off a cliff.</p><p>The company lost almost all its value within two years, prompting Mulvany to abandon his early retirement and mount a boardroom coup to take back control last year. He had become frustrated that Benevolent had shifted from his concept of a technology company to a drug developer in its own right, with all the risk and costs associated with it.</p><p>“They brought in some luminaries,” Mulvany recalls. “Some really heavy hitters from pharma. And Benevolent morphed from a tech company to a pharma company. For me as an investor, and for some of my fellow investors, we didn’t have the appetite for that. We were technology investors.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>“You had a technology shareholder base and a management and board doing biotech. All of its revenue was from its technology but it was spending a ton of money developing drugs.</p><p>“The technology cost was very low relative to drug development. So I became more of an activist shareholder at that point because it wasn’t going the way I wanted it to go and the markets reflected that too. It lost 95pc of its value.”</p><p>It’s a tale of hype meeting with financial and scientific reality that now seems to be playing out on an extreme scale as OpenAI and its rivals test the limits of pre-profit funding and investor patience. Altman alone has committed to spending more than $1tn (£750bn).</p><p>Having abandoned his retirement to mount his successful coup, Mulvany is now rebuilding Benevolent as an enterprise software company. Its new software and services are focused sharply on helping drug developers, rather than developing drugs. It’s a more commercial proposition, with a closer eye on returns for Benevolent and its big pharma customers.</p><p>“We help on the science side of things, reviewing the literature, but also how you make business decisions as a drug developer, how you expand into a particular market, how you design trials and all of that.</p><p>“People in the industry are making decisions with a fraction of the information they need.”</p><p>These are still the early days of Benevolent’s attempted comeback and Mulvany’s unexpected return from early retirement, which he had intended to spend skiing. His hopes of using the company’s targeted AI technology beyond drug discovery in fields such as defence and energy have been revived.</p><p>Benevolent, without revenue, now has the cash and investor support to pursue its new business into 2027, according to Mulvany.</p><p>Despite the mounting fears of an AI bust, he remains a believer in the technology. After a deep cull of staff, Benevolent’s coders are 50 times faster with the help of computer intelligence, for instance. But Mulvany, now an AI survivor, admits a shake-out lies ahead for those with grandiose visions.</p><p>“I saw this in the dotcom. I was there right at the bubble. But whether it’s railroads, or electricity or the internet there has always been over-investment and hype.</p><p>“So there’s going to be losers in this but the infrastructure is being put in place. So yeah, you’re seeing an AI bubble, but I’ve seen it before.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

The Los Angeles-headquartered company had previously offered $30 per share, valuing Warner Bros at $108.4bn (£80.3bn).</p><p>The improved bid represents a late effort by Paramount to derail an <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/16/netflix-promises-cheaper-streaming-hollywood-takeover-fight/\">$83bn takeover agreed between Warner Bros and Netflix</a> last year.</p><p>The board of Warner Bros has repeatedly rebuffed Paramount’s advances, insisting that the Netflix deal offers superior value.

However, it has acknowledged that the regulatory process could take up to 18 months.</p><p>Paramount, which would also face regulatory scrutiny, last week said it had cleared a key hurdle with the DOJ.</p><p>Netflix has also faced criticism from the cinema industry amid fears the streaming giant could release fewer films on the big screen.

More high-profile casualties are expected in the coming weeks.</p><p>Amid the continued hollowing out of town centres, one high street stalwart remains: Boots.</p><p>Outposts of the lipstick-to-prescriptions business can still be found across the country, but many are in a sad state. After its exit from the stock market in 2007, Boots has spent the last two decades being starved of investment.</p><p>With serial dealmaker <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/30/boots-biggest-problem-is-now-its-billionaire-owner/\">Stefano Pessina leading the charge, Boots has been allowed to dwindle</a> – first under the ownership of private equity’s original Barbarians at the Gate, KKR, then as a forgotten overseas outpost of American pharmacy giant Walgreens.</p><p>Now Boots is in the hands of another private equity house, Sycamore Partners, after the New York-based outfit took Walgreens off the public markets last summer. Employees must fear yet more decline.</p><p>However, a shake-up at the very top of the company may signal a revival for one of Britain’s best-loved and most important retailers.</p><p>After leading the pharmacy giant for almost a decade, Boots chief executive Ornella Barra is stepping down to become chair. She replaces Pessina, who is also her business partner and husband, and is believed to still own half of the business at the ripe age of 84.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>At the same time, managing director Anthony Hemmerdinger is being handed a much bigger role running Boots, including oversight of the No7 beauty brand – long regarded as one of several jewels in the stable.</p><p>The management reshuffle is viewed internally, and in the City, as another major step towards setting Boots free from its ownership purgatory and returning it to the UK stock market.</p><p>City sources said a float is still the main long-term ambition of the owners, and more likely to occur next year than in 2026.</p><p>A former executive said a spin-off of Boots “was always the plan” and the boardroom changes were “a step towards that”. The break-up of Walgreens into five standalone entities – Boots among them – shortly after its <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/03/07/boots-bought-by-us-private-equity-in-10bn-deal/\">£8bn takeover last year</a> was seen as the first real step.</p><p>The prospect of Boots being groomed for a spectacular public markets comeback under new leadership will raise hopes of a long overdue makeover of its unloved shops. Shoppers will be hoping that it also means a halt to any further closures.</p><p>The sale to Sycamore came after Boots axed 300 stores across the UK, drastically reducing its footprint from 2,200 to around 1,900 branches. <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/07/10/ailing-boots-searches-way-back-health/\">Boots also shut 48 opticians in 2020</a>, and had kickstarted a store closure plan the previous year that ended with more than 200 outlets being given the chop.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>The status of Boots as more than just your typical bog-standard retailer means its future garners more attention than others.</p><p>Armed with Britain’s best-selling skincare brand No 7, the chain believes it can continue to compete in the booming beauty market despite the excitement surrounding the arrival of <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/events/went-shopping-uks-first-branch-sephora-does-live-hype/\">LVMH-backed French phenomenon Sephora in Britain</a>, as well as other upstarts.</p><p>Amid the glamour of expensive lipstick and eyelash-thickening mascara, it is easy to forget that Boots is an integral part of the country’s healthcare system. Without its sprawling network of pharmacists, thousands of people would struggle to get their vital medicines and daily pills.</p><p>Its last round of store closures was accompanied by an apologetic statement explaining that the decision was “not taken lightly” and that in all cases there was an alternative store less than three miles away.</p><p>Yet that didn’t prevent an outcry in some affected towns, with locals complaining about being forced to endure long queues at other pharmacies, which in some cases had led to delays in getting their prescriptions.</p><p>Boots bosses have long rejected the portrayal of a business stuck in retreat as lazy and outdated.</p><p>“The Boots Group is in great shape, both financially and operationally, with Boots UK having grown market share for 19 consecutive quarters,” Barra said as she stepped aside.</p><p>But that fact masks the two-speed nature of the business. A former executive said there are around 500 Boots shops that are “the powerhouse of the business” – the vast majority of which have already been revamped.</p><p>However, the rest are much smaller shops, which are vital to the surrounding communities but cost “between £50,000 and £100,000” to refurbish with no resulting “uplift” in turnover, making it hard to justify the outlay.</p><p>“Pharmacies are really difficult to make money in now, because of what the Government pays per prescription,” another ex-director said. In November, the Department of Health and Social Care announced that NHS prescription charges would be frozen for the second year running.</p><p> Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, adds: “There has been immense profiling of a small number of new and modernised stores, gaining lots of capital expenditure and senior management attention, to show the newfound vitality of Boots.</p><p>“But the reality is that many Boots are drab, under-invested, and needing of an injection of elevated execution that British shoppers will notice across the board.”</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Those who know the business well say Boots branches need to become even bigger healthcare hubs, so that they can alleviate pressure on local GPs by providing more of the services that you would usually go to your doctor for.</p><p>The chain already does private online doctor consultations, vaccinations and blood pressure checks, as well as specialised treatments for skin and hair loss. However, it is eyeing a larger role in diagnostics with “at-home” testing kits for conditions such as high cholesterol, vitamin deficiencies and food intolerances. These will be offered under the mantra of standing “shoulder to shoulder with the NHS”.</p><p>If the move is successful, it would justify spending more capital on its smaller stores, many of which struggle to turn a profit.</p><p>The former executive says: “The mantra…was always ‘We’re going to have a great Boots in every major town, and none that we’re ashamed of.’ I think that will continue.”</p></div></div></div></div>",

What we are seeing instead is a decline on fast-forward. In a world of rising energy demand, tighter public finances and intense geopolitical competition, Britain cannot afford to treat oil and gas as a moral litmus test rather than a pragmatic bridge to net zero.</p><p>Instead of extracting maximum value from our remaining resources, we are turning a home-grown strategic asset into a political symbol. Closing it down is presented as <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"http://telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/15/labour-net-zero-strategy-ripping-heart-out-britain/\">proof of seriousness on net zero</a>. Yet we will still rely on oil and gas for decades.</p><p>We require realism about the energy system and about the fuels already embedded within it. The real question is simple: do we produce what we need at home, supporting British jobs, revenues and energy security? Or do we import more from abroad?</p><p>In today’s volatile world, that choice matters more than ever. Energy is once again a source of national power.</p><p>The US is using <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/12/19/the-marvellous-prospect-of-cheap-energy-again/\">cheap domestic energy</a> to attract industry. Norway continues to develop its oil and gas while remaining a climate leader. Meanwhile, Britain is debating whether to shrink its own production faster than demand declines.</p><p>We should be accelerating electrification as fast as possible. Transport, heating and industry must move on to clean power. And the electricity system must expand rapidly to support that shift. That is the only credible route to net zero and energy security.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>But accelerating electrification does not mean pretending oil and gas will disappear overnight.</p><p>Start with the facts. Even under the Climate Change Committee’s most ambitious pathway, the UK will require 13 to 15 billion barrels of oil and gas between now and 2050. That would account for around 14pc of our energy supply.</p><p>Yet Britain is choosing dependency. We already import roughly half our oil and gas. Without fresh investment, that could rise to 80pc by 2030. By 2050, domestic production will meet only a fraction of what we still consume.</p><p>Even if we extracted every remaining viable barrel from the UK Continental Shelf – an estimated nine to 10 billion barrels – it would not meet projected demand. At best, we could cover around half our needs domestically. The rest would still be imported.</p><p>And imports themselves are not necessarily better. Gas shipped halfway around the world often has a higher carbon footprint than gas produced in UK waters.</p><p>The basin has been subjected to repeated short-term fiscal interventions – sudden tax rises, temporary levies and shifting allowances. The <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/30/labour-prepared-to-scrap-north-sea-windfall-tax-in-dash-for/\">windfall tax</a> has pushed headline rates to punishing levels, with some operators facing effective tax rates of more than 90pc.</p><p>The consequences are visible. Industry estimates suggest that £50bn of investment has been rejected or deferred under current conditions. Around 1,000 jobs are being lost every month across the sector. Capital is flowing elsewhere.</p><p>Yes, the levy raises revenue in the short term. But you cannot tax what is no longer produced. Accelerate decline and you shrink the future tax base, while bringing forward vast clean-up costs.</p><p>The UK faces between £40bn and £60bn in offshore decommissioning costs in the coming decades. Between £20bn and £30bn of that will ultimately fall to taxpayers through tax relief. Faster decline brings those bills forward while shrinking the revenue available to offset them.</p><p>Decline may be inevitable, but that doesn’t mean we should accelerate it. What the North Sea needs isn’t subsidy, but stability. A predictable fiscal framework would allow companies to invest, extend viable fields and manage decline responsibly.</p><p>That strengthens energy security, preserves skilled jobs and generates revenues to fund the transition.</p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>There is still significant value left. Industry estimates suggest billions of additional barrels could be unlocked under stable conditions, potentially adding more than £100bn in economic value. That supports communities, strengthens the balance of payments and helps finance the clean technologies of the future.</p><p>None of this weakens Britain’s commitment to net zero. The 2050 target must stand. Climate change is real and dangerous. But cutting domestic production faster than demand falls does not reduce global emissions. It simply shifts supply elsewhere.</p><p>Even under <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/17/miliband-miss-net-zero-targets-unless-spends-extra-75bn/\">Clean Power 2030</a>, substantial gas capacity will remain in the system to keep the lights on when the wind does not blow. Gas does not disappear because it’s politically inconvenient.</p><p>Using domestic resources pragmatically, while building nuclear and other firm low-carbon power, isn’t a retreat. It’s realism.</p><p>An energy strategy built on climate theatre will not endure. If electricity remains expensive, if industry relocates and if public consent fractures, climate policy will falter.</p><p>The North Sea isn’t a relic. It’s a strategic asset in managed decline. Used wisely, it can strengthen energy security, support jobs and generate revenues while we build the low-carbon system of the future.</p><p>Wind it down prematurely and we don’t eliminate demand. We export it.</p><hr/><p><em>Tone Langengen is senior energy policy adviser at the Tony Blair Institute</em></p></div></div></div></div>",

The extra expenses are mainly due to problems with electromechanical work: the wiring and plumbing needed around the reactors, which are now in place.</p><p>If that work hits further snags, project costs will rise by at least another £1bn, EDF has warned. Given inflation will push all these prices up, Hinkley’s final cost is now all but certain to exceed £50bn.</p><p>When first planned a decade ago, Hinkley C was predicted to cost £18bn and to start operations around 2025.</p><p>However, the project’s expenses has ballooned since then, as the delivery timeline has slipped.</p><p>EDF said the project would cost between £25bn and £26bn in 2024 and be delivered in 2027.

However, EDF has reduced its stake in that project to just 12.5pc, with the UK Government holding 44.9pc and most of the risk.</p><p>EDF runs the UK’s remaining fleet of five nuclear power stations, each with two reactors. Its accounts reveal that a fall in prices and a prolonged outage at one of its nuclear power stations dragged on UK profits last year.</p><p>The company said nuclear output from its five active power stations decreased by 12pc last year. Its Sizewell B facility in Suffolk and Torness in Scotland had a strong performance, but was hit by an extended outage at the Hartlepool power station in Durham.</p><p>The station, in Teesside, North East England, began generating power 43 years ago and provides enough electricity to power around two million homes. It was given a further one-year extension to generate electricity until March 2028, one year later than previously expected.</p><p>But outages affecting one of its two reactor systems were the main driver of EDF’s overall drop in nuclear output last year.

Pâté is also being dropped, while tinned mackerel will be available only until the current stock has sold out.</p><p>Instead, Waitrose will be promoting smoked herring and cured sea bass as “tasty alternatives”.</p><p><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/08/waitrose-outperforms-rivals-for-fourth-month-running/\">Waitrose is the first major UK supermarket</a> to stop stocking mackerel. It comes after the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, which helps governments manage their fish stocks, last year called for a <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/10/08/halt-north-sea-fishing-to-protect-british-cod-extinction/\">70pc reduction in mackerel fishing</a>, warning stocks were dangerously depleted.</p><p>Jake Pickering, the head of agriculture, aquaculture and fisheries at Waitrose, said: “By suspending sourcing of mackerel at Waitrose we are reinforcing our ethical and sustainable business commitments, acting to tackle overfishing and protect the long-term health of our oceans and this crucial fish.”</p><p>Mackerel populations in the north-east Atlantic are now at their lowest level in more than 20 years.</p><p>The UK, Norway and the Faroe Islands recently agreed to cut mackerel catches by 48pc but observers have warned that this is not enough to allow populations to rebound. The European Commission warned in December that the deal “poses serious risks for the sustainability of the mackerel stock”.</p><p>Mr Pickering added: “Our customers trust us to source responsibly, and we are closely monitoring the fishery. We look forward to bringing mackerel back to our shelves once it meets our high sourcing standards.”</p><p><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/columnists/supermarket-value-ranges-new-middle-class-status-symbol/\">The supermarket said it would start stocking</a> mackerel again if and when fish stocks recover.</p><p>Mackerel, an iridescent oily fish with a strong flavour, is high in Omega-3, which is known to be good for the human brain. However, Omega-3 oxidises very quickly, meaning that the fish goes rotten if not preserved or eaten fresh.</p><p>They are often grilled, barbecued or made into pâté. For generations, they have been an easily-caught species by children and adult anglers alike.</p><p>In Rick Stein’s fish cookery book, Fruits of the Sea, the TV chef wrote of mackerel: “The taste takes me right back to my childhood in Cornwall, when we used to go out feathering for mackerel around Padstow or the Scilly Isles.”</p><p>Because of the spoilage risk, the fish is most often sold smoked. Smoked mackerel is often turned into pâté, blended with crème fraîche or <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/columnists/spreading-baking-cream-cheese-philadelphia/\">cream cheese</a>.</p><p>“Smoked mackerel pâté is a fairly new delicacy that has become popular in the last four or five years,” Jane Grigson, the influential British cookery writer, wrote in her 1971 cookbook, Good Things.</p><p>Since then, it has become a modern classic and is often served as a dinner party canapé or starter.</p><p>Britons buy around 33,000 tonnes of mackerel a year. This is far lower than 200,000 tonnes brought ashore annually by the UK fleet, with much of Britain’s mackerel exported to France and Spain.</p><p>The UK also currently allows foreign vessels, such as Norwegian boats, to catch mackerel in British waters, which contributes to overfishing.</p><p>Almost all of Waitrose’s mackerel is sourced from Scotland.</p><p>While sales of fresh fish have stagnated in recent years, demand for tinned fish is rising. Brands such as Ortiz and Sea Sisters have proved popular with Gen Z and millennials thanks to their retro packaging and striking logos.</p><p><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2026/01/01/waitrose-withdraws-bottled-water-may-contain-glass/\">Waitrose said it would promote</a> smoked herring, smoked peppered herring and smoked sea bass as mackerel alternatives.</p><p>The supermarket will also introduce frozen sardines in May as a sustainable replacement for frozen mackerel.</p></div></div></div></div>",

However, shortly after Netflix said it would back out of the deal instead.</p><p>Co-chief executives Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a joint statement: “We’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.</p><p>“We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.’ iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the US. But this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.”</p><p>Netflix shares climbed 10pc higher after the announcement was made.</p><p>It marks a stunning victory for billionaire Larry Ellison and his son David, who runs Paramount. The Ellisons, close allies of Donald Trump, have been building a media empire in recent years and had seen acquiring Warner Bros as a key part of their plans.</p><p>Paramount has been seeking to derail the Netflix bid since the start of the year, making unsolicited counter offers and stressing the regulatory risks involved in the current deal. </p></div></div><div class=\"articleBodyText section\"><div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\"><p>Earlier in the week Warner Bros, the studio behind the Harry Potter franchise and recent hits including Sinners, had signalled that it was minded to endorse the latest Paramount bid.</p><p>The Los Angeles-headquartered company’s latest proposal values Warner Bros at around $112bn (£83bn) and includes a promise to pay a $2.8bn termination fee triggered by walking away from the Netflix deal.</p><p>The offer also includes a “ticking fee” of $0.25 per share for every quarter the deal doesn’t close and a $7bn termination fee if the transaction does not gain regulatory approval.</p><p>David Ellison, chairman and chief executive of Paramount, said on Thursday night: “We are pleased WBD’s Board has unanimously affirmed the superior value of our offer, which delivers to WBD shareholders superior value, certainty and speed to closing.”</p><p>Paramount said the Ellison Trust would provide $45.7bn of equity towards the deal, backstopped by Mr Ellison’s tech billionaire father Larry. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi and private equity giant Apollo have agreed to provide $57.5bn of debt.</p><p>Shares in Paramount rose just more than 5pc in after-hours trading and Warner Bros Discovery shares fell 2pc.</p><p>Last December, Netflix agreed a deal to pay $27.75 per share for the Warner Bros’s studio business along with the HBO Max streaming service, known for shows such as Succession and White Lotus. The transaction would see Warner Bros’s cable business, which includes channels such as CNN, spun off as a separate business.</p><p>By contrast, Paramount’s offer is for the whole company.</p><p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) had launched a review into <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/16/netflix-promises-cheaper-streaming-hollywood-takeover-fight/\">the Netflix takeover</a> amid concerns that combining two major streaming services – Netflix and HBO Max – would hand the company too much power.</p><p>Netflix had downplayed concerns, though acknowledged that the review could drag for a year and a half.</p><p>It had criticised the <a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2026/02/23/foreign-ownership-media-companies-netflix-boss/\">involvement of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar</a> in Paramount’s bid, highlighting free speech restrictions in the Gulf states. Paramount insists the Gulf states will not have governance rights.</p><p>Both sides have been lobbying in Washington to garner support for their bids. </p><p>Mr Ellison, the Paramount chief, attended Mr Trump’s State of the Union address as a guest of Republican Senator Lindsey Graham earlier this week. </p><p>Separately, CNBC reported Netflix chief Ted Sarandos visited the White House on Thursday to discuss the takeover with President Trump.</p></div></div></div></div>",
