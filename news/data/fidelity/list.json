By embedding payments into the platform’s intelligence engine, RevPay transforms financial activity into real-time insight that supports forecasting, reduces administrative burden, and strengthens both clinical and operational decision-making.\n\n</p><p>\nAs reimbursement pressures rise and patient expectations grow, financial visibility and operational efficiency are strategic priorities. Across healthcare, credit card fees commonly range from 2.5 to 4.5 percent per transaction. For a <money>$1 million</money> practice collecting 40 percent of revenue via card, that can mean<b> </b>anywhere <b>from <money>$10,000</money> to <money>$18,000</money> in annual processing costs</b>.\n\n</p><p>\nRevPay helps you keep more of what you earn by automating structured revenue recovery built directly into RevolutionEHR with optional patient surcharging. Additionally, practices can accept cards, ACH, digital wallets, tap-to-pay, link-to-pay, and patient portal payments directly within the platform. Transactions post automatically to patient ledgers, dashboards reflect live activity, and funding follows a predictable structure that supports operational stability.\n\n</p><p>\nFor office staff, this means fewer manual steps, faster closeout, and more time focused on patient care. For patients, it delivers flexible payment options, secure card-on-file functionality, and a seamless checkout experience that feels modern and effortless.\n\n</p><p>\nCore capabilities include:\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\nEmbedded in-office and online payment acceptance within RevolutionEHR\n\n</li>\n<li>\nAutomated ledger mapping tied directly to patient records\n\n</li>\n<li>\nUnified dashboards providing real-time visibility into transactions, fees, and deposits\n\n</li>\n<li>\nTransparent pricing and predictable funding\n\n</li>\n<li>\nAutomated revenue recovery with optional patient surcharging\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n“RevPay marks an important step in redefining how optometry practices manage revenue,” said <person>Danny Shipman</person>, Vice President of Product Strategy at PracticeTek. “By embedding payments directly into our AI-native platform, we are transforming financial activity into real-time insight and turning clarity into a daily operating advantage.

            "description": "\n<p><chron>12:17 PM EST</chron>, <chron>02/27/2026</chron> (MT Newswires) -- <org>The Toronto Stock Exchange</org> is down 163 points at midday on mixed sectors.</p><p>The  worst performers are info tech and financials, down 2.6% and 1.7%, respectively.</p><p>Telecoms, up 2.1% is the best performer, followed by utilities, and healthcare, both up 0.8%.</p><p>In economics, focus was on Canadian GDP for the fourth quarter and December, and the flash estimate for January.</p><p>Desjardins' <person>Royce Mendes</person> noted <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada's</location> economy contracted in the fourth quarter of last year, but added that the print &quot;hides a healthier set of details&quot;. The 0.6% SAAR decline in the fourth-quarter GDP was slightly below analyst expectations for a 0.2% drop. The main drag came from inventories, which subtracted more than four percentage points from the headline reading. However, outside of that very volatile category and a further decline in housing activity, the economy posted &quot;respectable&quot; numbers for the fourth quarter.</p><p>While the underlying momentum in the economy can't be characterized as consistently strong, &quot;it's not weak enough&quot; for the <org>Bank of Canada</org> to cut rates any further.</p><p>On balance, RBC said, the economy remained &quot;more resilient&quot; last year than was feared as U.S. tariffs ramped up last spring. Some sectors targeted by tariffs have been significantly negatively impacted but, controlling for ongoing slowing in population growth, per-capita GDP posted a first increase in three years in 2025. RBC adds: &quot;Most Canadian exports have remained duty free under a CUSMA exemption, the lagged impact of earlier <org>Bank of Canada</org> interest rate cuts has helped to stabilize consumer spending, and governments have stepped in to support the economy with added spending.</p><p>TD, in looking at the key implications, noted <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> ended the year on a weaker footing as businesses drew down inventories, weighing on headline growth. For 2025 as a whole, the economy slowed to 1.7%, primarily due to lower exports to <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location>. But domestic demand grew at 2.3%, supported by stronger government spending. The rebound in consumption and the return of non-residential investment in the fourth quarter provide some reassurance that underlying demand is stabilizing, TD added.</p><p>Still, TD said, today's report is weaker than the BoC's January projections for a flat reading, reinforcing their view that momentum remains limited.</p><p>BNN Bloomberg says <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada's</location> Big Six banks had a &quot;blockbuster start&quot; to the year, with all of them exceeding earnings expectations for the first quarter. Together, the banks hit about <money>$19 billion</money> in profit, up from <money>$14 billion</money> in the same period last year. BNN cited one analyst saying it is because they have done a &quot;wonderful job&quot; managing their capital. &quot;We've said for years and years that Canadian banks are the most excellent stewards of capital in the world,&quot; <person>Brian Belski</person>, CEO and chief investment officer at Humilis Investment Strategies told BNN Bloomberg. He says last year, banks were beginning to use excess reserves they built the year prior, and the benefits are now flowing through into the first fiscal quarter of 2026. Going forward, Belski says Scotiabank will &quot;set the trend&quot; for the rest of the banks, signalling a positive capital markets backdrop and strong volumes for the quarter.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

            "description": "<p><chron>Feb 27</chron> (Reuters) - OpenAI's latest funding round valued the ChatGPT maker at <money>$840 billion</money> as Big Tech and <person>Masayoshi Son's</person> SoftBank piled into the <money>$110 billion</money> blockbuster round, signaling the AI investment race is alive and well despite recent fears of a valuation bubble. </p>\n<p>The funding round - one of the largest private capital raises on record - with various strings and conditions attached that come in phases, includes a <money>$30 billion</money> investment from SoftBank, <money>$30 billion</money> from Nvidia, and <money>$50 billion</money> from <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span>. </p>\n<p>It comes ahead of the AI startup's expected mega-IPO this year to meet the ChatGPT maker's surging compute and R&amp;D costs. </p>\n<p>More investors are expected to join the round as it progresses, OpenAI said in a statement on Friday.</p>\n<p>FUNDING BOOST AMID COMPETITION</p>\n<p>With the latest injection, SoftBank's investment in OpenAI is set to be <money>$64.6 billion</money>, representing an ownership interest of about 13%, the Japanese conglomerate said. The investment will come in three phases throughout this year, with the first tranche of <money>$10 billion</money> expected to close by <chron>April 1</chron>. </p>\n<p>As a result of the investment, SoftBank will gain preferred shares that will be converted into common shares of OpenAI upon an IPO. </p>\n<p>SoftBank said the <money>$30 billion</money> is expected to be financed initially through bridge loans and capital raise from major financial institutions. The Japanese investment giant has sold stakes in its existing investments, including Nvidia, in order to fund its check into OpenAI. </p>\n<p>The infusion will help OpenAI secure advanced AI chips and the computing capacity it needs to maintain its lead position in the AI industry, especially as competition heats up from Anthropic and Alphabet's Google. </p>\n<p>It also exacerbates <location>Wall Street</location> concerns about  &quot;circular&quot; financing agreements, where firms invest in and sign supply deals with each other, inflating demand and revenue.</p>\n<p>After years of outsized gains, tech stocks have suffered sharp declines in 2026 as investors question whether AI investments will generate sufficient returns to justify lofty valuations.</p>\n<p>Nvidia was punished by shareholders this week after the chipmaker said it would pour money into the AI ecosystem, instead of returning cash to shareholders. Nvidia's investment in OpenAI gives the chip company a financial stake in one of its largest customers, tightening their already intertwined relationship.</p>\n<p>OpenAI said on Friday it would use Nvidia's latest Rubin systems, representing five gigawatts of computing capacity - enough energy to power millions of U.S. households.</p>\n<p>It was not immediately clear whether Nvidia's <money>$30 billion</money> investment replaced its earlier commitment announced in September under which Nvidia was set to invest up to <money>$100 billion</money> in the startup. </p>\n<p>OpenAI and Nvidia did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for clarification. </p>\n<p>AMAZON PARTNERSHIP </p>\n<p>The new investment is crucial for OpenAI. </p>\n<p>The launch of Google's Gemini 3 in November has given the Alphabet-owned company a stronger footing, while Anthropic has cemented its lead in the enterprise AI market with its specialized coding tool.</p>\n<p>OpenAI, which is yet to turn a profit, is targeting roughly <money>$600 billion</money> in total compute spend through 2030, a source told Reuters last week. </p>\n<p>Along with the <money>$50 billion</money> investment, OpenAI and <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> have also struck a deal in which OpenAI will utilize two gigawatts of computing capacity powered by <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon's</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> in-house Trainium AI chips.</p>\n<p>The companies are also expanding their <money>$38 billion</money> cloud deal signed last year, with OpenAI saying it would spend an additional <money>$100 billion</money> on Amazon Web Services over the next eight years. As well, OpenAI will work with <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> to develop customized models for the e-commerce company's engineering teams.</p>\n<p><org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> will start with an initial <money>$15 billion</money> investment, followed by another <money>$35 billion</money> in the coming months when certain conditions are met, the companies said. </p>\n<p>AWS will be the exclusive third-party cloud provider for OpenAI Frontier, the ChatGPT maker's enterprise platform for building and running AI agents. </p>\n<p>Microsoft, in a joint statement with OpenAI, sought to outline the limits to the work that <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> and OpenAI can undertake together without involving Azure, Microsoft's cloud unit. </p>\n<p>The partnership does not change OpenAI's relationship with Microsoft, with Microsoft Azure still the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI's APIs that provide access to OpenAI's models, the companies said. OpenAI's first-party products, including Frontier, will continue to be hosted on Azure. </p>\n<p>ChatGPT serves more than 900 million weekly active users, OpenAI said on Friday, adding that it has surpassed 50 million consumer subscribers.

He may be among the first to act as if it already has - and to say so openly.</p>\n<p>&quot;Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company. We're already seeing it internally. A significantly smaller team using the tools can do more and do it better,&quot; Block CEO and co-founder said in a statement on Thursday.</p>\n<p>&quot;I don't think we're early to this realization. I think most companies are late,&quot; he added as he laid out plans to cut over 4,000 jobs, nearly half the company's workforce, as part of an overhaul to embed AI across the fintech's operations.</p>\n<p>Block shares rose sharply on Friday, underscoring how markets are increasingly rewarding companies that present AI not as an experiment but as a driver of structural change.</p>\n<p>Dorsey also delivered a blunt warning to peers: most companies are behind the AI curve and will reach the same conclusion within a year.</p>\n<p>&quot;I'd rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively.&quot;</p>\n<p>Until now, most executives have resisted those kinds of sweeping conclusions even as their firms pour billions into the technology.</p>\n<p>The comments are likely to sharpen a growing debate among executives, economists, investors and policymakers: is AI primarily a tool that helps workers do more - or one that enables companies to do the same with far fewer people?</p>\n<p>AI JOB CUTS ACCELERATE</p>\n<p>AI-linked layoffs have been rising worldwide.</p>\n<p>According to a Reuters tally, companies have announced more than 61,000 job cuts tied to AI, including <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span>, <org value=\"PINS.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Pinterest</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='PINS' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( PINS )</span> and <location value=\"LC/au\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Australia's</location> Wisetech since November.</p>\n<p>But Block is among the highest-profile companies to cite AI explicitly as the primary driver of its reductions, rather than a secondary efficiency gain.</p>\n<p>Some investors argue that automation-related cuts are partly correcting for years of overhiring.</p>\n<p>&quot;AI is the new scapegoat,&quot; said <person>Brian Jacobsen</person>, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management, on Friday.</p>\n<p>Still, markets are increasingly uneasy about AI's potential to upend jobs and profits amid an uncertain global economic backdrop.</p>\n<p>A widely circulated report this week by <org>Citrini Research</org> outlined a 2028 scenario in which unemployment rises to 10.2%, driven by rapid displacement of workers in software, logistics and delivery roles.</p>\n<p>BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN MORE GUARDED</p>\n<p>Evidence is emerging that firms are beginning to see returns on their investment.</p>\n<p>Morgan Stanley analysts said this week there has been a steady rise in the number of companies reporting quantifiable benefits from AI adoption, based on an analysis of more than 10,000 earnings calls and fourth-quarter conference transcripts.</p>\n<p>Some 21% of S&amp;P 500 companies mentioned at least one measurable benefit, up from 15% in the third quarter and 10% in the final quarter of 2024.

            "title": "Brothers Launch True North Budgeting: Privacy-First Desktop App Offers Calm Alternative as Subscription Fatigue Grows",
            "description": "\n<p><location value=\"LU/us.az.phonix\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Phoenix, AZ</location>, <chron>Feb.  27, 2026</chron>  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- True North Budgeting, a privacy-first desktop budgeting application created by brothers <person>Ashton and Aaron Alexander</person>, is now available for individuals and households who want a clear picture of where their money goes - without cloud syncing, bank logins, subscriptions, or tracking. The offline budgeting tool launched <chron>February 14, 2026</chron>, and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux for a one-time price of <money>$49.99</money>.</p>  <p>After years of watching users struggle with overwhelming budgeting apps that demanded bank credentials, monthly fees, and constant connectivity, the Alexander brothers created something different: a budgeting tool designed to reduce anxiety instead of adding to it.</p>  <p>&quot;We kept hearing the same thing: 'I just want to see where my money goes without giving up my privacy or paying forever,'&quot; said <person>Aaron Alexander</person>, co-founder. &quot;That's why we built True North - to give people a calm, private space for their finances that they actually own.&quot;</p>  <p><b>Privacy-First by Design, Not as an Add-On</b></p>  <p>True North Budgeting runs entirely offline, storing budget data locally on the user's device. It does not collect budgeting data, does not include analytics or telemetry, and never asks users to connect bank accounts.</p>  <p>While many budgeting tools prioritize automation and engagement, True North was built around a different premise: budgeting works best when it is calm, private, and user-owned.</p>  <p>In an era where financial apps compete for attention with notifications, gamification, and engagement metrics, True North takes the opposite approach. The interface is deliberately quiet - no alerts, no daily streaks, no social comparisons. Just clear numbers and calm design.</p>  <p>&quot;Privacy-first shouldn't be a premium feature or buried in settings,&quot; said <person>Ashton Alexander</person>, co-founder. &quot;For personal finance, privacy has to be the default. Our goal is a budgeting app that behaves like a notebook - something you own - rather than an account you rent.&quot;</p>  <p><b>Subscription Fatigue Meets Privacy Concerns</b></p>  <p>As financial activity increasingly migrates to cloud platforms, concerns around data exposure continue to grow. Recent industry data shows approximately 80% of organizations experienced cloud security incidents in the past year, with breaches averaging <money>$5.17 million</money> per incident.</p>  <p>Beyond security, recurring subscription models have become standard across software categories. Many budgeting apps charge <money>$10-15</money> monthly while layering on upsells and feature tiers - costs that add up to <money>$120-180</money> annually, or nearly <money>$1,800</money> over ten years.</p>  <p>True North Budgeting's one-time <money>$49.99</money> purchase eliminates recurring fees while keeping budget files on the user's hard drive, never transmitted to external servers.</p>  <p>The timing is notable: True North's launch comes months after Intuit announced the shutdown of Mint, leaving millions of users searching for alternatives. Many former Mint users are reconsidering whether cloud-based financial tools align with their privacy values.</p>  <p><b>Complete Financial View Without Cloud Dependency</b></p>  <p>True North Budgeting includes seven core modules designed to provide complete cash flow visibility without automated bank syncing:</p>  <p><b>Dashboard: </b>Central overview showing upcoming expenses grouped by pay period and 12-month forecast.</p>  <p><b>Income Tracking: </b>Tools for take-home pay tracking across monthly, semi-monthly, and bi-weekly schedules.</p>  <p><b>Expense Management: </b>Categorization using 50/30/20 framework (Needs, Wants, Debt, Investing) with subscription tracking.</p>  <p><b>Assets &amp; Net Worth: </b>Tracking across assets and linked debts to reflect equity and overall financial position.</p>  <p><b>Financial Goals: </b>Savings goals with targets and scheduled contributions aligned to pay periods.</p>  <p><b>Budget Calendar: </b>Color-coded calendar for income, expenses, and goals with click-to-edit events. The visual approach provides clarity that spreadsheet users appreciate - showing when money arrives and leaves at a glance.</p>  <p><b>Insights &amp; Reports: </b>Views covering net worth, emergency fund progress, budget allocation, and debt strategies.</p>  <p><b>Part of a <org>Broader Local-First Movement</org></b></p>  <p>True North Budgeting joins a growing number of applications embracing &quot;local-first&quot; principles - storing user data on devices rather than in the cloud. While this approach has gained traction in productivity and note-taking software, True North brings the philosophy to personal finance.</p>  <p>The local-first approach mirrors trends in note-taking apps like Obsidian, password managers offering local vaults, and productivity tools prioritizing offline functionality - sectors where users increasingly demand data sovereignty alongside features.</p>  <p>&quot;People are asking different questions about the software they rely on,&quot; said Ashton. &quot;Not just 'What does it do?' but 'Who controls it? What does it collect?' True North is our answer for budgeting - a tool that stays with you, on your device, on your terms.&quot;</p>  <p>True North Budgeting is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux at <b>https://truenorthbudgeting.com</b></p>  <p><b>About True North Budgeting</b></p>  <p>True North Budgeting is a privacy-first budgeting tool built to help people create a calmer, more intentional relationship with money.
