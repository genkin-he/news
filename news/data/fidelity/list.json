            "description": "\n<p><location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >SAN FRANCISCO</location>, <chron>Feb.  27, 2026</chron>  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Flux, the AI-powered platform for hardware design, today announced <money>$37M</money> of new investment, including a <money>$27M</money> Series B led by 8VC, with participation from existing investors including <org>Bain Capital Ventures</org>, Liquid 2 Ventures, and <org>Outsiders Fund</org>.</p>  <p>Flux also disclosed a previously unannounced <money>$10M</money> Series A led by <org>Outsiders Fund</org> and co-led by <org>Bain Capital Ventures</org>.</p>  <p>It’s yet more fuel for the <location>Silicon Valley</location> startup leading a grassroots revolution in hardware design.</p>  <p>Flux is the world’s first AI hardware engineer, trained on hundreds of thousands of real-world designs and fine-tuned for common design tasks. With nothing more than natural language prompts, Flux’s agentic AI works with users to plan circuit-board layouts, source components, and test designs. It outputs everything a manufacturer needs to produce a finished product. It even suggests ways to minimize costs and reduce supply-chain risks.</p>  <p>And it does all this in the web browser—no desktop application required.</p>  <p>“With Flux, you can have a brilliant idea one day and hold the finished product in your hand a few weeks later,” said Flux CEO <person>Matthias Wagner</person>.</p>  <p>More than 1 million makers, designers, and entrepreneurs have used Flux to design nearly 6.5 million devices, from wearables to robots to smart home controllers and drone navigation systems.</p>  <p><person>One Flux</person> customer built an IoT device that extracts data from construction machinery, taking the entire project from concept to production without hiring an electrical engineer.</p>  <p>Another is using Flux to design and ship custom electronics throughout <location value=\"LR/afr\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Africa</location>.</p>  <p>Yet another uses Flux to build IoT-enabled organ-on-chip platforms for drug discovery and biological barrier modeling.</p>  <p>With Flux, anyone can become a builder. In the past, designers had two options: They could hire electrical engineers to design PCB boards from scratch or buy OEM components off the shelf. But many smaller businesses can’t afford to hire, and don’t want to pay for OEM parts that do more than they need.</p>  <p>Flux gives them a third option: AI that delivers bespoke PCBs at near-material costs. Flux’s custom layouts reduce the need for complex multi-board integration, resulting in faster, cheaper production and easier maintenance in the field.</p>  <p>“We wrote Flux’s first check when they were only a few founders with an audacious vision to transform hardware design,” said 8VC partner Francisco Gimenez. “Seven years later, they’re redefining who can build electronic hardware. Their market is not simply electrical engineers designing PCBs. It’s the universe of makers from individuals to businesses to whole industries. We’re privileged to renew our support.”</p>  <p>Flux plans to use the new funding to extend its AI to even more complex electronic use cases.</p>  <p>“Historically, building hardware has been insanely difficult,” said Flux CEO Wagner. “When you’re working with atoms instead of electrons, everything costs more and takes longer. Those limitations have always kept hardware in the hands of an elite few. By bringing the cost of design down to near-zero, we’re giving millions of non-experts the ability to build for niche audiences—or make something for themselves. The electronics business has always been structured around giant manufacturers. Now, for the first time, Flux puts creators at the center.”</p>  <p><strong>About Flux:</strong><br/>Flux is the AI hardware engineer—a new kind of AI agent that goes from text prompt to manufactured board in a single browser tab. Flux is leading a paradigm shift in hardware design with its end-to-end, eCAD environment, which includes integrated workflows, reusable blocks, and modern collaboration tools. Headquartered in <location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >San Francisco</location>, Flux is backed by investors including 8VC, <org>Bain Capital Ventures</org>, Liquid 2 Ventures, and <org>Outsiders Fund</org>, along with Figma board member <person>John Lilly</person> and Github founder <person>Tom Preston-Werner</person>.</p>  <p><strong>Media contact:</strong><br/>Meghana Patnana<br/><org>Firebrand Communications for Flux</org><br/>flux@firebrand.marketing<br/>415-848-9175</p>  Image: https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTY2Mjg1MiM3NDU4Nzk5IzIzMDYyMzM=  <br/> Image: https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MzNlMzgyNjMtOTUwMC00ZGI5LWE1NDUtZDhjNjM1MDZiYzU2LTEzMTc3ODMtMjAyNi0wMi0yNy1lbg==/tiny/Flux.png <p> Image: Primary Logo </p>\nSource: Flux\n",

The increase in total revenue was due primarily to performance bonuses earned during the fourth quarter of 2025, as well as higher wholesale capacity services revenue resulting from additional service fees associated with the reimbursement of network-related costs.\n\n</p><p>\nRevenue was also impacted favorably by (1) an increase in Commercial IoT related revenue due to higher average subscribers and device sales, which was offset partially by a decline in Duplex and SPOT driven revenue due to subscriber churn; and (2) revenue recognized under our service agreement with Parsons Corporation as we moved beyond the proof of concept phase during 2025, which was offset by a decrease in revenue from XCOM RAN sales.\n\n</p><p>\n<i>Loss from Operations</i>\n\n</p><p>\nLoss from operations was <money>$0.4 million</money> during the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to a loss from operations of <money>$4.2 million</money> during the prior year's fourth quarter. This improvement was due to higher revenue (as discussed above) offset partially by an increase in operating expenses (as discussed below).\n\n</p><p>\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2025, higher cost of services, marketing, general and administrative (\"MG&amp;A\") expenses and cost of subscriber equipment sales were offset partially by lower stock-based compensation expenses. Higher cost of services resulted primarily from network operating costs to support the build out of our next-generation satellite and ground network infrastructure, a significant portion of which are reimbursed to us, and this consideration is recognized as revenue. Additionally, costs increased to support the development of XCOM RAN technology and new MSS products. MG&amp;A expense was higher than the prior year's fourth quarter due primarily to legal and professional fees.\n\n</p><p>\nThe cost of subscriber equipment sales increased during the fourth quarter of 2025 due to higher hardware sales as well as <money>$1.1 million</money> in expense related to tariffs on equipment imported and re-exported to foreign subsidiaries. These tariffs were previously recorded as recoverable duty drawbacks but are no longer deemed probable of being refunded.\n\n</p><p>\n<i>Net Loss</i>\n\n</p><p>\nNet loss was <money>$11.6 million</money> for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to net loss of <money>$50.2 million</money> for the fourth quarter of 2024. This improvement was due primarily to a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the paydown of the 2023 13% Notes recorded during the fourth quarter of 2024. Favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the remeasurement of intercompany balances as well as a non-cash gain on the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment of our derivative asset gain were offset by higher interest expense resulting from our recognition of non-cash imputed interest related to the 2024 Prepayment Agreement (as defined in our periodic reports).\n\n</p><p>\n<i>Adjusted EBITDA</i>\n\n</p><p>\nAdjusted EBITDA increased to <money>$32.4 million</money> for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to <money>$30.4 million</money> for the same period in 2024. This 7% increase was due to an increase in revenue of <money>$10.8 million</money> offset partially by a <money>$8.8 million</money> increase in operating expenses (excluding adjustments for non-cash or non-recurring items).\n\n</p><p>\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.”\n\n</p><p>\n<b>ANNUAL FINANCIAL REVIEW</b>\n\n</p><p>\n<i>Revenue</i>\n\n</p><p>\nTotal revenue was <money>$273.0 million</money> during the twelve months ended <chron>December 31, 2025</chron>, including <money>$257.3 million</money> of service revenue and <money>$15.7 million</money> of revenue generated from subscriber equipment sales. Total revenue increased 9% from 2024, reaching a record high for the fourth consecutive year. This increase was due to higher service revenue and higher revenue from subscriber equipment sales.\n\n</p><p>\nService revenue increased <money>$19.6 million</money>, or 8%, during the twelve months ended <chron>December 31, 2025</chron>, compared to the same period in 2024 due to increases in wholesale capacity services. Revenue from subscriber equipment sales increased <money>$3.0 million</money>, or 24%, during the twelve months ended <chron>December 31, 2025</chron>, compared to the same period in 2024 due to a higher volume of Commercial IoT device sales.\n\n</p><p>\n<i>Income (Loss) from Operations</i>\n\n</p><p>\nIncome from operations was <money>$7.4 million</money> during 2025 compared to loss from operations of <money>$0.9 million</money> during 2024 due to higher revenue (as discussed above) offset partially by higher operating expenses (as discussed below).\n\n</p><p>\nHigher cost of services, MG&amp;A expense and cost of subscriber equipment sales were offset partially by lower stock-based compensation expenses. A non-cash loss on disposal of assets during the first quarter of 2025 also increased operating expenses. The drivers of higher cost of services, MG&amp;A expense and cost of subscriber equipment sales for the full year 2025 compared to 2024 are generally consistent with the quarterly increases noted above. Costs incurred to enhance and develop our XCOM RAN product and service offerings were also impacted by our recognition of certain non-cash amortized costs beginning in <chron>May 2024</chron>.\n\n</p><p>\nOperating expenses were partially offset by employee retention credits received in 2025 as a result of our eligibility under the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act for 2021. The total credits of <money>$3.9 million</money> reduced operating expenses during 2025, of which <money>$2.7 million</money> was allocated to cost of services and <money>$1.2 million</money> was allocated to MG&amp;A expense, based on the employee costs incurred during the eligible period.\n\n</p><p>\n<i>Net Loss</i>\n\n</p><p>\nNet loss was <money>$8.7 million</money> for 2025 compared to <money>$63.2 million</money> for 2024. This improvement was due primarily to higher revenue (discussed above), net foreign currency gains due to the remeasurement of intercompany balances and non-cash gains on the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment of our derivative asset. This improvement was also due to a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the paydown of the 2023 13% Notes recorded during the fourth quarter of 2024. These favorable items were offset partially by higher operating expenses (discussed above) as well as higher interest expense resulting from our recognition of non-cash imputed interest related to the 2024 Prepayment Agreement.\n\n</p><p>\n<i>Adjusted EBITDA</i>\n\n</p><p>\nAdjusted EBITDA was <money>$136.1 million</money> in 2025, reaching a record high for the Company and representing a margin of 50%. This increase from 2024 was due to a <money>$22.6 million</money> increase in total revenue (for reasons previously discussed), offset partially by a <money>$21.9 million</money> increase in operating expenses (excluding adjustments for non-cash or non-recurring items) primarily due to investment in growth opportunities. Specifically, while we continue to enhance and develop our XCOM RAN product and service offerings, we incur costs, primarily for personnel, in advance of significant revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.\"\n\n</p><p>\n<i>Liquidity</i>\n\n</p><p>\nAs of <chron>December 31, 2025</chron>, we held cash and cash equivalents of <money>$447.5 million</money>, compared to <money>$391.2 million</money> as of <chron>December 31, 2024</chron>.\n\n</p><p>\nDuring 2025, net cash flows generated from operations were <money>$621.7 million</money>, capital expenditures were <money>$550.4 million</money> and net cash flows used in financing activities were <money>$16.2 million</money>. Cash and cash equivalents were also positively impacted by a <money>$1.2 million</money> change in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating cash flows during 2025 included <money>$430.6 million</money> received in connection with the Infrastructure Prepayment and other cash flows generated from the business. Capital expenditures were primarily associated with our commitments under the Updated Services Agreements related to the deployment of the replacement satellites and Extended MSS Network.\n\n</p><p>\nAdjusted free cash flow during 2025 was <money>$171.5 million</money> compared to <money>$131.9 million</money> during 2024. This increase primarily includes <money>$45.0 million</money> in accelerated service payments received during 2025 as well as higher service payments received pursuant to the Updated Services Agreements, offset partially by higher operating costs (as discussed above). Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Free Cash Flow\".\n\n</p><p>\nThe principal amount of our debt was <money>$410.0 million</money> at <chron>December 31, 2025</chron>, compared to <money>$417.5 million</money> at <chron>December 31, 2024</chron>. This decrease was due to scheduled recoupments of <money>$34.6 million</money> under the 2021 Funding Agreement, offset partially by the issuance of <money>$27.1 million</money> of debt under the 2023 Funding Agreement in <chron>August 2025</chron>.\n\n</p><p>\n(Capitalized terms not defined in this release have the meanings ascribed to them in our periodic reports)\n\n</p><p>\n<b>FINANCIAL GUIDANCE</b>\n\n</p><p>\nOur financial guidance for 2026 is as follows:\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\nTotal revenue between <money>$280 million</money> and <money>$305 million</money>\n\n</li>\n<li>\nAdjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 50%\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n<b>CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its results at <chron>9:00 a.m. Eastern Time</chron> (ET) on <chron>Friday, February 27, 2026</chron>.

Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash compensation expense, reduction in the value of assets, foreign exchange (gains)/losses, and certain other non-cash or non-recurring charges as applicable. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to manage the Company's business and to compare its results more closely to the results of its peers. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measurements, such as net loss. These terms, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">\n \n\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measurement of its operating performance. The Company believes it best reflects changes across time in the Company's performance, including the effects of pricing, cost control and other operational decisions. The Company's management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of its annual operating budget. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA also is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies in similar industries. As indicated, Adjusted EBITDA does not include interest expense on borrowed money or depreciation expense on our capital assets or the payment of income taxes, which are necessary elements of the Company's operations. Because Adjusted EBITDA does not account for these expenses, its utility as a measure of the Company's operating performance has material limitations. Because of these limitations, the Company's management does not view Adjusted EBITDA in isolation and also uses other measurements, such as revenues and operating profit, to measure operating performance.\n\n</p>\n\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"bwpadl0\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" />\n<td class=\"bwpadl0\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" />\n<td class=\"bwpadl0\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"bwpadl0 bwpadr0 bwvertalignt\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"bwalignr bwcellpmargin\">\n(2)\n\n</p>\n\n</td>\n\n<td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" />\n<td class=\"bwvertalignt bwpadl0\" rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><p class=\"bwcellpmargin\">\nIn connection with the License Agreement with XCOM, the Company entered into a Support Services Agreement (the “SSA”).

USGS mapping shows the Music Valley area is underlain by Proterozoic to Palaeozoic metasedimentary rocks intruded by granitic and alkaline igneous bodies. These units are overlain locally by Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary sequences. Faulting and fracturing are widespread and control fluid movement and mineral deposition.</p><p>USGS studies describe rare earth mineralisation associated with alkaline intrusive rocks, altered volcanic units, and reworked sedimentary materials. Heavy rare earth elements occur within accessory minerals such as xenotime, monazite, and other REE phosphates.</p><img src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/f46454fa-34c2-4e5a-b3e1-cbaf7b9bb262/1142106/figure-2-fermi-claims-map.png\" style=\"width:719px;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\" /><figcaption><i>Figure 2: Music Valley Claims outline</i></figcaption><div style=\"clear: both\"> </div><p><strong>USGS Rock Chip and Sample Results</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">USGS rock chip and sediment sampling across Music Valley returned anomalous total rare earth element values with elevated proportions of heavy rare earths<sup>1</sup>.

Through this integration, Pedigree augments the system moving it into the field with mobile-first workflows that streamline communication, reduce manual processes, and improve operational visibility across multi-stop pickup and delivery operations.</p><p>Key capabilities include two-way messaging between drivers and operations teams, pickup and delivery job execution with real-time status updates flowing back into the CLI TMS, and secure mobile document capture for bills of lading, proof of delivery, and signed receipts. These workflows are designed to eliminate paper handling, accelerate billing, and improve customer responsiveness.</p><p>Unlike many technology integrations that require fleets to overhaul their existing systems, Pedigree's integration with CLI is intentionally modular and ELD-agnostic. LTL carriers can continue using their current ELD provider, or operate without an ELD dependency, while still benefiting from modern mobile workflows and real-time operational data.</p><p>\"Our goal is to help carriers modernize without disruption,\" said <person>Rocco Marrari</person>, VP of sales at Pedigree Technologies. \"This integration allows LTL fleets to improve communication, document handling, and workflow efficiency, without forcing unnecessary change or technology replacement.\"</p><p>The integration is designed specifically for terminal-based LTL operations, supporting multi-stop routes, linehaul coordination, and pickup and delivery workflows.</p><p>\"This integration between CLI and Pedigree Technologies brings together two companies with a shared focus on serving the unique operational needs of LTL carriers,\" said <person>Ben Wiesen</person>, president of Carrier Logistics. \"Through Pedigree's mobile-first workflows, CLI's solution extends out onto the road— creating stronger alignment between drivers, dispatch, and back-office operations. Providing better visibility across their operations is a practical step for both our organizations and, most importantly, for the LTL fleets that rely on us.\"</p><p>Together, Pedigree Technologies and Carrier Logistics are delivering a fully integrated solution that helps carriers reduce manual touchpoints, improve data accuracy, speed up billing, and create tighter alignment between drivers and operations teams.</p><p><b>About Pedigree Technologies</b><br />Pedigree Technologies is a U.S.-based fleet and asset technology provider delivering mobile workflows, driver communications, telematics, and optional ELD solutions designed to improve visibility, efficiency, and safety across fleet operations.</p><p><b>About <org>Carrier Logistics Inc.</org></b><br /><org>Carrier Logistics Inc.</org> (CLI), based in <location value=\"LU/us.ny.elmord\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Elmsford, N.Y.</location>, is a leader in freight management software with over 50 years of experience serving the transportation industry.

It helps developers and system integrators understand real time behavior in a Radio Access Network (RAN) implementation and reveals optimization opportunities for efficient hardware resource usage. This enables deployment of optimized solutions with faster time to market, tested in a more cost-effective way to fine tune software to sync perfectly with an open RAN mobile site's hardware.</p>\n<p>Cirrus360's Declarative Digital Twin powered Gabriel™ platform tackles these challenges via AI Reasoning. It utilizes all available facts: descriptions of 5G/6G protocol using a RAN Domain Specific Language, RDSL™, RAN functions metadata, and hardware resources, to create a digital twin. \"<i>Our Declarative Digital Twin methodology, in conjunction with AI Reasoning in Cirrus360's cloud-based Gabriel™ platform, acts as a RAN testing specific AI assistant for system integrators</i>\", said Cirrus360 co-founder/CEO <person>Chaitali Sengupta</person>.</p><p>This milestone provides a clear example of how an open collaborative ecosystem can contribute to innovation. By offering access to real-world test environments and scenarios, Vodafone will help facilitate more efficient network evolution across the telecom landscape and support AI powered innovations such as Cirrus360's Gabriel™ platform. \"<i>We are building an integration and testing framework that will expedite testing and deployment readiness of new innovations in RAN silicon and AI driven features</i>\", said Kyriakos Exadaktylos, Head of OpenRAN at Vodafone. \"What's exciting about the Declarative Digital Twin approach is how it utilizes AI Reasoning to accelerate the progression and effectiveness of in-lab testing of RAN solutions\".</p><p>Cirrus360's Declarative Digital Twin platform was developed with funding from <org>US Department of Commerce</org>, <org>National Telecommunications and Information Administration</org> (NTIA), <org>Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund</org>. This funding award is in the R&amp;D focus area that invests in the development of new/improved testing methods. These testing methods assess the interoperability, performance, and security of networks.</p><p>\"<i><org>NTIA's Innovation Fund</org> was designed to advance the deployment of open and interoperable equipment and networks, and we are eager to see how this AI-powered Vodafone and Cirrus360 partnership can more drive open RAN solutions to market quickly and effectively</i>\", said <person>Amanda Toman</person>, Director of <org>NTIA's Innovation Fund</org>.</p><p>Media Contact: <person>Sudipta Sen</person>, sudipta@cirrus3sixty.com, https://www.linkedin.com/company/cirrus360</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"PURL\"><img title=\"Cision\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" alt=\"Cision\" src=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/img/favicon.png?sn=DA97409&amp;sd=2026-02-27\" /> View original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cirrus360-and-vodafone-demonstrate-a-novel-ai-reasoning-driven-declarative-digital-twin-platform-for-ran-integration-and-testing-302699171.html</p><p>SOURCE <org>Cirrus360 Corporation</org></p></div>\n",

Prior quarters saw softer demand largely due to market uncertainty in the application of the <org>U.S. Government's</org> planned copper tariffs. Now that these tariffs have been implemented, product demand appears to be strengthening. The Division also posted gains in the quarter in operating income, Adjusted EBITDA, gross profit, and gross margin over the comparable prior-year period.</p><p>Consolidated loss in the quarter of <money>$480,000</money> narrowed YOY from a loss of <money>$1.4 million</money> in the comparative period, largely driven by higher copper alloys sales revenue and reduced costs at the company's Engineered Materials division, which was closed in 2024.</p><p>&quot;We saw strong signs of demand recovery in our second fiscal quarter almost across the board in copper alloy products, and those gains appear to be continuing into the current quarter,&quot; said <person>Mark A. Smith</person>, CEO and Executive Chairman of IBC. &quot;Additionally, we continue to explore opportunities for sales of aluminum-scandium alloys, which we successfully began producing in <chron>October 2025</chron>. We see that market growing significantly as the prospect of the first-ever domestic scandium production in the U.S. appears increasingly likely to launch in the near future.&quot;</p><p><strong>Selected Results</strong></p><p>Unless otherwise noted, all financial amounts are calculated following IFRS.<sup>1</sup></p><table><tbody><tr><td

It made for pretty grim\nreading: the loss of millions of office jobs will destroy\ndemand, plunging the economy into a deflationary tailspin.\nIs that possible? Sure, in the sense that anything is possible.\nBut when markets are being spooked by apocalyptic long-form\nblogposts, it's time to ask if we are in the midst of an AI doom\nbubble.\nThe software sector got a slight boost on Tuesday when a new\nround of plug-ins from Anthropic highlighted the potential for\nAI upstarts to partner with legacy firms instead of replacing\nthem.\nBut, as is often the case, fear trumps hope, and both the S&amp;P\n500 and the Nasdaq fell on Thursday.\nThis was - perhaps surprisingly - after the announcement of\nanother strong quarter from Nvidia - its 14th consecutive\nrevenue beat. The <money>$4.5 trillion</money> chipmaker on Wednesday posted\nbetter-than-expected results for the January quarter and also\nforecast above-market estimates for current quarter revenue. Its\nshare price initially rose, but then pulled back, likely because\nthe good news was already baked in and concerns - such as rising\ncompetition and customer concentration - remain.\nMeanwhile, two months into the year, the country with the best\nperforming equity market by far is Korea. The benchmark KOSPI\nindex may have slid slightly on Friday, but it's up more than\n48% in the year to date. This eye-popping figure might suggest\nfevered speculation is at play, but that's not necessarily the\ncase - and there is reason to believe it could still have room\nto run.\nMoving over to M&amp;A, the months-long battle between Paramount\nSkydance and Netflix to acquire Warner Bros Discovery appears to\nbe over, with the former coming out on top with its revised\n<money>$31</money>-a-share offer.</p>\n<p>Turning back to anxiety, another major source of it this\nweek was the ongoing standoff between <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location> and <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location>\nover <location value=\"LU/ir..tehran\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Tehran's</location> nuclear program. The two held indirect talks in\n<location value=\"LU/ch..geneva\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Geneva</location> on Thursday.\nWhile crude prices fell following claims that progress in the\nnegotiations had been made, Brent crude was up again early on\nFriday, trading above <money>$71</money> a barrel. Discussions will resume in\n<location value=\"LU/at..vienna\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Vienna</location> next week, which means the waiting game continues.\nOne party that may benefit from the geopolitical noise is OPEC+.\nThe volatile headlines have weighed on prices, giving the\nproducer group cover to stick to its \"balanced market\"\nnarrative, despite many facts on the ground that suggest\notherwise. OPEC+ is expected to announce a 137,000 barrel per\nday increase in output when it meets on Sunday.\nSpeaking of energy, one would have needed a lot of it to stay up\nthough all of President <person>Donald Trump's</person> State of the Union\naddress on Tuesday, which clocked in at a record one hour and 47\nminutes. It offered little in the way of new ideas for\naddressing Americans' affordability concerns, with the exception\nof a plan to boost Americans' retirement savings. The president\nalso vowed to move forward with his tariff agenda even after a\nlarge portion of it was quashed by the <org>Supreme Court</org> last week.\nOne notable takeaway from the speech was the president's claim\nthat hyperscalers &quot;have the obligation to provide for their own\npower needs&quot; as they build out energy-hungry data centers to\nfuel the AI boom. The administration wants to avoid stressing\nthe grid and pushing up consumers' electricity prices.\nBut the pressure is already building, and whether or not\ncompanies cover their own power needs, ambitious AI expansion\nplans are likely to be hobbled by severe power-infrastructure\nbottlenecks.</p>\n<p>It's a reminder that instead of fretting about viral AI\ndoomsday reports, we should probably spend a little more time\nconsidering the very real physical limitations that could slow\ndown this technological revolution.\nFor more commodities and markets news, check out Reuters Open\nInterest.

Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, Roman DBDR and ThomasLloyd will become wholly-owned subsidiaries of a new holding company, which is to be incorporated under the laws of <location value=\"LS/gb.eng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >England</location> and <location value=\"LS/gb.wal\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Wales</location> and to be listed on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol \"TCSG\". The new holding company will be formed to facilitate the agreed-upon transaction structure.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>ThomasLloyd Overview</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThomasLloyd, which has its origins dating back to 2003, has evolved into a vertically integrated provider of sustainable energy, decarbonization and climate finance solutions to public and private sector customers globally. The Company integrates development, investment, operations, and technology into a single independent platform, positioning itself as a comprehensive partner in climate infrastructure development and decarbonization worldwide. Its activities span multiple sectors, including renewable power generation, sustainable fuels, water and waste infrastructure, energy efficiency, transmission and distribution systems, and climate finance solutions supporting public and private sector energy goals. Today, ThomasLloyd serves a diverse customer base including governments, multinational corporations, institutions and individuals in more than 50 countries.\n\n</p><p>\nAs an industry pioneer, ThomasLloyd has built deep financial, technical, social and operational expertise, driving sustainable infrastructure projects, systems and applications from origination through long-term operations. Its specialists have been responsible for the realization and operation of approximately 28 gigawatts (GW) of conventional and renewable power generation capacity, related transmission and distribution infrastructure, sustainable fuels production, water and waste treatment systems and energy efficiency solutions across various areas including mobility and built environment. This track record demonstrates the Company’s ability to execute complex solutions in markets facing accelerating energy and sustainability demands.\n\n</p><p>\nThomasLloyd’s integrated model, aligning financial structuring with development and operational execution, enables the Company to own full client relationships and deliver end-to-end solutions. This allows the Company to broaden customer engagements, improve project economics, and capture long-term value through operational performance. Its climate finance platform includes tailored capital solutions, impact investing products, and carbon procurement strategies designed to accelerate climate mitigation and adaptation at scale.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Management Commentary</b>\n\n</p><p>\n\"We're witnessing a fundamental transformation in how the world thinks about energy infrastructure and resources – what started as climate concerns has evolved into an urgent economic and national security imperative, particularly as AI and data centers reshape energy demand patterns,” said <person>Michael Sieg</person>, Founder and CEO of ThomasLloyd. “Our independent, vertically integrated platform, combining deep technical expertise with financial innovation and operational excellence, allows us to solve complex energy and decarbonization challenges that traditional players simply can't address at scale and with appropriate speed. The business combination with Roman DBDR would serve a dual purpose beyond raising capital – it accelerates our North American expansion and we believe establishes ThomasLloyd as the partner of choice for enterprises and governments seeking reliable, sustainable energy and technology solutions that can be delivered with exceptional speed and scale.”\n\n</p><p>\nVivienne Macalchlan, CFO of ThomasLloyd, says “Our strategic partnership with Roman DBDR and listing on Nasdaq would represent a pivotal step in ThomasLloyd’s journey, providing us with a robust platform from which we can take advantage of significant global market opportunities. Our successes, evolution and learnings over the last few years have allowed us to develop a well thought-through customer centric energy and decarbonization offering. With Roman DBDR as our partner, our team has a unique opportunity to drive, grow and optimize market share, revenue and margin in a more pronounced manner than before.”\n\n</p><p>\n“ThomasLloyd embodies the rare combination of visionary leadership, operational depth, and market timing that defines transformational investment opportunities,” said <person>Dixon Doll, Jr.</person>, Chairman and CEO of Roman DBDR. “Michael and his team have built something truly unique: a platform that doesn't just participate in the energy transition but actually drives it through innovative solutions and superior execution. ThomasLloyd’s ability to navigate complex, multi-jurisdictional projects while maintaining strong stakeholder relationships demonstrates the kind of institutional-quality management we believe public markets will reward.”\n\n</p><p>\n“This partnership embodies our conviction that the companies solving humanity’s most pressing infrastructure challenges will generate exceptional long-term value for shareholders,” added Dr. <person>Donald Basile</person>, Co-Founder of Roman DBDR. “ThomasLloyd’s unique positioning as an independent ‘one stop shop’ for best-in-class sustainable infrastructure development, financing and operations puts it in the driver’s seat as the global economy’s demands for smart energy resources and applications continue to grow at a rapid pace. We are excited to support ThomasLloyd’s vision for sustainable energy abundance.”\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Growth &amp; Market Overview</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThomasLloyd has achieved first-mover advantage in the global energy transition infrastructure sector, which a leading management consultancy quantifies as a <money>US$275 trillion</money> market opportunity – equivalent to 7.5% of global GDP annually between 2021 and 2050. Three irreversible structural drivers are converging in the Company's core North American and <location value=\"LR/asp\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Asia-Pacific</location> markets simultaneously: unprecedented energy demand growth from economic growth and population expansion, urbanization, and AI/data center development, energy transition for decarbonization, and national energy sovereignty and security imperatives driving demand for domestically deployable solutions. The Company's independent, decentralized sustainable energy solutions deliver superior economics with significantly lower capex and significantly faster deployment compared to traditional grid-based fossil fuel systems.\n\n</p><p>\nThis market position is supported by a fast-growing, robust commercial pipeline of potential investments across more than 40 projects in 10 countries. The pipeline comprises predominantly organic follow-on investments along with selected acquisitions in high-margin segments, focusing on synergistic, recurring offerings across renewable energy and hybrid solutions, biofuels, AI data centers, industrial decarbonization including heating and cooling, water scarcity solutions, and resource management. This approach serves to rationalize the fragmented, capital-constrained sustainable energy infrastructure sector to create massive opportunity for ThomasLloyd's scaled, vertically integrated platform to capture meaningful market share with strong revenue visibility and immediate execution capability.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Transaction Overview</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThe Proposed Business Combination, which has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Roman DBDR and ThomasLloyd, is expected to provide in excess of <money>US$240 million</money> in gross proceeds, from a combination of funds from cash held in Roman DBDR’s trust account and an anticipated PIPE raise, before accounting for potential redemptions and transaction expenses. The Proposed Business Combination does not have a minimum cash closing condition and is expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by Roman DBDR shareholders and other regulatory approvals.\n\n</p><p>\nIn addition, the Company has signed a binding term sheet with <org>B. Riley Principal Capital II, LLC</org> for a <money>US$200 million</money> equity line of credit to further support its growth strategy.\n\n</p><p>\nThe Proposed Business Combination values ThomasLloyd at a pre-money equity value of <money>US$850 million</money>, whereby the transaction value could increase up to <money>US$1.3 billion</money> via a <money>US$450 million</money> share price-based earnout, aligning management incentives for continued Company growth and reinforcing existing shareholders’ commitment to the Company.

            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >NEW YORK</location>, <chron>Feb 27</chron> (Reuters) - On paper, American consumers spent last year tightening their belts, and even retail heavyweights stumbled. But sit-down restaurants and some drive-through chains buzzed with patrons seeking a special treat or cheap comfort food.</p>\n<p>Their upbeat sales made the U.S. restaurant industry a rare bright spot for jobs, with restaurant payrolls ticking up 1% last year, adding about 108,000 jobs, according to the <org>Bureau of Labor Statistics</org>. </p>\n<p>In contrast, the overall U.S. economy added 181,000 non-farm jobs in 2025, marking the weakest annual payroll growth in 20 years outside a recession year.</p>\n<p>Success among restaurants was not evenly spread, though.</p>\n<p>Corporate filings show that eateries such as Brinker's Chili's, Yum Brands' <org>Taco Bell</org> and fast-growing coffee chain Dutch Bros lured customers by aggressively marketing bundled deals, leaning into digital innovation and limited-time offers, and focusing on high-margin, Instagrammable food. </p>\n<p>But previous darlings like Chipotle and Cava were hurt by what analysts call the &quot;slop-bowl fatigue&quot; -  growing weariness among younger consumers with high-priced, customizable grain or salad bowls. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LU/us.az.tempe\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Tempe, Arizona</location>-based Dutch Bros and its franchisees added roughly 8,000 employees in the last two years, a 33% increase, the company said. </p>\n<p>&quot;We have a healthy pipeline of growth,&quot; CEO <person>Christine Barone</person> told Reuters after the company's earnings in February. The brand, which serves customizable beverages, is a hit with younger consumers, Barone said.  </p>\n<p>A similar story is playing out at another chain that, like Dutch Bros, sells more treats than meals.</p>\n<p>Ice cream chain Whit's Frozen Custard has grown its payroll by up to 40% a year for the past two years, said owner <person>Bill Aseere</person>, to keep up with rapid growth. It now has stores in 93 locations across 10 states and some 15 to 20 employees per store. </p>\n<p>Amanda Wang, co-founder of fast-growing Chinese beverage chain Ningji Lemon Tea - part of a tidal wave of Chinese tea brands coming to the U.S. - said her chain's new restaurants in the U.S. were buoyed by demand among price-weary consumers for affordable indulgences. </p>\n<p>Tea &quot;offers that little bit of happiness,&quot; she said.</p>\n<p>As a whole, the restaurant industry grew payrolls even as it weathers depressed traffic and rising labor costs, analysts say, thanks in part to menu price increases. Menu prices at restaurants grew 4.1% in 2025 compared to grocery inflation of 2.3%, according to the <org>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</org>. </p>\n<p>DIVERGING FORTUNES</p>\n<p>A deeper look at 2025 payroll data shows the difference in fortunes between types of restaurants: staff headcount at snack and non-alcoholic beverage restaurants grew 3.6% in 2025 and those at sit-down restaurants rose 1%. But fast-food payrolls grew only 0.4%, while cafeterias and buffet payrolls shrank 3.9%. </p>\n<p>&quot;At the end of the day, people want go out to eat and celebrate those big occasions,&quot; said <person>Chad Moutray</person>, an economist at the <org>National Restaurant Association</org>, referring to resilient spending at sit-down restaurants. </p>\n<p>&quot;Consumers might be pulling back from vacations, but they still prioritize eating out.&quot;</p>\n<p>The payroll data and Moutray's comments underscore what the industry calls the &quot;lipstick effect&quot; - consumers tightened their budgets, canceling expensive trips and postponing big-ticket purchases, but treated themselves to an indulgent meal, coffee or dessert.</p>\n<p>Brinker's reported 23% growth in its hourly restaurant staff between fiscal years 2024 and 2025, according to <org>SEC</org> filings, though it indicated that a growing share of its employees were part-time. </p>\n<p>Darden, the parent company of sit-down restaurants like Olive Garden and <org>LongHorn Steakhouse</org>, increased staff for fiscal 2025 by about 3.8%.</p>\n<p>Most national restaurant chains are franchised and do not report total employment figures among franchisees, but Chipotle and Starbucks, which operate the majority of their own stores, reported slight declines in total headcount for fiscal year 2025. </p>\n<p>While cascades of tariff announcements have forced other industries to raise prices and reroute sourcing, restaurant owners have only faced the tariffs impacting narrow categories like cup packaging and Chinese Sichuan peppers. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Waylon Cunningham</person>; Editing by <person>Sayantani Ghosh</person> and <person>Nick Zieminski</person>)</p>\n",

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We lift our target price by <money>CAD1</money> to <money>CAD66</money>, about 25x our unchanged 2026 EPS of <money>CAD2.62</money> (2027 EPS initiated at <money>CAD2.85</money>). This is a premium to the five-year mean of 18x, which we think is warranted given the company's strong pipeline for store expansion. Q4 results were a bit underwhelming, particularly the 1.5% same-store sales growth, a notable deceleration from previous quarters. However, L did manage to alleviate some fears, noting a tough Y/Y comp (last year benefited from more promo activity) and an acceleration in growth through Q4 and into Q1. However, there is some weakness in certain categories like liquor and tobacco, which is weighing on overall growth. L guides for high-single-digit EPS growth, which we think could be a bit conservative given the somewhat consistent double-digit EPS growth over the past several years. L continues to open new stores (another year of about 70+), with a focus on discount banners as Canadians increasingly flock towards more value-oriented stores. We keep our Hold view.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice. Unauthorized reproduction is strictly prohibited.</p>\n",

            "description": "\n<p><chron>03:35 AM EST</chron>, <chron>02/27/2026</chron> (MT Newswires) -- CFRA, an independent research provider, has provided MT Newswires with the following research alert. Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We raise our 12-month target to <money>$134</money> from <money>$127</money>, based on ~13x our FY 27 (Apr.) EPS estimate of <money>$10.31</money>. While we lower our FY 27 EPS from <money>$10.61</money>, our forecast remains above consensus' <money>$9.85</money>, and we trim FY 26 EPS modestly to <money>$8.87</money> from <money>$8.91</money>. The applied multiple sits modestly below SJM's 14x long-term average. We view SJM's Jan.-Q results as solid overall, though we remain disappointed by the continued challenges related to the Hostess acquisition. That said, we expect margins in the Hostess business to improve in FY 27 following recent restructuring actions. We are also constructive on margin expansion in coffee next year, supported by lower commodity costs and the recent removal of coffee tariffs. Core brands such as Uncrustables, <org>Cafe Bustelo</org>, Meow Mix, and Milk-Bone continue to perform well. Oversight from Elliott Management could help unlock incremental shareholder value. Overall, we see a reasonable path to $10+ EPS in FY 27, as we model approximately 16% growth to <money>$10.31</money> vs. <money>$9.85</money> consensus.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.
