The prototype will be demonstrated at <org>Mobile World Congress</org> 2026 and shows how AI‑enabled, RAN-assisted intelligence can improve uplink performance in real time while remaining effective over time through practical model retraining and over‑the‑air (OTA) updates, helping operators and ecosystem partners accelerate the transition to networks.\n\n</p><p>\nAs networks evolve, maintaining consistent uplink performance becomes increasingly challenging. Coverage conditions vary widely across urban, rural, indoor, and hard-to-reach locations. Traditional transmitter diversity techniques are often static, which can limit performance as conditions change. At the same time, AI models trained in one environment may not perform the same across all deployment scenarios and updating those models in live networks can be operationally complex. Operators need an approach that is accurate, site‑aware, and easy to maintain.\n\n</p><p>\n<org value=\"KEYS.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Keysight</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='KEYS' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( KEYS )</span> and MediaTek address this need by combining RAN‑assisted AI decision‑making, site‑specific model retraining, and over-the-air (OTA) model updates in a controlled test environment that mimics real-world network conditions. The prototype leverages Keysight’s Channel Studio RaySim and its Network and Channel Emulation solutions to create realistic, repeatable validation scenarios. This enables measurable gains in uplink throughput, spectral efficiency, and reliability while reducing the operational effort required to support diverse deployment environments. The work aligns with the objectives of the AI‑RAN Alliance, supporting scalable deployment and continuous optimization of AI in the RAN.\n\n</p><p>\n<b><person>Mingxi Fan</person>, Senior General Manager of <org>Wireless Technology Group</org>, MediaTek, said:</b> “We’re looking forward to highlighting how instrumental uplink performance enhancement will be in scaling future mobile networks so they can support AI-era applications more efficiently. Transmit diversity is a promising technique to be implemented at the device level so it can work across a wide variety of network environments, and our collaboration with <org value=\"KEYS.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Keysight</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='KEYS' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( KEYS )</span> demonstrates that through open infrastructure and device cooperation, our technology will facilitate practical, scalable AI-native RAN deployments.”\n\n</p><p>\n<b><person>Peng Cao</person>, Vice President and General Manager, <org>Wireless Test Group</org>, <org value=\"KEYS.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Keysight</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='KEYS' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( KEYS )</span>, said:</b> “Together with MediaTek, we have demonstrated a novel AI-enabling-AI technique which helps address the increasing demand on mobile networks’ uplink performance, capacity, and consistent end user experiences driven by AI and AR applications.

For a second successive day, Info Tech led decliners , down 2.5%, while Financials was down near 2%. Telecom led gainers, up 1.65%, with Energy, up 1.15% and the Battery Metals Index, up 1.1%, next.</p><p><org>BMO Capital Markets</org> Chief Economist <person>Douglas Porter</person> in his regular Friday 'Talking Points' note noted even as the Canadian economy remains &quot;challenged by relentless trade uncertainty&quot;, the TSX continues to &quot;find its own path&quot;. Prior to Friday's stumble, the index managed to rise more than 1% this week to hit an record high above 34,500 and was up 8% in the first two months of the year. Porter noted a rebound in gold and firmer oil prices assisted, but Q1 bank earnings were also &quot;greeted favourably&quot;. He also noted economy-wide profits rose more than 6% in 2025, topping nominal GDP growth of 4.3% on the year. More broadly, <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> may be benefitting from a diversification push away from U.S. markets, where valuations are rich, Porter said.</p><p>Porter cited as just as one small sample of the shift into <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> in the past year a &quot;welcome&quot; swing in foreign direct investment into a rare surplus. For Q4 alone, quarterly net FDI inflows were <money>$11.6 billion</money>, driven by M&amp;A activity. Looking at the four-quarter trend reveals that for the first time in more than a decade, and only the second time in the past 18 years, <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> had a net inflow in FDI in 2025 of <money>$17.3 billion</money>, Porter noted. For perspective, Porter said that alone would have funded more than half of the current account deficit of <money>$30.4 billion</money> last year. He noted there are three major types of FDI: M&amp;A, greenfield investments, and reinvested earnings. In 2025, the latter remained in a large outflow position of <money>$47 billion</money> &quot;and is normally in a deficit because of <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada's</location> large stock of outstanding investments abroad&quot; while M&amp;A was in a large offsetting surplus. Net new FDI investments were, thus,  in a surplus of <money>$17.6 billion</money> for the year, &quot;which is encouraging news for an economy looking for new growth avenues&quot;, Porter added.</p><p>Of commodities, gold rose to the highest in a month Friday following a report U.S. wholesale inflation rose above expectations in January. Gold for April delivery was last seen up <money>US$86.50</money> to to <money>US$5,280.70</money> per ounce, the highest since the record close of <money>US$5,354.80</money> on <chron>Jan. 29</chron>.</p><p>Also, West Texas Intermediate crude oil rose to a six-month high as a third round of talks between the U.S. and <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location> ended with an agreement to meet again next week amid reports <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location> is balking at U.S. demands it abandon its uranium enrichment program, raising worries President Trump will decide to strike at the OPEC+ member.

The investment will come in three phases throughout this year, with the first tranche of <money>$10 billion</money> expected to close by <chron>April 1</chron>. </p>\n<p>As a result of the investment, SoftBank will gain preferred shares that will be converted into common shares of OpenAI upon an IPO. </p>\n<p>SoftBank said the <money>$30 billion</money> is expected to be financed initially through bridge loans and capital raise from major financial institutions. The Japanese investment giant has sold stakes in its existing investments, including Nvidia, in order to fund its check into OpenAI. </p>\n<p>The infusion will help OpenAI secure advanced AI chips and the computing capacity it needs to maintain its lead position in the AI industry, especially as competition heats up from Anthropic and Alphabet's Google. </p>\n<p>It also exacerbates <location>Wall Street</location> concerns about  &quot;circular&quot; financing agreements, where firms invest in and sign supply deals with each other, inflating demand and revenue.</p>\n<p>After years of outsized gains, tech stocks have suffered sharp declines in 2026 as investors question whether AI investments will generate sufficient returns to justify lofty valuations.</p>\n<p>Nvidia was punished by shareholders this week after the chipmaker said it would pour money into the AI ecosystem, instead of returning cash to shareholders. Nvidia's investment in OpenAI gives the chip company a financial stake in one of its largest customers, tightening their already intertwined relationship.</p>\n<p>OpenAI said on Friday it would use Nvidia's latest Rubin systems, representing five gigawatts of computing capacity - enough energy to power millions of U.S. households.</p>\n<p>It was not immediately clear whether Nvidia's <money>$30 billion</money> investment replaced its earlier commitment announced in September under which Nvidia was set to invest up to <money>$100 billion</money> in the startup. </p>\n<p>OpenAI and Nvidia did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for clarification. </p>\n<p>AMAZON PARTNERSHIP </p>\n<p>The new investment is crucial for OpenAI. </p>\n<p>The launch of Google's Gemini 3 in November has given the Alphabet-owned company a stronger footing, while Anthropic has cemented its lead in the enterprise AI market with its specialized coding tool.</p>\n<p>OpenAI, which is yet to turn a profit, is targeting roughly <money>$600 billion</money> in total compute spend through 2030, a source told Reuters last week. </p>\n<p>Along with the <money>$50 billion</money> investment, OpenAI and <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> have also struck a deal in which OpenAI will utilize two gigawatts of computing capacity powered by <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon's</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> in-house Trainium AI chips.</p>\n<p>The companies are also expanding their <money>$38 billion</money> cloud deal signed last year, with OpenAI saying it would spend an additional <money>$100 billion</money> on Amazon Web Services over the next eight years. As well, OpenAI will work with <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> to develop customized models for the e-commerce company's engineering teams.</p>\n<p><org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> will start with an initial <money>$15 billion</money> investment, followed by another <money>$35 billion</money> in the coming months when certain conditions are met, the companies said. </p>\n<p>AWS will be the exclusive third-party cloud provider for OpenAI Frontier, the ChatGPT maker's enterprise platform for building and running AI agents. </p>\n<p>Microsoft, in a joint statement with OpenAI, sought to outline the limits to the work that <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> and OpenAI can undertake together without involving Azure, Microsoft's cloud unit. </p>\n<p>The partnership does not change OpenAI's relationship with Microsoft, with Microsoft Azure still the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI's APIs that provide access to OpenAI's models, the companies said. OpenAI's first-party products, including Frontier, will continue to be hosted on Azure. </p>\n<p>ChatGPT serves more than 900 million weekly active users, OpenAI said on Friday, adding that it has surpassed 50 million consumer subscribers. January and February are on track to become the largest months for new subscriber additions, it said.</p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Deborah Sophia</person> and <person>Akash Sriram</person> in Bengaluru, <person>Krystal Hu</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >San Francisco</location>; Additional reporting by <person>Stephen Nellis</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >San Francisco</location>; Editing by Arun Koyyur, <person>Chizu Nomiyama</person>, <person>Nick Zieminski</person>, <person>Sayantani Ghosh</person>, <person>Rod Nickel</person>)</p>\n",

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We trim our 12-month target price by <money>$1</money> to <money>$9</money>, applying an EV/revenue multiple of 1.0x to our 2026 estimate, comparable to its three-year historical average multiple of 1.1x. We raise our 2026 EPS estimate by <money>$0.05</money> to <money>$0.48</money> and set 2027's at <money>$0.73</money>. The legislative environment for Huawei replacement in the EU is currently non-compulsory, meaning the transition away from Huawei will take years and may slow market activity until more stringent requirements are enacted. In addition, tightening supply conditions in key components such as memory and optics were highlighted, which could impact costs and supply chain dynamics. Finally, in some European markets, broadband deployment cycles are still at early stages, meaning revenue realization from these projects may be delayed, and some carriers have not started deployments yet.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

Data showed annual inflation cooled to 4.1%, from 4.5% in January, but was above the 3.8% expected by analysts.\n    However, the print is not expected to prevent the country's central bank from kicking off a monetary policy easing cycle in March, as indicated by policymakers recently.\n    This would be the central bank's first interest rate cut since 2024 if the expectations come true, bringing the Selic rate down from a near two-decade high of 15%.\n    &quot;Although this reading doesn't show a worsening in inflation year-on-year, it certainly shows that stickiness may be higher in services and core measures, in line with our scenario,&quot; said Citigroup analysts led by <person>Ernesto Revilla</person>.\n    &quot;This data strengthens our more hawkish monetary policy call of a 25-basis-point cut in the March meeting.&quot;\n\n    EQUITIES DIP SLIGHTLY\n    Most equities in the region were lower on the day as global risk appetite faltered.\n    <location value=\"LU/br..saopau\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Sao Paulo</location> stocks fell 1.2%, with some financial firms including Itau Unibanco falling 2%, tracking declines in global financial stocks.\n    Mexican stocks were the only outliers, up 0.4%.\n    AI chipmaker Nvidia's results on Wednesday failed to provide the boost some investors had bet on, with doubts on the AI-fueled rally and stretched tech valuations taking center stage.\nColombian equities sank 0.8%, setting them up for their worst week since <chron>March 2023</chron>. The index has shed nearly 7% over the last three sessions as trade tensions with <location value=\"LC/ec\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Ecuador</location> intensify.\n    Elsewhere, Chilean stocks slipped 1.6% and were set to break a half-year monthly winning streak, while the peso fell 0.7%. The local unemployment rate rose to 8.3% in the quarter through January.\n    February has been a data-heavy month across the region. Data showed convincing signs that <location value=\"LC/br\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Brazil's</location> economy is cooling, while <location value=\"LC/mx\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Mexico</location>, <location value=\"LC/co\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Colombia</location> and <location value=\"LC/ar\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Argentina</location> are gaining momentum. That divergence is starting to show up in policy paths, offering different carry-trade benefits.\nMeanwhile, <location value=\"LC/ar\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Argentina's</location> stock index slumped 4%, set for its biggest monthly fall in two years.

            "description": "\n<p>    <location value=\"LU/us.ca.sandgo\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >SAN DIEGO</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nRevolutionEHR, the market-leading optometry-first operating platform, today announced the launch of RevPay, its fully embedded payments solution designed to help practices get paid effortlessly while recovering more of the revenue they earn.\n\n</p><p>\nRevPay connects payments directly to RevolutionEHR’s AI-native platform, integrating checkout, patient records, engagement, and reporting into one intelligent workflow. By embedding payments into the platform’s intelligence engine, RevPay transforms financial activity into real-time insight that supports forecasting, reduces administrative burden, and strengthens both clinical and operational decision-making.\n\n</p><p>\nAs reimbursement pressures rise and patient expectations grow, financial visibility and operational efficiency are strategic priorities. Across healthcare, credit card fees commonly range from 2.5 to 4.5 percent per transaction. For a <money>$1 million</money> practice collecting 40 percent of revenue via card, that can mean<b> </b>anywhere <b>from <money>$10,000</money> to <money>$18,000</money> in annual processing costs</b>.\n\n</p><p>\nRevPay helps you keep more of what you earn by automating structured revenue recovery built directly into RevolutionEHR with optional patient surcharging.
