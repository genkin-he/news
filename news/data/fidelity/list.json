These people research company financial statements, sit in conference calls and meetings, and speak with relevant insiders to determine what are known as analyst ratings for stocks. Typically, analysts will rate each stock once a quarter. </p>\n<p>Some analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings. When using analyst ratings, it is important to keep in mind that stock and sector analysts are also human and are only offering their opinions to investors.</p>\n<p>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</p>\n",

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We cut our 12-month target by <money>$3</money> to <money>$16</money>, valuing HP at 5.5x our CY 2027 EPS view of <money>$2.99</money>, below peers due to anemic growth. We cut our FY 26 (Oct.) EPS view to <money>$2.91</money> (<money>$3.09</money>) and FY 27's to <money>$2.98</money> (<money>$3.28</money>). Our reduced estimates reflect escalating memory costs, up roughly 100% Q/Q, about 35% of PC BOM, which we believe will compress PS margins into the low to mid-5% area for the balance of FY 26. While Q1 beat expectations (non-GAAP EPS <money>$0.81</money> vs. consensus' <money>$0.77</money>, revenue <money>$14.4B</money> vs. <money>$14.1B</money>), we think upside was partly led by consumer demand pull-in, which is unlikely to repeat. Management maintained its <money>$2.90</money> to <money>$3.20</money> non-GAAP EPS guide but steered toward the low end, and we see risk as skewed to the downside as mitigation levers (supplier qualification, configuration changes, pricing) lag cost inflation. Print remains challenged at negative 2% Y/Y with units down 6%. We maintain Sell as we see limited catalysts to offset margin pressure, an interim CEO transition, and a double-digit PC unit TAM decline in CY 26.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

It's something that shows up where decisions are made.</p><p><strong>Built for Scale, Security and Simplicity</strong></p><p>The HighLevel app in ChatGPT is designed to be easy to activate while maintaining enterprise-grade security.

HighLevel's presence as an app in ChatGPT reflects that direction, building toward an AI-first operating model grounded in relevance, transparency and real-world use.</p><p><strong>Built for Scale, Security and Simplicity</strong></p><p>The HighLevel app in ChatGPT is designed to be easy to activate while maintaining enterprise-grade security.

            "description": "\n<p><chron>12:17 PM EST</chron>, <chron>02/27/2026</chron> (MT Newswires) -- <org>The Toronto Stock Exchange</org> is down 163 points at midday on mixed sectors.</p><p>The  worst performers are info tech and financials, down 2.6% and 1.7%, respectively.</p><p>Telecoms, up 2.1% is the best performer, followed by utilities, and healthcare, both up 0.8%.</p><p>In economics, focus was on Canadian GDP for the fourth quarter and December, and the flash estimate for January.</p><p>Desjardins' <person>Royce Mendes</person> noted <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada's</location> economy contracted in the fourth quarter of last year, but added that the print &quot;hides a healthier set of details&quot;. The 0.6% SAAR decline in the fourth-quarter GDP was slightly below analyst expectations for a 0.2% drop. The main drag came from inventories, which subtracted more than four percentage points from the headline reading. However, outside of that very volatile category and a further decline in housing activity, the economy posted &quot;respectable&quot; numbers for the fourth quarter.</p><p>While the underlying momentum in the economy can't be characterized as consistently strong, &quot;it's not weak enough&quot; for the <org>Bank of Canada</org> to cut rates any further.</p><p>On balance, RBC said, the economy remained &quot;more resilient&quot; last year than was feared as U.S. tariffs ramped up last spring. Some sectors targeted by tariffs have been significantly negatively impacted but, controlling for ongoing slowing in population growth, per-capita GDP posted a first increase in three years in 2025. RBC adds: &quot;Most Canadian exports have remained duty free under a CUSMA exemption, the lagged impact of earlier <org>Bank of Canada</org> interest rate cuts has helped to stabilize consumer spending, and governments have stepped in to support the economy with added spending.</p><p>TD, in looking at the key implications, noted <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> ended the year on a weaker footing as businesses drew down inventories, weighing on headline growth. For 2025 as a whole, the economy slowed to 1.7%, primarily due to lower exports to <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location>. But domestic demand grew at 2.3%, supported by stronger government spending. The rebound in consumption and the return of non-residential investment in the fourth quarter provide some reassurance that underlying demand is stabilizing, TD added.</p><p>Still, TD said, today's report is weaker than the BoC's January projections for a flat reading, reinforcing their view that momentum remains limited.</p><p>BNN Bloomberg says <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada's</location> Big Six banks had a &quot;blockbuster start&quot; to the year, with all of them exceeding earnings expectations for the first quarter. Together, the banks hit about <money>$19 billion</money> in profit, up from <money>$14 billion</money> in the same period last year. BNN cited one analyst saying it is because they have done a &quot;wonderful job&quot; managing their capital. &quot;We've said for years and years that Canadian banks are the most excellent stewards of capital in the world,&quot; <person>Brian Belski</person>, CEO and chief investment officer at Humilis Investment Strategies told BNN Bloomberg. He says last year, banks were beginning to use excess reserves they built the year prior, and the benefits are now flowing through into the first fiscal quarter of 2026. Going forward, Belski says Scotiabank will &quot;set the trend&quot; for the rest of the banks, signalling a positive capital markets backdrop and strong volumes for the quarter.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We raise our 12-month target by <money>CAD8</money> to <money>CAD102</money> on an EV/EBITDA of 11.2x our 2026 EBITDA forecast, a premium to its five-year average forward EV/EBITDA of 10.0x. We lower our 2026 EPS view by <money>CAD0.33</money> to <money>CAD4.89</money> and lower 2027 by <money>CAD0.40</money> to <money>CAD5.27</money>. CCL Industries posted full-year sales growth of 5.8%, while adjusted basic EPS increased 7.4% to <money>CAD4.64</money>. The flagship CCL segment drove performance with sales advancing 8.4% and operating income surging 11.3%, reflecting sustained demand across key divisions. Broad-based strength emerged across the portfolio, with Checkpoint achieving 2.6% sales growth, Innovia delivering 12.2% operating income growth on flat sales, and Avery maintaining resilience despite tariff pressures. We expect secular growth in the Checkpoint segment from accelerating adoption of radio frequency identification (RFID) once apparel supply chain disruptions normalize, though RFID growth has moderated in the near term. Therefore, we forecast sales growth of 4.2% in 2026 and another 3.9% in 2027.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

After the pilot demonstrated a safer, fire-compliant alternative to traditional e-bike charging, Swobbee received approval to scale across all five boroughs, with more than dozens of additional stations planned by the end of the year.</p><p>SINBON's advanced interconnect technology is supporting the expansion, enabling safe, efficient battery integration across the swapping network. Reliable power connectivity and traceable systems are essential to maintaining safety and operational stability. <person>Alex Shiung</person>, Associate Corporate Business Development Director with SINBON, commented: \"SINBON is committed to advancing electrification infrastructure that is both safe and scalable. Through our collaboration with Swobbee, we are contributing technical expertise that supports <location value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >New York City's</location> public safety goals while enabling cleaner micromobility solutions.\"</p><p>Swobbee oversees deployment and operations across the network, centralizing battery charging in controlled environments to reduce fire risks. Swobbee's model enables riders to instantly exchange depleted batteries for fully charged ones which eliminates charging downtime and reduces reliance on informal charging setups. Since onboarding customers in <chron>March 2025</chron>, users have completed approximately 150,000 battery swaps across <location value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >New York City</location> and <location value=\"LU/us.nj.jerity\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Jersey City</location> which reflects strong adoption among delivery riders. The system provides UL-certified batteries, 24/7 station access, and round-the-clock customer support, including in-person assistance in <location value=\"LU/us.ny.mantan\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Manhattan</location>, helping riders maintain consistent earning potential.</p><p><person>Thomas Duscha</person>, CEO of Swobbee, shared: \"<location value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >New York City</location> was actively looking for safer, UL-certified battery solutions and invited us to participate in the pilot project in 2024. The pilot demonstrated that battery swapping can significantly improve safety while making daily work easier for delivery riders. After its success, we received the green light to expand across all five boroughs.\"</p><p>Together, SINBON and Swobbee aim to provide a scalable, fire-safe infrastructure model that aligns with public safety priorities while supporting the city's growing micromobility ecosystem.</p><p><b>About Swobbee<br /></b>Swobbee is a <location value=\"LU/us.ny.berlin\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Berlin</location>-based climate technology company, founded in 2020 with the idea that battery charging needs to be safer and more efficient in terms of operation and resource consumption.

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>On <chron>February 25</chron>, we upgraded our opinion on WSP to Buy from Hold before the company's Q4 2025 earnings report. Following the earnings report and 2026 guidance, we maintain our Buy rating. We now increase our target price to <money>CAD283</money> from <money>CAD272</money>, valuing shares based on an average of 13x our 2027 EBITDA estimate and 22x our 2027 EPS view. We increase our 2026 adjusted EPS forecast to <money>CAD11.11</money> (up by <money>CAD0.54</money>) and initiate our 2027 adjusted EPS estimate at <money>CAD11.81</money> after seeing management's guidance, which incorporates the impact of the recently finalized acquisition of TRC. In our view, valuation is very attractive relative to peers as the EBITDA and earnings multiples are severely depressed. We are confident in WSP's offerings and its ability to generate compounding cash flows, particularly at its current valuation, due to recent deals like the USA Rare Earth agreement as well as strong free cash flow generation.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We lower our target price to <money>USD63</money> (from <money>USD64</money>), which is 13.5x 2026 EV/EBITDA vs. the three-year average of about 15x, factoring in risk from the antitrust investigation and growth moderation as mobility normalizes. As a leading online travel agency in <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>, we expect TCOM to benefit from inbound tourism growth, supported by government initiatives to attract foreign visitors, such as the expansion of the visa-free entry policy. Higher spending on experiences among Chinese consumers may support outbound tourism growth, in our view. Meanwhile, we see downside risk to TCOM's earnings from the ongoing investigation by <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China's</location> antitrust regulator. For example, in prior cases, Alibaba and Meituan faced fines of up to 4% of previous revenue for violations under the Anti-Monopoly Law. We lower our 2026 EPADS estimate to <money>CNY24.57</money> (from <money>CNY27.77</money>), reflecting lower margin forecasts, and start 2027's at <money>CNY29.16</money>.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.
