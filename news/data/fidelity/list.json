            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/us.ca.losang\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >LOS ANGELES</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - For more than a year, <person>Elon Musk</person> has repeatedly said Tesla is months away from launching a driverless robotaxi service in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> - once state regulators give their blessing.</p>\n<p>Tesla did nothing to secure that approval in 2025, according to previously unreported state <org>Department of Motor Vehicles</org> records and a state spokesperson. Tesla logged zero miles of autonomous test driving on California roads last year for the sixth year in a row, the records show.</p>\n<p>Documenting test miles is critical in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California's</location> regulatory system for robotaxis, which requires companies to progress through a series of permits before being allowed to operate a driverless ride-hailing service such as Alphabet's Waymo.</p>\n<p>Much of Tesla's <money>$1.5 trillion</money> market value is tied to investors' belief that it will soon operate a vast fleet of robotaxis and sell millions of autonomous-driving software subscriptions. Operating driverless vehicles in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> - the largest U.S. auto market - is a linchpin of those ambitions.</p>\n<p><person>Bryant Walker Smith</person>, a <org>University of South Carolina</org> law professor and autonomous-driving expert who has consulted for the California DMV, said Tesla is implying that \"they are ready and regulators are not,\" while the reality is that \"regulators are ready, and they are not.\"</p>\n<p>Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. On an earnings call in October, Musk told analysts that the company is &quot;paranoid about safety&quot; and that it takes a &quot;cautious approach&quot; to new markets. &quot;We probably could just let it loose in these cities,&quot; he said, &quot;but we just don't want to take a chance.&quot;</p>\n<p>So far, Tesla operates only a small pilot robotaxi service in <location value=\"LU/us.tx.austin\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Austin, Texas</location>, which has far fewer regulatory barriers than <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location>.</p>\n<p>In the <location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >San Francisco Bay Area</location>, the company last July started operating what it called a \"robotaxi\" service that was not a robotaxi service at all. Instead, it is a chauffeur service with human drivers who use Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" driver-assistance software, which is not fully autonomous, according to the state regulator authorizing the service and Tesla's disclosures to customers.</p>\n<p>In order to operate fully self-driving vehicles in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location>, like Waymo, Tesla would first need to obtain permits to test and operate driverless vehicles from the state's <org>DMV and Public Utilities Commission</org>, which regulates commercial ride-hailing.</p>\n<p>Tesla so far has only the entry-level DMV permit, which allows testing driverless vehicles only with a human safety monitor in the driver's seat. A DMV spokesperson said Tesla has not applied for any additional permits.</p>\n<p>Tesla would need to log at least 50,000 miles (80,467 km) of autonomous driving on public roads in <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> with a safety driver before applying for a different permit allowing testing without one, according to proposed DMV regulations expected to be finalized later this year.</p>\n<p>Tesla has not logged any miles with state regulators since 2019 and has documented only 562 miles in total since 2016. </p>\n<p>Waymo, by comparison, logged more than 13 million testing miles and secured seven different regulatory approvals between 2014 and 2023, when it received approval to charge passengers for rides in driverless robotaxis. Waymo is one of three companies with <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> permits to commercially operate driverless vehicles and the only one approved to operate a robotaxi fleet anything like what Musk envisions.</p>\n<p>In written comments last year, Tesla criticized some of the California DMV's proposed revisions to autonomous-driving rules, questioning the need for testing on state roads and minimum-mile requirements. The company also complained about &quot;overly burdensome reporting requirements&quot; for crashes and other system failures.</p>\n<p>Musk has often suggested <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> regulations are the main impediment to deploying robotaxis there. On an <chron>October 2024</chron> earnings call, he said <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> has \"quite a long regulatory approval process.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'd be shocked if we don't get approved next year,\" he added, \"but it's just not something we totally control.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Reporting by <person>Chris Kirkham</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.ca.losang\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Los Angeles</location>; Editing by <person>Brian Thevenot</person> and <person>Matthew Lewis</person>)</p>\n",

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We keep our <money>$250</money> target, on a P/E of ~24x our CY 27 EPS view of <money>$10.31</money>, above peers/below historical. We lift our FY 27 EPS  to <money>$8.15</money> from <money>$7.80</money> and  FY 28  to <money>$10.31</money> from <money>$10.00</money>. We believe that NVDA's growth is being supported by rising hyperscaler capex (over half of sales), but we think investors need to see greater signs of successful AI monetization from its customer base in a year where CEO Jensen Huang sees Agentic AI at an inflection point. The bar undoubtedly increases, as NVDA makes the case that compute equals revenue for their customers to justify the higher spend. We do expect sequential growth to slow in 2H (tougher comps) but think this is already discounted in shares, while Physical AI/Sovereign AI offers long term upside. We no longer assume NVDA will gain considerable traction in <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> while Rubin appears on pace to ramp in 2H.

            "description": "\n<p><location value=\"LU/be..brussl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >BRUSSELS</location>, <chron>Feb.  26, 2026</chron>  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Aikido Security today unveiled Aikido Infinite, the industry’s first continuous AI penetration testing solution that autonomously validates and remediates vulnerabilities. Infinite reduces risk at every release by testing software changes as they move through deployment, confirming exploitability, and fixing vulnerabilities within the same workflow. With Infinite, Aikido is defining a new approach to software security: self-securing software.</p>  <p>Traditional penetration testing relies on manual or point-in-time assessments, often delivered weeks after software has already shipped. In a recent survey of 500 security and engineering leaders conducted by Aikido, 76% reported deploying significant production changes weekly or faster, yet only 21% validate security on every release. Meanwhile, 85% report that security findings are outdated by the time final reports are delivered.<br/><br/>While newer tools have introduced faster, AI-driven testing, these solutions are often riddled with false positives, do not truly operate autonomously, and stop short of remediation. Aikido Infinite closes this gap. Security teams can expand their capacity with elite hacking agents dedicated to finding security holes in every single piece of code that is pushed, 24/7.</p>  <p>“For years, organizations have been working around the limitations of traditional testing and DAST because there was nothing better available,” said Willem Delbare, co-founder and CEO of Aikido. “Software delivery is now continuous, but security testing isn’t. Infinite completely changes that. This is the beginning of self-securing software.”</p>  <p>Each software change triggers agentic pentesting agents that discover risk, validate exploitability, apply remediation where safe, and retest to confirm risk reduction. Instead of relying on periodic engagements, teams gain a continuous feedback loop that operates alongside deployment, not after it. This level of exhaustiveness would be difficult to replicate even with the largest in-house security teams, whose resources do not scale in proportion to the expanding attack surface and pace of change.</p>  <p>“As software delivery cycles shorten and change becomes constant, point-in-time security models no longer reflect how modern systems operate,” said <person>Katie Norton</person>, Research Manager, DevSecOps and Software Supply Chain Security at IDC. “We are beginning to see early signs of a more autonomous security approach, where exploitability validation and remediation are embedded directly into the software lifecycle. Aikido Infinite reflects this shift by combining continuous testing with remediation capabilities inside a unified platform.”</p>  <p>Infinite utilizes two main resources for its attack. First, Aikido's code-to-runtime platform gives it deep context from the organization's source code, application architecture, and internal logic flows. Then, agents autonomously pursue every possible route of attack across the application’s total surface area, identifying undocumented endpoints, hidden logic paths, complex multi-step edge cases, and architectural anomalies that are often unknown by testers today or too time-consuming for manual testers to address. Aikido Infinite learns from every finding on each deployment, providing a continuous feedback loop that developers can then use to improve code security even before commit.</p>  <p>Built on Aikido’s model-agnostic architecture, Infinite combines advanced AI with proprietary exploit validation and controlled runtime execution. Aikido Infinite is the company's flagship product and the realization of the company’s vision for building self-securing software, shifting security from a reactive process to an embedded, continuous loop. Infinite builds on Aikido Attack, the company’s on-demand AI penetration testing offering that deploys hundreds of specialized agents to hunt vulnerabilities like hackers, validate exploitability, and provide built-in remediation.</p>  <p>Aikido’s AI pentesting capability is already uncovering complex vulnerabilities in apps and frameworks that had previously gone undetected by experts. When combined with in-house expertise, teams achieve a previously unattainable improvement in security posture.</p>  <p>For more information, please visit https://www.aikido.dev/.</p>  <p><strong>About Aikido Security</strong><br/>Founded in Ghent, <location value=\"LC/be\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Belgium</location>, Aikido Security is building self-securing software for modern development teams. Aikido's unified security platform secures code, cloud and runtime, helping teams to reduce risk without slowing down development.

A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided below under “Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures.”</p>  <p align=\"justify\">ACM believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in assessing its operating performance. ACM uses these financial measures internally to evaluate its operating performance and for planning and forecasting of future periods. Financial analysts may focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on the non-GAAP financial measures. ACM also believes it is in the best interests of investors for ACM to provide this non-GAAP information.</p>  <p align=\"justify\">While ACM believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be reported by competitors, and they may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to differences in calculation methodologies. The non-GAAP financial measures are not an alternative to GAAP information and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures. They should be used only as a supplement to GAAP information and should be considered only in conjunction with ACM’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.</p>  <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p>  <p align=\"justify\">Certain statements contained in this press release are not historical facts and may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

With this acquisition, if completed, we will strengthen our armamentarium to reverse oncology drug resistance – by implementing therapeutics that specifically target resistance mutations that arise from targeting the EGFR receptor. Importantly, our established clinical consortia on the <location>West Coast</location>, anchored at <org>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</org> in <location value=\"LU/us.ca.losang\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Los Angeles</location>, provides us with the clinical infrastructure and expertise to rapidly initiate and execute Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies for both compounds.”\n\n</p><p>\n<org value=\"KAPA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Kairos Pharma</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='KAPA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( KAPA )</span> believes the scientific rationale for combining a pan-EGFR inhibitor with a c-MET inhibitor in non-small cell lung cancer as demonstrated with these two assets is compelling and well-validated clinically. MET amplification represents one of the most important resistance mechanisms in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, and the ability to address both pathways with highly selective, brain-penetrant molecules represents a significant therapeutic advance. The Company anticipates that CL-273's wild-type-sparing profile and broad coverage of EGFR mutations, combined with CL-741's potent and selective c-MET inhibition, upon acquisition, will position it to develop best-in-class monotherapies as well as a differentiated combination regimen. Mechanistically, dual inhibition of EGFR and MET pathways can overcome compensatory signaling that drives resistance, deepens tumor responses, and extends progression-free survival in this difficult-to-treat patient population.\n\n</p><p>\nKinase inhibitors for cancer treatment were estimated to be valued at <money>$60.7B</money> in 2025. Of these, EGFR inhibitors represented 32.5% of the market in 2025 (<i>Future Market Insights</i>).\n\n</p><p>\nCL-273, developed using a proprietary AI-driven drug discovery platform, targets the EGFR mutated lung cancer treatment, a market valued at <money>$16.2B</money> in 2026 (<i>Future Market Insights</i>). EGFR mutations are present in approximately 10-15% of NSCLC cases in Western populations and up to 50% in Asian populations (<i>CoherentMI</i>), creating a substantial addressable patient population for targeted therapies.\n\n</p><p>\nCL-741 addresses the cMet inhibitor market which is experiencing rapid growth, valued at more than <money>$2B</money> and projected to reach over <money>$10B</money> by 2030 with a CAGR in excess of 17% <i>(Biospace</i>). The c-MET metastatic NSCLC market represents a high-value niche with significant unmet medical needs, with c-MET amplification being a critical resistance mechanism for EGFR-targeted therapies. C-MET alterations, including MET exon 14 skipping mutations and MET amplification, is a driver of multiple cancer types inclusive of gastric, liver, and renal cancer.\n\n</p><p>\n\"Our proprietary AI-driven drug design platform has enabled the discovery of a highly efficacious, wild-type-sparing, pan-mutant EGFR inhibitor. This molecule offers a 4-to-5-fold broader safety margin than current competitive inhibitors,\" stated <person>Nikolay Savchuk</person>, Ph.D., CEO of Celyn Therapeutics. \"By partnering with <org value=\"KAPA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Kairos Pharma</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='KAPA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( KAPA )</span> and leveraging their clinical consortia at <org>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</org>, we are positioned to rapidly advance CL-273 and CL-741. This collaboration combines Kairos’s operational expertise with our innovative pipeline to create an optimal pathway for patients fighting EGFR-mutant and c-MET-driven lung cancers.\"\n\n</p><p>\nClinical studies have demonstrated that combination treatment with EGFR and MET inhibitors for EGFR-mutant, MET-amplified NSCLC patients is able to achieve progression-free survival of approximately 7 months, representing a significant advance over single-agent therapy (<i>SAVANNAH trial</i>).\n\n</p><p>\nCL-273 is an investigational, reversible, wild-type-sparing pan-EGFR small-molecule inhibitor specifically engineered for EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Preclinical data demonstrate that CL-273 maintains broad-spectrum activity against classical EGFR mutations including Exon 19 and 21 deletions and Exon 20 insertions, atypical mutations, and resistance-associated variants that bypass currently approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).\n\n</p><p>\nA defining feature of CL-273 is its exceptional selectivity index. By sparing wild-type EGFR, studies to date have shown CL-273 offers a 4–5 fold wider therapeutic window, suggesting significantly improved safety and tolerability over existing therapies. Designed for high brain and lung permeability to address metastatic disease, CL-273 possesses favorable ADME properties and has successfully completed GLP toxicology studies. The program is currently pre-IND, with first-in-human clinical trials projected to commence in 2026.\n\n</p><p>\nCL-741 is an orally available, small-molecule, type IIb c-MET kinase inhibitor designed to be highly selective for c-MET with broad coverage of activating and acquired resistance mutations in solid tumors. The compound was discovered as a drug-like lead with potent activity across multiple c-MET resistance mutants and is being developed for c-MET-driven advanced solid tumors, with a primary focus on non-small cell lung cancers harboring MET exon 14 skipping alterations and MET amplification.\n\n</p><p>\nThe acquisition of both CL-273 and CL-741, if the acquisition is successfully completed, are anticipated to enable <org value=\"KAPA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Kairos Pharma</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='KAPA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( KAPA )</span> to pursue a differentiated dual-target strategy addressing both primary EGFR mutations and MET-mediated resistance mechanisms. MET amplification is one of the most common mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs.\n\n</p><p>\nDeveloping CL-273 and CL-741 together provides a rational combination therapy approach for EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who either harbor baseline MET amplification/overexpression or acquire MET-driven resistance on EGFR-TKI therapy. Combined EGFR and MET inhibition has already demonstrated meaningful clinical response rates and survival benefit with other agents in this setting. Pairing CL-273 with CL-741 could deepen and prolong responses, reduce outgrowth of MET-mediated escape clones, and potentially expand the addressable population of MET-dependent, EGFR-mutant tumors.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>About <org value=\"KAPA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Kairos Pharma, Ltd.</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='KAPA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( KAPA )</span></b>\n\n</p><p>\nBased in <location value=\"LU/us.ca.losang\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Los Angeles, California</location>, <org value=\"KAPA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Kairos Pharma Ltd.</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='KAPA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( KAPA )</span> is at the forefront of oncology therapeutics, utilizing structural biology to overcome drug resistance and immune suppression in cancer.

Like our flagship <org>Laird Lake Project</org>, Forester is historically underexplored yet lies along trend - in a similar geological environment - from a producing, multimillion-ounce, gold mine. Despite only limited drilling in the 1980s, we are impressed by the exceptional grade-thickness gold hits of up to 60 gram-metres, which we consider highly anomalous given the shallow and sparse nature of that program. Back then, large-scale open-pit mining of orogenic gold systems was virtually non-existent in <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location>, so the bulk-tonnage potential at Forester was largely overlooked. With a newly consolidated land package, a much stronger gold price environment, and access to modern exploration tools, we believe we are well-positioned to build upon the historical work with a fresh perspective and systematically unlock value at Forester&quot;</i> said <person>Koby Kushner</person>, CEO of Athena.</p><p><strong>Forester Project Overview</strong></p><p>Forester is located in northwestern <location value=\"LS/ca.on\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Ontario</location>, less than 30 km southeast of the operating <location>Musselwhite Gold Mine</location> (owned by Orla Mining Ltd., with proven &amp; probable reserves of ~1.5 <person>Moz Au</person> at 6.43 g/t). The 4,900-hectare land package is underlain by the same banded iron formations, mafic volcanics, and metasedimentary rocks that host significant gold mineralization at Musselwhite.</p><img src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/37cfdfc4-0c42-4e92-8a8b-103f24dff898/1141804/image20260226022638d30n5k.png\" style=\"width:650px;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\" /><figcaption><strong>Figure 1: Regional map showing Forester project location relative to Orla Mining's Musselwhite mine.</strong></figcaption><div style=\"clear: both\"> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><p>Limited historical exploration in the mid-1980s included 16 shallow diamond drill holes focused on the eastern <location>Tex Zone</location>, returning encouraging high-grade gold mineralization near surface. The Project has seen virtually no modern follow-up for almost 40 years and hosts 14 known surface gold occurrences grading up to 147 g/t Au, along with multiple additional showings.</p><p>Athena believes the bulk-tonnage potential was largely ignored by historical operators, who focused primarily on narrow, high-grade vein mineralization. The Company sees a compelling opportunity to apply modern exploration concepts and test for both high-grade, banded iron formation-hosted (Musselwhite-style) mineralization and broader, lower-grade bulk-tonnage style mineralization. With Orla actively exploring and expanding resources at Musselwhite, Forester is well-positioned to benefit from regional activity and potential processing synergies.</p><p>In addition to gold, the Project is also prospective for hosting critical metals, including copper with historical results returning up to 1.49% Cu along with 2 g/t Au from surface grade samples (https://www.geologyontario.mines.gov.on.ca/persistent-linking?mineral-inventory=MDI53B08NE00009). The copper potential at Forester has never been a focus of historical exploration and represents an opportunity for Athena.</p><img src=\"https://app.accessnewswire.com/imagelibrary/31fdb20d-52bf-4cba-a4a3-5f0b8c72eb21/1141804/image.png\" style=\"width:650px;text-align:center;margin:0.9em auto;\" /><figcaption><strong>Figure 2: Geological map over Forester project area, showing historical results.

Without regular application of these coatings, engines cannot be used.</p>\n<p>Since Reuters first reported about yttrium shortages in November, prices have jumped 60% and are now about 69 times as high as a year ago. Some coatings manufacturers are also now starting to ration material, according to company executives and traders.</p>\n<p>Executives at two North American firms that buy yttrium to make coatings told Reuters they have needed to temporarily pause production due to shortages. One is also now turning away smaller and offshore customers in order to conserve supply for larger clients, which include certain engine makers.</p>\n<p>Another firm in the coating supply chain recently ran out of material and stopped selling products containing yttrium oxide, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>\n<p>While shortages of yttrium and scandium have not weighed on production of jet engines or chips yet, a U.S. government official told Reuters some U.S. manufacturers now face &quot;shortages&quot; of certain rare earths from <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> exported 17 tons of yttrium products to the U.S. in the eight months after controls were introduced last April versus 333 tons in the eight months before the measures.</p>\n<p>A <org>White House</org> official said the Trump administration is committed to ensuring access to critical minerals for all U.S. businesses. </p>\n<p>&quot;This includes negotiating with <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> and monitoring compliance with President Trump's agreement with President Xi, as well as developing alternative supply chains as warranted.&quot;</p>\n<p>Reuters spoke with two U.S. government officials, 14 company executives and staff, traders and analysts across aerospace and semiconductors. All of them spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity except the analysts named in the story. The North American executives did not want to be named discussing internal production challenges in public. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China's</location> <org>Ministry of Commerce</org> did not respond to questions.</p>\n<p>PRODUCTION PRESSURE </p>\n<p>While low yttrium supplies have not hurt engine production, manufacturers remain concerned, said aerospace supply chain specialist <person>Kevin Michaels</person>.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is a watch item and a tangible example of how <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> is flexing its rare earth muscle,&quot; said Michaels, managing director at U.S. consultant AeroDynamic Advisory. </p>\n<p>Enginemakers are already struggling to meet demand for spare parts from airlines and higher production by planemakers <org value=\"BA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Boeing</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BA )</span> and Airbus.</p>\n<p>U.S. aircraft enginemakers <org>GE Aerospace</org>, RTX's Pratt &amp; Whitney and <org value=\"HON.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Honeywell</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='HON' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( HON )</span> declined comment.</p>\n<p>SCARCE SCANDIUM</p>\n<p>In addition to yttrium, U.S. semiconductor makers are running low on scandium, putting production of next-generation 5G chips at risk, said <person>Dylan Patel</person>, founder and CEO of research firm SemiAnalysis. </p>\n<p>With global production of only several tens of tons a year, scandium plays small but important parts in fuel cells, specialty aluminium aerospace alloys and advanced chip processing and packaging.</p>\n<p>Major U.S. semiconductor manufacturers all rely on scandium for making chip components that &quot;go into essentially every 5G smartphone and base station&quot;, Patel said.</p>\n<p>U.S. chipmakers have experienced delays in receiving new scandium export licenses from <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> in recent months and have reached out to <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location> for help, said two industry sources. </p>\n<p>Many of these firms had obtained scandium from third-country suppliers, another U.S. official said, but <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> requires license applicants to declare their end-users.</p>\n<p>&quot;Our thesis is that it is precisely the semi industry being targeted,&quot; the U.S. official said.</p>\n<p><org>The U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association</org> declined to comment.</p>\n<p>&quot;The U.S. currently has zero domestic scandium production and no operational alternative sources outside <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>,&quot; Patel said, adding that stockpiles are likely in months rather than years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Allison Lampert</person> in <location value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Montreal</location>; <person>Laurie Chen</person> and <person>Lewis Jackson</person> in <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location>; <person>Michael Martina</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location>; Additional reporting by <person>Fanny Potkin</person> in <location value=\"LC/sg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Singapore</location>, <person>Ernest Scheyder</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.tx.houstn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Houston</location> and <person>Melanie Burton</person> in <location value=\"LU/au..melbou\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Melbourne</location>; Editing by <person>Sonali Paul</person>)</p>\n",

Our backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize from existing agreements with our customers for the sale of our battery energy storage systems and performance of services. The backlog is calculated by adding new orders in the current fiscal period to the backlog as of the end of the prior fiscal period and then subtracting the shipments in the current fiscal period. If the amount of an order is modified or cancelled, we adjust orders in the current period and our backlog accordingly, but do not retroactively adjust previously published backlogs. There is no comparable US-GAAP financial measure to backlog. We believe that the backlog is a useful indicator regarding the future revenue of our Company.</p>    <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Pipeline</strong>. Our pipeline represents projects for which we have submitted technical proposals or non-binding quotes plus letters of intent (“LOI”) or firm commitments from customers. Pipeline does not include lead generation projects.</p>    <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Booked Orders</strong>. Booked orders are orders where we have legally binding agreements with a Purchase Order (“PO”), or Master Supply Agreement (“MSA”) executed by both parties.</p>    <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</strong></p>    <p align=\"justify\">To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed in this earnings release non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit (loss), and adjusted EPS, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the <org>SEC</org>. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures of the Company’s calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company believes adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit (loss), and adjusted EPS are useful measures in evaluating its financial and operational performance distinct and apart from financing costs, certain non-cash expenses and non-operational expenses.</p>    <p align=\"justify\">We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively may be helpful to our investors in assessing its operating performance. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents. For example, the Company’s definitions of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Below is a description of the non-GAAP financial information included herein as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. You should review the reconciliations below but not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.</p>    <p align=\"justify\">Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (net loss) attributable to Eos adjusted for interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of debt and derivatives, debt extinguishment, and other non-cash or non-recurring items as determined by management which it does not believe to be indicative of its underlying business trends. Adjusted gross profit (loss) is defined as gross profit (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EPS is defined as GAAP net loss per common share as adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense change in fair value of debt and derivatives and debt extinguishment per common share.</p>  <table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. We present non-GAAP financial measures in order to assist readers of our financial statements in understanding the core operating results that our management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning purposes. Our non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our financial performance over multiple periods.\n\n</p><p>\nThe non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are key performance measures that our management uses to assess our operating performance. These non-GAAP measures facilitate internal comparisons of our operating performance on a more consistent basis. We use these performance measures for business planning purposes and forecasting. We believe that these non-GAAP measures enhance an investor’s understanding of our financial performance as they are useful in assessing our operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business.\n\n</p><p>\nThe non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate these measures in the same manner. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. When evaluating the Company’s performance, you should consider adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS alongside other financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, including gross profit or loss, gross margin, net loss, and EPS.\n\n</p><p>\nThe non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. In this press release, we have provided reconciliations of adjusted gross profit to gross profit or loss, adjusted gross margin to gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to corresponding GAAP measures are not available on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the non-cash component of employee compensation expense, changes in our working capital needs, variances in our supply chain, the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be reflective, on a recurring basis, of our ongoing operations, and other such items without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to our results computed in accordance with GAAP. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Forward Looking Statements</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our actual results may differ from our expectations, estimates, and projections and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believe,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, our expectations with respect to financial results, revenue growth, future performance of our ultrasound business and Embedded opportunities (inclusive of co-development, revenue share/commercialization revenue, chip purchases, and/or chip licensing opportunities through the Embedded program), commercialization and plans to deploy our products and services, including expectations regarding the launches of our Compass AI software, our P5 and Apollo chips and fourth-generation technology, finalizing our first commercial HomeCare agreement, development of products and services, and the size and potential growth of current or future markets for our products and services. Forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to us. These forward-looking statements involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Most of these factors are outside our control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: our ability to grow and manage growth effectively; the success, cost, and timing of our product and service development activities; the potential attributes and benefits of our products and services; the degree to which our products and services are accepted by healthcare practitioners and patients for their approved uses; our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products, as applicable, and any related restrictions and limitations on the use of any authorized product; our ability to identify, in-license, or acquire additional technology; our ability to maintain our existing license, manufacturing, supply, and distribution agreements; the success, cost, and timing of our efforts to out-license our intellectual property to third parties; our ability to compete with other companies currently marketing or engaged in the development of ultrasound imaging devices, many of which have greater financial and marketing resources than us; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the size and growth potential of the markets for our products and services, and our ability to serve those markets, either alone or in partnership with others; the pricing of our products and services, and reimbursement for medical procedures conducted using our products and services; our estimates regarding expenses, revenue, capital requirements, and needs for additional financing; our financial performance; our ability to attract and retain customers; our ability to manage our growth effectively; our ability to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights; our ability to maintain the listing of our Class A common stock on the <org>New York Stock Exchange</org>; and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or in subsequent filings that we make with the <org>Securities and Exchange Commission</org>. We caution that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. We caution you not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertake to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\n</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bwtablemarginb bwblockalignl bwwidth100\">\n<tr>\n<td class=\"bwpadl0\"

By <chron>February 2025</chron>,\n<location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> government had tightened controls on foreign\nproperty purchases.</p>\n<p>The housing scare fed into the broader push to give\nauthorities tools to vet who is behind incoming capital.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>FOREIGN INVESTMENT BILL SUBMITTED IN OCTOBER</p>\n<p>A foreign investment screening bill, long in the works and\nformally submitted to parliament in October, was initially\nconceived partly as a safeguard against any unwanted Chinese\ninvestment. But three of the sources said the focus had shifted\nfollowing Trump's revived <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> ambitions.</p>\n<p>&quot;We are very interested in working with American investors,\nbut not in a way where they try to push certain political\ngoals,&quot; said MP Aqqalu Jerimiassen from the Atassut party, part\nof <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> governing coalition.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> has long sought to diversify its economy,\nprimarily by courting investments in its mining sector. However,\nlimited infrastructure, including a lack of roads connecting the\nregion's 72 towns, extreme climatic conditions, and labour\nshortages, have hampered progress in attracting meaningful\nforeign capital.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/dk\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Denmark</location> has allocated extra money for infrastructure and\nother development initiatives, and the EU has proposed more than\ndoubling its funding. Still, <location>the Arctic</location> nation's economy remains\nstagnant, with growth at just 0.2% in 2025 and a significant\ndeficit in public finances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>SOME SECTORS WILL NEED MANDATORY SCREENING</p>\n<p>First debated in November, the screening bill is set for\nfurther discussion in April and is expected to be passed that\nmonth. The draft requires foreign investors to disclose the\norigin of their funds and enables authorities to reject deals if\nthe political affiliations or intentions of the investors raise\nconcerns.</p>\n<p>&quot;If someone is working for Trump, we will find out with this\nscreening law. This is about our own security,&quot; Jerimiassen\nadded.</p>\n<p>The proposed bill does not single out specific countries but\nurges cooperation with allies, indicating that American and\nEuropean investors may face less scrutiny compared to Chinese\ncounterparts. However, it grants <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> the authority to\nreview foreign investments considered a threat to security.</p>\n<p>&quot;The purpose of the law is to prevent foreign investments\nfrom posing a threat to <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> security or public order,&quot;\nthe legislation states. In addition, its goal is to enhance the\nsecurity of &quot;<location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> and its allies, including <org>NATO</org> member\nstates&quot;.</p>\n<p>Foreign investments in critical infrastructure, IT and\nclassified data systems, raw materials and mining, hydropower,\nand government-owned companies will require mandatory screening\nunder the proposed law.</p>\n<p>The legislation is limited to areas under <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location>\njurisdiction and does not extend to U.S. military activities on\nthe island, which remain under <location value=\"LC/dk\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Denmark's</location> control.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> has said it has no intention of competing for\ninfluence in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >GREENLAND</location> STILL WANTS AMERICAN CAPITAL, MP SAYS</p>\n<p>Last month, <person>Drew Horn</person>, a former senior aide in Trump's first\nadministration, announced plans for a multi-billion-dollar data\ncentre in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> - the kind of project some lawmakers view as\nunderscoring the need for clearer screening rules.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> government said it has not received any\napplications or formal requests related to the proposal.</p>\n<p>Horn, who now leads an investment and advisory firm, told\nReuters the project had no political ties and that he had no\nconcerns about passing any screening requirements in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>.</p>\n<p>&quot;<location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> wants American capital, but we fear hidden\npolitical motives behind certain U.S. private investors,&quot; said\none member of parliament, speaking anonymously due to the\nsensitivity of the issue.</p>\n<p>Negotiations between <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> and the U.S. over access and\npresence on the island are ongoing, with Trump still insisting\non \"total access\" to the island.</p>\n<p>Business Minister Naaja Nathanielsen told Reuters the\nforeign investment screening law was not drafted in response to\nU.S. interest and that she continued to welcome American\ninvestment.</p>\n<p>However, if negotiations between the U.S. and <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>\nbroke down, she said, &quot;then of course we would need to\nreevaluate our position.
