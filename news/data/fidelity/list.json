We don't need it, we don't want it, and will not do business with them again!&quot;</p>\n<p>He added there would be a six-month phaseout for the <org>Defense Department</org> and other agencies that use the company's products.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Pentagon's supply-chain risk designation, typically reserved for companies in adversary nations, means that defense contractors could be barred from deploying Anthropic's AI as part of work for the Pentagon. The defense industrial base includes tens of thousands of contractors, including major public companies.</p>\n<p>The actions were pegged to a Friday deadline that the Pentagon set to resolve an escalating feud with <location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >San Francisco</location>-based Anthropic, over concerns about how the military could use AI at war.</p>\n<p>Spokespeople for Anthropic, which won a <money>$200 million</money> ceiling Pentagon contract last year, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>Trump's announcement stopped short of the Pentagon's threat that it could invoke the Defense Production Act to require Anthropic's compliance. But the U.S. president vowed further action if Anthropic did not cooperate going forward.</p>\n<p>Trump warned he would use &quot;the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow&quot; if Anthropic did not help with the phaseout of its technology.</p>\n<p>WEAPONS, SURVEILLANCE CONCERNS</p>\n<p>The setback comes as AI leader Anthropic raced to win a fierce competition selling novel technology to businesses and government, particularly for national security, ahead of its widely expected initial public offering. The company has said it has not finalized an IPO decision.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the battle over technological guardrails had raised concerns that the <org>Department of Defense</org> would follow U.S. law but little other constraint when deploying AI for national-security missions, regardless of safety or ethics service terms embraced by the technology's developers.</p>\n<p>Anthropic had sought guarantees that its AI would not be used for fully autonomous weapons or for mass domestic surveillance - applications in which the Pentagon has said it had no interest. </p>\n<p>Anthropic was the first frontier AI lab to put its models on classified networks via cloud provider <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon.com</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> and the first to build customized models for national security customers, the startup has said.</p>\n<p>Its product Claude is in use across the intelligence community and armed services.</p>\n<p>U.S. Senator <person>Mark Warner</person>, a Democrat and vice chairman of the <org>Select Committee on Intelligence</org>, criticized the action taken by Trump, a Republican.</p>\n<p>\"The president's directive to halt the use of a leading American AI company across the federal government, combined with inflammatory rhetoric attacking that company, raises serious concerns about whether national security decisions are being driven by careful analysis or political considerations.&quot;</p>\n<p>The conflict is the latest eruption in a saga that dates back at least to 2018. That year, employees at Alphabet's Google protested the Pentagon's use of the company's AI to analyze drone footage, straining relations between <location>Silicon Valley</location> and <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location>.

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We lower our 12-month target price by <money>$25</money> to <money>$65</money>, applying an EV/revenue multiple of 2.3x to our FY 27 (Jan.) estimate, a discount to its three-year historical average multiple at 3.7x.

The Online business, while stabilizing, continues to see only slight growth, and guidance suggests that this segment will remain relatively flat, with only modest increases anticipated for FY 27. The company noted that price increases are not expected to be an ongoing lever for growth, indicating that future revenue improvement will rely more heavily on adding value and product innovation rather than pricing actions. Finally, the ongoing transition from on-prem to cloud for large enterprise customers remains incomplete, with approximately 150 million seats still on-prem. This indicates a slower migration pace and ongoing challenges in capturing full market potential.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

            "description": "\n<p><strong>XRP</strong> (CRYPTO: XRP) is way off <money>$2</money>, yet recent industry discussions suggest the token and the XRP Ledger could play a central role in a digitized global financial system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The XRP Ledger Has One Advantage</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the Paul Barron podcast, panelists addressed perceived competition between the Canton Network and the XRP Ledger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discussion argued that the <org>Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation</org> using Canton for tokenization does not directly threaten XRP's use case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canton is designed for real-world asset tokenization and privacy across subnets, rather than cross-border liquidity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By contrast, the XRP Ledger is described as a bridge asset system built for instant cross-border and cross-asset settlement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under that framework, tokenized assets issued on Canton that move across currencies or jurisdictions could still require a neutral liquidity layer such as XRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tokenization of real-world assets was highlighted as a major long-term catalyst. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hosts cited commentary from the <org>World Economic Forum</org> suggesting that a significant portion of global assets, from government treasuries to commodities, could eventually migrate on chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that scenario, XRP would function as a shared liquidity pool connecting tokenized treasuries, gold, commodities and central bank digital currencies across borders in near real time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ripple's Strategic Positioning</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ripple is also seen as strengthening its institutional footprint through acquisitions and infrastructure expansion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speculation has emerged that Ripple could explore bank acquisitions to accelerate integration within the global financial system, potentially targeting institutions such as <strong>BNY</strong> or <strong>Standard Chartered</strong>. No formal announcements have been made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between 2023 and 2025, Ripple pursued acquisitions aimed at expanding custody, liquidity and stablecoin infrastructure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its stablecoin, <strong>RLUSD</strong> (CRYPTO: RLUSD), is positioned as a potential &quot;cash leg&quot; for tokenized securities and commodities, complementing XRP's proposed role as a bridge asset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this framing, XRP is presented not merely as a speculative token but as a liquidity layer within a broader blockchain-based financial architecture focused on interoperability and tokenized collateral.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>\n",

The prototype will be demonstrated at <org>Mobile World Congress</org> 2026 and shows how AI‑enabled, RAN-assisted intelligence can improve uplink performance in real time while remaining effective over time through practical model retraining and over‑the‑air (OTA) updates, helping operators and ecosystem partners accelerate the transition to networks.\n\n</p><p>\nAs networks evolve, maintaining consistent uplink performance becomes increasingly challenging. Coverage conditions vary widely across urban, rural, indoor, and hard-to-reach locations. Traditional transmitter diversity techniques are often static, which can limit performance as conditions change. At the same time, AI models trained in one environment may not perform the same across all deployment scenarios and updating those models in live networks can be operationally complex. Operators need an approach that is accurate, site‑aware, and easy to maintain.\n\n</p><p>\n<org value=\"KEYS.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Keysight</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='KEYS' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( KEYS )</span> and MediaTek address this need by combining RAN‑assisted AI decision‑making, site‑specific model retraining, and over-the-air (OTA) model updates in a controlled test environment that mimics real-world network conditions. The prototype leverages Keysight’s Channel Studio RaySim and its Network and Channel Emulation solutions to create realistic, repeatable validation scenarios.

            "description": "\n<p><chron>04:15 PM EST</chron>, <chron>02/27/2026</chron> (MT Newswires) -- <org>The Toronto Stock Exchange</org> slumped Friday, mostly on some profit taking after it set six record closes over the prior seven sessions, but losses on the resources-heavy index were capped by higher commodity prices, while investors continue to welcome news of a swing in foreign direct investment into a rare surplus.</p><p>The S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index closed down 161.97 points, or 0.5%, to 34,339.99,  falling off the 17th record close of 2026 set Thursday, with sectors mixed over Friday's session. For a second successive day, Info Tech led decliners , down 2.5%, while Financials was down near 2%. Telecom led gainers, up 1.65%, with Energy, up 1.15% and the Battery Metals Index, up 1.1%, next.</p><p><org>BMO Capital Markets</org> Chief Economist <person>Douglas Porter</person> in his regular Friday 'Talking Points' note noted even as the Canadian economy remains &quot;challenged by relentless trade uncertainty&quot;, the TSX continues to &quot;find its own path&quot;. Prior to Friday's stumble, the index managed to rise more than 1% this week to hit an record high above 34,500 and was up 8% in the first two months of the year. Porter noted a rebound in gold and firmer oil prices assisted, but Q1 bank earnings were also &quot;greeted favourably&quot;. He also noted economy-wide profits rose more than 6% in 2025, topping nominal GDP growth of 4.3% on the year. More broadly, <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> may be benefitting from a diversification push away from U.S. markets, where valuations are rich, Porter said.</p><p>Porter cited as just as one small sample of the shift into <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> in the past year a &quot;welcome&quot; swing in foreign direct investment into a rare surplus. For Q4 alone, quarterly net FDI inflows were <money>$11.6 billion</money>, driven by M&amp;A activity. Looking at the four-quarter trend reveals that for the first time in more than a decade, and only the second time in the past 18 years, <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> had a net inflow in FDI in 2025 of <money>$17.3 billion</money>, Porter noted. For perspective, Porter said that alone would have funded more than half of the current account deficit of <money>$30.4 billion</money> last year. He noted there are three major types of FDI: M&amp;A, greenfield investments, and reinvested earnings. In 2025, the latter remained in a large outflow position of <money>$47 billion</money> &quot;and is normally in a deficit because of <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada's</location> large stock of outstanding investments abroad&quot; while M&amp;A was in a large offsetting surplus. Net new FDI investments were, thus,  in a surplus of <money>$17.6 billion</money> for the year, &quot;which is encouraging news for an economy looking for new growth avenues&quot;, Porter added.</p><p>Of commodities, gold rose to the highest in a month Friday following a report U.S. wholesale inflation rose above expectations in January. Gold for April delivery was last seen up <money>US$86.50</money> to to <money>US$5,280.70</money> per ounce, the highest since the record close of <money>US$5,354.80</money> on <chron>Jan. 29</chron>.</p><p>Also, West Texas Intermediate crude oil rose to a six-month high as a third round of talks between the U.S. and <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location> ended with an agreement to meet again next week amid reports <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location> is balking at U.S. demands it abandon its uranium enrichment program, raising worries President Trump will decide to strike at the OPEC+ member. WTI crude oil for April delivery closed up <money>US$1.81</money> to settle at <money>US$67.02</money> per barrel, the highest since <chron>Aug. 1</chron>, while <person>April Brent</person> crude was up <money>US$1.81</money> to <money>US$72.56</money>.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

The Japanese investment giant has sold stakes in its existing investments, including Nvidia, in order to fund its check into OpenAI. </p>\n<p>The infusion will help OpenAI secure advanced AI chips and the computing capacity it needs to maintain its lead position in the AI industry, especially as competition heats up from Anthropic and Alphabet's Google. </p>\n<p>It also exacerbates <location>Wall Street</location> concerns about  &quot;circular&quot; financing agreements, where firms invest in and sign supply deals with each other, inflating demand and revenue.</p>\n<p>After years of outsized gains, tech stocks have suffered sharp declines in 2026 as investors question whether AI investments will generate sufficient returns to justify lofty valuations.</p>\n<p>Nvidia was punished by shareholders this week after the chipmaker said it would pour money into the AI ecosystem, instead of returning cash to shareholders.
