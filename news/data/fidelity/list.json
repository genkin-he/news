The program honors organizations and technologies that demonstrate excellence, innovation and measurable market impact.\n\n</p><p>\nThe dual Gold recognition highlights Ooma AirDial’s role in helping organizations modernize fire, life-safety, elevator, and other mission-critical communications as telecommunications carriers continue to retire legacy copper networks nationwide.\n\n</p><p>\n“Critical communications infrastructure is undergoing a major transition as copper lines are phased out,” said <person>Jim Gustke</person>, senior vice president of marketing at Ooma. “These awards continue to validate Ooma AirDial’s ability to help organizations maintain reliability, visibility and compliance while transitioning to a more modern, resilient communications architecture.”\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Addressing a Growing Infrastructure Challenge</b>\n\n</p><p>\nOrganizations across commercial real estate, healthcare, education, government and other sectors continue to rely on analog devices originally designed for traditional Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) lines. As carriers accelerate copper retirement and support resources decline, many enterprises are facing increased risk, rising costs and reduced visibility into critical systems.\n\n</p><p>\nOoma AirDial was designed to help organizations transition away from legacy copper infrastructure without requiring replacement of existing endpoint devices, enabling a more controlled and predictable modernization path.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Award-Winning Innovation</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThe Merit Awards judges recognized Ooma AirDial for its combination of cloud-based management, real-time operational visibility, compliance-based architecture, and resilient connectivity architecture.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Key capabilities include:</b>\n\n</p><ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\n<b>Remote Device Management</b> which provides centralized visibility into device status, connectivity and call activity across locations.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Automated alerts</b> that notify teams of emergency calls and power events.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Patented MultiPath™ technology</b> that simultaneously routes traffic over LTE and wired Ethernet.\n\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Support for life-safety compliance requirements</b> including NFPA 72 and ASME A17.1 environments.\n\n</li>\n</ul><p>\nTogether, these capabilities help shift critical communications management from reactive troubleshooting to proactive monitoring and control.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Building on Industry Recognition</b>\n\n</p><p>\nThe Merit Awards add to a growing list of industry recognition for Ooma AirDial, now recognized as one of the most awarded POTS replacement solutions in the industry. In recent years, the solution has earned recognition from organizations including TMC, Channel Vision, UC Today, <org>Elevator World</org> and FacilitiesNet, reflecting continued market validation across communications and facilities management sectors.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Supporting the Ongoing Copper Transition</b>\n\n</p><p>\nWith copper network retirement accelerating across <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location>, many organizations are now reassessing how legacy voice lines support life-safety and operational systems. Solutions that provide centralized oversight, redundancy and predictable deployment models are becoming increasingly important for multi-site enterprises and public-sector environments.\n\n</p><p>\n“Ooma AirDial was built specifically to help organizations navigate this transition with confidence,” Gustke added. “As the copper sunset continues, visibility and reliability are becoming mission critical for enterprise communications.”\n\n</p><p>\nOoma AirDial is available today for organizations seeking to modernize legacy copper-dependent systems.

            "description": "\n<p><location value=\"LU/dk..cophgn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >COPENHAGEN</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - A surge in property interest from U.S. buyers in Nuuk early last year prompted lawmakers to rush through curbs on foreign purchases and shifted the focus of <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> upcoming foreign-investment screening law, lawmakers and other people familiar with the matter said. </p>\n<p>In <chron>January 2025</chron>, around the time U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his efforts to assert greater control over <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>, lawyers and real estate firms in the capital began receiving multiple inquiries from U.S. buyers, six people familiar with the matter said. </p>\n<p>Until then, foreigners had shown little interest in property in the town of 20,000 people.</p>\n<p>&quot;The most aggressive ones wanted to buy everything available on the market,&quot; said a Nuuk-based lawyer, who requested anonymity.</p>\n<p>BALANCING NEEDS OF ECONOMY WITH POLITICS</p>\n<p>Trump's interest in <location>the Arctic</location> island has left its lawmakers in a dilemma, as they balance the need to attract capital to boost its stagnating economy with a wish to block out U.S. investors they suspect may carry hidden political motives. </p>\n<p>It was not clear who the investors were or whether they were linked to Trump's push for <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>, which is a semi-autonomous part of the Kingdom of <location value=\"LC/dk\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Denmark</location>.</p>\n<p>But the sudden interest alarmed lawmakers, who feared outside buyers could push residents out of Nuuk's already tight housing market, three of the sources said. By <chron>February 2025</chron>, <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> government had tightened controls on foreign property purchases.</p>\n<p>The housing scare fed into the broader push to give authorities tools to vet who is behind incoming capital. </p>\n<p>FOREIGN INVESTMENT BILL SUBMITTED IN OCTOBER</p>\n<p>A foreign investment screening bill, long in the works and formally submitted to parliament in October, was initially conceived partly as a safeguard against any unwanted Chinese investment. But three of the sources said the focus had shifted following Trump's revived <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> ambitions.</p>\n<p>&quot;We are very interested in working with American investors, but not in a way where they try to push certain political goals,&quot; said MP Aqqalu Jerimiassen from the Atassut party, part of <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> governing coalition. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> has long sought to diversify its economy, primarily by courting investments in its mining sector. However, limited infrastructure, including a lack of roads connecting the region's 72 towns, extreme climatic conditions, and labour shortages, have hampered progress in attracting meaningful foreign capital.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/dk\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Denmark</location> has allocated extra money for infrastructure and other development initiatives, and the EU has proposed more than doubling its funding. Still, <location>the Arctic</location> nation's economy remains stagnant, with growth at just 0.2% in 2025 and a significant deficit in public finances.</p>\n<p>SOME SECTORS WILL NEED MANDATORY SCREENING</p>\n<p>First debated in November, the screening bill is set for further discussion in April and is expected to be passed that month. The draft requires foreign investors to disclose the origin of their funds and enables authorities to reject deals if the political affiliations or intentions of the investors raise concerns.</p>\n<p>&quot;If someone is working for Trump, we will find out with this screening law. This is about our own security,&quot; Jerimiassen added.</p>\n<p>The proposed bill does not single out specific countries but urges cooperation with allies, indicating that American and European investors may face less scrutiny compared to Chinese counterparts. However, it grants <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> the authority to review foreign investments considered a threat to security.</p>\n<p>&quot;The purpose of the law is to prevent foreign investments from posing a threat to <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> security or public order,&quot; the legislation states. In addition, its goal is to enhance the security of &quot;<location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> and its allies, including <org>NATO</org> member states&quot;.</p>\n<p>Foreign investments in critical infrastructure, IT and classified data systems, raw materials and mining, hydropower, and government-owned companies will require mandatory screening under the proposed law.</p>\n<p>The legislation is limited to areas under <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> jurisdiction and does not extend to U.S. military activities on the island, which remain under <location value=\"LC/dk\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Denmark's</location> control.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> has said it has no intention of competing for influence in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >GREENLAND</location> STILL WANTS AMERICAN CAPITAL, MP SAYS</p>\n<p>Last month, <person>Drew Horn</person>, a former senior aide in Trump's first administration, announced plans for a multi-billion-dollar data centre in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> - the kind of project some lawmakers view as underscoring the need for clearer screening rules. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland's</location> government said it has not received any applications or formal requests related to the proposal.</p>\n<p>Horn, who now leads an investment and advisory firm, told Reuters the project had no political ties and that he had no concerns about passing any screening requirements in <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location>.</p>\n<p>&quot;<location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> wants American capital, but we fear hidden political motives behind certain U.S. private investors,&quot; said one member of parliament, speaking anonymously due to the sensitivity of the issue.</p>\n<p>Negotiations between <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> and the U.S. over access and presence on the island are ongoing, with Trump still insisting on \"total access\" to the island.</p>\n<p>Business Minister Naaja Nathanielsen told Reuters the foreign investment screening law was not drafted in response to U.S. interest and that she continued to welcome American investment. </p>\n<p>However, if negotiations between the U.S. and <location value=\"LC/gl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Greenland</location> broke down, she said, &quot;then of course we would need to reevaluate our position.

            "description": "\n<p class=\"bwalignc\">\n<i>Latest feature detects anomalous behavior in backup environments, identifying credential-based threats before they become catastrophic breaches</i>\n\n</p>\n<p>    <location value=\"LU/us.ma.burltn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >BURLINGTON, Mass.</location>--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\n<org value=\"NABL.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >N-able, Inc.</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='NABL' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( NABL )</span> , a global cybersecurity company delivering business resilience, today expanded its Anomaly Detection capabilities in Cove Data Protection to combat the surge in identity-driven cyberattacks targeting backup environments. The new functionality delivers real-time alerts when suspicious or unauthorized changes to backup policies are detected – giving customers an early warning system against the credential-based tactics attackers use to disable or corrupt backups before deploying ransomware.\n\n</p><p>\nIdentity-based attacks have become a major driver of successful cyberattacks, with AI making these schemes even more convincing. With stolen or phished credentials, attackers can gain access to backup software and weaken backup policies. The 2025 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report found that roughly 88% of basic web application breaches involved stolen credentials, making it clear how widespread this tactic has become. Once inside, attackers – and sometimes well-intentioned employees - can alter retention policies, exclude critical data from backups, and delete protected devices. These are subtle changes that can go unnoticed for weeks or even months before the attacker triggers the final ransomware event.\n\n</p><p>\nTo give IT teams real-time visibility, Anomaly Detection introduces a vital layer of protection through event-based notifications that highlight these indicators of compromise. This capability notifies users of potential cyberattack signals or misconfigurations before they escalate, allowing organizations to take just-in-time action to safeguard their recovery posture and maintain data resilience. This new capability builds on last year’s Anomaly Detection feature, Honeypots, an always-on defense mechanism designed to detect brute-force attacks on backup infrastructure.\n\n</p><p>\n“It’s no longer just active systems under attack – backups are firmly in the crosshairs,” says <person>Neil Douglas</person>, CIO at Network ROI, a UK-based managed IT services provider. “If attackers gain access to the backup platform, they don’t always strike immediately. They can quietly manipulate backups, alter retention policies, or delete servers, then sit undetected for weeks (or even months). When they finally launch their attack, recovery can be impossible. In the past, we had no visibility into those subtle changes happening behind the scenes. Now, with real-time, event-based alerts for even the smallest alteration, we know the moment something suspicious occurs. That not only protects us from malicious actors but also guards against accidental misconfigurations. It’s a powerful step forward in strengthening our overall data resilience.”\n\n</p><p>\n“A new wave of threats is targeting businesses through stolen identities,” said <person>Chris Groot</person>, General Manager of Cove Data Protection. “Real-time alerts to backup policy changes give customers peace of mind by protecting them from risky changes that could affect recovery, whether that change was caused by attackers or employees. By catching these changes as they happen, organizations can stop identity-driven attacks and misconfigurations before recovery is compromised.\"\n\n</p><p>\nTo learn more about how Anomaly Detection can strengthen your organization’s data resilience, visit our blog.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>About N-able</b>\n\n</p><p>\nN-able protects businesses from evolving cyberthreats.

We believe that NVDA's growth is being supported by rising hyperscaler capex (over half of sales), but we think investors need to see greater signs of successful AI monetization from its customer base in a year where CEO Jensen Huang sees Agentic AI at an inflection point. The bar undoubtedly increases, as NVDA makes the case that compute equals revenue for their customers to justify the higher spend. We do expect sequential growth to slow in 2H (tougher comps) but think this is already discounted in shares, while Physical AI/Sovereign AI offers long term upside.

            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >WASHINGTON</location>, <chron>Feb 25</chron> (Reuters) - Outgoing Atlanta Federal Reserve President <person>Raphael Bostic</person> said on Wednesday that the political battles around the Fed are undermining public confidence in the central bank's independence, a &quot;major concern&quot; he said cuts to the heart of U.S. economic performance and the country's standing in the global economy.</p>\n<p>Due ​to finish his term on Friday, Bostic used an essay on ‌the eve of his departure, cast largely as a farewell letter, to warn that U.S. economic strength and standing as a global safe haven &quot;is ⁠not guaranteed. Safeguarding our special status includes protecting the Fed's independence.&quot;</p>\n<p>His comments come a day after President Donald ⁠Trump trumpeted U.S. economic performance in his State of the Union speech but ‌amid broader debate about whether ‌the administration's tariff, immigration and other policies are eroding the country's status or could, over time, endanger the dollar's role as the global ​reserve currency. </p>\n<p>Central bank independence coupled with a commitment to a ‌low-inflation target are policies shared across developed and many developing countries.</p>\n<p>&quot;My travels over the past several months have made clear that the legal and rhetorical battles raging around the central ​bank right now have caused people across a wide ​cross-section of our ‌population to begin to doubt the Fed's independence,&quot; Bostic wrote.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's important that the public understand what is at stake. Decades of lived experience, as well as a large body of academic research, ⁠make clear that a nation's economic outcomes are better when there is an independent central bank. Inflation is ⁠lower, economic performance is more robust, and consumers and businesses alike are more confident that long-run investments will be worth making.&quot;</p>\n<p>Though his letter did not mention President <person>Donald Trump</person> or the Trump administration by name, the &quot;legal and rhetorical battles&quot; have included efforts by the president to fire Fed Governor <person>Lisa Cook</person>, a still-ongoing investigation of Fed ⁠Chair Jerome Powell ‌by the <org>Department of Justice</org>, and frequent public demands by Trump for lower ‌interest rates.</p>\n<p>Powell earlier this year called out the DOJ investigation as an effort to pressure him on monetary policy, ⁠an unusual rebuke of the president by a Fed chair.</p>\n<p>Other Fed officials and global central bankers have rallied behind Powell, citing as did Bostic the risks the U.S. would be taking if the Fed's standing was compromised. </p>\n<p>Trump has nominated former Fed Governor <person>Kevin Warsh</person> to become Fed chair when Powell's term expires in May, though his confirmation has been complicated by pushback from Republican senators who objected to the DOJ's probe of Powell and said they would block Warsh's confirmation until the ​matter is clarified.</p>\n<p>The situation has also left Warsh, Bostic said in an interview with Reuters this week, with the task of proving he will act independently of the president as Fed chair.</p>\n<p>&quot;One thing we'll see is how, to ​the extent that there is pressure, ... he responds ‌to it. We won't know until we know on this,&quot; Bostic said. </p>\n<p>(Reporting by ​Howard Schneider; Editing by <person>Andrea Ricci</person>)</p>\n",

Without regular application of these coatings, engines cannot be used.</p>\n<p>Since Reuters first reported about yttrium shortages in November, prices have jumped 60% and are now about 69 times as high as a year ago. Some coatings manufacturers are also now starting to ration material, according to company executives and traders.</p>\n<p>Executives at two North American firms that buy yttrium to make coatings told Reuters they have needed to temporarily pause production due to shortages. One is also now turning away smaller and offshore customers in order to conserve supply for larger clients, which include certain engine makers.</p>\n<p>Another firm in the coating supply chain recently ran out of material and stopped selling products containing yttrium oxide, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>\n<p>While shortages of yttrium and scandium have not weighed on production of jet engines or chips yet, a U.S. government official told Reuters some U.S. manufacturers now face &quot;shortages&quot; of certain rare earths from <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> exported 17 tons of yttrium products to the U.S. in the eight months after controls were introduced last April versus 333 tons in the eight months before the measures.</p>\n<p>A <org>White House</org> official said the Trump administration is committed to ensuring access to critical minerals for all U.S. businesses. </p>\n<p>&quot;This includes negotiating with <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> and monitoring compliance with President Trump's agreement with President Xi, as well as developing alternative supply chains as warranted.&quot;</p>\n<p>Reuters spoke with two U.S. government officials, 14 company executives and staff, traders and analysts across aerospace and semiconductors. All of them spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity except the analysts named in the story. The North American executives did not want to be named discussing internal production challenges in public. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China's</location> <org>Ministry of Commerce</org> did not respond to questions.</p>\n<p>PRODUCTION PRESSURE </p>\n<p>While low yttrium supplies have not hurt engine production, manufacturers remain concerned, said aerospace supply chain specialist <person>Kevin Michaels</person>.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is a watch item and a tangible example of how <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> is flexing its rare earth muscle,&quot; said Michaels, managing director at U.S. consultant AeroDynamic Advisory. </p>\n<p>Enginemakers are already struggling to meet demand for spare parts from airlines and higher production by planemakers <org value=\"BA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Boeing</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='BA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( BA )</span> and Airbus.</p>\n<p>U.S. aircraft enginemakers <org>GE Aerospace</org>, RTX's Pratt &amp; Whitney and <org value=\"HON.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Honeywell</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='HON' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( HON )</span> declined comment.</p>\n<p>SCARCE SCANDIUM</p>\n<p>In addition to yttrium, U.S. semiconductor makers are running low on scandium, putting production of next-generation 5G chips at risk, said <person>Dylan Patel</person>, founder and CEO of research firm SemiAnalysis. </p>\n<p>With global production of only several tens of tons a year, scandium plays small but important parts in fuel cells, specialty aluminium aerospace alloys and advanced chip processing and packaging.</p>\n<p>Major U.S. semiconductor manufacturers all rely on scandium for making chip components that &quot;go into essentially every 5G smartphone and base station&quot;, Patel said.</p>\n<p>U.S. chipmakers have experienced delays in receiving new scandium export licenses from <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> in recent months and have reached out to <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location> for help, said two industry sources. </p>\n<p>Many of these firms had obtained scandium from third-country suppliers, another U.S. official said, but <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> requires license applicants to declare their end-users.</p>\n<p>&quot;Our thesis is that it is precisely the semi industry being targeted,&quot; the U.S. official said.</p>\n<p><org>The U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association</org> declined to comment.</p>\n<p>&quot;The U.S. currently has zero domestic scandium production and no operational alternative sources outside <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>,&quot; Patel said, adding that stockpiles are likely in months rather than years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Allison Lampert</person> in <location value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Montreal</location>; <person>Laurie Chen</person> and <person>Lewis Jackson</person> in <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location>; <person>Michael Martina</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location>; Additional reporting by <person>Fanny Potkin</person> in <location value=\"LC/sg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Singapore</location>, <person>Ernest Scheyder</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.tx.houstn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Houston</location> and <person>Melanie Burton</person> in <location value=\"LU/au..melbou\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Melbourne</location>; Editing by <person>Sonali Paul</person>)</p>\n",
