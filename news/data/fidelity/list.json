PNTR was first granted in 2000, allowing <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> to join the <org>World Trade Organization</org>, a move that catapulted the country into becoming the world's biggest manufacturer.</p>\n<p>Since his <chron>inauguration day</chron> order, Trump imposed new tariffs on Chinese imports that reached as high as 145% last year, but that had been reduced to around 20% through a series of trade negotiations before the <org>Supreme Court</org> last week ruled Trump's emergency tariffs illegal. </p>\n<p>Trump's punitive <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> duties sit on top of the normal &quot;Most Favored Nation&quot; duties of about 2.5% that prevailed before he launched a trade war on <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> during his first term, imposing tariffs of about 25% on most Chinese imports.</p>\n<p>Revoking PNTR would raise the base MFN rates, adding to whatever punitive duties Trump imposes to replace the illegal emergency tariffs under other trade authorities. </p>\n<p>The USITC, which studies trade and competitiveness matters and rules on anti-dumping and anti-subsidy trade cases, said its report would focus on U.S. trade, production and prices in the industries that could be directly and most affected by increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to the higher non-MFN rates.</p>\n<p>The panel said it would also examine an alternative scenario where <org>Congress</org> revokes PNTR treatment with a five-year phase-in of a subset of tariffs on products important for national security.</p>\n<p>The USITC said the public was invited to file written comments on the implications of raising these tariffs on Chinese imports, through the close of business on <chron>April 13</chron>. Due to the accelerated timeline, the commission said it does not plan to hold a public hearing.</p>\n<p>(Reporting by <person>David Lawder</person>, <person>Daphne Psaledakis</person> and <person>Bhargav Acharya</person>; Editing by <person>David Ljunggren</person> and <person>Mark Porter</person>)</p>\n",

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>After reviewing Q1 FY 26 earnings, we increase our 12-month target price by <money>CAD18</money> to <money>CAD151</money>, 14.8x our FY 27 (Oct.) EPS view of <money>CAD10.22</money>, above the peer average P/E of 13.1x, as superior credit quality and improving efficiency outweigh headwinds stemming from the asset cap on TD's two U.S. banking subsidiaries. We raise our FY 26 EPS estimate to <money>CAD9.37</money> from <money>CAD9.04</money> and increase FY 27's to <money>CAD10.22</money> from <money>CAD9.64</money>. While credit quality is weakening industry-wide, TD's recent results are encouraging. Gross impaired loans have risen only modestly in recent quarters. TD still trails peers on efficiency but is making progress as its adjusted efficiency ratio improved 190 bps Y/Y to 57.1% in Q1 FY 26. Return on equity (ROE) also improved 100 bps to 14.2%. Additional ROE gains should come readily as TD plans to reduce its CET1 ratio from 14.5% to approximately 13% by 2H FY 27, which would add another 100 bps to ROE. Shares yield a healthy 3.1%.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice. Unauthorized reproduction is strictly prohibited.</p>\n",

            "description": "\n<p><chron>03:40 PM EST</chron>, <chron>02/26/2026</chron> (MT Newswires) -- CFRA, an independent research provider, has provided MT Newswires with the following research alert. Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>After reviewing Q1 2026 earnings, we increase our 12-month target price by <money>USD15</money> to <money>USD110</money>, 14.8x our FY 27 (Oct.) EPS view of <money>CAD10.22</money>, above the peer average P/E of 13.1x, as superior credit quality and improving efficiency outweigh headwinds stemming from the asset cap on TD's two U.S. banking subsidiaries. We raise our FY 26 EPS estimate to <money>CAD9.37</money> from <money>CAD9.04</money> and increase FY 27's to <money>CAD10.22</money> from <money>CAD9.64</money>. While credit quality is weakening industry-wide, TD's recent results are encouraging. Gross impaired loans have risen only modestly in recent quarters. TD still trails peers on efficiency but is making progress as its adjusted efficiency ratio improved 190 bps Y/Y to 57.1% in Q1 FY 26. Return on equity (ROE) also improved 100 bps to 14.2%. Additional ROE gains should come readily as TD plans to reduce its CET1 ratio from 14.5% to approximately 13% by 2H FY 27, which would add another 100 bps to ROE. Shares yield a healthy 3.1%.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice. Unauthorized reproduction is strictly prohibited.</p>\n",

In 2025 alone, the number jumped to 135, with about 16% of them complaints about issues such as shipment delays and increased regulatory burdens. The rate of complaints nearly doubled in early 2026.</p>\n<p>The actual number of queries from exporters is likely to be  orders of magnitude larger as there are several private channels these companies can use, including contacting provincial and municipal commerce bureaux, many of which do not have public query platforms like the central government's commerce ministry.</p>\n<p>The official responses to the queries from Chinese exporters have been vague and formulaic, stopping short of confirming whether any individual product, from rare-earth magnets to medical materials, required a licence.</p>\n<p>The enforcement push is also legal and bureaucratic. Since <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> enacted its Export Control Law in <chron>October 2020</chron>, it has introduced or expanded export control measures 29 times, compared to just six times between 2015-2020.</p>\n<p>Recruitment documents show 45 commerce ministry posts available in this year's national civil-service examination could be assigned to export-control-related work, compared with 11 such vacancies in both 2022 and 2023. </p>\n<p>Dozens of provincial and municipal governments have organised compliance seminars and policy briefings over the past year, while <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location> has convened national export-control work conferences bringing officials from across the country to the capital.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing's</location> <chron>October 2025</chron> revision to its rare-earth export-control regime reflected lessons from the U.S. Foreign Direct Product Rule, which allows <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location> to assert jurisdiction over certain foreign-made goods produced with American technology.</p>\n<p>&quot;<location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China's</location> use of rare earths as leverage is completely learned from the West - especially the U.S.,&quot; said <person>Li Xing</person>, professor at the <org>Guangdong Institute for International Strategies</org>, a think tank in <location value=\"LU/cn..gngzhu\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Guangzhou</location>. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> dominates the processing of rare earths, the conversion of ore into refined oxides and metals used in electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence systems, a chokepoint deeper in the supply chain than mining itself. </p>\n<p>Its new licensing system reaches into processing and downstream incorporation.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is not just a supply chain shortage. This is economic warfare,&quot; said <person>Nick Myers</person>, chief executive of U.S. rare-earth startup Phoenix Tailings.</p>\n<p>PACE OF U.S. EXPORT CONTROLS SLOWS</p>\n<p>During Trump's first term and under President <person>Joe Biden</person>, <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location> rapidly expanded export controls targeting <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>.</p>\n<p>Annual <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>-related additions to the Entity List, which requires U.S. exporters to obtain licences, often reviewed under a presumption of denial, surged from 47 in 2018 to 227 in 2020, reaching a record 257 in 2024, according to a Reuters analysis.  </p>\n<p>Since Trump's return to office, that trajectory has reversed. <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>-related Entity List additions fell to 131 in 2025, roughly half the previous year's pace.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, the Pentagon briefly published, then withdrew, an updated Military End User list that would have added Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Baidu while removing a couple of memory chipmakers.</p>\n<p>The <org>White House</org> and the <org>U.S. Commerce Department's</org> <org>Bureau of Industry and Security</org> did not respond to requests for comment. A Pentagon official said the list was removed as it may require changes based on new information and that an updated list would be published, without further elaborating.</p>\n<p>The moderation has drawn criticism from bipartisan U.S. lawmakers, who have faulted the administration for approving certain Nvidia AI chip exports and cutting BIS funding. </p>\n<p>A <org value=\"NVDA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Nvidia</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='NVDA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( NVDA )</span> spokesperson said in a statement that criticism of the current administration's decision to greenlight these semiconductor shipments to <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> was unintentionally promoting the interests of foreign competitors.</p>\n<p>&quot;America should always want its industry to compete for vetted and approved commercial businesses, and thereby protecting national security, creating American jobs, and keeping America's lead in AI,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p>\n<p><org value=\"NVDA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Nvidia</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='NVDA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( NVDA )</span> CEO Jensen Huang, who criticised Biden-era controls, said last year that &quot;export control was a failure&quot; and that Trump &quot;realises it's exactly the wrong goal.&quot; </p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Eduardo Baptista</person>; Editing by <person>Miyoung Kim</person> and <person>Jamie Freed</person>)</p>\n",

We believe the emergence of prediction markets will accelerate the path to state regulation of online sports betting and iGaming,&quot; Jackson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jackson called prediction markets the &quot;most valuable long-term opportunity in the U.S.&quot;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Flutter CEO said prediction markets will grow the total addressable market and help increase the reach of sports markets to users in states without legal online sportsbook options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&quot;We are exceptionally well-positioned to harness this opportunity given the nationwide strength of the FanDuel brand and our sports betting expertise.&quot;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The comments are similar to those of sportsbook company<strong> <org value=\"DKNG.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >DraftKings Inc</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='DKNG' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( DKNG )</span> </strong>, which highlighted prediction markets as a growth opportunity and not as a competitive threat.

            "description": "\n<p><location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >BEIJING</location>, <chron>Feb 27</chron> (Reuters) - Almost a year after <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> expanded rare-earth export controls ostensibly aimed at preventing their use by foreign militaries, exporters are still asking a basic question: when does a small magnet turn an everyday product into a controlled item?</p>\n<p>Makers of products ranging from pill boxes, printed billboards, motor components and optical glass are among the growing number of companies that have queried the commerce ministry over whether they require export licences.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location> is expanding export enforcement manpower and imposing compliance nationwide, even as it raises costs for domestic firms and makes it harder for them to ship goods. </p>\n<p>A Reuters review of over 200 public export-control compliance enquiries to <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China's</location> commerce ministry between 2019 and the start of this month showed a stark surge after rare-earth controls were tightened last April.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location> has eased some export restrictions on products like advanced artificial-intelligence chips during President <person>Donald Trump's</person> second term, after <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China's</location> curbs on rare earths exports threatened to hobble global supply chains spanning autos, technology, energy, aerospace, and defence.</p>\n<p>The export controls on both sides are expected to be in sharp focus as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping meet in <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location> in late March for their second in-person talks since Trump returned to office, setting up a high-stakes test of whether a fragile trade truce between the world's two largest economies can hold.</p>\n<p>&quot;What we are seeing in <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> is ... the rapid construction of a comprehensive export-control apparatus designed to weaponize chokepoints across strategic and non-strategic sectors,&quot; said <person>Alfredo Montufar-Helu</person>, a <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location>-based managing director at <org>Ankura Consulting</org>. &quot;That the U.S. is reining in some of its controls is a direct acknowledgement of <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China's</location> growing leverage.&quot;</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China's</location> commerce ministry did not respond to a request for comment. </p>\n<p>EXPORT COMPLIANCE QUERIES JUMP</p>\n<p>Exporters have flooded the Chinese commerce ministry's website with urgent compliance questions: whether magnetic sheets cross rare-earth thresholds; whether gallium nitride chips are restricted; whether ultraviolet medical equipment counts as controlled technology.</p>\n<p>From 2019 through 2024, only 43 export-control compliance enquiries were posted publicly. In 2025 alone, the number jumped to 135, with about 16% of them complaints about issues such as shipment delays and increased regulatory burdens. The rate of complaints nearly doubled in early 2026.</p>\n<p>The actual number of queries from exporters is likely to be  orders of magnitude larger as there are several private channels these companies can use, including contacting provincial and municipal commerce bureaux, many of which do not have public query platforms like the central government's commerce ministry.</p>\n<p>The official responses to the queries from Chinese exporters have been vague and formulaic, stopping short of confirming whether any individual product, from rare-earth magnets to medical materials, required a licence.</p>\n<p>The enforcement push is also legal and bureaucratic. Since <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> enacted its Export Control Law in <chron>October 2020</chron>, it has introduced or expanded export control measures 29 times, compared to just six times between 2015-2020.</p>\n<p>Recruitment documents show 45 commerce ministry posts available in this year's national civil-service examination could be assigned to export-control-related work, compared with 11 such vacancies in both 2022 and 2023. </p>\n<p>Dozens of provincial and municipal governments have organised compliance seminars and policy briefings over the past year, while <location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing</location> has convened national export-control work conferences bringing officials from across the country to the capital.</p>\n<p><location value=\"LU/cn..beijng\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Beijing's</location> <chron>October 2025</chron> revision to its rare-earth export-control regime reflected lessons from the U.S. Foreign Direct Product Rule, which allows <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location> to assert jurisdiction over certain foreign-made goods produced with American technology.</p>\n<p>&quot;<location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China's</location> use of rare earths as leverage is completely learned from the West - especially the U.S.,&quot; said <person>Li Xing</person>, professor at the <org>Guangdong Institute for International Strategies</org>, a think tank in <location value=\"LU/cn..gngzhu\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Guangzhou</location>. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> dominates the processing of rare earths, the conversion of ore into refined oxides and metals used in electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence systems, a chokepoint deeper in the supply chain than mining itself. </p>\n<p>Its new licensing system reaches into processing and downstream incorporation.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is not just a supply chain shortage. This is economic warfare,&quot; said <person>Nick Myers</person>, chief executive of U.S. rare-earth startup Phoenix Tailings.</p>\n<p>PACE OF U.S. EXPORT CONTROLS SLOWS</p>\n<p>During Trump's first term and under President <person>Joe Biden</person>, <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location> rapidly expanded export controls targeting <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>.</p>\n<p>Annual <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>-related additions to the Entity List, which requires U.S. exporters to obtain licences, often reviewed under a presumption of denial, surged from 47 in 2018 to 227 in 2020, reaching a record 257 in 2024, according to a Reuters analysis.  </p>\n<p>Since Trump's return to office, that trajectory has reversed. <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location>-related Entity List additions fell to 131 in 2025, roughly half the previous year's pace.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, the Pentagon briefly published, then withdrew, an updated Military End User list that would have added Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Baidu while removing a couple of memory chipmakers.</p>\n<p>The <org>White House</org> and the <org>U.S. Commerce Department's</org> <org>Bureau of Industry and Security</org> did not respond to requests for comment. A Pentagon official said the list was removed as it may require changes based on new information and that an updated list would be published, without further elaborating.</p>\n<p>The moderation has drawn criticism from bipartisan U.S. lawmakers, who have faulted the administration for approving certain Nvidia AI chip exports and cutting BIS funding. </p>\n<p>A <org value=\"NVDA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Nvidia</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='NVDA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( NVDA )</span> spokesperson said in a statement that criticism of the current administration's decision to greenlight these semiconductor shipments to <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> was unintentionally promoting the interests of foreign competitors.</p>\n<p>&quot;America should always want its industry to compete for vetted and approved commercial businesses, and thereby protecting national security, creating American jobs, and keeping America's lead in AI,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p>\n<p><org value=\"NVDA.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Nvidia</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='NVDA' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( NVDA )</span> CEO Jensen Huang, who criticised Biden-era controls, said last year that &quot;export control was a failure&quot; and that Trump &quot;realises it's exactly the wrong goal.&quot; </p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Eduardo Baptista</person>; Editing by <person>Miyoung Kim</person> and <person>Jamie Freed</person>)</p>\n",

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>TLN reported strong Q4 and full-year 2025 results, with adjusted EBITDA rising 34% to <money>$1.04B</money>, due to capacity revenues surging 153% to <money>$485M</money> and energy revenues increasing 14% to <money>$2.14B</money>. Adjusted FCF expanded 85% to <money>$524M</money> despite higher capex, while total generation grew 10% to 39.9 TWh. The company completed transformational <money>$3.8B</money> acquisitions of Freedom and Guernsey assets adding 2.8 GW of baseload capacity, with an additional <money>$3.45B</money> Cornerstone deal announced for 2.5 GW. TLN expanded its Amazon PPA to 1,920 MW and maintained disciplined hedging with 90% of 2026 and 40% of 2027 generation volumes hedged. We view the strategic acquisitions as enhancing TLN's competitive position in PJM markets while the expanded Amazon partnership provides long-term revenue visibility. Total assets increased to <money>$10.91B</money> from <money>$6.11B</money>, with long-term debt rising to <money>$6.78B</money> from <money>$3.00B</money> reflecting acquisition financing, though the enhanced scale should support stronger cash generation.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.
