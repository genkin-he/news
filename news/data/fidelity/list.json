Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We lower our 12-month target price by <money>$25</money> to <money>$65</money>, applying an EV/revenue multiple of 2.3x to our FY 27 (Jan.) estimate, a discount to its three-year historical average multiple at 3.7x. We raise our FY 27 EPS estimate by <money>$0.04</money> to <money>$5.91</money> and set FY 28's at <money>$6.12</money>. The Online business, while stabilizing, continues to see only slight growth, and guidance suggests that this segment will remain relatively flat, with only modest increases anticipated for FY 27. The company noted that price increases are not expected to be an ongoing lever for growth, indicating that future revenue improvement will rely more heavily on adding value and product innovation rather than pricing actions. Finally, the ongoing transition from on-prem to cloud for large enterprise customers remains incomplete, with approximately 150 million seats still on-prem. This indicates a slower migration pace and ongoing challenges in capturing full market potential.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

In our view, every OPEC+ producer is essentially maxed out with the sole exception of <location value=\"LC/sa\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Saudi Arabia</location>. Hence, the barrel impact of any headline OPEC+ increase tomorrow will be limited by the lack of actual production capabilities.&quot;</p>\n<p><person>JORGE LEON</person>, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND HEAD OF GEOPOLITICAL ANALYSIS AT RYSTAD ENERGY:  </p>\n<p>&quot;Alternative infrastructure in the <location value=\"LR/mde\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Middle East</location> can be used to bypass the Strait's flows, but the net impact remains an effective loss of 8-10 million bpd of crude oil supply,&quot; in a global market that uses about 100 million bpd. </p>\n<p>&quot;Nations with strategic petroleum reserves may take action and release volumes if the disruption of the Strait risks being extended. Unless de-escalation signals emerge swiftly, we expect a significant upward repricing of oil at the start of the week.&quot;</p>\n<p>ENERGY ANALYSTS AT EURASIA GROUP:</p>\n<p>&quot;Oil prices will rise sharply when markets open. Should the conflict continue into Sunday, oil prices are likely to respond by increasing by <money>$5-10</money> above the current <money>$73</money> baseline, based on <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran's</location> claim to have closed the <location>Strait of Hormuz</location> and the disruption in tanker traffic.&quot;</p>\n<p>ENERGY ANALYSTS AT BARCLAYS:</p>\n<p>&quot;Oil markets might have to face their worst fears on Monday. As things stand right now, we think Brent could hit <money>$100</money> (per barrel), as the market grapples with the threat of a potential supply disruption amid a spiralling security situation in the <location value=\"LR/mde\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Middle East</location>.&quot;</p>\n<p>VISHNU VARATHAN, HEAD OF MACRO RESEARCH, <person>ASIA EX-JAPAN</person>, MIZUHO, <location value=\"LC/sg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >SINGAPORE</location>:</p>\n<p>&quot;A broader state of spots of regional attacks/instability may be par for the course - in line with <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran's</location> warning. Oil prices are likely to remain elevated as production and passage remain prone to attacks and disruptions. <org>OPEC</org> may be under pressure to raise production to try and offset. But a 10-25% premium on oil is not outlandish - even without a blockade of the <location>Strait of Hormuz</location>, which is easily a 50% premium risk event.&quot;</p>\n<p><person>CHRISTOPHER WONG</person>, STRATEGIST, OCBC, <location value=\"LC/sg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >SINGAPORE</location>:</p>\n<p>&quot;The strike raises geopolitical risk premia as markets head into Monday's open. The immediate reaction function is fairly predictable: safe-haven assets such as gold are likely to see an upside gap, while oil prices may also firm on supply-disruption concerns. Risk assets and high-beta currencies ... could face an initial bout of volatility, particularly if headlines suggest potential retaliation or regional spillovers.&quot;</p>\n<p><person>NICK FERRES</person>, CIO, VANTAGE POINT ASSET MANAGEMENT, <location value=\"LC/sg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >SINGAPORE</location>:</p>\n<p>&quot;Energy is still inexpensive.

Berkshire has not repurchased its own stock since the spring of 2024.</p>\n<p>&quot;I recognize how you want us to succeed together, and to do so in the right way,&quot; Abel wrote in an 18-page, single-spaced letter. &quot;My role is to ensure our liquidity levels and capital deployment remain intentional and deliberate.&quot;</p>\n<p>Abel also paid homage to Buffett, 95, who remains chairman and goes to Berkshire's offices five days a week, calling him a &quot;remarkable&quot; CEO.</p>\n<p>&quot;<person>Warren Buffett</person> is arguably the greatest investor of all time, with generations benefiting from his investment acumen,&quot; Abel wrote. &quot;To invest in Berkshire has long been a vote of trust in our founder - a trust that now rests with Berkshire.&quot;</p>\n<p>Berkshire shares have significantly underperformed the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index since Buffett announced unexpectedly in May he was stepping aside as CEO.</p>\n<p>Though Abel's letter lacked Buffett's writing flair, <org>CFRA Research</org> analyst <person>Cathy Seifert</person> said it might prove reassuring to investors.</p>\n<p>&quot;He needed to show a degree of continuity, that the Berkshire franchise would continue despite the change in leadership, and it would be business as usual,&quot; she said. &quot;In my opinion, he hit the mark.&quot;</p>\n<p>The letter also signaled that Abel wouldn't upend Buffett's 60 years of work transforming Berkshire from a failing textile company into a more than <money>$1 trillion</money> conglomerate that owns car insurer Geico, BNSF railroad and dozens of other insurance, manufacturing, energy and retail businesses.</p>\n<p>&quot;If there were any doubts about whether Greg was the right individual to take the reins, the letter should dispel them,&quot; said <person>Dan Hanson</person>, who oversees more than <money>$6 billion</money> as head of the quality equity team at Neuberger Berman. </p>\n<p>PROFIT DECLINES</p>\n<p>Berkshire also reported declining profit, after taking writedowns for its approximately 27% stakes in both Kraft Heinz and oil company Occidental Petroleum.</p>\n<p>Fourth-quarter operating profit fell 30% to <money>$10.2 billion</money> as income from insurance operations such as Geico declined.</p>\n<p>Net income fell 3% to <money>$19.2 billion</money>, reflecting a <money>$4.5 billion</money> writedown for Occidental, despite gains from equity holdings led by <org value=\"AAPL.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Apple</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AAPL' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AAPL )</span> and <org value=\"AXP.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >American Express</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AXP' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AXP )</span>.</p>\n<p>For all of 2025, operating profit fell 6% to <money>$44.49 billion</money>, while net income fell 25% to <money>$66.97 billion</money>. Buffett had long urged investors to ignore fluctuations in Berkshire's net income, which reflect accounting rules for equity investments.</p>\n<p>Full-year revenue was essentially unchanged at <money>$371.44 billion</money>, and Seifert said Abel &quot;teed up an expectation that reinsurance and commercial insurance growth may be nonexistent&quot; in 2026.&quot;</p>\n<p>One of Berkshire's best-known businesses, Fruit of the Loom, shed 6,000 jobs last year as revenue fell, Berkshire said.</p>\n<p>WILDFIRE-BATTERED PACIFICORP UTILITY 'NOT A DEEP POCKET'</p>\n<p>Abel said Berkshire's culture and values will continue &quot;in perpetuity,&quot; and signaled no changes in its decentralized structure in which its dozens of businesses operate largely without interference from the top.</p>\n<p>He also signaled a willingness to stick around, suggesting that in 20 years he will have had &quot;just a fraction of the tenure that Warren had.&quot;</p>\n<p>Abel pledged to invest in durable, well-managed businesses that Berkshire understands and &quot;avoid businesses that undermine the fabric of society or could jeopardize Berkshire's reputation.&quot;</p>\n<p>He didn't elaborate, but Seifert said he could have been referring to artificial intelligence. </p>\n<p>Abel acknowledged pressures on its PacifiCorp utility from litigation over <location value=\"LS/us.or\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Oregon</location> and <location value=\"LS/us.ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >California</location> wildfires that burned more than 500,000 acres in 2020.</p>\n<p>Many victims blame PacifiCorp, saying it failed to shut off power lines. The utility has reached more than <money>$2.2 billion</money> of settlements, but faces <money>$50 billion</money> of additional wildfire claims. Abel said Berkshire accepts responsibility when it causes wildfires, but will fight unjustified claims in court.</p>\n<p>&quot;PacifiCorp is not an insurer of last resort and should not be treated as a deep pocket,&quot; Abel said. &quot;Accountability, paired with principled opposition to unwarranted liability, is essential to preserving the regulatory compact that governs utilities.&quot; </p>\n<p>TED WESCHLER STAYS ON</p>\n<p>Abel was more critical than Buffett of Berkshire businesses that could perform better.</p>\n<p>He said the performance gap between BNSF and industry-leading rivals is &quot;too wide,&quot; while &quot;self-inflicted&quot; difficulties at the Shaw flooring company hurt quality and service.</p>\n<p>&quot;Each business is accountable to its CEO, who is expected to pursue operational excellence relentlessly and close performance gaps,&quot; Abel said, referring to Berkshire's non-insurance businesses.</p>\n<p>Hanson, the Neuberger Berman investment manager, said: &quot;Those are fighting words.&quot;</p>\n<p>Berkshire has not named a chief investment officer to replace Buffett, though Abel said responsibility for equity investments &quot;ultimately resides with me as CEO.&quot;</p>\n<p>Abel signaled that longtime portfolio manager <person>Ted Weschler</person>, who manages about 6% of Berkshire's equity investments, will continue playing a &quot;broader role&quot; assessing significant investment opportunities and supporting Berkshire in other ways.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Jonathan Stempel</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >New York</location>, Editing by <person>Megan Davies</person>, <person>Louise Heavens</person> and <person>Cynthia Osterman</person>)</p>\n",

            "title": "Here's how bitcoin's price rise could be fueled by job-stealing AI software",
            "description": "\n<p>Bitcoin’s future in an artificial intelligence-driven world may depend less on code and more on central banks.</p><p>In a new note, <person>Greg Cipolaro</person>, global head of research at financial services and infrastructure firm NYDIG, argued that artificial intelligence will affect bitcoin mainly through macroeconomic channels and its impact on the labor market.</p><p>The key variables are growth, employment, real interest rates and liquidity. Bitcoin, he writes, sits downstream of those forces.</p><p>If automation cuts jobs and wages, consumer demand could weaken and, in a severe case, falling incomes would strain debt payments and pressure asset prices.</p><p>Those fears appear to be well-grounded. Just this week, Jack Dorsey’s fintech firm Block unveiled its shrinking back toward its pre-pandemic size, cutting staff by about 40%. Dorsey cited AI-enabled efficiency for the job cuts, something that was theorized in Citrini's research on the AI-doom that spooked the market this week. </p><p>In such a scenario, policymakers might respond with lower rates or fiscal spending to stabilize the economy. That wave of liquidity could support bitcoin, which has often tracked shifts in global money supply.</p><p>A different outcome would look less friendly for the cryptocurrency. If AI boosts productivity and economic growth without major job losses, real yields could rise, and central banks might keep policy tight.</p><p>Higher real rates have historically weighed on bitcoin by raising the opportunity cost of holding it and making risk assets less attractive.</p><h2><strong>Shift in demand</strong></h2><p>Anxiety around AI echoes past moments of upheaval in Human society.</p><p>The steam engine displaced manual labor in factories and on farms. Electrification then rewired entire industries. Later, computers and the internet automated clerical work and reshaped retail, media and finance.</p><p>Each wave triggered fears of permanent job loss. In the early 1900s, factory mechanization sparked labor unrest as machines replaced skilled craftsmen. In the 1980s and 1990s, personal computers cut typist pools and back-office staff. More recently, e-commerce helped hollow out brick-and-mortar retail roles.</p><p>Yet aggregate demand did not collapse. Productivity rose. New industries absorbed displaced workers, even if the transition proved uneven and painful. Nowadays, we have industries that were unthinkable before the dawn of the internet. Think cloud computing.</p><p>Cipolaro argued AI may follow a similar pattern. As a general-purpose technology, it requires firms to redesign workflows and invest in complementary tools. Over time, that process tends to expand productive capacity rather than shrink it.</p><p>“The implication is not that disruption will be painless, but that the equilibrium response to new technology has historically been integration, not obsolescence,” Cipolaro wrote. “Society's response to AI will likely follow the same pattern.”</p><p>For bitcoin, that distinction matters. If AI ultimately lifts long-term growth, the structural backdrop could differ from the short-term shocks that often drive liquidity injections.</p><p>Meanwhile, adoption may also rise thanks to agentic payments, which would essentially see software pay other pieces of software without human involvement. One of Bitcoin’s earliest visions centered on machine-to-machine payments, and AI may be the necessary tool to make them a reality.</p><p>Still, incentives aren’t currently there for a widespread rollout. Credit cards bundle rewards and short-term credit, features that stablecoins do not yet match, Cipolaro noted.</p><p>Ultimately, while the rise of AI brings new challenges, what matters is the human response to the disruption it brings. If AI triggers a deflationary shock and forces the money printer to turn back on, or if it fuels a productivity boom that raises real yields, bitcoin will reflect that.</p>\n",

            "description": "\n<p><chron>04:15 PM EST</chron>, <chron>02/27/2026</chron> (MT Newswires) -- <org>The Toronto Stock Exchange</org> slumped Friday, mostly on some profit taking after it set six record closes over the prior seven sessions, but losses on the resources-heavy index were capped by higher commodity prices, while investors continue to welcome news of a swing in foreign direct investment into a rare surplus.</p><p>The S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index closed down 161.97 points, or 0.5%, to 34,339.99,  falling off the 17th record close of 2026 set Thursday, with sectors mixed over Friday's session. For a second successive day, Info Tech led decliners , down 2.5%, while Financials was down near 2%. Telecom led gainers, up 1.65%, with Energy, up 1.15% and the Battery Metals Index, up 1.1%, next.</p><p><org>BMO Capital Markets</org> Chief Economist <person>Douglas Porter</person> in his regular Friday 'Talking Points' note noted even as the Canadian economy remains &quot;challenged by relentless trade uncertainty&quot;, the TSX continues to &quot;find its own path&quot;. Prior to Friday's stumble, the index managed to rise more than 1% this week to hit an record high above 34,500 and was up 8% in the first two months of the year. Porter noted a rebound in gold and firmer oil prices assisted, but Q1 bank earnings were also &quot;greeted favourably&quot;. He also noted economy-wide profits rose more than 6% in 2025, topping nominal GDP growth of 4.3% on the year. More broadly, <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> may be benefitting from a diversification push away from U.S. markets, where valuations are rich, Porter said.</p><p>Porter cited as just as one small sample of the shift into <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> in the past year a &quot;welcome&quot; swing in foreign direct investment into a rare surplus. For Q4 alone, quarterly net FDI inflows were <money>$11.6 billion</money>, driven by M&amp;A activity. Looking at the four-quarter trend reveals that for the first time in more than a decade, and only the second time in the past 18 years, <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> had a net inflow in FDI in 2025 of <money>$17.3 billion</money>, Porter noted. For perspective, Porter said that alone would have funded more than half of the current account deficit of <money>$30.4 billion</money> last year. He noted there are three major types of FDI: M&amp;A, greenfield investments, and reinvested earnings. In 2025, the latter remained in a large outflow position of <money>$47 billion</money> &quot;and is normally in a deficit because of <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada's</location> large stock of outstanding investments abroad&quot; while M&amp;A was in a large offsetting surplus. Net new FDI investments were, thus,  in a surplus of <money>$17.6 billion</money> for the year, &quot;which is encouraging news for an economy looking for new growth avenues&quot;, Porter added.</p><p>Of commodities, gold rose to the highest in a month Friday following a report U.S. wholesale inflation rose above expectations in January. Gold for April delivery was last seen up <money>US$86.50</money> to to <money>US$5,280.70</money> per ounce, the highest since the record close of <money>US$5,354.80</money> on <chron>Jan. 29</chron>.</p><p>Also, West Texas Intermediate crude oil rose to a six-month high as a third round of talks between the U.S. and <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location> ended with an agreement to meet again next week amid reports <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location> is balking at U.S. demands it abandon its uranium enrichment program, raising worries President Trump will decide to strike at the OPEC+ member.

Oil prices are likely to remain elevated as production and passage remain prone to attacks and disruptions. <org>OPEC</org> may be under pressure to raise production to try and offset.

The immediate reaction function is fairly predictable: safe-haven assets such as gold are likely to see an upside gap, while oil prices may also firm on supply-disruption concerns. Risk assets and high-beta currencies... could face an initial bout of volatility, particularly if headlines suggest potential retaliation or regional spillovers.&quot;</p>\n<p><person>NICK FERRES</person>, CIO, VANTAGE POINT ASSET MANAGEMENT, <location value=\"LC/sg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >SINGAPORE</location>:</p>\n<p>&quot;Energy is still inexpensive.

If the Iranian regime feel they face an existential threat, attempts to block the <location>Strait of Hormuz</location> cannot be ruled out. The US and allies will have military escort plans to try protect passage through the Strait.</p>\n<p>&quot;But if <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location> were to manage to disrupt flows through the Strait, over 20% of global oil and LNG flows could be impacted.  This could present a scenario three times the severity of the arab oil embargo and Iranian revolution in the 1970s, and drive oil prices into the triple digits, while LNG prices could retest the record highs of 2022.</p>\n<p>&quot;The scope for intentional and unintentional escalation in these circumstances is broad and hard to predict. Initial oil market reactions will price in higher risk of various scenarios that may disrupt supply, from a more modest disruption to 2mmbbld of Iranian exports, to attacks on regional oil infrastructure, through to disruption of passage through the <location>Strait of Hormuz</location> in the most extreme scenario. This could add several dollars more to oil, poised for even higher price spikes is the conflict escalates.</p>\n<p>&quot;A full prolonged closure of the <location>Strait of Hormuz</location> is unlikely. But even a partial disruption of flows, especially as some tankers avoid the region, could see several million barrels per day of oil disrupted which would still send oil over <money>$100</money>.&quot;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Scott Murdoch</person>, <person>Tom Westbrook</person>, Rae Wee Compiled by <person>Vidya Ranganathan</person>)</p>\n",

The legislative environment for Huawei replacement in the EU is currently non-compulsory, meaning the transition away from Huawei will take years and may slow market activity until more stringent requirements are enacted. In addition, tightening supply conditions in key components such as memory and optics were highlighted, which could impact costs and supply chain dynamics.

But that fall was short-lived and unwound after three or four days.  </p>\n<p>&quot;In current circumstances, the size of the fall will depend on how large and how long-lasting the conflict is expected to be,&quot; CBA analysts said in a note a week ago.  </p>\n<p>&quot;If the conflict was long-lasting and disrupted oil supplies, we expect the U.S. dollar would lift against most currencies except Japanese yen and Swiss franc. The U.S. is a net energy exporter and so benefits from higher oil and gas prices that would result from disrupted oil supply.&quot;</p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/il\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Israel's</location> shekel will almost certainly be another mover - <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location> quickly retaliated against <location value=\"LC/il\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Israel</location> on Saturday.</p>\n<p>It dropped 5% at the start of the June war and also reacted after <location value=\"LC/il\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Israel</location> struck <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran's</location> <location value=\"LU/sy..damcus\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Damascus</location> consulate in <chron>April 2024</chron> and when <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location> launched missiles at <location value=\"LC/il\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Israel</location> that October.</p>\n<p>All episodes were short-lived and followed by quick shekel rebounds. However, JPMorgan said it could be different this time if the conflict and a rise in market risk premia proved more persistent.     </p>\n<p>&quot;This would especially be the case if confrontation with <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location> also triggers more intensive operations against <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran's</location> proxies,&quot; the <location>Wall Street</location> bank said.</p>\n<p>SAFE-HAVENS DO THEIR THING</p>\n<p>The Swiss franc, widely regarded as a safe haven in times of turmoil, is expected to face further upward pressure, creating a headache for the <org>Swiss National Bank</org>. It is up 3% this year against the U.S. dollar.</p>\n<p>Investors could also make another dash for gold, which has had a record run and is up 22% so far in 2026, and into silver, which has also been on a roll.</p>\n<p>The conflict could also add to demand for U.S. Treasuries whose yields have been falling in the past few weeks. </p>\n<p>The outlier has been bitcoin, no longer seen as a haven. It fell 2% on Saturday and has shed more than a quarter of its value in two months.</p>\n<p>WATCH <location value=\"LR/mde\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >MIDDLE EAST</location> MARKETS</p>\n<p>Trading in bourses in the <location value=\"LR/mde\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Middle East</location> on Sunday, including <location value=\"LC/sa\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Saudi Arabia</location> and <location value=\"LC/qa\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Qatar</location>, will provide an initial indicator of investor sentiment. While these markets are highly correlated to oil prices, an escalating conflict could ripple through the economies. </p>\n<p>&quot;I suspect markets will be down if these hostilities continue through the day,\" said <person>Ryan Lemand</person>, chief executive officer and co-founder of Neovision Wealth Management. Depending on the scale of the conflict, Gulf equities could drop by 3-5%, he said. </p>\n<p><location value=\"LC/sa\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Saudi Arabia's</location> benchmark stock index dropped 1.3% in five days through Thursday, its second consecutive week of declines. <location value=\"LU/ae..dubai\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Dubai's</location> main market, which reopens on Monday, fell in the last two weeks.     </p>\n<p>AIRLINE &amp; DEFENCE STOCKS   </p>\n<p>Global airlines cancelled flights across the <location value=\"LR/mde\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Middle East</location> on Saturday, and their stocks could be under pressure if the conflict spreads and forces more airspace closures.</p>\n<p>European weapons makers, up 10% this year, could see more demand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> (Reporting by <person>Dhara Ranasinghe</person>, <person>Marc Jones</person> and <person>Vidya Ranganathan</person> in <location value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >London</location>, <person>Rae Wee</person> in <location value=\"LC/sg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Singapore</location>, <person>Hadeel Al Sayegh</person> in <location value=\"LU/ae..abudha\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Abu Dhabi</location>; Editing by <person>Kevin Liffey</person>)</p>\n",
