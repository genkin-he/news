The defense industrial base includes tens of thousands of contractors, including major public companies.</p>\n<p>The designation is typically reserved for suppliers from adversary nations. Such action was taken to remove Chinese tech giant Huawei from the Pentagon's supply chains: Starting in 2017, the U.S. restricted <org>Defense Department</org> use of Huawei equipment, prohibited federal agencies from purchasing its technology, and halted federal grant and loan funds for Huawei equipment.</p>\n<p>Anthropic could launch a court challenge to the designation, which poses an existential threat to its business with the government and may harm its private-sector relationships, according to <person>Franklin Turner</person>, an attorney who specializes in government contracts.</p>\n<p>&quot;Blacklisting Anthropic is the contractual equivalent of nuclear war,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>WEAPONS, SURVEILLANCE CONCERNS</p>\n<p>The Pentagon had set a Friday deadline to resolve an escalating feud with <location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >San Francisco</location>-based Anthropic over how the military could use AI at war.</p>\n<p>AI leader Anthropic has raced to win fierce competition to sell novel technology to businesses and government, particularly for national security, ahead of a widely expected initial public offering.

The defense industrial base includes tens of thousands\nof contractors, including major public companies.\nThe designation is typically reserved for suppliers from\nadversary nations. Such action was taken to remove Chinese tech\ngiant Huawei from the Pentagon's supply chains: Starting in\n2017, the U.S. restricted <org>Defense Department</org> use of Huawei\nequipment, prohibited federal agencies from purchasing its\ntechnology, and halted federal grant and loan funds for Huawei\nequipment.</p>\n<p>Anthropic could launch a court challenge to the designation,\nwhich poses an existential threat to its business with the\ngovernment and may harm its private-sector relationships,\naccording to <person>Franklin Turner</person>, an attorney who specializes in\ngovernment contracts.</p>\n<p>&quot;Blacklisting Anthropic is the contractual equivalent of\nnuclear war,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>WEAPONS, SURVEILLANCE CONCERNS\nThe Pentagon had set a Friday deadline to resolve an escalating\nfeud with <location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >San Francisco</location>-based Anthropic over how the military\ncould use AI at war.\nAI leader Anthropic has raced to win fierce competition to sell\nnovel technology to businesses and government, particularly for\nnational security, ahead of a widely expected initial public\noffering. The company has said it has not finalized an IPO\ndecision.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the battle over technological guardrails\nhad raised concerns that the <org>Defense Department</org> would follow\nU.S. law but few other constraints when deploying AI for\nnational-security missions, regardless of safety or ethics terms\nrequired by the technology's developers.</p>\n<p>Anthropic had sought guarantees that its AI would not be\nused for fully autonomous weapons or for mass domestic\nsurveillance - applications in which the Pentagon has said it\nhad no interest.</p>\n<p>Anthropic was the first frontier AI lab to put its models on\nclassified networks via cloud provider <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon.com</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> and\nthe first to build customized models for national security\ncustomers, the startup has said.</p>\n<p>Its product Claude is in use across the intelligence\ncommunity and armed services.</p>\n<p>U.S. Senator <person>Mark Warner</person>, a Democrat and vice chairman of\nthe <org>Select Committee on Intelligence</org>, criticized the action\ntaken by Trump, a Republican.</p>\n<p>&quot;The president's directive to halt the use of a leading\nAmerican AI company across the federal government, combined with\ninflammatory rhetoric attacking that company, raises serious\nconcerns about whether national security decisions are being\ndriven by careful analysis or political considerations.&quot;</p>\n<p>Tech companies and the Pentagon have repeatedly locked horns\nsince at least 2018, when employees at Alphabet's\nGoogle protested against the Pentagon's use of the company's AI\nto analyze drone footage. A rapprochement ensued with companies\nincluding <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> and <org value=\"MSFT.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Microsoft</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='MSFT' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( MSFT )</span> jousting for defense\nbusiness, while several big-tech CEOs pledged cooperation last\nyear with the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>But theoretical &quot;killer robots&quot; have remained a concern held\nby human-rights and technology activists.

Such action was taken to remove Chinese tech giant Huawei from the Pentagon's supply chains: Starting in 2017, the U.S. restricted <org>Defense Department</org> use of Huawei equipment, prohibited federal agencies from purchasing its technology, and halted federal grant and loan funds for Huawei equipment.</p>\n<p>Anthropic could launch a court challenge to the designation, which poses an existential threat to its business with the government and may harm its private-sector relationships, according to <person>Franklin Turner</person>, an attorney who specializes in government contracts.</p>\n<p>&quot;Blacklisting Anthropic is the contractual equivalent of nuclear war,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>WEAPONS, SURVEILLANCE CONCERNS</p>\n<p>The Pentagon had set a Friday deadline to resolve an escalating feud with <location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >San Francisco</location>-based Anthropic over how the military could use AI at war.</p>\n<p>AI leader Anthropic has raced to win fierce competition to sell novel technology to businesses and government, particularly for national security, ahead of a widely expected initial public offering. The company has said it has not finalized an IPO decision.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the battle over technological guardrails had raised concerns that the <org>Defense Department</org> would follow U.S. law but few other constraints when deploying AI for national-security missions, regardless of safety or ethics terms required by the technology's developers.</p>\n<p>Anthropic had sought guarantees that its AI would not be used for fully autonomous weapons or for mass domestic surveillance - applications in which the Pentagon has said it had no interest.</p>\n<p>Anthropic was the first frontier AI lab to put its models on classified networks via cloud provider <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon.com</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> and the first to build customized models for national security customers, the startup has said.</p>\n<p>Its product Claude is in use across the intelligence community and armed services.</p>\n<p>U.S. Senator <person>Mark Warner</person>, a Democrat and vice chairman of the <org>Select Committee on Intelligence</org>, criticized the action taken by Trump, a Republican.</p>\n<p>&quot;The president's directive to halt the use of a leading American AI company across the federal government, combined with inflammatory rhetoric attacking that company, raises serious concerns about whether national security decisions are being driven by careful analysis or political considerations.&quot;</p>\n<p>Tech companies and the Pentagon have repeatedly locked horns since at least 2018, when employees at Alphabet's Google protested against the Pentagon's use of the company's AI to analyze drone footage. A rapprochement ensued with companies including <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> and <org value=\"MSFT.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Microsoft</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='MSFT' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( MSFT )</span> jousting for defense business, while several big-tech CEOs pledged cooperation last year with the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>But theoretical &quot;killer robots&quot; have remained a concern held by human-rights and technology activists.

            "description": "\n<p><chron>04:15 PM EST</chron>, <chron>02/27/2026</chron> (MT Newswires) -- <org>The Toronto Stock Exchange</org> slumped Friday, mostly on some profit taking after it set six record closes over the prior seven sessions, but losses on the resources-heavy index were capped by higher commodity prices, while investors continue to welcome news of a swing in foreign direct investment into a rare surplus.</p><p>The S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index closed down 161.97 points, or 0.5%, to 34,339.99,  falling off the 17th record close of 2026 set Thursday, with sectors mixed over Friday's session. For a second successive day, Info Tech led decliners , down 2.5%, while Financials was down near 2%. Telecom led gainers, up 1.65%, with Energy, up 1.15% and the Battery Metals Index, up 1.1%, next.</p><p><org>BMO Capital Markets</org> Chief Economist <person>Douglas Porter</person> in his regular Friday 'Talking Points' note noted even as the Canadian economy remains &quot;challenged by relentless trade uncertainty&quot;, the TSX continues to &quot;find its own path&quot;. Prior to Friday's stumble, the index managed to rise more than 1% this week to hit an record high above 34,500 and was up 8% in the first two months of the year. Porter noted a rebound in gold and firmer oil prices assisted, but Q1 bank earnings were also &quot;greeted favourably&quot;. He also noted economy-wide profits rose more than 6% in 2025, topping nominal GDP growth of 4.3% on the year. More broadly, <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> may be benefitting from a diversification push away from U.S. markets, where valuations are rich, Porter said.</p><p>Porter cited as just as one small sample of the shift into <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> in the past year a &quot;welcome&quot; swing in foreign direct investment into a rare surplus. For Q4 alone, quarterly net FDI inflows were <money>$11.6 billion</money>, driven by M&amp;A activity. Looking at the four-quarter trend reveals that for the first time in more than a decade, and only the second time in the past 18 years, <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada</location> had a net inflow in FDI in 2025 of <money>$17.3 billion</money>, Porter noted. For perspective, Porter said that alone would have funded more than half of the current account deficit of <money>$30.4 billion</money> last year. He noted there are three major types of FDI: M&amp;A, greenfield investments, and reinvested earnings. In 2025, the latter remained in a large outflow position of <money>$47 billion</money> &quot;and is normally in a deficit because of <location value=\"LC/ca\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Canada's</location> large stock of outstanding investments abroad&quot; while M&amp;A was in a large offsetting surplus. Net new FDI investments were, thus,  in a surplus of <money>$17.6 billion</money> for the year, &quot;which is encouraging news for an economy looking for new growth avenues&quot;, Porter added.</p><p>Of commodities, gold rose to the highest in a month Friday following a report U.S. wholesale inflation rose above expectations in January. Gold for April delivery was last seen up <money>US$86.50</money> to to <money>US$5,280.70</money> per ounce, the highest since the record close of <money>US$5,354.80</money> on <chron>Jan. 29</chron>.</p><p>Also, West Texas Intermediate crude oil rose to a six-month high as a third round of talks between the U.S. and <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location> ended with an agreement to meet again next week amid reports <location value=\"LC/ir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Iran</location> is balking at U.S. demands it abandon its uranium enrichment program, raising worries President Trump will decide to strike at the OPEC+ member. WTI crude oil for April delivery closed up <money>US$1.81</money> to settle at <money>US$67.02</money> per barrel, the highest since <chron>Aug. 1</chron>, while <person>April Brent</person> crude was up <money>US$1.81</money> to <money>US$72.56</money>.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

But his visit to <location value=\"LU/us.tx.corsti\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Corpus Christi</location> placed him near several competitive <org>U.S. House of Representatives</org> districts where Hispanic voters, an important constituency for Republicans nationally, could determine the outcome in November's midterm elections.</p>\n<p>The trip followed a warning from a <location value=\"LS/us.tx\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Texas</location> Republican who said her recent loss in a state legislature race, despite Trump's endorsement, was a &quot;wake-up call&quot; for the party.</p>\n<p>Trump, wearing a red Make America Great Again hat, spoke to several hundred supporters at a waterfront rally in front of a ship he said had carried Venezuelan oil.</p>\n<p>He made references to &quot;new friend and partner <location value=\"LC/ve\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Venezuela</location>,&quot; nearly two months after he ordered the U.S. military to arrest Venezuelan President <person>Nicolas Maduro</person> and seize control of the country's oil.</p>\n<p>Trump boasted about his single-minded determination to increase production of fossil fuels blamed for climate change, saying his policies had led to lower gasoline prices and helped boost economic growth. Gas prices are about 4% lower since January last year.</p>\n<p>&quot;We're witnessing a historic American energy boom like we've never seen,&quot; Trump said.</p>\n<p>The president's event springboarded off his State of the Union address, which sought to draw sharp contrasts with Democrats on affordability and immigration enforcement as they aim to gain control of <org>Congress</org> later this year.</p>\n<p>The <location value=\"LU/us.tx.corsti\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Corpus Christi</location> area is the top exporter of liquefied natural gas in the U.S., with 42% of the product nationwide passing through its port.</p>\n<p>TRUMP MUM ON ENDORSEMENT</p>\n<p>Midterm elections are historically seen as a check on the sitting president, and Trump has warned his agenda will be derailed if his party loses power. But first, Republicans in the deeply conservative state must settle on who they want to represent them in November's general election. </p>\n<p>Public opinion polls show Senator <person>John Cornyn</person>, in office since 2002, trailing two challengers - <location value=\"LS/us.tx\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Texas</location> Attorney General <person>Ken Paxton</person> and U.S. Representative <person>Wesley Hunt</person> - in <location value=\"LS/us.tx\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Texas'</location> most cutthroat contest.</p>\n<p>Trump told reporters shortly after arriving that he had &quot;pretty much&quot; decided who to support but would not announce the name.</p>\n<p>During the rally, Trump called both Cornyn and Paxton &quot;great&quot; and said there was &quot;a little bit of a race&quot; between the men.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's going to be an interesting one,&quot; Trump said.</p>\n<p>As he has done several times before, Trump also raised the prospect of seeking an unconstitutional third term as president.</p>\n<p>CAN FORCED REDISTRICTING RESCUE REPUBLICANS?</p>\n<p>At the president's urging last year, <location value=\"LS/us.tx\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Texas</location> Republicans launched a redistricting fight aimed at improving the party's prospects in U.S. House races. With the new map in effect, Republicans could gain up to five more seats across the state. </p>\n<p>Hispanic voters in south <location value=\"LS/us.tx\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Texas</location> are key to the party's electoral success, said <location value=\"LU/us.tx.corsti\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Corpus Christi's</location> state Senator <person>Adam Hinojosa</person>, the first Republican to represent the <location>Rio Grande Valley</location> in the <org>Texas Senate</org> since 1874.</p>\n<p>&quot;We need the job opportunities, we need to make sure that our families are taken care of, we need to be able to afford all of the groceries and things to have a decent lifestyle,&quot; Hinojosa said in an interview.</p>\n<p>Crediting Trump's border policy and pro-oil agenda, Hinojosa said he thought the president's visit would help energize the Republican base.</p>\n<p>Trump has prioritized maximizing U.S. fossil fuel production by rolling back environmental regulations and streamlining permitting for energy projects, benefiting places like southern <location value=\"LS/us.tx\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Texas</location>.</p>\n<p>Even so, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 36% of people nationwide approved of Trump's handling of the economy while 56% disapproved. </p>\n<p><person>Mary Campbell</person>, who attended Friday's rally and has two Christmas trees she keeps decorated for Trump year-round, said she was \"very happy with the border&quot; under his presidency. But the economy, she said, \"could use a little more help.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm sad that prices are not quite controlled yet, but hopefully we're working in that direction,\" Campbell, of <location value=\"LU/us.tx.corsti\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Corpus Christi</location>, said. \"I have five kids, so you know, I watch some of them struggling.\"</p>\n<p>(Reporting by <person>Bo Erickson</person>, <person>Jarrett Renshaw</person> and <person>Nolan McCaskill</person>; Writing by <person>Bo Erickson</person> and <person>Steve Holland</person>; Editing by <person>Colleen Jenkins</person>, <person>Chris Reese</person>, <person>Rod Nickel</person>)</p>\n",

The legislative environment for Huawei replacement in the EU is currently non-compulsory, meaning the transition away from Huawei will take years and may slow market activity until more stringent requirements are enacted. In addition, tightening supply conditions in key components such as memory and optics were highlighted, which could impact costs and supply chain dynamics.

We don't need it, we don't want it, and will not do business with them again!&quot;</p>\n<p>He added there would be a six-month phaseout for the <org>Defense Department</org> and other agencies that use the company's products.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Pentagon's supply-chain risk designation, typically reserved for companies in adversary nations, means that defense contractors could be barred from deploying Anthropic's AI as part of work for the Pentagon. The defense industrial base includes tens of thousands of contractors, including major public companies.</p>\n<p>The actions were pegged to a Friday deadline that the Pentagon set to resolve an escalating feud with <location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >San Francisco</location>-based Anthropic, over concerns about how the military could use AI at war.</p>\n<p>Spokespeople for Anthropic, which won a <money>$200 million</money> ceiling Pentagon contract last year, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>Trump's announcement stopped short of the Pentagon's threat that it could invoke the Defense Production Act to require Anthropic's compliance. But the U.S. president vowed further action if Anthropic did not cooperate going forward.</p>\n<p>Trump warned he would use &quot;the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow&quot; if Anthropic did not help with the phaseout of its technology.</p>\n<p>WEAPONS, SURVEILLANCE CONCERNS</p>\n<p>The setback comes as AI leader Anthropic raced to win a fierce competition selling novel technology to businesses and government, particularly for national security, ahead of its widely expected initial public offering. The company has said it has not finalized an IPO decision.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the battle over technological guardrails had raised concerns that the <org>Department of Defense</org> would follow U.S. law but little other constraint when deploying AI for national-security missions, regardless of safety or ethics service terms embraced by the technology's developers.</p>\n<p>Anthropic had sought guarantees that its AI would not be used for fully autonomous weapons or for mass domestic surveillance - applications in which the Pentagon has said it had no interest. </p>\n<p>Anthropic was the first frontier AI lab to put its models on classified networks via cloud provider <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon.com</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span> and the first to build customized models for national security customers, the startup has said.</p>\n<p>Its product Claude is in use across the intelligence community and armed services.</p>\n<p>U.S. Senator <person>Mark Warner</person>, a Democrat and vice chairman of the <org>Select Committee on Intelligence</org>, criticized the action taken by Trump, a Republican.</p>\n<p>\"The president's directive to halt the use of a leading American AI company across the federal government, combined with inflammatory rhetoric attacking that company, raises serious concerns about whether national security decisions are being driven by careful analysis or political considerations.&quot;</p>\n<p>The conflict is the latest eruption in a saga that dates back at least to 2018. That year, employees at Alphabet's Google protested the Pentagon's use of the company's AI to analyze drone footage, straining relations between <location>Silicon Valley</location> and <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location>.

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We lower our 12-month target price by <money>$25</money> to <money>$65</money>, applying an EV/revenue multiple of 2.3x to our FY 27 (Jan.) estimate, a discount to its three-year historical average multiple at 3.7x.

The Online business, while stabilizing, continues to see only slight growth, and guidance suggests that this segment will remain relatively flat, with only modest increases anticipated for FY 27. The company noted that price increases are not expected to be an ongoing lever for growth, indicating that future revenue improvement will rely more heavily on adding value and product innovation rather than pricing actions. Finally, the ongoing transition from on-prem to cloud for large enterprise customers remains incomplete, with approximately 150 million seats still on-prem. This indicates a slower migration pace and ongoing challenges in capturing full market potential.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.
