Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We trim our 12-month target  by <money>$7</money> to <money>$33</money>, applying an EV/EBITDA multiple of 5.7x to our 2026 estimate, a discount to its three-year historical average multiple at 6.5x. We lower our 2025 EPS estimate by <money>$0.10</money> to <money>$4.22</money> and cut 2026's by <money>$0.50</money> to <money>$4.29</money>. The company cited several near-term headwinds, including the negative EBITDA impact from broadband repositioning, the onboarding of new NBA sports rights (introduces upfront dilution), and the spin-off of VERSANT, which will affect both EBITDA and free cash flow in the short term. The broadband environment remains intensely competitive, and this is not expected to change soon. Business Services also faces elevated competition, particularly from fixed wireless alternatives, affecting growth and requiring ongoing investment. Finally, the shift toward simplified, transparent pricing and increased promotional activity (including free wireless lines) is causing revenue dilution.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

            "description": "\n<p><chron>02:00 PM EDT</chron>, <chron>10/31/2025</chron> (MT Newswires) -- CFRA, an independent research provider, has provided MT Newswires with the following research alert. Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We increase our 12-month target by <money>$15</money> to <money>$110</money>, based on a 2026 P/E of 13.0x, a justified discount to APTV's 10-year forward P/E multiple of 23.8x. We raise our adjusted EPS estimates to <money>$7.90</money> from <money>$7.55</money> for '25, to <money>$8.45</money> from <money>$8.25</money> for '26, and introduce '27 at <money>$9.15</money>. Following APTV's big Q3 beat, we reiterate our Strong Buy on the shares, as APTV screens as one of the best earnings growth stories in the auto supplier space. We see EPS growth supported by its record new business awards of <money>$31B</money> in 2024 (its third straight year of $30B+ in new business wins), with EPS boosted by share count reduction from buybacks (its weighted average shares outstanding were down 12% Y/Y in Q3), which should help generate superior EPS growth relative to auto supplier peers. While shares are down slightly on the weaker-than-expected Q4 guidance, we believe these concerns are overblown, noting management's long history of providing conservative guidance, and like APTV's exposure to higher-growth segments of the industry.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to &#8220;go short&#8221; a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource.  Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading &#8211; either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>\n",
