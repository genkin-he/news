A shocking statistic: In 2025, the US experienced a record <b>3,332 data compromises, exposing over 278 million individuals and costing businesses an average of <money>$10.22 million</money> per breach</b>. Under the CLOUD Act, US-based cloud providers must hand over customer data to government authorities—regardless of where it's stored—potentially without warrants or customer notification.

And\nLVMH donated <money>5 million euros</money> to the victims of what it called\nthe \"tragic situation\" in <location value=\"LC/ua\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Ukraine</location>.</p>\n<p>One of its businesses in <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location>, however, has kept\noperating: <location>The Grand Hotel Europe</location> in <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St. Petersburg</location>, owned\nthrough LVMH's Belmond chain of luxury hotels and trains.</p>\n<p>The storied hotel itself isn't subject to sanctions and is\noperating legally. However, it has continued to receive payments\nfor providing services to corporate clients that have been\nsanctioned by <location value=\"LR/eur\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Europe</location> and the UK, including major Russian\ntransport, energy and media companies as well as banks and\nmilitary contractors, Reuters has found.</p>\n<p>Signs of the hotel's ownership have been scrubbed from\npublic view, including images from social media showing an empty\nspace at the entrance where a placard with Belmond's logo was\nonce affixed. The hotel was also de-listed from Belmond's\nbooking site in 2023, according to archived versions of the\nBelmond booking website.</p>\n<p>Belmond's ownership of the hotel, however, continues to\nappear in Russian, British and French corporate records. Belmond\nis 100% owned by LVMH, according to its 2025 accounts. Names of\nthe hotel's corporate clients, including the sanctioned ones,\nappear in value-added-tax records reviewed by Reuters.</p>\n<p>Asked about the hotel's operations and business with\nsanctioned clients, LVMH said the <location>Grand Hotel Europe</location> \"operates\nautonomously and independently from Belmond.\"</p>\n<p>\"It is not part of the Belmond distribution systems and the\ndedicated local team in <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location> manages this historic property\nseparately,\" the company said. LVMH declined to respond further\nto detailed questions from Reuters. Belmond issued an identical\nresponse.</p>\n<p>Executives at LVMH, the world's largest luxury conglomerate,\nconsidered closing the <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St. Petersburg</location> property but ultimately\ndecided against it, two sources with direct knowledge of the\nmatter told Reuters. \"These are people who work for us, that we\nhave been paying for years,\" said one of the people. \"Shall we\npunish them because their country is being run by a fool?\"</p>\n<p><person>Yulia Pashkovskaya</person>, the hotel manager, and a hotel\nspokesperson declined to comment to Reuters.</p>\n<p>Situated on the Nevsky Prospekt in the heart of <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St.\nPetersburg</location> since 1875, the <location>Grand Hotel Europe</location> has hosted guests\nincluding <location value=\"LC/gb\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Britain's</location> then-<person>Prince Charles</person> and pop stars <person>Elton John</person>\nand <person>Whitney Houston</person>. One of its first famous guests was Pyotr\nTchaikovsky, the Russian composer.</p>\n<p>The five-star hotel features a butler service and a caviar\nbar famous for its \"Egg in Egg\" dish - boiled truffle-flavored\neggs and three types of caviar.</p>\n<p>More recently, the hotel has hosted multiple events\ninvolving <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia's</location> political and economic elites. Last year, it\nhosted a meeting between diplomatic envoys of U.S. President\nDonald Trump and Russian President <person>Vladimir Putin</person> to discuss the\nwar in <location value=\"LC/ua\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Ukraine</location>, and celebrated its 150th anniversary with a\nlavish gala that included bank executives, the director of the\n<org>Russian State Museum</org>, and <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St. Petersburg</location> officials.</p>\n<p>For over a decade, the hotel has been an official partner of\nthe <org>St. Petersburg International Economic Forum</org>, the annual\nbusiness gathering chaired by Putin.</p>\n<p>REASONS TO STAY</p>\n<p>The hotel's enduring allure may make it worth LVMH's while\nto hold on to the property, Russian business experts say. \"Most\nlikely, they are hoping to wait out the situation, thinking that\none day things with <location value=\"LC/ua\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Ukraine</location> will improve,\" said <person>Artem\nZhavoronkov</person>, a partner at the <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St. Petersburg</location> law firm <org>Nordic\nStar</org>, who specialises in sanctions litigation but is not\nadvising the hotel. \"It's a good asset, it's profitable. And it\nis first-class real estate that will only grow in value over\ntime,\" added Zhavoronkov.</p>\n<p>LVMH's decision to retain the property could be part of a\nlong-term ambition to re-enter the Russian market, said <person>Kristian\nLasslett</person>, a professor at <org>Ulster University</org> in <location value=\"LS/gb.nir\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Northern Ireland</location>\nwho studies corporate behaviour in <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location> and <location value=\"LR/asp\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Central Asia</location>.</p>\n<p>\"Business in <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location> has long depended on personal\nconnections and the favour in which one is held,\" Lasslett said.</p>\n<p>There could be other reasons why LVMH has held onto the\nproperty, according to people familiar with the situation. Among\nthe possible reasons are Russian rules requiring foreign\ncompanies to sell their assets at a hefty discount if they leave\nthe country, and that the city of <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St. Petersburg</location> holds a 6.5%\nstake in the art nouveau building in which the hotel is located,\naccording to Russian property records and Belmond filings to the\n<org>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</org>.</p>\n<p>The <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St. Petersburg</location> mayor's office didn't respond to\nquestions about whether Belmond needed the city's permission to\nsell its stake in the hotel or whether there had been any\nrequests to do so.</p>\n<p>Most Western hotel chains - including Marriott, Four\nSeasons, and InterContinental owner IHG - have cut ties with\n<location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location>. Unlike Belmond, all of these groups functioned through\nthird-party investors, allowing them to withdraw from <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location>\nquickly. Some others including Hilton halted new investments but\nstill operate there.</p>\n<p>The <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St. Petersburg</location> hotel does not face international\nrestrictions on its operations because services like\naccommodation and catering aren't specifically targeted by\nsanctions, according to legal experts in <location value=\"LU/fr..paris\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Paris</location>, <location value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >London</location> and\n<location value=\"LU/ru..moscow\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Moscow</location> and a <org>EU Commission</org> source. Regis Bismuth, an\ninternational law professor at <org>Sciences Po University</org> in <location value=\"LU/fr..paris\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Paris</location>,\nnoted that the hotel is a Russian subsidiary, incorporated under\nRussian law, providing everyday services within <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location>.</p>\n<p>SANCTIONED CLIENTS</p>\n<p>The hotel is making money from sanctioned companies, though.\nVAT filings to local tax authorities from the second quarter of\n2022 to the first quarter of 2025 show the hotel received\npayments from sanctioned entities including two units of arms\nmaker Rostec and a subsidiary of <org>Tactical Missiles Corp</org>, as well\nas from ship building company Sovcomflot and energy giant\nRosneft. Other payments came from corporations under asset\nfreezes such as Sberbank, Sovcombank and VTB.</p>\n<p>The tax filings don't specify what services the sanctioned\ncompanies purchased from the hotel. But most of the individual\npayments did not exceed <money>$2,000</money>, in line with the hotel's\nofferings for rooms, dinners or meeting spaces. The hotel's room\nprices range from roughly <money>$270</money> to <money>$1,200</money>, with high-end suites\nfrom <money>$1,800</money> to nearly <money>$8,000</money> per night, according to its booking\nsite. Some companies made repeated payments over the years.\nOthers only once or twice.</p>\n<p>The VAT records do not specify what goods or services were\nreceived in exchange for payments.</p>\n<p>Rostec, <org>Tactical Missiles Corp.</org>, Sovcomflot, Rosneft,\nSberbank and Sovcombank did not respond to detailed requests for\ncomment. VTB said the information Reuters provided was incorrect\nbut did not specify.</p>\n<p><org>The European Commission</org>, which has drafted several rounds of\nsanctions against <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location>, declined to comment about the hotel.\nThe Commission has said that its sanctions do not apply outside\nthe <org>European Union</org>, but that parent companies may not \"use their\nRussian subsidiaries to circumvent the obligations that apply to\nthe EU parent.\"</p>\n<p>Among the hotel's largest clients was sanctioned lender\nSovcombank, which paid <money>$140,000</money> to the hotel. Another major\nclient was Prezident-Servis, a travel agency owned directly by\nthe Kremlin, which made payments worth at least <money>$270,000</money> to the\nhotel.</p>\n<p>Most of the payments by both entities coincided with the <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St.\nPetersburg</location> forum in 2023 and 2024, the records show.</p>\n<p>In response to questions about the hotel, the Kremlin said\nit was not in the hospitality business.</p>\n<p><org>Europe Hotel LLC</org>, the firm behind the property, is listed\namong LVMH's hundreds of 100%-owned subsidiaries on page 401 of\nits latest universal registration document, a detailed mandatory\nannual filing with the French market watchdog AMF. Reuters could\nfind no other public mentions of the hotel by LVMH since the\nstart of the war.\nBetween 2022 and 2024, the hotel's annual revenues have almost\ndoubled, reaching <money>1.9 billion roubles</money> (<money>$25 million</money>), slightly\nabove its top line in the three years preceding the 2020\nCOVID-19 pandemic, according to Russian financial filings\nreviewed by Reuters.\nThe hotel in 2024 generated a net profit of some <money>$5.7 million</money> in\n2024, its highest since data was first published in 2004. The\ncash from these operations reached <money>$13 million</money> on the hotel's\nbalance sheet published last year, up from less than <money>$1 million</money>\nannually from 2018 to 2021, according to the documents. The\nrecords indicated that the hotel's profits stay inside <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia</location>.</p>\n<p>The totals are tiny compared to LVMH's annual sales of\naround <money>80 billion euros</money>, but the hotel's storied past and its\nties to <location value=\"LC/ru\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Russia's</location> elite give it value beyond the revenue it\ngenerates.</p>\n<p>\"I always say that <location>Grand Hotel Europe</location> is one of the true\nplaces of power in <location value=\"LU/ru..saiurg\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >St. Petersburg</location>,&quot; Pashkovskaya, the hotel's\nmanager since 2006, told a Russian YouTuber in <chron>June 2023</chron>.</p>\n<p>The bubbly flowed at the <location>Grand Hotel Europe's</location> 150th\nanniversary gala. But Veuve Clicquot, Dom Perignon and other\nLVMH champagne brands were nowhere to be seen in a video\nreleased by the hotel after the party was over.

            "description": "\n<p><chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - Anthropic said it would not accede to the Pentagon's request to eliminate safeguards from its AI systems, despite threats to deem the company a &quot;supply chain risk&quot; and remove it from the <org>Department of Defense's</org> systems, putting a <money>$200 million</money> contract at risk.</p>\n<p>The Pentagon's dispute with Anthropic stems from the AI startup's refusal to remove safeguards that would prevent its technology from being used to target weapons autonomously and conduct surveillance in <location value=\"LC/us\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >the United States</location>.</p>\n<p>Earlier in the day, Pentagon spokesperson <person>Sean Parnell</person> said on X that the department has no interest in using AI to conduct mass surveillance of Americans nor does it want to use AI to develop autonomous weapons that operate without human involvement.</p>\n<p>&quot;Here's what we're asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic's model for all lawful purposes,&quot; Parnell said, adding that the company had until <chron>5:01 pm ET on Friday</chron> to decide.</p>\n<p>&quot;Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk.&quot;</p>\n<p>In a statement on Thursday, Anthropic CEO <person>Dario Amodei</person> underscored the company's opposition to the Pentagon using its AI models for mass domestic surveillance or to power fully autonomous weapons, the latter being because &quot;frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough.&quot;</p>\n<p>A source close to the company said Anthropic was not accusing the Pentagon of planning to engage AI for either use, but was offering a product safety judgment.</p>\n<p>The source said AI systems were not reliable enough for &quot;life-or-death targeting&quot; because they behave unpredictably in novel scenarios, which could lead to &quot;friendly fire, mission failure or unintended escalation&quot; in a weapons context.</p>\n<p>Using AI for mass domestic surveillance was problematic because current laws do not restrict the conclusions that AI can draw by aggregating large amounts of data, the source said. That meant AI could build population-level profiles that &quot;no law explicitly prohibits but that clearly violate the spirit of constitutional protections,&quot; they added.</p>\n<p>Amodei said he hoped the Pentagon would reconsider but that the company &quot;will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider,&quot; if the Pentagon decided to cancel the contract.</p>\n<p>The Pentagon threatened to remove Anthropic from its systems if the company maintained the safeguards, designate them a supply chain risk, and invoke the Defense Production Act to force the safeguards' removal, Amodei said.</p>\n<p>&quot;Regardless, these threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.&quot;</p>\n<p>Undersecretary of Defense <person>Emil Michael</person> responded on X, saying, &quot;It's a shame that @DarioAmodei is a liar and has a God-complex. He wants nothing more than to try to personally control the US Military and is ok putting our nation's safety at risk.&quot;</p>\n<p>Michael said the Pentagon would &quot;ALWAYS adhere to the law but not bend to whims of any one for-profit tech company.&quot;</p>\n<p>Anthropic, backed by Google and <org value=\"AMZN.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Amazon</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='AMZN' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( AMZN )</span>, has a contract with the department worth up to <money>$200 million</money>.</p>\n<p>An Anthropic spokesperson said the company remains &quot;ready to continue talks and committed to operational continuity for the Department and America's warfighters.&quot;</p>\n<p>More than 200 Google and OpenAI employees backed Anthropic's position in an open letter. </p>\n<p>Google and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>\n<p> (Reporting by Carlos Méndez and <person>Chris Thomas</person> in <location value=\"LU/mx.sm.mexcty\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Mexico City</location>; <person>Shubham Kalia</person> in Bengaluru, Andrea Shalal, <person>Mike Stone</person> and <person>David Shepardson</person> in <location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Washington</location>; Editing by <person>Matthew Lewis</person>, <person>Shri Navaratnam</person> and <person>Kim Coghill</person>)</p>\n",

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We raise our 12-month target to <money>$134</money> from <money>$127</money>, based on ~13x our FY 27 (Apr.) EPS estimate of <money>$10.31</money>. While we lower our FY 27 EPS from <money>$10.61</money>, our forecast remains above consensus' <money>$9.85</money>, and we trim FY 26 EPS modestly to <money>$8.87</money> from <money>$8.91</money>. The applied multiple sits modestly below SJM's 14x long-term average. We view SJM's Jan.-Q results as solid overall, though we remain disappointed by the continued challenges related to the Hostess acquisition. That said, we expect margins in the Hostess business to improve in FY 27 following recent restructuring actions. We are also constructive on margin expansion in coffee next year, supported by lower commodity costs and the recent removal of coffee tariffs. Core brands such as Uncrustables, <org>Cafe Bustelo</org>, Meow Mix, and Milk-Bone continue to perform well. Oversight from Elliott Management could help unlock incremental shareholder value. Overall, we see a reasonable path to $10+ EPS in FY 27, as we model approximately 16% growth to <money>$10.31</money> vs. <money>$9.85</money> consensus.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>We lift our target price by <money>CAD1</money> to <money>CAD66</money>, about 25x our unchanged 2026 EPS of <money>CAD2.62</money> (2027 EPS initiated at <money>CAD2.85</money>). This is a premium to the five-year mean of 18x, which we think is warranted given the company's strong pipeline for store expansion. Q4 results were a bit underwhelming, particularly the 1.5% same-store sales growth, a notable deceleration from previous quarters. However, L did manage to alleviate some fears, noting a tough Y/Y comp (last year benefited from more promo activity) and an acceleration in growth through Q4 and into Q1. However, there is some weakness in certain categories like liquor and tobacco, which is weighing on overall growth. L guides for high-single-digit EPS growth, which we think could be a bit conservative given the somewhat consistent double-digit EPS growth over the past several years. L continues to open new stores (another year of about 70+), with a focus on discount banners as Canadians increasingly flock towards more value-oriented stores. We keep our Hold view.</p>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">MT Newswires does not provide investment advice. Unauthorized reproduction is strictly prohibited.</p>\n",

PNTR was first granted in 2000, allowing <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> to join the <org>World Trade Organization</org>, a move that catapulted the country into becoming the world's biggest manufacturer.</p>\n<p>Since his <chron>inauguration day</chron> order, Trump imposed new tariffs on Chinese imports that reached as high as 145% last year, but that had been reduced to around 20% through a series of trade negotiations before the <org>Supreme Court</org> last week ruled Trump's emergency tariffs illegal. </p>\n<p>Trump's punitive <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> duties sit on top of the normal &quot;Most Favored Nation&quot; duties of about 2.5% that prevailed before he launched a trade war on <location value=\"LC/cn\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >China</location> during his first term, imposing tariffs of about 25% on most Chinese imports.</p>\n<p>Revoking PNTR would raise the base MFN rates, adding to whatever punitive duties Trump imposes to replace the illegal emergency tariffs under other trade authorities. </p>\n<p>The USITC, which studies trade and competitiveness matters and rules on anti-dumping and anti-subsidy trade cases, said its report would focus on U.S. trade, production and prices in the industries that could be directly and most affected by increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to the higher non-MFN rates.</p>\n<p>The panel said it would also examine an alternative scenario where <org>Congress</org> revokes PNTR treatment with a five-year phase-in of a subset of tariffs on products important for national security.</p>\n<p>The USITC said the public was invited to file written comments on the implications of raising these tariffs on Chinese imports, through the close of business on <chron>April 13</chron>. Due to the accelerated timeline, the commission said it does not plan to hold a public hearing.</p>\n<p>(Reporting by <person>David Lawder</person>, <person>Daphne Psaledakis</person> and <person>Bhargav Acharya</person>; Editing by <person>David Ljunggren</person> and <person>Mark Porter</person>)</p>\n",

This strategic funding initiative supports Rapidus’ plan to steadily progress from its current R&amp;D phase to mass production of 2nm (10⁻⁹ meters) logic semiconductors by 2027.\n\n</p><p>\nThrough this initiative, DNP will advance the development and mass production of EUV lithography photomasks and support Rapidus as it establishes a mass production system for 2nm &amp; next-generation semiconductors.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Background</b>\n\n</p><p>\nIn recent years, the rise in energy consumption, in line with increased data generation, has become a challenge, driving demand for next-generation semiconductors capable of improving device performance and reducing power consumption.\n\n</p><p>\nNext-generation semiconductors manufactured using EUV lithography enable the formation of finer patterns on silicon wafers compared to currently available technologies. This in turn is boosting expectations for the realization of higher performance and lower power consumption semiconductors.\n\n</p><p>\nAgainst this backdrop, in 2024 DNP was selected as a subcontractor for Rapidus under the <org>Post-5G Information and Communications System Infrastructure Enhancement R&amp;D Project</org>, led by the <org>New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization</org> (NEDO). Under this project, DNP has been advancing the development of manufacturing processes for 2nm generation EUV lithography photomasks.\n\n</p><p>\nLooking ahead, toward Rapidus’ goal of achieving mass production of 2nm-generation logic semiconductors in 2027, DNP aims to realize high-yield and short-lead-time production of EUV lithography photomasks for the 2nm generation at an early stage. Our investment will further strengthen the partnership between our two companies that has been cultivated to date.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Going Forward</b>\n\n</p><p>\nDNP positions EUV lithography photomasks as a key growth driver of its semiconductor-related business. We will continue to make proactive investments while advancing technology development with a view toward even finer 1.4nm generation and beyond. Through these efforts, DNP will contribute to the growth of Japan’s semiconductor industry.\n\n</p><p>\n<b>More Details</b>\n\n</p><p>\n<b>About DNP</b>\n\n</p><p>\nDNP was established in 1876, and has become a leading global company that leverages print-based solutions to engineer fresh business opportunities while protecting the environment and creating a more vibrant world for all. We capitalize on core competencies in microfabrication and precision coating technology to provide products for the display, electronic devices, and optical film markets.\n\n</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&amp;sty=20260224169578r1&amp;sid=acqr8&amp;distro=nx&amp;lang=en\" style=\"width:0;height:0\" /><span class=\"bwct31415\" /></p><p id=\"mmgallerylink\"><span id=\"mmgallerylink-phrase\">View source version on businesswire.com: </span><span id=\"mmgallerylink-link\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260224169578/en/</span></p>\n<p>Source: <org value=\"DNPCF.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd.</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='DNPCF' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( DNPCF )</span></p>\n",
