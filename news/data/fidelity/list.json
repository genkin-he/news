            "description": "<p><location value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >WASHINGTON</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - The average rate on the popular U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell below 6% this week for the first time in 3-1/2 years, but the decline is likely temporary and on its own insufficient to significantly boost housing demand unless supply increases, said economists.</p>\n<p>The 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 5.98%, the lowest level since <chron>September 2022</chron>, down from 6.01% last week, mortgage finance company Freddie Mac said on Thursday. It averaged 6.76% during the same period a year ago.</p>\n<p>The housing market has become a hot-button political issue as President <person>Donald Trump</person>, under pressure to address cost-of-living concerns ahead of November midterm congressional elections, has floated a number of proposals to make homebuying more affordable.    </p>\n<p>The drop followed a decline in the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield after the <org>U.S. Supreme Court</org> on Friday struck down Trump's sweeping tariffs. In response, Trump imposed a 10% global tariff, before raising the rate to 15%. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage tracks the 10-year Treasury yield.</p>\n<p>&quot;As this week's decline stems from market volatility rather than fundamental economic data, more supportive economic data is needed to establish a consistent trend,&quot; said <person>Jiayi Xu</person>, an economist at Realtor.com, while others noted a lack of housing inventory would continue to be a challenge for buyers.</p>\n<p>Economists and policymakers say a dearth of properties for sale, especially starter homes, continues to weigh on the housing market. Many homeowners hold mortgages with rates below 5%, creating what has been called a rate-lock. The inventory of previously owned houses is also well below its pre-pandemic level. </p>\n<p>Still, some bankers and market-watchers said the 30-year mortgage rate falling below 6% was an important psychological threshold that could draw some sellers to list their homes, and give potential homebuyers more confidence to jump into the market at a time when seasonally the market typically heats up. Mortgage refinancing has risen as the 30-year rate has fallen.</p>\n<p>&quot;That headline alone could prompt many sidelined buyers to take another peek at the housing market,&quot; said <person>Kara Ng</person>, senior economist at Zillow. </p>\n<p><person>Matt Vernon</person>, head of consumer lending at Bank of America, said he would expect any movement in the market to happen gradually. </p>\n<p>&quot;In many cases, life events drive decisions more than rates alone, but lower rates could be the nudge some buyers and current homeowners have been waiting for,&quot; said Vernon, adding mortgage application volumes at Bank of America are up nearly 22% year over year. </p>\n<p>RATE-LOCK LIMITS HOME AVAILABILITY</p>\n<p>House prices increased 1.8% in the 12 months through December after climbing 2.1% in November, the <org>Federal Housing Finance Agency</org>, which oversees mortgage finance giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, said on Tuesday.    </p>\n<p>Trump last month ordered that agency to purchase <money>$200 billion</money> in mortgage bonds to help lower the cost of home loans.  </p>\n<p>Economists are skeptical that those mortgage purchases will significantly improve housing affordability.</p>\n<p>Minutes of the Federal Reserve's <chron>January 27-28</chron> policy meeting published last week, describing a briefing by a New York Fed official, noted that the administration's bond-buying plans had caused &quot;a notable decline in mortgage-backed securities yields.&quot; However, that is unlikely to materially boost mortgage refinancing &quot;because current mortgage rates are well above the weighted average rate of outstanding mortgages,&quot; the minutes noted. </p>\n<p> (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani, additional reporting by <person>Michael S.

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>After reviewing Q1 FY 26 earnings, we increase our 12-month target price by <money>CAD18</money> to <money>CAD151</money>, 14.8x our FY 27 (Oct.) EPS view of <money>CAD10.22</money>, above the peer average P/E of 13.1x, as superior credit quality and improving efficiency outweigh headwinds stemming from the asset cap on TD's two U.S. banking subsidiaries. We raise our FY 26 EPS estimate to <money>CAD9.37</money> from <money>CAD9.04</money> and increase FY 27's to <money>CAD10.22</money> from <money>CAD9.64</money>. While credit quality is weakening industry-wide, TD's recent results are encouraging. Gross impaired loans have risen only modestly in recent quarters.

Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:</p><p>After reviewing Q1 2026 earnings, we increase our 12-month target price by <money>USD15</money> to <money>USD110</money>, 14.8x our FY 27 (Oct.) EPS view of <money>CAD10.22</money>, above the peer average P/E of 13.1x, as superior credit quality and improving efficiency outweigh headwinds stemming from the asset cap on TD's two U.S. banking subsidiaries.

While credit quality is weakening industry-wide, TD's recent results are encouraging. Gross impaired loans have risen only modestly in recent quarters. TD still trails peers on efficiency but is making progress as its adjusted efficiency ratio improved 190 bps Y/Y to 57.1% in Q1 FY 26. Return on equity (ROE) also improved 100 bps to 14.2%.

            "description": "\n<p><location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanjse\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >SAN JOSE, California</location>, <chron>Feb 26</chron> (Reuters) - ASML Holding's next-generation chipmaking machine is ready for manufacturers to start bringing it into use for production at high volumes, a senior executive told Reuters, a big step for the chip industry.</p>\n<p>The Dutch company produces the world's only commercial extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) tools, which are a critical piece of equipment for chipmakers. This new tool will help chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  and <org value=\"INTC.NaE\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >Intel</org> <span fmr-attach-component='fmr.qnr.components.snapshot.Mini' fmr-param-symbol='INTC' fmr-param-security-type='Equity'>( INTC )</span> produce more powerful and efficient chips, by eliminating several costly and complex steps from the chip-manufacturing process, data from ASML shows.</p>\n<p>ASML plans to release this data, which represents a key milestone, at a technical conference in <location value=\"LU/us.ca.sanjse\" idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" >San Jose</location> on Thursday, the company's chief technology officer, <person>Marco Pieters</person>, told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>It has taken ASML years to develop the costly, next-generation tools as chipmakers have attempted to determine at what point it makes economic sense to begin to use them for mass production.</p>\n<p>But given that the current generation of EUV tools is approaching the technical limit of their ability to make complex AI chips, the next-generation machines - called High-NA EUV tools - are key for the AI industry to improve chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and help chipmakers deliver their AI chip roadmaps on time to meet surging demand.</p>\n<p>The new tools cost roughly <money>$400 million</money>, twice the cost of the original EUV machines.</p>\n<p>The High-NA EUV tools now experience limited downtime, have produced 500,000 dinner-plate-sized silicon wafers and can draw sufficiently precise patterns that make up the circuits on the chip, the ASML data shows, Pieters said. In combination, the three data points indicate the tools are ready for manufacturers.</p>\n<p>&quot;I think that it's at a critical point to look at the amount of learning cycles that have happened,&quot; he said, referring to the number of tests that have been conducted on the machines by customers.</p>\n<p>Despite their technical readiness, it will take two to three years for companies to conduct enough testing and development to integrate them into manufacturing.</p>\n<p>&quot;(Chipmakers) have all the knowledge to qualify these tools,&quot; Pieters said.</p>\n<p>Pieters also said the company has achieved roughly 80% uptime at the moment and plans to achieve 90% by the end of the year. The imaging data ASML plans to release is enough to convince customers to replace multiple steps with the older-generation tools with a single <org>High-NA</org> step, Pieters said. The 500,000 wafers the machines have processed have allowed the company to work out many of the kinks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Reporting by <person>Max A.
